The <i>Zero Hunger Challenge</i>was launched by the UN Secretary General in 2012. He set the international community the challenge to achieve an end to global hunger within a generation. There has been significant progress in recent years, but the stark reality remains that over 800 million people across the world still suffer from hunger.  Ireland is recognised internationally for our commitment to ending hunger.  We have made this a central tenet of our development policy, and of our foreign policy.  Since 2011, we have devoted a fifth of Irish Aid funding to actions that will end hunger. <br/><br/>We work on the challenge with governments in our partner countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, with civil society and with the UN. <br/><br/>We have focused in particular on the period from pregnancy to age two &ndash; the critical &lsquo;thousand day&rsquo; period for a baby.  Under-nutrition is linked to almost half of all deaths in children under five. We provide funding for essential interventions such as fortification of foods, iron and vitamin supplements, and promoting breastfeeding and nutritious diets.<br/><br/>We invest in boosting the productivity of poor smallholder farmers,<b></b>with a particular focus on women.  We help farmers to improve the quality of their soil, diversify their crops and to adapt to a changing climate and support links to markets.  <br/><br/>I was proud last week to sign the Zero Hunger Declaration to build political will and take action to deliver on our pledge to end hunger, and build a more just world for all.  </p></reply>

Ireland and our EU partners strongly encourage any such moves in Iran. My Department has also provided the Iranian Foreign Ministry with information on human rights protection and mechanisms in this country. At parliamentary level, I am sure that visits to Iran this year by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and most recently by the Ceann Comhairle will have helped to underline these messages.</p><p>  Ireland has repeatedly addressed the human rights situation in Iran in its bilateral contacts and in the relevant international fora. The issue was discussed during senior official level consultations between Ireland and Iran which took place in Tehran last July. At the most recent session of the UN Human Rights Council in September, Ireland expressed concerns about the persecution of religious minorities in Iran and our hope that the stated intention of Iran to improve human rights protection will include these minority groups. The upcoming Universal Periodic Review of the human rights record of Iran at the UN in Geneva will be an important opportunity for states to engage in dialogue with Iran on its human rights record and to make recommendations on how to improve it. In addition, later this year, Ireland will once again actively engage in discussions on the annual resolution on the human rights situation in Iran at the current 69th session of the UN General Assembly. </p><p>  While we welcome positive overtures by the Rouhani administration, we have yet to see significant improvement on the ground in human rights. It may be that the new leadership&rsquo;s focus on trying to resolve the nuclear issue, and avoid negative domestic backlash particularly from conservative quarters, is limiting their ability to act concurrently in this sphere. But human rights is very much an area where positive words must be followed up with actions and changes on the ground, and this is an area we will continue to monitor closely, along with our EU partners.</p><p>  I would hope also that if agreement can be reached on the nuclear issue, as seems possible, this may help to act as a confidence building measure for better relations in other areas as well.</p></reply>

While there I had a wide range of meetings covering UN issues as well as bilateral US-Ireland relations and Irish community matters. While our paths had crossed at the UN in New York, I met bilaterally with both Vice-President Biden and Secretary of State Kerry during my visit to Washington D.C. I also participated at the swearing-in ceremony for the incoming U.S. Ambassador to Ireland, Kevin O&rsquo;Malley, presided over by Vice-President Biden.<br/><br/>While several issues were touched upon, the main focus of the discussion that I had with Vice-President Biden and Secretary of State Kerry in Washington D.C. was on Northern Ireland. Given the developments on all party talks involving both governments in Dublin and London, I saw these meetings as an important and timely opportunity to engage with the U.S. Administration and with Irish-American supporters of the Northern Ireland peace process. I stressed that active U.S. support remains critical to sustaining peace and political stability in Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>I was happy to hear at first hand that the U.S. Administration is committed to active engagement over the period ahead. Throughout the Peace Process, the unwavering support of successive U.S. Administrations has been critically important, as it will be again in addressing the current challenges. <br/><br/>In my meeting with Vice-President Biden and Secretary of State Kerry, I also conveyed the best wishes of the Government and people of Ireland to Ambassador O&rsquo;Malley as he takes up his important position. The new Ambassador&rsquo;s arrival in Ireland is all the more significant as the 90th anniversary of the establishment of Ireland-U.S. diplomatic relations occurs today, October 7.<br/><br/>While in Washington, I also had the opportunity to meet with the White House Chief of Staff Denis <font color="#2F2F2F">McDonough.  In addition to Northern Ireland, I also raised with him the question of the undocumented Irish community in the U.S.  I urged that President Obama would include their situation in the administrative action he is committed to taking before the end of the year.</font></p></reply>

We welcome the determination of both sides to conduct negotiations in a structured and results-oriented manner.</p><p>  While Minister Flanagan has not yet had the opportunity to discuss the issue directly with his  Cypriot colleagues, officials have on-going dialogue with representatives of the Cypriot Government, including through our respective Embassies. </p><p>  This new phase of the discussions promises a qualitative change in the level of engagement. We very much welcome the appointment of Mr Espen Barth Eide in August as the new UN Special Adviser to the Secretary General (SASG) on Cyprus, and we wish him well in his role. Mr. Eide is assuming his functions at an encouraging moment in the process. </p><p>  We were pleased to see the positive statement issued by Mr Eide after his meeting on 17 September, when the leaders re-affirmed their commitment to lead negotiations through a win-win approach and reach a settlement. This generates fresh momentum into this new phase. The leaders recognised the enormous amount of work that had been conducted in previous phases of the negotiations and agreed to move to the next phase of structured negotiations as well as to increase the frequency of their meetings. </p><p>  Ireland fully supports the aim to find a solution that provides for a comprehensive settlement based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, as set out in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Ireland remains supportive of all efforts to assist in the search for a mutually acceptable settlement to this long-standing problem. </p><p>  We are pleased to have been able to maintain our presence in UNFICYP, the UN mission to promote peace and stability. Twelve members of An Garda S&iacute;ochan&aacute; are currently deployed to UNFICYP. </p></reply>

While there I had a wide range of meetings covering UN issues as well as bilateral and community matters. On U.S. immigration reform, which remains a key Government priority, I met with both Irish community groups and high level   government contacts.</p><p>  My programme included discussions with Vice President Joe Biden, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, Secretary of State John Kerry, and Congressman Joseph Kennedy. I had a meeting in New York with Irish-American community leaders, including from the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, Ancient Order of Hibernians and the New York branch of the GAA, with whom the Government has worked closely on our shared U.S. immigration reform agenda. I also had the opportunity to visit the Emerald Isle Immigration Center and Aisling Irish Center in New York and the Irish International Immigrant Center in Boston, which gave me the opportunity to meet some of those most affected by the current state of affairs.</p><p>  Following the bipartisan U.S. Senate bill last year, and despite extensive combined efforts at Government, Embassy and Irish-American community levels since then, the U.S. House of Representatives has not yet taken action that would deliver relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the U.S. or an improved facility for future legal migration between Ireland and the U.S. While it appeared before the summer to be the intention of President Obama and his Administration to examine the scope for action on immigration via executive authority, President Obama announced on September 6 that he would delay any such action until after the November U.S. elections. </p><p>  The exact extent, nature and timing of any action that the U.S. Administration will be ready to take remains to be confirmed and there is clearly no guarantee as to the outcome that can be achieved via executive action.  However, in my contacts in Washington, including in my conversation with the White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, I stressed the importance of addressing the needs and concerns of the undocumented Irish migrants in any such action. There are of course limits to what executive action is likely to be able to do and so further progress on the legislative track is also necessary. </p><p>  While there appears to be some willingness to consider further action in Congress at some future point, this is dependent on many factors and will not be easy to achieve. The Government will continue to work resolutely for progress over the coming months from which currently undocumented Irish migrants in the U.S. and their families can benefit.  </p></reply>

As I made clear in my address to the General Assembly, there can be no complacency within the international community about the threat which ISIS and other extremists represent or about the need for urgent international action to confront this threat to us all.</p><p>  Confronting this growth of extremism requires a wide range of actions including security responses to deny ISIS the freedom to attack civilians, action by the new Iraqi Government to promote inclusivity and ensure real Sunni representation within Iraq&rsquo;s political system and Government, as well as achieving a political resolution to the Syrian conflict. Humanitarian relief is also a critical component of the response to mass displacement of civilians fleeing the threat from ISIS and other terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq. </p><p>  UN Security Council Resolutions 2170 and 2178 adopted in recent weeks require all UN Member States to implement comprehensive measures to address the threat of terrorism including through such measures as taking active steps to prevent travel by persons suspected of planning or intending to participate in terrorist acts; cooperation in exchanging information on actions and movement by terrorists; prevention of recruitment and radicalisation of possible members of such groups, including through community outreach initiatives, and denying financial transfers to terrorist groups; and supporting the provision of bilateral assistance to States in developing national capacities to respond to foreign terrorist fighters. The Foreign Affairs Council meeting which I attended on 15 August has also welcomed the provision of military support by individual member States to the Iraqi and Kurdish regional authorities at their request to combat terrorism, consistent with the provisions of UN Security Council resolution 2170. </p><p>  Ireland will continue to pro-actively support all international efforts, including by the EU and UN, to promote a political resolution of the current conflict in both Syria and Iraq. We will also continue to address the humanitarian consequences of the conflict and provide urgent assistance and support to the civilian populations within Syria and Iraq who have been displaced or suffered violations of their rights at the hands of ISIS and other extremists.  </p><p>  In this regard, Ireland has already made a major contribution to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis, having committed over &euro;29 million in assistance for humanitarian relief in response to the crisis in Syria and the recent humanitarian challenges in northern Iraq. Most recently, in response to the current wave of refugees from Syria into Turkey, funding of &euro;210,000 has been allocated from the Start Fund, an NGO pooled fund mechanism which Ireland supports. </p></reply>

Since 2011 we have allocated over &euro;2.5 billion for ODA, providing &euro;657 million in 2011, &euro;629 million in 2012, and &euro;637 million in 2013.  For 2014 we are likely to spend in excess of &euro;600 million on ODA.  These are substantial allocations of public funds and are clear evidence of the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to the aid programme.</p><p>  The estimates process for Budget 2015 is now in its finals stages. As with allocations to all Government Departments, the 2015 allocation to ODA must be framed in the context of our policy commitments and the overall budgetary circumstances we face.  The final allocation is ultimately a decision for Government and will be announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on 14 October next.  However, as I have repeatedly stated publicly, and in response to previous Questions this week, I and the Minster for Foreign Affairs and Trade have made, and will continue to make, the strongest case possible for the allocation to the development assistance programme. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware our aid programme is implemented in challenging, complex and indeed, inherently risky environments. To mitigate against those risks, my Department has a comprehensive system of internal controls in place including a strong internal audit function which is overseen by an independent audit committee reporting directly to the Secretary General.  An Internal Audit unit operates at Headquarters and Key Partner Country level and monitors the internal control systems within the Department and across partner organisations.  All expenditure under the aid programme is subject to audit by the Department&rsquo;s Internal Audit Unit.   I can confirm that no cases have come to our attention to date in 2014 which would require the Department to carry out an investigation into the misuse of funds managed under the aid programme.</p></reply>

Ireland believes strongly that ridding the Middle East region of all weapons of mass destruction is an important and urgent task. For this reason, Ireland brokered a consensus agreement at the 2010 Review Conference on organising this Conference, which had the support of all the parties in the region.</p><p>  While the content of the resolution may be viewed as being in line with our position on the promotion of NPT universality and the application of IAEA safeguards, the tabling of the resolution at this time, when there remains some prospect of agreement being reached on scheduling the Conference which all parties in the region would attend, may not be conducive to facilitating participation in this Conference.</p><p>  For this reason, Ireland chose to vote with all other EU member States against the resolution. In light of the relevance of the resolution to the NPT, Ireland regularly reviews its vote and will continue to do so, taking into account the prospect of the Conference being convened, since our primary goal must be to help achieve a Middle East Zone free of all weapons of mass destruction. I discussed the prospects for convening the Conference with the Foreign Minister of Egypt, which is one of Ireland&rsquo;s five partners in the New Agenda Coalition for nuclear disarmament, at a meeting in the margins of the United Nations General Assembly last month. </p><p>  I further wish to note that Ireland, in conjunction with all EU Member States, supported a resolution on the &ldquo;Application of IAEA Safeguards in the Middle East&rdquo;, and that this resolution was adopted by the General Conference.  </p></reply>

This material will then be collated for future consideration by the ETC. <br/><br/>In the meantime, I would like to bring to the Deputy&rsquo;s attention, a number of examples of progress achieved on some of the reconfigured Actions Points:<br/><br/><b>Maximise Ireland&rsquo;s access to international markets </b><br/><br/>Taking account of the new market approach set out in the Review, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade this year opened new Embassies and Consulates General in key locations across South East Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas which will provide a platform for further promotion of Irish exports, investment, tourism and education.  <br/><br/><b>Maximise impact of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period worldwide</b><br/><br/>As part of the &lsquo;Reputation&rsquo; theme of the revised Action Plan model, the 2014 St. Patrick&rsquo;s period saw 30 trade-focussed visits led by the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Ministers. As part of these visits, and over the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day season, Embassies and Consulates helped to deliver an average of 17 promotional events and engagements each, across 133 cities in 68 countries. The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, Ministers and the Embassy network promoted key messages on trade, tourism and investment in op-eds and interviews in the international media &ndash; reaching, at a very conservative estimate, over 23.5 million people. When overseas media coverage of events that were part of the high level visits or supported by the Embassy network are added, wider audiences of at least 80 million people were reached.<br/><br/><b>Maximise the impact of integrated trade missions </b><br/><br/>In implementing the &lsquo;Winning Business and Jobs&rsquo; theme, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to work closely with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Bord Bia and other State agencies to promote Ireland, Irish companies and Irish products overseas. This is particularly the case in relation to the preparation for and implementation of Enterprise Ireland Ministerial-led trade missions, of which 18 will have taken place during 2014. The focus of such trade missions will continue to take account of the identification of seven Exploratory and High Potential Markets under the Review and the expansion of the Embassy network. [If appropriate: I will be leading one of these missions myself to Mexico and Austin in November]<br/><br/>The current Strategy runs to the end of 2015 and, of course, the focus of Departments, the Embassy network and the State Agencies will be on its continued implementation over that period. My Department, in consultation with the Embassy network and other Government Departments, State agencies and private sector members of the ETC, would propose to conduct a scoping exercise in the second half of next year to examine options for future approaches in the trade, tourism, investment and education areas. </p></reply>

This has resulted in the development of a strong international framework on debt cancellation for developing countries with debt sustainability problems.  We can be proud that Ireland has contributed our full financial share to both the main elements of this debt relief framework, the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).</p><p>  In total, since 1996, Ireland has provided over &euro;116 million for international debt cancellation initiatives.  We have done so despite the fact that Ireland, unlike most international aid donors, has not been a bilateral creditor.  Our development aid has always been untied and provided on grant terms, not as loans.</p><p>  We have worked with our partners on the ground, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, to help ensure that the additional money from debt relief has been spent on programmes that benefit the poor, especially through the support of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and support for anti-corruption efforts.  Through Irish Aid, we are also contributing &euro;100,000 annually to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) for its technical assistance programme to help developing countries manage their debt sustainably.</p><p>  Ireland is playing a prominent role at the UN on the negotiation of a new framework for international development to succeed the Millennium Development Goals, post-2015.  When my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade met with the UN Secretary General in New York last week, they discussed our joint ambition for this new global development framework.  Under the post-2015 process, the Third International Conference on Financing for Development will be held Addis Ababa in July 2015 and will consider debt and debt sustainability as well as other financing options for developing countries.  Ireland will play our full role in working for the success of this crucially important meeting.</p></reply>

It is crucial now that all sides respect their commitments and work to consolidate and to build upon this ceasefire to secure a sustainable peace. In this regard, I am encouraged by the constructive negotiations of the OSCE trilateral contact group in recent days, including the marking out of a proposed 30km buffer zone in eastern Ukraine from which government forces and separatists will remove heavy weapons. I hope to see further progress on a sustainable political solution, based on the principle of respect for Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and with clear guarantees on border security, disarmament of all illegal groups and the withdrawal of foreign forces.</p><p>   On the key issue of energy supplies, there have been gas talks between Russia and Ukraine. At a meeting in Berlin on 25 September, both sides agreed to consider a compromise proposal put forward by the European Commission aimed at breaking the deadlock to ensure gas supply to Ukraine for the winter. The proposal would see Ukraine settle its debts in two payments, the first of $2 billion in October and the second of $1.1 billion by the end of the year. In return, Gazprom and Naftogaz would deliver 5 billion cubic meters, the minimum sufficient volume of gas which Ukraine considers is required for the winter months, with the possibility of ordering more gas if needed. </p><p>  If agreed, this proposal should be binding on both parties. An interim agreement like this is necessary as the dispute has been referred by both Russia and Ukraine to the international arbitration court in Stockholm, with a final decision only expected next year.  I am hopeful that the interim agreement will be finalised in the coming days in order to ensure a more certain outlook for the winter months.</p></reply>

Ireland co-sponsored the Resolution along with 103 other States, including all other EU member states.</p><p>  This Resolution takes a comprehensive, human rights compliant approach to tackling the foreign fighters problem in accordance with international law.  It highlights the need to tackle the underlying causes of radicalisation through community outreach initiatives, while at the same time focusing on strengthening legal and security measures.</p><p>  This comprehensive strategy is very much in line with Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the issue.</p><p>  The terms of the Resolution are consistent with conclusions of a special meeting of the European Council on 30 August 2014 which called for accelerated implementation of a package of measures agreed in June 2013 concerning four priority areas: prevention of radicalisation, detection of suspicious travel, investigation and prosecution and cooperation with third countries.  The European Council will review this issue in December 2014. </p><p>  On the issue of travel, the Resolution provides that all States shall take steps to prevent the movement of terrorists or terrorist groups.  These steps include the introduction of controls on the issuance of travel documents and measures to prevent counterfeiting, forgery or fraudulent use of such documents.  </p><p>  The Passports Act 2008 sets out a range of provisions related to this area.  The Act provides a statutory basis for refusal to issue and for cancellation of a passport in defined circumstances including where a person would be likely to engage in conduct that might prejudice national security or the security of another state; where such conduct might endanger public safety or where it might endanger the person or others.  Section 20 of the Act also introduced a range of offences concerning the provision of false or misleading information in connection with a passport application, possession or use of a false passport and the making or attempted making of a false passport.</p><p>  My Department, in consultation with other relevant Government Departments, will closely examine the Resolution to establish whether any further legislation may be required in order to ensure its full implementation in Ireland.  </p><p>  Resolution 2178 is fully in line with the policy of military neutrality that has been pursued by successive Irish Governments.  It does not involve participation in any military alliance; it provides for the protection of human rights; and it is designed to promote and maintain international peace and security through the United Nations.  </p></reply>

Ireland co-sponsored the Resolution along with 103 other States, including all other EU member states.</p><p>  This Resolution takes a comprehensive, human rights compliant approach to tackling the foreign fighters problem in accordance with international law.  It highlights the need to tackle the underlying causes of radicalisation through community outreach initiatives, while at the same time focusing on strengthening legal and security measures.</p><p>  This comprehensive strategy is very much in line with Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the issue.</p><p>  The terms of the Resolution are consistent with conclusions of a special meeting of the European Council on 30 August 2014 which called for accelerated implementation of a package of measures agreed in June 2013 concerning four priority areas: prevention of radicalisation, detection of suspicious travel, investigation and prosecution and cooperation with third countries.  The European Council will review this issue in December 2014. </p><p>  On the issue of travel, the Resolution provides that all States shall take steps to prevent the movement of terrorists or terrorist groups.  These steps include the introduction of controls on the issuance of travel documents and measures to prevent counterfeiting, forgery or fraudulent use of such documents.  </p><p>  The Passports Act 2008 sets out a range of provisions related to this area.  The Act provides a statutory basis for refusal to issue and for cancellation of a passport in defined circumstances including where a person would be likely to engage in conduct that might prejudice national security or the security of another state; where such conduct might endanger public safety or where it might endanger the person or others.  Section 20 of the Act also introduced a range of offences concerning the provision of false or misleading information in connection with a passport application, possession or use of a false passport and the making or attempted making of a false passport.</p><p>  My Department, in consultation with other relevant Government Departments, will closely examine the Resolution to establish whether any further legislation may be required in order to ensure its full implementation in Ireland.  </p><p>  Resolution 2178 is fully in line with the policy of military neutrality that has been pursued by successive Irish Governments.  It does not involve participation in any military alliance; it provides for the protection of human rights; and it is designed to promote and maintain international peace and security through the United Nations.  </p></reply>

Sanctions can also have different aims, and the measures which might be effective in one situation may be unsuited to another.<br/><br/>In short, the possible application of sanctions depends on what the EU, or UN, as a whole can agree is the best action to take. If partners do not agree on sanctions as a response, they do not happen. <br/><br/>In the case of the recent tragic conflict in Gaza, we could not dispute the right of Israel to make some sort of military response to attacks on its territory, but we did clearly and loudly condemn as unacceptable and disproportionate the nature of the response that was made, and the dreadful toll of civilian casualties that it caused.<br/><br/>In the case of Ukraine, the EU is faced with an attempt to undermine or threaten the very sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of a major European state, a direct neighbour of several EU members. <br/><br/>This has involved first the illegal seizure of the Crimea, then the destabilisation of another large area, and attacks on Ukrainian forces and officials.A civil aircraft was downed, killing hundreds of EU citizens and many others, including one from Ireland.<br/><br/>It should also be borne in mind that the EU is attempting in this case to prevent a deterioration into a major war in a neighbouring state.<br/><br/>Finally, it is necessary to point out that, dreadful and unacceptable as the events in Gaza have been, it is misleading and counterproductive to describe them as &lsquo;genocide&rsquo;, a word which has a specific legal meaning which does not apply in this case. </p></reply>

The Council stressed its major concerns regarding the human rights and humanitarian situations within Iraq, and outlined EU assistance being made available. The Council welcomed the establishment of a new Government in Iraq which it hopes will take a more inclusive approach and promote the active engagement by all Iraqis, whatever their ethnic or religious background, in the governance of their country.</p><p>  On the security situation, the Council welcomed the provision of military support by individual member States to the Iraqi and Kurdish regional authorities, at their request, to combat terrorism, consistent with the provisions of UN Security Council resolution 2170.</p><p>  In relation to resettlement of Iraqi families, it should be recalled that until June of this year, Iraq was itself a location in which refugees fleeing from ISIS in Syria were being accommodated. </p><p>  The refugee crisis in and around Syria and Iraq is of enormous proportions, amounting to over 3 million from Syria alone. Resettlement in Europe cannot therefore be the answer to this crisis, as it could only assist a tiny fraction of those in need, while requiring a disproportionate share of the resources available. In addition, it is the normal principle that refugees should as far as possible be accommodated close to their homes, to facilitate eventual return. We do not want to unwittingly complete the work of ISIS by finally removing minority communities which have survived in the region for thousands of years.</p><p>  Nonetheless, the Government has recognised that in some cases resettlement in Europe may have a role to play. Ireland has for many years operated a programme in cooperation with the UN High Commission for Refugees of accepting every year a certain number of cases brought to us by the UNHCR for resettlement here. In recent years, many of those places have been used for refugees from Syria and Iraq and earlier this year it was decided by the Minister for Justice and Equality that all of the available places this year should be allocated for Syrian refugees. More recently, the Minister for Justice and Equality and I have discussed this problem, and agreed that the Minister for Justice and Equality will look at whether we can make an additional number of places available for refugees fleeing the crisis in northern Iraq where minority communities in particular, such as Yazidis and Christians, have been subject to horrendous attacks by ISIS and other extremists. </p><p>  These resettlement programmes are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality, to whom questions as to the precise numbers and origins of persons resettled here should be addressed.</p></reply>

Our conversation largely focused on the prospects for 12 July parades, which were taking place the following day, but also touched upon the need to resume political dialogue on the legacy issues which formed part of the earlier Haass talks. I also had conversations that evening with the deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, and the Leader of the SDLP, Dr. Alasdair McDonnell. I also spoke the following week by phone to First Minister, Peter <font color="#2F2F2F">Robinson</font><b><i><font color="#2F2F2F">,</font></i></b><font color="#2F2F2F"> and </font>other party leaders.<br/><br/>I visited Belfast on 30 July last for a comprehensive programme which included meetings with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the First Minister and deputy First Minister, other Northern Ireland party leaders, and a range of civil society and community representatives. The visit was an important opportunity to reiterate the Government&rsquo;s support for effective partnership government in Northern Ireland and our steadfast commitment to the full implementation of the Good Friday and St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreements.<br/><br/>I have continued to stay in close contact with the Secretary of State, with whom I have had several telephone conversations with over recent weeks, and with Party leaders. I met most recently with the First Minister and with the deputy First Minister en marge of the North South Ministerial Council Plenary meeting held in Dublin on 3 October. I will be meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland later today.<br/><br/>The Good Friday Agreement, as well as the values and principles underpinning it, is at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.Implementing outstanding elements of the Good Friday Agreement, as well as the St Andrews Agreement, is a priority for the Government. Among the elements yet to be implemented are the establishment of a North South Consultative Forum, a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland and an Irish Language Act. The Government&rsquo;s priority remains to ensure that the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement function effectively to the benefit of all. I continue to urge all the parties to progress fuller implementation of the Agreements.<br/><br/>In the St Andrews Agreement, the British government committed to introducing an Irish Language Act and to working with the Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish Language.  Since the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland is a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive and in particular of the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms. Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA.  The Government continues to follow developments closely in relation to the proposed Act, as well as the overall enhancement and protection of the Irish Language in Northern Ireland. <br/><br/>The Good Friday Agreement also provided for the establishment of an independent Civic Forum representative of civil society in Northern Ireland. The St Andrews Agreement provided further that the Northern Ireland Executive would support the establishment of an independent North/South Consultative Forum.  In September 2008, the Irish Government submitted proposals for the role, format, membership and operation of a North South Consultative Forum to the Executive for its consideration, and facilitated three consultative conferences, the most recent of which was in January 2011.  The Government awaits a response from the Executive.  We have since raised the Forum at each Plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council and it was on the agenda for the plenary meeting of 3 October 2014.<br/><br/>A Bill of Rights drawn up by agreement between the main parties of the Assembly could set out precisely and formally the rights underpinning a reconciled society in Northern Ireland. Officials of my Department keep in ongoing contact with representatives of civil society on the issue of a Bill of Rights. <br/><br/>I will continue to press the importance of implementing outstanding elements of the Agreements in my discussions with the British Government and Northern Ireland Executive.  Officials in my Department will continue to monitor these matters in their ongoing contacts with the Northern Ireland Office and officials of the Northern Ireland Executive. </p></reply>

The Government took the view that the referendum question was one for the people of Scotland to decide and that public speculation or comment in advance of the vote would be neither appropriate nor helpful. Notwithstanding this approach, the Government and our diplomatic missions in London and Edinburgh followed the referendum campaign very closely.</p><p>  Now that the referendum has taken place and the result is known, the Government will be in close contact with London, Edinburgh and other devolved administrations as discussions proceed on enhanced devolution for Scotland and on the political changes across the UK outlined by Prime Minister Cameron on 18 September.</p><p>  While a timetable and some broad principles have been outlined, the precise details of the changes are still to be clarified. I will discuss these matters in my ongoing contact with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and with the British Foreign Secretary who I expect to meet in the period ahead.   I also look forward to visiting Scotland in the near future and to discussing these issues with the Scottish Government.  </p><p>  The further devolution of powers to Scotland and the political changes outlined by Prime Minster Cameron do of course have political and policy implications for Ireland, North and South. It will take time to tease out these political and policy implications with all stakeholders, on these islands and within the European Union.</p><p>  In this context, I would recall that the Good Friday Agreement sets as a key objective the promotion of the harmonious and mutually beneficial development of the totality of relationships among the peoples of these islands. The Agreement also makes a commitment to partnership, equality and mutual respect as the basis of relationships within Northern Ireland, between North and South and between these islands.</p></reply>

These include longstanding issues such as parades, flags and dealing with the past.  It also includes more recent difficulties in relation to budgetary issues.    The Executive parties need to reach agreement on such issues to ensure the effective functioning of the Northern Ireland Executive into the future.</p><p>  I am confident that the North&rsquo;s political representatives will show the leadership needed to deliver comprehensive, fair and balanced solutions to the issues before them. This will require compromise and committed engagement to the talks process. The goal is to ensure that the North&rsquo;s political institutions not only function, but flourish, to the benefit of all, as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement. I am of the view that all party talks involving the Governments are required at this time to overcome the current political impasse within the Northern Ireland Executive.

Few can doubt that there is considerable scope for improving the functioning of that body. Ireland is a member of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency (ACT) grouping which was launched in May 2013 in New York. ACT is a cross-regional group of 21 states which is actively promoting new approaches to the work of the Security Council. In particular,  we welcome the initiative put forward by France and supported by Mexico to better regulate the use of the veto power by Permanent Members of the Security Council. While we consider this power an anachronism and something which should eventually be abolished, the French proposal is a necessary step in the right direction and deserving of support.</p><p> It is also clear that the question of increasing the membership of the Security Council needs to be addressed and a number of ideas have been proposed for that purpose. While Ireland is not a proponent of any particular configuration of the Council, other than refusing to countenance the possibility that any new Permanent Members would exercise a veto, we are strongly of the view that the Council must more closely reflect regional balances as well as the current realities of population and economic weight in the world.</p></reply>

I have explained elsewhere that Irish foreign policy is based above all on the resolution of conflicts by dialogue, and that we do not therefore respond to difficult or even unacceptable situations by expelling the interlocutor, except in very exceptional circumstances.</p><p>  As the Deputy has recognised in his Question, Ireland would have serious human rights concerns about very many states around the world. Across the broader Middle East region, there are very few states that could be regarded as fully democratic in our terms.

In addition, the Government has announced it will bring forward proposals for a referendum on removal from the Constitution of the offence of blasphemy but no date has been decided as yet.<br/><br/>In addition, the Government decided to refer to the relevant Oireachtas Committee the question of a constitutional amendment to give citizens a say in the nomination process for Presidential candidates. The Government has also undertaken to look at making Article 41.2 of the Constitution on the role of women gender-neutral, and at including other carers both in and beyond the home. It has also undertaken to look at amending the Constitution to include the principle of gender equality, as well as the use of gender-inclusive language in the Constitution.  Arising from the Fourth Report, the Government has agreed that work should commence on the establishment of an Electoral Commission. This was a central recommendation of that report. <br/><br/>Work is ongoing in relation to the remainder of the reports, which as the House will be aware, deal with such matters as giving citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in Presidential elections; D&aacute;il reform; economic, social and cultural rights and the Convention&rsquo;s conclusions and final recommendations.The Government expects to respond to all of them before the end of the current D&aacute;il session. </p></reply>

This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments, and in particular those who have been receiving such payments for extended periods.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people. </p><p>  Persons who are unemployed but not in receipt of a social welfare payment are not, however, disqualified from receiving training and employment supports. A range of services are in fact available to such people. </p><p>  For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.   </p><p>  Further, unemployed persons not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB (formerly F&Aacute;S) training for unemployed people, although they are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course (they may receive some financial support for travel and meals).  </p><p>  The Work Placement Programme operated by my Department is also open to persons not in receipt of a social welfare payment, although the participant will not receive a payment while on the programme.</p><p>  An unemployed person who does not qualify for a social welfare payment due to the assessment of their means may be eligible to sign for social insurance contribution credits.  Persons who sign for credits for three months (78 days) of the last six months are eligible to participate in the JobBridge programme.</p><p>  The number of young people who do not qualify for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance because of parental means is relatively low. In the most recent twelve-month period for which data are available, some 52,808 awards of JA were made to young people under the age of 25. Over the same period, 1,579 JA claims from young people were disallowed on the grounds that the applicant&rsquo;s means (from all sources) were deemed to be in excess of the prescribed limits. Disallowances on grounds of means thus represented a maximum of 3% of the claims actually awarded to young people. This would include cases where the means involved were those of the applicant or the applicant&rsquo;s spouse, not just parental means cases. </p></reply>

In August 2014 the person concerned applied for an increase in rent supplement as the rent on her accommodation had increased to &euro;975 per month. However, when her case was being reviewed it came to light that her income had also increased as she is receiving maintenance payments of &euro;20 per week. Consequently, when assessing her new entitlement to rent supplement, the increase in her assessable income was taken into account, and this means the amount payable to her increased from &euro;745.00 per month to &euro;749.70 per month. This calculation is correct and was done in accordance with social welfare legislation; it is not therefore possible to further increase the amount payable as the Deputy has requested.</p><p>  However if there are exceptional circumstances in this case, the person concerned may wish to contact Threshold to explore the possibility of obtaining suitable accommodation under the Interim Tenancy Sustainment Protocol (ITSP), the initiative between this Department, the 4 Dublin Local Authorities, and Threshold Ltd to tackle homelessness in the Dublin area. If the person concerned has any supporting evidence in this regard she should furnish this to her Local Office as soon as possible.

The programme is funded by the Department with day-to-day management of contracts undertaken by Pobal.  Contract holders must deliver tangible services that are capable of generating non-public revenues from their operations by way of charging fees, sales and/or fundraising and other public funds. Funding is provided on the basis of a contribution to the cost of a full-time position to support the delivery of the service and includes management and non-management positions.  A business plan has been submitted by the organisation concerned and is currently being appraised by Pobal as to its fit and eligibility for funding under the CSP programme.  The appraisal and decision making process is ongoing and a recommendation is expected within the next month. The organisation will be informed of the outcome of this process when completed.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 73,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.</p><p>  Maximum rent limits are generally reviewed every 18 months. The most recent review was completed in June 2013 with revised rent limits introduced on 17 June 2013. Despite pressures on the social protection budget, the last review saw rent limits increase in line with market rents in some areas, including Dublin and Galway, with Dublin limits increasing by a weighted average of 9%.</p><p>  A review of the maximum rent limits is being undertaken within the Department. This review involves a comprehensive analysis of information from a range of sources including rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), the Central Statistics Office rental indices, websites advertising rental properties, relevant Departments and Agencies, landlord representative groups and non-Government organisations such as Threshold, Focus Ireland and the Society of St Vincent de Paul. Any changes to social welfare supports can only be considered in a budgetary context.</p><p>  The current difficulties in the rental market and the difficulties faced by prospective tenants, including those seeking access to rent supplement, is a shortage of supply of suitable properties in areas of high demand. The Government has recently launched its Construction Strategy with the aim of increasing housing supply generally.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputies that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met. Discretionary powers are available to staff to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant. A notice reminding staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated in July 2014.</p><p>  In view of the current supply difficulties, the Department has agreed a protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf. Since the launch of this initiative in mid-June 2014, over 130 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department.</p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to transfer responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need to local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Officials are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in introducing HAP on a phased basis, in the selected local authorities.</p></reply>

Whereas the Department of Education and Skills has the lead role in supporting students, this Department focuses resources on supporting jobseekers to the return to work by upskilling.  The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) provides an approved jobseeker with the cash equivalent of their prior rate of social welfare payment while they are participating in full-time education.  Jobseekers under 26 year olds on an age-related jobseeker&rsquo;s payment receive an increased weekly rate of &euro;160 subject to means.  Given the nature of BTEA, the Department has no plans to extend payments beyond income support or to compensate for other individual costs arising from pursuing full-time education.<br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  The Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme can provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need</font>subject to certain terms and conditions. A person in full-time education is not usually considered eligible for SWA, save where exceptional circumstances arise in the form of a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.<br/><br/>A recent measure introduced along with Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is the joint After-School Child Care initiative launched between both of the Departments. It is targeted to support those who engage in activation processes and who enter into training or employment.  The scheme builds on the existing supports provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in the child care sector through which child care is provided to some 40,000 children of low-income parents at reduced rates. These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) schemes.<br/><br/>People seeking assistance or wishing to establish eligibility for this range of supports should contact their local DSP Intreo Centre or local office. Further information is available on the Department&rsquo;s website (www.welfare.ie).</p></reply>

In 2013, the Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;190 million for the increasing number of pensioners. The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance provided significant annual savings and meant that the Department was able to retain other elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence. These are valuable supports for recipients.

A Relationship Framework has been specified that defines the nature of the relation ship between the Minister for Finance and each bank. These Frameworks were published on 30 March 2012 and can be found at: .<br/><br/>Notwithstanding this, officials in my Department have referred the issue to Bank of Ireland and have received the following comment in this regard:<br/><br/>&quot;The US Government has a restrictive trade embargo against Cuba. The US legislative and regulatory measures include an embargo on making or receiving payments from Cuba and/or facilitating the making or receiving of payments from Cuba.<br/><br/>Bank of Ireland depends on correspondent banks for the processing of our national, European and international transactions, including our SEPA (Single European Payment Area) transactions. We are reliant on our correspondent banks because they process and facilitate all such transactions on our behalf. The current issue has arisen as a result of the transition to SEPA. As it happens, our principal correspondent bank for SEPA transactions is a leading US bank who must comply with its own regulatory requirements and obligations to avoid a possible exposure to regulatory sanctions and penalties.<br/><br/>As a result, we are not in a position to process such transactions. This affects all international payments to or from Cuba and also any related SEPA payments.&quot;<br/><br/>I have also been asked previously if I, as Minister for Finance, would challenge relevant U.S. policy. My response, which has not changed, is to highlight that US policy in this regard is not restricted to Ireland and extends worldwide and accordingly I do not intend to challenge this policy as I would not expect a positive outcome to such an action.</p></reply>

Revenue has made great progress in tackling the problem of diesel laundering over the past three years, and reports now indicate the emergence of another form of fuel fraud, commonly referred to as petrol stretching. This involves the illegal addition of a low tax commodity to petrol to defraud the exchequer and the motorist.</p><p>  Petrol stretching is an offence under section 102 (IA) of the Finance Act 1999. It carries a penalty on summary conviction of a fine of &euro;5,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both a fine and imprisonment. Where conviction occurs on indictment, a fine of up to &euro;126,970, or a term of imprisonment of up to 5 years, or both a fine and imprisonment, may be imposed.</p><p>  I am advised by Revenue that they are investigating the recent reports concerning petrol stretching and that they have been in contact with the motor and oil trades. I understand also that they have taken samples from a number of filling stations  that it has been claimed may have been sources of adulterated fuel, and that they will undertake any further enquiries that are required as a result of reports or information that they receive. These enquiries will seek to establish if there is evidence that petrol stretching has occurred, and whether there is evidence to support a prosecution.</p><p>  Revenue and the oil sector have cooperated very successfully to tackle diesel laundering and I am confident that, with this cooperation and with the supply chain information available to Revenue, the problem of petrol stretching can also be tackled successfully. It is essential that petrol distributors report any reduction in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade which may indicate that specific retailers are shifting some of their sourcing to laundered or &quot;stretched&quot; fuel.</p><p>  Motorists themselves should take care about where they source their petrol from, and report to Revenue any suspicions concerning the source of adulterated petrol that may have damaged their engines. Revenue will investigate such reports and pursue prosecutions where possible. In that regard, Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website specifically on the black economy and this includes an electronic reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices such as petrol stretching.</p></reply>

The measure was designed to boost tourism and create additional jobs in that sector. The 9% rate applies to the supply of food and drink (excluding alcohol, soft drinks and bottled water) in the course of catering.  I also provided for the abolition of the Air Travel Tax in Budget 2014 to further assist the tourism sector.</p><p>  In relation to cross-border shopping, the most recent cross-border price survey carried out by the Revenue Commissioners in July 2014 can be found online on the Revenue website. The survey compares prices in the off-trade rather than the on-trade, and does not support the contention of the correspondence in question that a price difference of 35% in respect of beer, wine and spirits exists between prices in Northern Ireland and the State.</p></reply>

I have however, introduced an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative. The additional levy, within the existing legal framework, applies to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015.</p><p>  There are two exceptions to the requirement to pay the levy provided for in the governing legislation (section 125B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999).</p><p>  The first exception provides that the levy will not apply to the assets of occupational pension schemes in respect of employees whose employment is, or was, wholly exercised outside the State. In other words, the levy does not apply to the extent that a pension scheme is intended to provide retirement benefits to scheme members employed outside the State.</p><p>  The second exception provides that the levy will not apply where the trustees of a scheme have passed a resolution to wind-up the scheme and where the business in respect of which the scheme was established is insolvent in accordance with the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984.</p><p>  The fact that there are very limited situations where the levy does not have to be paid explains, in part at least, why it was possible to introduce it at a relatively low rate of 0.6% in the first place and to have a rate of additional levy as low as 0.15% for the years 2014 and 2015. Making an exception for pension funds with a value of less than &euro;300,000 will inevitably give rise to demands for exceptions to be granted in other situations that would be viewed by those seeking them as being equally deserving.  The inevitable result of this course of action would be a narrowing of the levy base which would result in a greater imposition on the non-exempt schemes and I am not prepared to go down that road.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that receipts to date in 2014 from the Stamp Duty levy on pension fund assets, introduced in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2011, amount to &euro;697 million. The Deputy may wish to note that this includes an estimate of payments that have not yet been fully processed as a result of increased payment processing times due to the impact of SEPA in 2014. A finalised figure should be available later in the month.</p><p>  The yield from the pension fund levy at the reduced rate of 0.15% in 2015 is estimated at &euro;135 million.</p><p>  Preparations for Budget 2015 and the consequent Finance Bill are ongoing. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on what changes, if any, are being considered in the pension fund levy or any other tax measure.</p></reply>

These thresholds can be adjusted upwards by taking into account 80% of any gross mortgage interest payments. A couple whose only income source is a Department of Social Protection (DSP) payment, and who are occupying their property as their sole or main residence, would qualify for deferral. Unfortunately, as the Deputy has stated that the couple are not living in their property, they would not qualify for the normal income based deferral.  The various phased payment options are available to them.<br/><br/>In  the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 I included a provision in section 13(d) of the Act that allows a deferral of the Local Property Tax (LPT) charge that is not restricted to owner-occupiers.  This deferral option applies where a property owner suffers an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense as a result of which they are unable to pay their LPT, or maintain phased payment arrangements, without causing excessive financial hardship.  Full information on applying for this deferral option, and of the conditions involved, is available from the Revenue Commissioners' website at .</p></reply>

This scheme was introduced in Finance Act 2001 as an incentive to encourage individuals to let rooms in their principal private residence in order to bring about an increase in the availability of rental accommodation, particularly for the student sector.</p><p>  The scheme provides an exemption from Income Tax, PRSI and USC on rent received where a person rents out a room or rooms in his or her principal private residence and the rent received does not exceed &euro;10,000 per year. This was increased from &euro;7,620 in Budget 2008. </p><p>  In order to qualify for the exemption, it is necessary for the residential premises to be situated in the State and occupied by the individual as his or her sole or main residence during the tax year.</p><p>  The relief only applies to individuals. It does not apply to companies or partnerships. In addition, an individual cannot avail of the relief in respect of payments for accommodation in the family home by a child of the individual. There is no restriction where rent is paid by other family members, for example, nieces or nephews.</p><p>  The latest figures available relate to the tax year 2012 when the cost of the relief was estimated at &euro;6 million and was availed of by 4,070 claimants.

While it concluded that there was a strong case for broadening the tax base to include an annual wealth tax, it also noted that there was no consensus in academic literature about the value of wealth taxes.</p><p>  The paper suggested that a yield of 0.1% of GDP which would be in the region of &euro;160 million was attainable from an annual wealth tax where the net wealth threshold of liability is set at &euro;1 million and the tax rate is set at 0.6%.  However, as I have stated in reply to a number of Parliamentary Questions in the past, in order to estimate the potential revenue from a tax on wealth, one would need to identify the wealth held by individuals, which is not possible from the data available at present. </p><p>  It should also be noted that wealth can be taxed in a variety of ways, some of which already exist in Ireland.  Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) are, in effect, taxes on wealth, in that they are levied on an individual or company on the disposal of an asset (CGT) or the acquisition of an asset through gift or inheritance (CAT). However, they are not annual taxes on an individual's wealth.  Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) is charged at 41%, with limited exemptions, on interest earned on deposit accounts.  Local Property Tax (LPT) introduced in 2013 is a tax based on the market value of residential properties.  The Domicile Levy introduced in Budget 2010 also constitutes a form of wealth tax.  The combined yield of these taxes considerably exceeds, on an annual basis, that of the measures considered in the Report.</p></reply>

These samples are sent to the State Laboratory for scientific analysis. If the results of the analysis reveals the presence of any illegal stretching agents, I can assure the Deputy that the Revenue Commissioners will take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.</p><p>  Revenue and the oil sector have cooperated very successfully to tackle diesel laundering and I am confident that with this cooperation, and with the supply chain information available to Revenue, the problem of petrol stretching can also be tackled successfully. In this regard it is essential that petrol distributors report on any reduction in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade which may indicate that specific retailers are shifting some of their sourcing to laundered or 'stretched' fuel.  </p><p>  Motorists themselves should take care about where they source their petrol from, and report any suspicions concerning the source of adulterated petrol that may have damaged their engines to Revenue. Revenue will investigate such reports and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible. In that regard, Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website specifically on the shadow economy and this includes an electronic reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices such as petrol stretching.</p><p>  The first point of contact for motorists whose vehicles have been affected should be the insurance companies they hold their policies with.  Further to that, those affected should also contact the point of purchase and seek redress through them.  If they remain unsatisfied they may have recourse to civil remedies and as such could seek legal advice.</p></reply>

The monies raised by water charges will be received by Irish Water, which is a not part of general government.

The first point that would need to be considered is the proposed level of expenditure on water services and how to fund it. Any decisions on Exchequer expenditure on the provision of water services would be a matter for the Minister for Environment, Local Government and Community and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  The second issue is that the absence of water charges revenue would have to be taken into account by the Central Statistics Office in the statistical classification of Irish Water.

The programme is supported by a combination of student fees, State funding and other income.  <br/><br/>While in this case the fees could be considered high, in the majority of cases where third level tuition fees are payable they are at much lower levels.  In addition, those participating in the programme must already have acquired an undergraduate degree, the fees for which would have been covered by the State in the vast majority of cases. <br/><br/>I would point out that tax relief at the standard rate of 20% is available in respect of qualifying fees paid by an individual for a third level education course, including a postgraduate course.<br/><br/>Qualifying fees mean tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college and includes what is referred to as the &quot;student contribution&quot;.  No other fees e.g. administration fees, examination fees, capitation fees, qualify for tax relief.  Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grant, scholarship, employer contribution or other means are deducted in arriving at the net qualifying fees. A claim for relief may be made in respect of a number of students.  <br/><br/>In making a claim for relief for the tax year 2014, the maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per student, but an amount set out in the legislation must be disregarded from each claim (whether in respect of one or more students).  Where a claim for relief includes fees paid on behalf of at least one full-time student, the disregard is &euro;2,750.<br/><br/>Where a claim for relief includes fees solely paid on behalf of a part-time student or part-time students, the amount disregarded is &euro;1,375.  Thus, for example, an individual undertaking a graduate entry medical course on a full-time basis, where tuition fees of &euro;15,000 per student apply, would attract relief of &euro;850 made up as follows:<table><tr><th>-</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Tuition fees  </td><td><br /><br />&euro;15,000</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Capped at</td><td><br /><br />&euro;7,000</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Less  </td><td><br /><br />&euro;2,750</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><br /><br />&euro;4,250 @ 20% = &euro;850</td></tr></table><br/><br/>It is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions. However, as with all tax reliefs, the introduction of tax relief for loans taken out to pursue the graduate entry medical programme will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Budget and Finance Bill and any announcements will be made on Budget Day.</p></reply>

The LTV maximum tends to be at 90% and the mortgage to NDI no more than 35%.  In addition, banks require detailed income and expenditure disclosure which they examine carefully and then apply a stress test for changes to interest rates. </p><p>  In assessing affordability of credit, the Consumer Protection Code requires lenders to, inter alia, carry out an assessment of affordability which must include the consumer's ability to afford a 2% interest rate increase above the interest rate offered.  Therefore, in line with Central Bank guidance, new lending decisions are primarily based on assessment of affordability rather than LTV. </p><p>  From a prudential perspective, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) has been leading the work in developing macro-prudential frameworks across the EU.  This is being done through its recommendations of 2011 (on national macro-prudential mandates) and 2013 (on the intermediate objectives and instruments of macro-prudential policy). In a recent publication, the ESRB identified loan-to-income and debt service-to-income caps as potential instruments in addressing excessive credit growth.</p><p>  In addition, the Central Bank very recently published research which examines the use of limits on new lending at high loan-to-value (LTV) or loan-to-income (LTI) ratios as macro-prudential tools which can be used to make the financial system safer and less prone to crises. As the Deputy may be aware, the Governor of the Central Bank yesterday announced that the Central Bank intends to introduce some measures on the adoption of appropriate macro prudential tools in the context of the Irish mortgage market. These include proposed LTV and LTI measures, which will assist the regulator in maintaining and underpining financial stability.</p></reply>

The system will make several attempts to get the customer to repeat their PPS Number and after four unsuccessful attempts will place the customer directly in the queue for an operator.  Most unsuccessful attempts are usually due to background noise or bad quality telephony reception while the PPS Number is being spoken. <br/><br/>Revenue is constantly monitoring the performance of its voice activated service and looks to improve the quality of the customer's experience over the telephone.  I am further advised that when resources permit, Revenue will seek to invest further in their telephony system as it is now almost ten years old.<br/><br/>Regarding the length of time in the queue, this will always depend on the number of customers using the service at the time.  I am advised by the Commissioners that the average time in queue for the PAYE 1890 service is less than 6 minutes and not 20 minutes as stated in the details supplied.  The Commissioners further advise that at certain times, the wait time is significantly less than the average but they acknowledge that at certain peak times, the wait time can be longer.  <br/><br/>In order to manage the high volume of calls at peak times and to reduce the number of calls to operators, I am informed that Revenue also offers a variety of self-service options over the telephone to callers before they are connected to speak to an operator.  The self-service options include, inter alia, requesting the most popular forms and leaflets and finding out the status of any refund claims the caller may have submitted.  Unless the caller provides their PPS Number, the self-service options are not available.  An added benefit of the system capturing the caller's spoken PPS Number is that their call is routed directly to the correct office that is responsible for handling their call, thereby resulting overall in a speedier response.<br/><br/>I am also advised that, as is the norm with lo-call telephone numbers, the cost of a call is shared equally between the caller and Revenue.  The caller's telecommunications provider is the recipient of the call charge.<br/><br/>In addition to the 1890 services, the vast majority of routine Revenue enquiries can be answered by reference to comprehensive information leaflets, the PAYE Anytime Service and the Revenue On-Line Service (ROS) for business taxes.  All of these services are available at .</p></reply>

If one of the parties wants to mediate the complaint and the other does not, then no mediation will take place and the matter will proceed to investigation and adjudication.<br/><br/>In 2013 no mediations took place in relation to mortgage arrears.</p></reply>

While circumstances are now different, it is a matter for PTSB and its advisors to assess the market for the disposal of assets at that time and develop an appropriate sales strategy to reflect current market conditions.  </p><p>  PTSB has issued an announcement in relation to the sale of a tranche of CHL loans, with a par value of &pound;173 million (&euro;215m), and for confidentiality and commercial reasons they have not released any further details relating to the transaction including, but not limited to the buyer, the price achieved and the costs of the transaction.   </p><p>  Also the Deputy may be aware, under the Relationship Framework, the board and management teams of PTSB retain the responsibility and the authority for determining the strategy and commercial decisions and conducting the day to day operations, including the sale of assets. In making such decisions the Board and management teams are highly conscious of ensuring that sale costs are minimised and that maximum proceeds are achieved in the sale of all loan portfolios. </p><p>  In relation to the continuing involvement of CHL in the management of the loans post sale, I have been informed it is for commercial purposes to facilitate the sale to a buyer who does not have a servicing platform in the UK. I refer to the press release made by PTSB where they state that &quot;as part of the transaction CHL will continue to service the Project Liverpool loans under a separate commercial arrangement&quot;.</p></reply>

I respond to these reports, usually in my next fiscal policy publication or by letter if there is a large gap between the last Fiscal Assessment Report and my next fiscal policy publication.  My responses can be found on the websites of the Council and my own Department.  The establishment of the Council has strengthened the fiscal governance of the country and its reports have widened and deepened the debate on fiscal policy.  The analytical work of the Council has been so far of a high quality and generally provides useful insights for policymakers.  I have full confidence in the Fiscal Council and have no intention of abolishing it.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Deputy should be aware that the Council fulfils a number of key statutory roles in Ireland's compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and the Fiscal Compact.  In relation to the latter, it is the independent institution responsible at national level for monitoring our observance with the balanced budgetary rule.  With regard to the SGP, it is responsible for considering and endorsing the macroeconomic projections upon which our fiscal planning is based.  These functions have been given to the Council by the Oireachtas in the Fiscal Responsibility Acts 2012 and 2013.</p><p>  The Fiscal Council have also published a number of other papers, including a Pre-Budget paper on 22 September which set out its opinion of what quantum of consolidation should underpin the Budget 2015 package.  My position continues to be that the achievement of fiscal targets as set out in the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) should remain the key anchor for fiscal policy.  Since 2011 policy has been consistently framed in order to achieve these targets, and they have been met or exceeded for every year since.  The overall fiscal stance to underpin Budget 2015 will be designed to ensure that the target is met in 2015 as well.</p><p>  With regard to costs in 2014, there is a ceiling of &euro;820,000 for the Fiscal Council, which is protected by legislation and is indexed to consumer prices.  However, to facilitate payments from the Central Fund, the Fiscal Council provided projected costs for 2014 to my Department.  The projected costs provided by the Council for 2014 are &euro;732,020. This sum is broken down as follows; Pay - &euro;384,955 and non-pay - &euro;347,065.</p></reply>

NAMA's mandate is to achieve the best financial return for the State from the loans acquired by it and the asset management of the underlying security.  The provision of development finance to enhance the ultimate disposal value of assets securing its loans is entirely consistent with this mandate.  There is clearly therefore no change in NAMA's strategy.  NAMA has already provided &euro;1bn in funding for Irish residential and commercial development projects since its acquisition of loans in 2010.  To the extent that it makes commercial sense to fund the development of projects under the control of its debtors and receivers, NAMA is well placed to do so.  Development projects, in any particular instance, will be managed by debtors, receivers or by third-party partners.  I should also point out that NAMA does not own properties.  Rather, NAMA, in its capacity as a secured lender, facilitates development via funding for viable commercial and residential projects under the control of its debtors and receivers.  With emerging shortages in the Dublin residential and office sectors, it is reasonable that NAMA should seek to contribute, in so far as this is consistent with achieving the best financial return, to meeting those emerging shortages and it is this decision by the NAMA Board that I have endorsed in my recent S227 review.</p><p>  I am satisfied that NAMA's professional and qualified staff, comprising finance, planning, property and legal specialists, are best placed to bring coherence, direction and drive to the development of secured assets by NAMA's debtors, receivers and third-party partners.

Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.<br/><br/><b>Group B: &euro;30,150</b>- applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.<br/><br/><b>Group C: &euro;15,075</b>- applies in all other cases.<br/><br/>Any prior gifts or inheritances received by a child from their parents since 5 December 1991 are aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on the current benefit.<br/><br/>A child can therefore receive gifts or inheritances from their parents up to the value of &euro;225,000 without incurring any liability to CAT.<br/><br/>Apart from these tax-free thresholds, a number of exemptions and reliefs from CAT are provided in CAT legislation.<br/><br/>Section 82(4) Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 exempts from CAT money or money's worth provided by deceased parents for the benefit of a minor child (whether incapacitated or not) for normal support, maintenance or education.<br/><br/>Section 84 Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 provides that a gift or inheritance taken exclusively to discharge 'qualifying expenses' of an individual who is permanently incapacitated shall be exempt from CAT.  'Qualifying expenses' is defined as expenses relating to medical care, including the cost of maintenance in connection with such medical care.  This would include all hospital charges, doctor's fees, medicines and other pharmaceutical fees, and also includes the cost of maintenance in connection with medical care.<br/><br/>In order for the exemption to apply there must be evidence from the disponer, either by will or otherwise, that he or she has provided the benefit exclusively for these purposes.<br/><br/>It is to be noted that any gifts or inheritances exempted from CAT under sections 82 or 84 Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 do not reduce the CAT tax-free threshold of a child of &euro;225,000, which is preserved without reduction against the value of other gifts and inheritances taken by the child from their parents.</p></reply>

These USC measures were introduced in conjunction on a revenue neutral basis and are due to cease on 31 December 2014.</p><p>- Consanguinity relief from Stamp Duty on transfers of non-residential properties was retained in Budget 2012 for intra-family transfers to end-2014 and is estimated to cost &euro;5 million in 2014.</p><p>- The 3 year tax relief for start-up companies was extended in Budget 2012 to include start-up companies which commenced a new trade in 2012, 2013 and 2014.

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or in relation to the mortgage interest rates charged.  It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.  It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the details of the accounts of mortgage holders.</p><p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations.  The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears.</p><p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors, including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution s overall funding.</p><p>  As I stated in a previous Parliamentary Question, a previous Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.</p><p>  As part of the Central Bank's work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions.</p></reply>

The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on pension contributions.<br/><br/>A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available as tax returns by employers of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level.  An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers.  There is, therefore, only a limited statistical basis for providing definitive figures.<br/><br/>However, by making certain assumptions using the available information, the Revenue Commissioners advise me that the impact on yield to the Exchequer may be tentatively estimated in respect of reducing the current annual earnings cap in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs.  Such estimates take no account of any behavioural impacts that may arise from the proposed changes and that could effect the scale of any yield.<br/><br/>On this basis, and based on the latest available information, it is tentatively estimated that the yield from the reduction of the annual earnings cap for pension contributions from &euro;115,000 as suggested by the Deputy is set out in the following Table.<table><tr><th>Revised Ceiling</th><th>Estimated Yield</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;100,000</td><td>&euro;28m</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;90,000</td><td>&euro;52m</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;80,000</td><td>&euro;78m</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;70,000</td><td>&euro;110m</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;60,000</td><td>&euro;149m</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This is an important measure that supports employment in small breweries throughout the country. </p><p>  I am aware of the important role played by the drinks industry in providing employment along all points of the production chain, including distilleries, breweries, and public houses. In this regard, the Government has introduced a number of measures to maintain and create jobs in the broader tourism sector, of which the pub trade is an important component. In July 2011, the 9% reduced VAT rate for tourism related services was introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative. The reduced VAT rate, due to expire on 31 December 2013, was retained as part of Budget 2014. This decision was taken in recognition of the importance of the tourism sector to the overall economy and also in recognition of the success of the initiative in helping to create many new jobs, as well as protecting existing jobs. The 9% reduced rate applies to the supply of food and drink (excluding alcohol, soft drinks and bottled water) in the course of catering, which of course benefits the pub trade. In addition, Budget 2014 provided for the abolition of the Air Travel Tax. This measure was designed to increase the number of tourists coming to Ireland, thus benefitting the broader hospitality sector, including the pub trade.</p><p>  These tax policy initatives, combined with other measures such as investment in tourism infrastructure like the 'Wild Atlantic Way', have begun to bear fruit. Figures from the Central Statistics Office indicate that in the period June   August 2014, the total number of overseas trips to Ireland increased by 9.7% to 2,484,000, an overall increase of 219,200 compared to the same period twelve months earlier. </p><p>  The nationally representative price (as measured by the Central Statistics Office) of a can of lager purchased in the off trade increased from &euro;1.77 in 2003 to &euro;1.98 in 2014. In the same period the excise imposed on such a product increased from &euro;0.43 to &euro;0.48. The price of a pint of lager purchased in the on trade rose from &euro;3.67 in 2003 to &euro;4.67 in 2014, while the excise imposed on such a product increased from &euro;0.49 to &euro;0.55 in the same period. Accordingly, the excise component as a percentage of the price of a pint of lager purchased in the on trade is lower now than it was in 2003, while the excise component of a can of lager sold in the off-trade is broadly the same at it was in 2003. This suggests that excise is not the primary driver of the price differential.</p><p>  Finally, I would point out that the percentage increase in excise duty in wine cited by the Deputy is based on using 2012 as the base year. Excise duty on a bottle of wine in 2009 was &euro;2.46, and stands at &euro;3.19 today.  It should be noted that the volume of wine cleared for consumption to end July is 9.2% higher than end July 2013.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-07a.322.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014100700059#WRG00800"><p>Tax relief is not available to parents in respect of creche fees or childcare costs. However, I can assure the Deputy that the Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children. In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents. These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free childcare places to qualifying F&Aacute;S and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school. Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided. <br/><br/>The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment. <br/><br/>In addition, a Single Person Child Carer tax credit of &euro;1,650 is provided as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000. This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated. The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and<b></b>increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year.<b></b>To claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit a claimant must not be married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting.<br/><br/>The Universal Social Charge (USC) was introduced in Budget 2011 to replace the Income Levy and Health Levy. It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base with very few exemptions. <br/><br/>In Budget 2012 I announced that those earning less than &euro;10,036 would no longer be subject to the Universal Social Charge. This in itself has removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge and is of particular benefit to the low paid.<br/><br/>In relation to exempting childcare costs from tax when the service is provided by an employer, a similar relief existed where a benefit-in-kind exemption was provided for childcare costs where the facilities were provided by the employer. This was abolished in Finance Act 2011. The Commission on Taxation recommended the abolition of this exemption, citing equity issues in relation to those parents whose employment does not provide such facilities. <br/><br/>I have no plans to introduce a tax relief for parents to assist with childcare costs. To provide such a tax relief could be seen to unfairly discriminate against those individuals who stay at home and look after their children. This could result in married one-earner couples effectively subsidising a two-earner family.<br/><br/>In addition, tax relief is only of benefit to those in the tax net and it is estimated that in 2014, 39% of income earners will be exempt from income tax. it could also be argued that any tax relief would most likely be absorbed by childcare providers in the form of higher prices.<br/><br/>As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. As the Deputy will also appreciate, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current budgetary constraints. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

The 'Code of Practice for Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals' was created to assist both parties to an engagement including an engagement in the construction sector - in determining if a contract of engagement is, by its nature, either a 'contract of service' (that is, an employer and employee arrangement) or a 'contract for service' (that is, not an employer and employee arrangement).  The Code of Practice for Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals' is not a Revenue Code but rather was compiled with the assistance of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions / Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation / National Employment Rights Authority / Department of Social Protection / Department of Finance / Small Firms Association / Irish Business and Employers Confederation / Construction Industry Federation / Revenue Commissioners.I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are committed to tackling all forms of shadow economy activity including that which is described as 'bogus self-employment status'.  Their staff carry-out visits to a wide range of businesses, including temporary places of business such as building sites, as part of their on-going compliance operations.    In some instances, such visits are undertaken jointly with other State agencies such as the Department of Social Protection and the National Employment Rights Authority.</p></reply>

The restructuring of the credit achieves such an outcome.</p><p>  The person who cares for the child for most of the year is entitled to the credit in the first instance. Agreement as to who will be the primary carer of a child is a matter for the parents or guardians. However, only the primary carer is entitled to the credit.</p><p>  In the circumstances where the primary carer cannot utilise the credit   for example, because of insufficient taxable income - the primary carer may relinquish the credit and a secondary claimant may claim it.  The requirement for a primary claimant to relinquish the credit before a claim from a secondary claimant can be considered is necessary, as in the first instance, only one credit is available in respect of a qualifying child or children. Secondly, the credit is targeted at the primary claimant, and finally, only the primary claimant can gauge whether their income would be of a sufficient amount over the course of a tax year to be able to utilise the credit. An individual may wish to retain the credit in the expectation that they may find employment during the year, for example. In addition, taxpayers are entitled to review their tax affairs over a four year look back period, and depending on circumstances, an individual might wish to retain the credit in order to offset any tax liability that might arise as a result of a review of their income tax liabilities in any of the years concerned.</p><p>  For information, it should be noted that where a primary carer is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting they would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one), on the basis that the relevant child is not, in the main, being cared for by a single person. In such circumstances the primary carer cannot relinquish the credit to a secondary carer. In addition, a secondary carer who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one) regardless of the marital status of the primary carer.</p></reply>

To be classified as a Community Hall, the premises needs to be used for purposes which are not for profit or gain and involve participation by inhabitants of the locality generally and are used for purposes which are of a recreational or otherwise of a social nature. </p><p>  Many sports clubs/organisations achieve exemption from rates of their property under this provision. However, the Valuation Act, 2001 specifically excludes from this provision, the premises of a club registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904. Therefore, the premises of such a registered club are rateable, which essentially means that clubs that sell alcohol are rateable.  This provision currently has the effect of making the entire premises occupied by the club rateable and not just that part of the premises normally used for the sale of alcohol. This is because the sale of alcohol is a commercial activity and a registered sports club is competing with other commercial licensed premises, all of which are rateable.   This situation can place an undue burden on many local clubs as most of their facility is purely for sporting purposes, and is provided on a not-for-profit basis with local volunteer effort for the benefit of the local community.</p><p>  I am, therefore, proposing an amendment to the Valuation (Amendment)(No.2) Bill 2012, which is  currently at Committee stage in the Seanad, that  would mean  Community Sports Clubs will only be liable for rates on buildings that are used for the generation of income. Buildings that are used for the sale of alcohol or food, retail outlets etc. will be rated but buildings that are used for community sport will be exempt.  If a sports club's only commercial facility is the bar then it is only the bar and ancillary facilities that will be rated. </p><p>  In proposing this amendment, I am conscious of situations where local sports clubs can be in competition with commercial operators. For that reason it is not just the bar area of a sports club that will be valued for rates but any building that is used in the generation of income. Minister of State, Simon Harris will be taking the Valuation (Amendment) (No.2) Bill 2012 through the Houses of the Oireachtas and we both welcome this common-sense amendment to address a long standing concern of many local sports clubs. </p></reply>

In certain instances the benefits payable under the N/SPS would actually be more beneficial for individuals, but it will be a matter for each employee to make a decision based on the information they will be given on their own pension position. The options process will start shortly. Contribution increases have not been implemented, in respect of Southern Members of the N/SPS, pending completion of this process.</p><p>  Finally in relation to the commitment in the Haddington Road Agreement (HRA), cited by the Deputy, I do not believe that this provision should impede the changes envisaged for the N/SPS. That commitment is instead a high-level affirmation by Government that, during the lifetime of the HRA, it plans no further general public service pay cuts following the reductions carried through in 2013 via the HRA and the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013. I do not believe that this commitment should be stretched to become a veto on objectively warranted reforms to pension schemes rules, including the N/SPS rules.</p></reply>

The Circular also outlines appropriate competitive procedures that can be used in the engagement of legal services and sets out a number of approaches and tools for public bodies to use in managing legal costs one of which is that where in-house services are available, such as those provided by the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Attorney General's Office in the Central Government sector, they should be used.</p><p>  In terms of reducing costs associated with legal services, the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) has been established to centralise the procurement of common goods and services across the public sector. This move is in line with best practice in the public and private sector and is part of the continuing reform programme being driven by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The reform of the public service procurement functions will deliver sustainable savings for the taxpayer and make a significant contribution to the deficit reduction programme.</p><p>  The OGP will take responsibility for the procurement of professional services within which the category of legal services falls. The OGP structures and capability are being developed at this stage and currently a number of sourcing strategies are being devised. A key category in which a sourcing strategy is being developed is legal services and, more particularly, those services which public sector bodies procure from solicitors. </p><p>  The OGP has developed a high level operating model from which Government departments and agencies which require external advices from solicitors may draw down service. This model is sectorial specific and is underpinned by the following: improved operational efficiencies and reduced costs; control and management of the expenditure on legal services in such a manner that delivers best economic value; discipline, continuity and consistency to the provision of legal services; establishment of a supply base with broad service coverage and improved service quality; a contracting approach which impacts positively on the Irish economy and society.</p><p>  Further validation will be required by the OGP before this model is tendered to the market, but in any event it is envisaged that this arrangement will be well advanced by Q2 2015.</p></reply>

I am pleased that the new Report acknowledges the progress that has already been made by the Government and that its recommendations reflect very similar themes and issues to those contained in the 2011 report that I commissioned through Forf&aacute;s. These issues and themes are guiding the work of the South East Development Forum, which I established to drive the renewal of economic and jobs growth in the region. I have asked the South East Forum to consider the contents of the SEEDS Report in the context of its ongoing work.  The report is a very helpful contribution to identifying possible interventions to assist the economy of the South East Region. Some of the actions in the report fall outside my own remit, while others have not been fully costed but are likely to have Exchequer costs if implemented. This naturally creates challenges in the context of the current public expenditure constraints.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the progress which has been made in job creation for the South East Region in recent times has been very heartening, with employment having increased by 15,000 in 2013 alone, a trend which has continued in 2014 .  The unemployment rate has fallen from 19% at the start of 2013 to 14.3% at the end of Q 2 2014. Just last week, the Taoiseach and I were very pleased to be able to officiate at the launch of the exciting new &euro;100m project by <i>West Pharma</i>in Waterford City, the latest in a succession of new job creation projects in the region.  <br/><br/>I am pleased also to advise that, in order to improve the offering in the Region to win new business, IDA Ireland has signed contracts for the construction of an advanced manufacturing facility in Waterford.  This facility, which will be 2,348 square metres in area, will be located in the IDA Technology Park at Butlerstown and will be completed by year end. In addition, IDA Ireland has rolled out a dedicated digital marketing initiative for inward investment focussing on the South East Region and Waterford (Connect and Invest Waterford).  <br/><br/>Regarding the level of IDA staffing in the region, I am informed by IDA Ireland that there are 5 staff based in the Waterford Office with client-facing and regional responsibilities.  These staff work with the existing client company base in the South East to ensure their sustainability and growth and they also facilitate itineraries into the region. They also work with other key stakeholders to ensure that the Region has a competitive and ever improving offering. Subject to the overall constraints of the Employment Control Framework ceiling, the numbers and location of staff in the various offices of IDA Ireland is a day to day operational matter for the Agency and not one in which I have a function.</p></reply>

Details of the number of site visits on a county basis in the periods 1 January to 30 September 2014 and 1 June to 30 September 2014 are set out in the attached tabular statement.  <br/><br/>There are many complex factors influencing decision location making, such as the increasing preference of investors globally for cities of scale with 1 million plus populations, significant challenges from lower cost locations in Eastern Europe and the Far East and attractive regional aid. While IDA Ireland does attempt to influence the choice of locationthe final decision as to where to visit and ultimately where to locate is taken in all cases by the investor. <br/><br/>The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.  My intention is that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, focusing on the Midlands region, and involving the agencies under the remit of my own Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices.  The objective is to enhance synergies between the agencies and their client companies and build on the competitive strengths of the region to maximise the potential for job creation.  The role which other public bodies in the region can play in working towards this objective will also be examined as the project develops.  The aim is that this framework will serve as a model for other regions of the country.<br/><br/>Table showing the number of IDA Ireland sponsored site visits, on a county by county basis in the period 1 January 2014 to 30 September 2014 and from <br/><br/>1 June 2014 to 30 September 2014<table><tr><th>County</th><th>First Time Site Visits <br /><br />June/July/Aug/Sept 2014</th><th>First Time Site Visits<br /><br />Jan-Sept 2014</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>2</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>9</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>54</td><td>184</td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>9</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>10</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>4</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>1</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>5</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>3</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>0</td><td>4</td></tr></table></p></reply>

A written request for submissions was also issued to other stakeholders and a further roundtable with entrepreneurs was held on the 8th of October. There is also an open call for submissions from the business community and the general public through the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation website. It is hoped that the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 will be finalised in January 2015. Regional meetings are an important part of communicating the actions needs and building coalitions for change and for gathering inputs for future Action Plans. The meetings in Galway in 2013 and 2014 were particularly helpful in this regard. In future I hope to convene further Action Plans for Jobs forums in Galway. </p></reply>

The SMS has operated in Ireland since 1982 with the objective of promoting and encouraging the consumption of milk among school children. Its management is primarily through the National Dairy Council (NDC) in conjunction with the co-ops, but take-up is quite limited on a geographical level.<br/><br/>The Scheme provides for the payment of aid for milk products to school pupils and is co-financed by the EU and the MS, with DAFM the responsible Department in Ireland. The aid rates were reduced by approximately 7% per annum from 2004 to 2007 in line with the general reductions in support prices brought about by the 2003 Mid Term Review of the CAP. However, the Exchequer has made up for this reduction in the EU contribution, and the overall aid rates have been maintained at &euro;27.89/100kg. Since 2007 the EU contribution is &euro;18.15/100kg, with the balance of &euro;9.74/100kg made up by the Exchequer.<br/><br/>In School year 2012-2013, approximately &euro;677,000 was spent on the scheme for the provision of milk to nursery, preschool, special schools, secondary and primary school pupils. The cost to the EU was &euro;440,572 and the National Top up was &euro;236,428. <br/><br/>Each pupil is entitled to 250 ml of milk or milk equivalent per day at an average charge of &euro;0.20 per 250ml. Milk is sold to schools at a subsidised rate and dairies claim the subsidy back from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The cost of the milk on average, as indicated above, is approximately &euro;1- &euro;1.25 per week per child, which equates to approximately &euro;40 per academic year.<br/><br/>For the School Year 1st August 2012 to 31st July 2013 almost 2.4 million litres of milk was supplied to schools around the country, the approximate number of children that benefited was 52,937. For the same school year, 1077 schools participated in the Scheme including 95 Montessori, 855 National, 84 Secondary and 43 Special Schools. In total there are 4014 schools registered on the Department of Education website of which 3152 are primary schools.<br/><br/>Regarding the size of the carton utilised all NDC member dairies deliver either a 189ml or 250ml carton/bottle of subsidised milk. Some dairies additionally provide a 330ml carton at the request of schools, (usually secondary). The maximum quantity eligible for aid and upon which a subsidy is provided is for up to 250ml per pupil per day.<br/><br/>In respect of issues relating to scheme uptake, unfortunately subscription to the School Milk Scheme is low in secondary schools. This can be attributed to a number of factors such as the perceived administrative burden of running the scheme and the fact that demand for milk will come directly from pupils rather than parents.<br/><br/>In terms of efforts to encourage further uptake, the National Dairy Council actively promotes and provides a support service for the subsidised School Milk Scheme through various initiatives.  The NDC contacts every primary school in ROI each September by letter encouraging participation in School Milk and outlines the health and nutritional benefits provided by milk.  The NDC provides a support service to schools that are interested in subscribing to the scheme by putting them in touch with dairies that can deliver to their school.  The NDC supplies fridges free of charge to subscribed schools, thereby ensuring that milk is provided to children at the optimum temperature.  In addition to this the NDC runs dairy education programmes at both primary and secondary level to promote awareness of the benefits of dairy.<br/><br/>Regarding the range of products available under the scheme, revisions to and further development of the School Milk Scheme are under negotiation at EU level. In these negotiations Ireland has sought to appropriately extend the range of products that would form the scheme basis. It is noteworthy that a number of milk categories, including skimmed and semi-skimmed milk are currently permitted under the scheme for the school year 2014/15 but demand has not been evident beyond the whole milk option. As such, full-fat milk is provided by all NDC dairies as that is where demand has been evident from schools and parents. <br/><br/>In respect of the application process, this is a straightforward process for interested schools via the NDC. Relevant information is available on the NDC website at the web address </p></reply>

Each year farmers in Ireland benefit from funding of over &euro;1.5 billion under Schemes such as the Single Farm Payment Scheme (SPS) , the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the Agri-environment Schemes, etc. This comprises the entire net income of many thousands of Irish farmers.</p><p>  The European Commission has an obligation to ensure that Member States manage and use the EU funding granted to them in accordance with the very restrictive provisions governing the Schemes and general financial provisions. All of the lands declared by farmers must be eligible if these lands benefit from payment under one of more or these Schemes. These claims are then recorded on the Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS). Given the importance of the LPIS database in underpinning direct aid payments worth in excess of &euro;1.5 billion annually, my Department is obliged under EU Regulations to ensure its accuracy.</p><p>  Following consultation with the EU Commission, as part of the normal Accounting process, my Department was requested to undertake a complete review of the LPIS database. This on-going review is of major significance as the Commission is seeking to disallow &euro;181m of funding to Ireland relating to payments over the five years to 2012. This potential disallowance is currently the subject of an Irish appeal to the EU Conciliation Body.</p></reply>

For this reason, ICCAT has implemented a strict management regime with the objective of bringing about a recovery of the stock. Within the EU, quotas were allocated over ten years ago to Member States based on track record. Ireland, which did not have the track record, does not have a quota. It has access to a by-catch quota for Bluefin tuna in the albacore tuna fishery. However, this by- catch quota is also available to other Member States, and cannot be used for recreational and/or sport fisheries.</p><p>  The Department has, following recent queries, been seeking to clarify the situation regarding recreational fisheries for bluefin tuna with the European Commission. The unequivocal advice I have received from the EU Commission is that a recreational fishery was not legally possible in the absence of a national blue fin tuna quota. We do not have such a quota and it is extremely unlikely that we could obtain one as it would involve reducing the share of the Total Allowable Catch of those Member States that do have quota and for whom bluefin is an important commercial fishery. Member States vessels with quota share, which was made available based on historic track record in the fishery, are permitted to fish for bluefin tuna.</p><p>  ICCAT (the international Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas) is responsible for the management and conservation of tuna. Ireland is represented in ICCAT, along with all other EU Member States by the European Commission. Under ICCAT rules bluefin tuna stocks are subject to a recovery plan due the decline in the stock over the years and catches are very strictly monitored and controlled. There would be no support from any quarter for any action by Ireland that might lead to an increase in bluefin mortality.</p><p>  My Department is in ongoing discussions with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, which has responsibility for angling, and the EU Commission with regard to the possibility of catch and release fishing for bluefin that would not impact mortality and would contribute to scientific knowledge via electronic tagging. However, this is a complicated area both legally and technically and there are many issues that will require examination and clarification before any strong case could be made to the EU Commission, in the first instance.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, questions of price are ultimately matters to be determined between the purchasers and the sellers of cattle. It is neither appropriate nor possible for me or any other Minister for Agriculture in the EU, to intervene directly on these issues. Cattle prices are determined by supply/demand dynamics which are in turn influenced by the seasonality of production, the length of the production lifecycle and market conditions such as retail promotions, consumer confidence, competition with other meats and the overall macroeconomic situation. However, the State, through the Competition Authority already has a well established infrastructure for dealing with allegations of anti competitive practices and I do not consider it appropriat e to replicate that structure through a new supervisory body in the beef sector.</p></reply>

My intention is to ensure that all resources available to my Department will be managed to provide the optimum benefit to economic activity in the agricultural, food, fisheries and forestry sectors, including farm incomes, and to realising the potential which clearly exists for the sectors to continue to contribute to the national economic recovery.</p><p>  It is understood that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is planning to publish the detailed 2015 Revised Estimates Volume later in the year. As in previous years, it is the practice of the of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to expand further on the information contained in the Revised Estimates Volume by publishing a more detailed tabular statement of budget figures on its website to coincide with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s publication.</p></reply>

The SFP forms a significant part of the annual income of farmers in Ireland, in many cases it is used to subsidise the running costs of the farming enterprise and is, therefore, greater than the net farm income in those cases.  I am particularly conscious of the need to improve the cash flow on these farms.  In the case of the Single Farm Payment, I can confirm that advance payments valued at over &euro;500 million will commence on 16 October.  My Department will make every effort to maximise the number of applicants cleared for payment on that date and will continue regular payment runs for cases as they are fully processed for payment thereafter.

Under this programme there has been considerable capital investment amounting to some &euro;6.38m from 2009 to date at Custume Barracks, Athlone.  </p><p>  The most recent major projects undertaken at the barracks include the construction of Armoured Vehicle Garaging facilities (&euro;932k), a Gymnasium (&euro;1.82m) and an upgrading of gas and water main facilities (&euro;597k), including the provision of new underground services and associated works.  The improvement and rationalization of facilities in Athlone over recent years benefitted the incoming units from Connolly Barracks and Columb Barracks as well as the units already located there.  In addition to the major capital projects as outlined above, there are ongoing works required to ensure the upkeep and repair of buildings and provide facilities generally for personnel. Recent examples include the upgrading of Accommodation Blocks 'K'&rsquo; and 'I' (at a cost of &euro;357k) in order to provide transit accommodation for personnel, including those relocated under the barrack consolidation programme.  Additional locker facilities were also provided (at a cost of &euro;397k) for personnel transferring into the Barracks over that period.</p></reply>

Such services include "the provision by a person, whether or not for commercial or other consideration, of accomodation in his or her own home."  Consequently, language schools which arrange such accomodation placements for foreign students must conduct Garda Vetting in respect of persons who are contracted to provide accomodation in this regard. </p><p>  However, the 2012 Act does not apply to &quot;private arrangements&quot;.

An Interdepartmental Committee is in place, and met recently to review issues and the action and timeframe required to tackle them.  Many of these issues involve amending unsuitable and outmoded language and in some cases, archaic legal provisions, in existing legislation. Another key task which is underway involves examining how the important issue of Reasonable Accommodation can be achieved in a meaningful way within our Constitutional framework as interpreted by the Supreme Court.   </p><p>  Progress towards ratification therefore continues to be made.  One of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed is the enactment of capacity legislation.

All information that the applicant wishes to have taken into consideration should be included with their application.  Where the stated purpose of the application is to marry in Ireland it is advisable to provide evidence of that intention in the form of an acknowledgement from the Registrar confirming the date of receipt of notification of the intention to marry.

The National Disability Authority (NDA) facilitated consultations with the Deaf Community in Ireland in 2012 at my Department's request in relation to actions that could make improvements in the lives of deaf people and submissions received from them were considered for inclusion where possible and appropriate in the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan (NDSIP) which was published in July 2013.  </p><p>  As part of the follow-up to that initiative, the first special themed meeting of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group (NDSIG) focussed on the issue of Irish Sign Language on November 28, 2013.  This meeting brought together representatives of relevant Departments, the NDA, the Deaf Community and other relevant stakeholders with a view to further progressing the implementation of the NDSIP in this regard. </p><p>  The meeting reviewed the current situation across Government Departments and their Agencies with regard to promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language including in-service provision and provided the Deaf Community with the opportunity of presenting their experience of interaction with the Public Sector.  It also provided a useful opportunity to examine mechanisms which could promote the further use and recognition of Irish Sign Language and understand practical implications for service users.  Further to this meeting, the Deaf Community prepared a report to reflect their views on key actions and priorities.  This report was submitted for consideration in the second quarter of this year.  The intention is that the recommendations from this report  will be reflected in the NDSIP where practicable, through the incorporation of new actions and related performance indicators and timelines as appropriate.  Progress on all relevant actions will then be monitored as part of the Implementation Plan monitoring process.  The focus therefore remains on the identification of mechanisms for the further promotion and recognition of Irish Sign Language with a view to promoting and supporting its use, thereby improving service delivery on the ground, rather than on its designation as an official language.  </p><p>  I might add that the existing supports for use of Irish Sign Language in Ireland give a level of recognition and practical measures equal to, or above that, in countries which have formally recognised sign language.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the revised General Scheme was published on 25 September 2014, following Government approval for it to be drafted as a Bill.</p><p>  In brief, the changes were made in response to recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to which the General Scheme was referred for pre-legislative scrutiny; recommendations of the Ombudsman for Children to whom the General Scheme was referred for observations; legal advice from the Attorney General and the views of relevant Government Departments.</p><p>  One of the most important changes has been the inclusion of a new Part designed to safeguard the right of a donor-conceived child to know his or her identity.  This change was strongly advocated by the Joint Oireachtas Committee and by the Ombudsman for Children.  In addition, the General Scheme has expanded the categories of couples who may be eligible to adopt jointly.  Cohabiting couples who have cohabited for three years will now be eligible to adopt jointly on the same basis as married couples.  The provisions on guardianship have been also been refined.</p><p>  The modified cohabitation criteria will make it easier for an unmarried father automatically to become a guardian of his child.  Equally, conscious of the need to safeguard the rights of parents who are guardians, the provisions for guardianship by those other than parents have been limited largely to decisions on day-to-day matters.  Finally, provisions relating to surrogacy have been removed, pending further policy analysis and the decision of the Supreme Court in a landmark case.</p></reply>

The Courts are aware of the statutory entitlement to remission when passing sentence.<b></b>It should be noted that persons sentenced to life imprisonment for murder are not entitled to remission.<br/><br/>The Prison Rules 2007 provided, in addition to the standard rate of remission of one-quarter of sentence, for the possibility of enhanced remission of up to one-third of sentence where a prisoner engages in authorised structured activity intended to increase the likelihood that the prisoner, when released from prison, will be less likely to re-offend or better able to re-integrate into the community.  The Prison Rules were amended in August of this year to clarify the factors which may be taken into account when considering whether or not to grant a prisoner an enhanced rate of remission.  These include the nature and gravity of the offence, the period of the sentence served, the potential threat to public safety, the views, where relevant, of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and of course the prisoner's conduct as well as his or her engagement with authorised structured activities.I am strongly of the view that greater remission must be earned and the central consideration when deciding whether or not to grant enhanced remission is the extent to which prisoners are less likely to re-offend and better able to reintegrate into society.<br/><br/>As I indicated recently when publishing the Penal Policy Review Group Report I have no plans to increase the standard rate of remission beyond one-quarter of sentence.  I have, however, asked my officials to examine further the potential for increased use of earned remission.</p></reply>

It should be noted, however, that, even where all of the conditions are satisfied, there is no obligation on a State to comply with a transfer request.  While the Convention does not require that the requested state give reasons for a refusal to agree to a transfer, the Irish legislation provides that, where practicable and where the interests of justice do not so preclude, a statement specifying the grounds for the refusal will be provided to the applicant or requesting state as appropriate. <br/><br/>I can inform the Deputy that the individual referred to is entitled to apply at any stage for a transfer to serve his sentence in this jurisdiction once he meets these conditions. <br/><br/>The conditions which must be met are that:<br/><br/>1)  The offender seeking a transfer is regarded as a national of the State to which the transfer is sought (the administering State),<br/><br/>2)  The order or judgement under which the sentenced person was sentenced is final,<br/><br/>3)  There is, at the time of the receipt of the request for transfer, at least six months of the sentence remaining to be served,<br/><br/>4)  The sentenced person consents to the transfer,<br/><br/>5)  The act or omission constituting the offence would also constitute an offence in the administering State, and<br/><br/>6)  Both States consent to the transfer.<br/><br/>Under the terms of the Convention, the two States involved in processing a transfer request are required to exchange information about the sentenced person in order to ensure that the conditions above are met.  This process is necessary to ensure that all parties (the offender, the sentencing State and the administering State) are fully aware of the legal consequences of a transfer and that an informed decision can be made by all concerned.  <br/><br/>Due to the complexity of the documentation required to affect a transfer between other States and Ireland, the process of information exchange can be time consuming therefore it is not possible to provide the Deputy with an indication of how long the process would take should the individual referred to submit an application for same. <br/><br/>Every effort is made to process each application as speedily as possible, once the three-way consent between the two States and the sentenced person is forthcoming.</p></reply>

The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law. Section 15A provides that the Minister may waive certain conditions for naturalisation if satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.<br/><br/>Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that I may,  in my absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances e.g. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons; or where the application is made on behalf of the minor child of a naturalised Irish citizen. <br/><br/>Officials in the citizenship section of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service prepare a comprehensive submission to me in respect of each application for naturalisation. This submission addresses any claims for the exercise of my discretion in areas such as Irish descent or Irish associations. I decide whether to grant naturalisation based on my evaluation of the merits of the entire case as presented to me.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-07a.648.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014100700065#WRN00500"><p>Addressing the price of alcohol is an important component of any long-term strategic approach to tackling alcohol misuse.  There is a link between consumption and harm and evidence that affordability is one of the drivers of increased consumption.  The Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse, to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  The package of measures to be implemented will include provision for minimum unit pricing, regulation of the marketing and advertising of alcohol, regulation of sports sponsorship, structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets and labelling of alcohol products. </p><p>  The Government has decided that minimum unit pricing is the most effective policy measure to deal with the sale of alcohol at cheap prices.  Minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels per gram of alcohol that must be legally observed by retailers in both the on and off trade sector.  This is a targeted measure, designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  It is mainly aimed at those who are higher risk, such as adolescents and people who have a harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption pattern.  It should therefore only have a marginal effect on moderate drinkers.   </p><p>  The other matters referred to by the Deputy, i.e. the banning of price-based promotions and the introduction of a statutory code in the area of alcohol merchandising, are a matter for my colleague, Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald who has responsibility for the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2008.</p><p>  Section 16 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2008 contains provisions for the making of regulations concerning conditions for the sale, supply and consumption of intoxicating liquor.  The Government has agreed that the forthcoming Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will give Environmental Health Officers statutory enforcement powers in relation to regulations made under Section 16 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2008.  The Department of Justice and Equality has advised that they will consider how best to proceed with the making of these regulations following enactment of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.</p><p>  The Government has agreed to replace the current Responsible Retailers of Alcohol in Ireland (RRAI) voluntary code of practice on the sale and display of alcohol products in mixed trading outlets with a statutory code of practice under Section 17 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act, 2011.  It is intended that the statutory code will operate for a 2 year period, after which its effectiveness will be jointly evaluated by my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Department of Justice and Equality has advised that preparatory work on the statutory code of practice is currently under way and it is hoped to launch a consultation process on the contents of the code in the coming weeks.</p><p>  Work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing and it is hoped to publish a General Scheme of a Bill before the D&aacute;il recess.</p></reply>

The Act provides, inter alia, for the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and the enhancement of their high standards of professional education and competencies.  The Department of Health is responsible for oversight of the governance of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). The Department has no role in setting or approving registration fees.</p><p>  The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 20141 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.</p><p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17th September, 2014.  A helpline, email address and website information page have been made available by the NMBI to provide clarification for registrants who may have queries on this matter.</p></reply>

With effect from 2009 nursing homes for older people have been registered and inspected by HIQA and during the course of this Government this function has extended to residential services for those with disabilities and child protection services.  There are no plans to extend the remit of HIQA to undertake inspections of sheltered housing.<br/><br/>The Health Service Executive provides health and personal services to tenants in sheltered housing in the same way that they are provided to older people living in their own homes in the community.  In this respect the <i>Government for National Recovery, 2011-2016 </i>commits to developing and implementing national standards for home support services which will be subject to HIQA inspection.  Primary legislation and resources will be required for the introduction of a statutory regulation system for home care services.

It negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process.  This is to ensure that the State obtains the best value for each individual in a nursing home and to comply with competition law.<br/><br/>In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:<br/><br/>- costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money,<br/><br/>- price(s) previously charged,<br/><br/>- local market price, and<br/><br/>- budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.<br/><br/>The cost of long-term nursing home care in public nursing homes is determined by the HSE.  It is acknowledged that there are variations in the cost of care between public, private and voluntary nursing homes and this is due to a range of factors, including nursing and overall staffing ratios, tenure and other conditions of employment, and the overall dependency levels and care needs of residents.<br/><br/>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a Review.  The review  is examining the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and  the current methods of negotiating and setting prices. It is expected that the Review will be completed in the coming months and the Report will then be made publicly available.</p></reply>

The success of the outpatient initiative run by the HSE at the end of 2013 which reduced those waiting over 12 months from over 100,000 in March 2013 to fewer than 5,000 in December 2013 and further validation work in 2014 resulted in facilitation of 33,000 additional outpatient appointments in 2013 and an additional 55,883 outpatient appointments thus far in 2014. However this had the consequence of driving up in-patient and day case waiting lists as patients are referred for appropriate treatment. In addition, other pressures such as almost 30,000 new cancer diagnoses each year place increasing demands of the order of 3000 &ndash; 6000 additional referral requirements on the system each month. </p><p>  Improvements in chronological scheduling, consistent validation of waiting lists and active engagement with patients to reduce &lsquo;DNA&rsquo; or Did Not Attend rates are underway to address outpatient waiting lists; similar measures, as well as optimisation of theatre capacity and day of surgery admission where possible are being employed to improve management of in-patient and day case waiting lists.  </p><p>  In relation to the particular patient query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to him directly.</p></reply>

The Programme takes direction and guidance from the Clinical Advisory Group, a group of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists from the Institute. The Programme established a multi-disciplinary national working group, which meets at least four times a year, to harvest the views of, and gain consensus from, the range of healthcare providers associated with maternity services. As the issues raised by the Deputy refer to such services, I have asked, through the HSE, that the Clinical Programme examine the matter and respond directly to him.  </p><p>  The Deputy may also be interested to note that the reports into the 2012 maternal death at UHG and infant deaths at Portlaoise Hospital from 2006 made important recommendations in relation to maternity services in both hospitals and in relation to wider maternity services' provision.  Implementation of the recommendations of both reports is underway and is being regularly monitored. </p><p>  Furthermore, my Department, in conjunction with the HSE, is currently working on the development of a new Maternity Strategy.  The Strategy will determine the optimal configuration of maternity services to ensure that women in Ireland have access to safe, high quality maternity care in a setting most appropriate to their needs.  Developing the strategy will provide us with the opportunity to take stock of current services and identify how we can improve the quality and safety of care provided to women and their babies.  The Strategy will ensure that our services are in accordance with best available national and international evidence. </p></reply>

The total budget for long-term residential care in 2014 is &euro;939m.  However, &euro;23m was transferred from the Nursing Homes Support Scheme at the beginning of 2014 to provide additional community services, with a view to allowing more older people to be supported in their own homes and communities for longer.  With this extra funding for community services, the HSE is currently developing far more intensive home care packages to keep more dependent people at home.  This initiative is in addition to the budget of &euro;315m already provided for home care packages and home help services.</p><p>  The funding  available for the Scheme is already stretched to meet the needs of the residential sector and there is no scope to expand the Scheme to cover home care supports. However the Scheme is currently the subject of a Review which will consider the case for applying a similar funding model to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health).  It is expected that the Review will be completed in the coming months and a report will then be made publicly available.  As the Scheme is statutory based, the implementation of any recommendations arising from the review may require amendments to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009.</p></reply>

I have had no role in this matter which is one for the HSE and it would be inappropriate for me to intervene regardless of political pressure or lobbying.  I hope you can understand and respect why that is. </p><p>  With regard to this case, I understand from the HSE that her indemnity has been suspended temporarily due to specific and serious concerns expressed by other clinical staff about patient safety.  When the HSE suspends an individual as precautionary measure subject to a review/investigation, it does not do so lightly.  An overall competence and performance review is planned.  I hope this be done as expediently as possible. </p><p>  On the broader issue, pregnancy is not a disease but a physiological condition and there is no reason why women with a normal pregnancy, should not have their baby delivered at home by a community midwife or in a midwife-led unit.  It should be a mother&rsquo;s choice within safe guidelines.  This will form part of the general review of maternity services being carried out over the course of the next twelve months. </p></reply>

The profession of social worker is one of the designated professions. <br/><br/>Applicants for registration with a Registration Board must satisfy the conditions set out in Section 38 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  This includes possession of an approved qualification.An approved qualification includes:<br/><br/>(i) a qualification awarded in the State that has been approved by bye-law or <br/><br/>(ii) a non-Irish qualification that the relevant registration board decides attests to a standard of proficiency corresponding to that attested by the qualifications approved by the bye-law. <br/><br/>In the case of the profession of social worker, the Approved Qualifications for Social Workers bye-law 2011 (S.I. No. 137 of 2011), has approved the following qualifications awarded in the State: <br/><br/>(1) Master of Social Work, University College Cork;<br/><br/>(2) Postgraduate Diploma in Social Work Studies, University College Cork;<br/><br/>(3) Masters of Social Science (Social Work), University College Dublin;<br/><br/>(4) Graduate Diploma in Social Work, University College Dublin;<br/><br/>(5) Masters in Social Work, University of Dublin, Trinity College;<br/><br/>(6) Postgraduate Diploma in Social Work, University of Dublin, Trinity College;<br/><br/>(7) Masters in Social Work, National University of Ireland Galway;<br/><br/>(8) Bachelor of Social Work, University College Cork;<br/><br/>(9) Bachelor in Social Studies, University of Dublin, Trinity College.<br/><br/>Section 38 also provides that a person, who has not practised the designated profession for a specified period of time, must satisfy the relevant registration board that he or she has met criteria and fulfilled conditions specified by bye-law.  This is to provide that registrants are up-to-date in their professional practice.  <br/><br/>In the case of non-Irish professional qualifications, the processes of the general system of Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of  professional qualifications  are applied to the qualifications of both EEA and non-EEA  nationals.  This provides for an assessment on a case-by-case basis of the professional qualifications of an applicant against those required to practise in Ireland (i.e. the qualifications approved under bye law) and for the  imposition of a compensation measure -the choice between a Period of Adaptation (a placement of up to three years) or an Aptitude Test if deficits in the applicant&rsquo;s professional training and  post-qualification professional experience are identified.  <br/><br/>My Department is advised by CORU that it has no record of communication with the person whose details have been provided.  If she wishes to apply for registration, she should contact the Social Workers Registration Board at www.coru.ie, telephone 01 2933160.</p></reply>

The research programme uses economic analysis to explore issues in relation to health services and health spending as well as population health. The analysis is informed by the international literature and Irish evidence and has the potential to:</p><p>  - assess the economic implications of policy choices in the design of the Government&rsquo;s programme of healthcare reform;</p><p>  - assist in the design of services to meet the challenges posed by changing health behaviours;</p><p>  - improve the cost effectiveness of health spending; and,</p><p>  - provide advice in a timely manner to inform policy development and discussion.</p><p>  The immediate priority of the ESRI research programme is to examine the cost implications of a change to a multi-payer, universal health insurance model, as proposed in the White Paper on Universal Health Insurance.  This analysis will include: analysis of total healthcare spending in Ireland and of recent trends in that spending; examination of the potential effects of changes to the systems of eligibility and financing on the composition of healthcare spending;  a review of evidence from the literature on the effects on healthcare spending of alternative systems of financing and of changes in financing methods and entitlements; and an examination of potential effects on Irish healthcare spending and demand of  the introduction of alternative financing methods, with a particular focus on the proposals in the White Paper.  </p><p>  I have asked the ESRI to provide initial costings by the end of first quarter 2015.  However, this work will continue beyond that date to further develop a model which is capable of providing a dynamic analysis of the effects of changing the system of financing the healthcare system.  The ESRI is working closely with my Department, the Health Insurance Authority and the HSE on this costing exercise.</p></reply>

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme.  </p><p>  Having examined the possibility of first introducing a GP service based on having a particular medical condition, this was found to be likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic for a short-term arrangement, given the commitment to providing a universal GP service for all.  Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness.  The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public.  This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions. </p><p>  As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition.  While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments.  The view was then taken that this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what would have been only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population.  The Government having considered this matter, announced, in Budget 2014, it's decision to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service for the entire population by initially providing all children under 6 years with access to a GP service without fees. </p><p>  The Health (General Practitioner Service) Act 2014, which provides an entitlement for all children aged under 6 to a GP service without fees, was passed by the Oireachtas in July 2014.  The Government has decided to prioritise the over 70&rsquo;s in the next phase of the roll-out of universal GP care.  The Government has approved the drafting of a Bill to provide a GP service without fees for all persons aged 70 years and over. Drafting of the Bill has commenced and is the subject on ongoing interaction between the Department and the Attorney-General&rsquo;s Office and I anticipate the Bill will be published in the near future.  The objective is to have universal GP care without fees for these 2 phases in place in the coming months, subject to the conclusion of the present discussions between the Department of Health, the HSE and the IMO and the completion of a fee-setting process.</p></reply>

Services are provided by contracted dentists. There are no waiting lists for these services. <br/><br/>Dental services for children up to 16 years of age and persons of all ages with special needs are provided by the Public Dental Service of the HSE through its dental clinics. All HSE dental clinics prioritise emergency care for children up to 16 years of age, treatment for special needs patients and screening of children aged from 11 to 13 years, including referral for orthodontic services where necessary. Other services, including screening of children 6 to 8 years, are provided but may be deferred in clinics where there is pressure on resources. Some patients have specialist treatment needs. Waiting times vary based on referral type and needs of patients.  <br/><br/>The HSE provides orthodontic treatment to those who have been assessed and referred for treatment before their 16th birthday.  It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need are provided with treatment by the HSE. Information on waiting times is collated by the HSE by region and for the intervals as shown below.  The most recent information on assessment and treatment waiting lists relates to the second quarter of 2014.<table><tr><th>Waiting time for assessment </th><th>1 - 6 months</th><th>7 - 12 months </th><th>13 - 24 months</th><th>&amp;gt;24 months</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster </td><td>2,030</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2,031</td></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin North East</td><td>397</td><td>556</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>953</td></tr><tr><td>HSE South </td><td>1,203</td><td>396</td><td>109</td><td>12</td><td>1,720</td></tr><tr><td>HSE West</td><td>1,606</td><td>268</td><td>62</td><td>18</td><td>1,954</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>5,236</td><td>1,221</td><td>171</td><td>30</td><td>6,658</td></tr></table><br/><br/><table><tr><th>Waiting time <br /><br />from assessment <br /><br />to commencement <br /><br />of treatment </th><th>1-6 months</th><th>7-12 months </th><th>13-24 months</th><th>25-48 months</th><th>Over 48 months</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster </td><td>1,133</td><td>779</td><td>1,060</td><td>1,261</td><td>87</td><td>4,320</td></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin North East</td><td>163</td><td>626</td><td>997</td><td>1,252</td><td>748</td><td>3,786</td></tr><tr><td>HSE South </td><td>650</td><td>439</td><td>946</td><td>1,333</td><td>9</td><td>3,377</td></tr><tr><td>HSE West</td><td>1,257</td><td>1,220</td><td>1,496</td><td>1,010</td><td>52</td><td>5,035</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>3,203</td><td>3,064</td><td>4,499</td><td>4,856</td><td>896</td><td>16,518</td></tr></table><br/><br/>The Government has decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet fiscal and budgetary targets.  The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction.  The recruitment embargo or moratorium has achieved substantial reductions in employment in the public health service and the number of staff employed by the health service has reduced from 111,770  whole time equivalents (WTEs) at the end of March 2009 to 99,959 (WTEs) at the end of December 2013, a reduction of 10.6% or over 11,800 WTEs. The recruitment moratorium and staff on long term leave is impacting on waiting lists in some areas. At present the HSE is considering a number of options to tackle waiting lists where they are problematic. These include skills mix and procurement of services. </p></reply>

In the area of treatment and rehabilitation, the focus is on providing opportunities for people to progress from drug dependence to a drug-free life where that is achievable. </p><p>  In recent years, the HSE has reoriented its services to develop a comprehensive service capable of dealing with all substances in order to respond to current patterns of drug misuse, in particular, the increased incidence of polydrug use. Considerable success has been achieved with a marked reduction in waiting times for access to addiction services particularly outside Dublin. More detoxification beds have been made available and opportunities to undergo detox in the community have been increased, and there are more places available in rehabilitation programmes generally. This work is being complemented by the refocusing of programmes to foster client progression facilitated by individual care plans and backed up by inter-agency working. Finally, there is greater provision of after-care to further assist recovering drug-users as they move towards a drug free lifestyle.</p></reply>

The key response is the establishment of an ex-gratia payment scheme, which will cost around &euro;34million.  In addition, there is a commitment to the continued provision of medical services, including medical cards for the women.<br/><br/>This followed Government&rsquo;s examination of a report carried out by Professor Oonagh Walsh, on <i>Practice of Symphysiotomy in Ireland, between 1944 and 1984</i>;<i></i>and<i></i>an <i>Independent Review of Issues relating to Symphysiotomy</i>by Judge Yvonne Murphy which advised Government, inter alia, on the relative liabilities of insurers, indemnifiers and/or other parties in relation to symphysiotomy and on the merits and costs of proceeding with an ex gratia scheme relative to allowing the court process to proceed.  <br/><br/>Judge Murphy outlined the case for a scheme in her report and her recommendations on levels of awards were accepted by Government.  Subsequently, I asked Judge Murphy to draw up a detailed draft scheme. I have consulted through the summer with the Judge and have also been speaking to relevant parties about the proposed scheme.  Judge Murphy submitted her more detailed proposal to me on 11 September, setting out how the scheme should operate.  In this context I met the support groups representing women who have undergone symphysiotomy on 19 September.  I wanted to hear from the support groups how they hope the scheme will operate, and to confirm to them that the scheme will be established as quickly as possible.  Two of the groups (Patient Focus and Survivors of Symphysiotomy Limited) have welcomed the establishment of an ex-gratia scheme. The third group (Survivors of Symphysiotomy) has advised women to reject the scheme. I hope that when the women see the details of the scheme and the efforts made to ensure it is person-centred, simple and non-adversarial many of them will opt to join the scheme.<br/><br/>Key aspects of the proposed scheme include:<br/><br/>- Women who had a surgical symphysiotomy in the State between the years 1940 and 1990 may apply in accordance with, and subject to the terms of the scheme.<br/><br/>- The scheme will be run by an independent Assessor.  If women have questions on any aspect of the scheme, the Assessor or secretariat, will be available to assist.<br/><br/>- The scheme will be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial. It will allow women to have legal and other advice available to them in preparing to submit an application.  It will result in awards of between &euro;50,000 and &euro;150,000 for the women.<br/><br/>- Women who have had a surgical symphysiotomy and have medical evidence to prove it may accept an award of &euro;50,000 without further assessment. If no medical records are available a medical assessment will be carried out.<br/><br/>- For those who wish to apply for higher awards (&euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000)  a medical assessment may be necessary if up to date medical records are not available, or if the Assessor decides this is needed for final determination of the award.<br/><br/>- Women will not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a pre-condition to participating in the scheme.  Women may opt out at any stage in application and assessment process, up to the time of accepting their awards.  However, on accepting the offer of the award under the Scheme, women will have to agree to discontinue their legal proceedings against any party arising out of their symphysiotomy.<br/><br/>- The details concerning the scheme and its commencement date will be advertised in national and other media, as decided by the Assessor.  <br/><br/>I intend to finalise the details of the scheme shortly and will bring a Memorandum to Government requesting approval to appoint an Assessor for the scheme instead of it being administered by the State Claims Agency and to a small number of other amendments to the Government decision of last July.<br/><br/>While I am aware of the comments made by the UN Human Rights Committee, the Government believes that the establishment of this scheme is a fair and appropriate response. In agreeing to the ex-gratia scheme, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to trying to bring a resolution for the women concerned. The Government has acknowledged the pain and suffering which the procedure caused to many of the women and is aware also of  the uphill battle many of them will face in the courts with uncertainty about the outcome of that process.</p></reply>

These include special education home tuition, the provision of supplemental learning support/resource teaching support on a needs basis and the provision of Special Needs Assistants (SNA) support if required.  Furthermore, reasonable accommodations, including special examination centres and rest breaks were provided for students who sat state exams in June this year.  Similar arrangements will be available on a needs basis to students sitting state exams in future years.

I welcome the fact that the process will allow for the many different groups in Scottish society to express their views. I hope that all parts of Scottish society can come together in a constructive and inclusive way in shaping Scotland&rsquo;s future within the UK.</p><p>  This Government is in close contact with London, Edinburgh and other devolved administrations as discussions proceed on enhanced devolution for Scotland and, indeed, on the political changes across the UK outlined by Prime Minister Cameron on 18 September.  Devolution of further powers in Northern Ireland will be an issue for discussion between the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government taking account of the framework of the Good Friday Agreement. </p><p>  The further devolution of powers to Scotland and the political changes outlined by Prime Minster Cameron do of course have political and policy implications for Ireland, North and South. It will take time to tease out these political and policy implications with all stakeholders, on these islands and within the European Union.</p><p>  The Good Friday Agreement set as a key objective the promotion of the harmonious and mutually beneficial development of the totality of relationships among the peoples of these islands. The commitment in that agreement to partnership, equality and mutual respect as the basis of relationships within Northern Ireland, between North and South and between these islands is as important today as it ever was. </p></reply>

Further humanitarian and reconstruction aid to Gaza will be discussed at an international conference in Cairo on 12 October, which I will attend.</p><p>  I have not been in contact with Prime Minister Netanyahu or Foreign Minister Liberman following the cessation of the conflict.</p><p>  I have met and spoken with the Israeli Ambassador on a number of occasions throughout the recent Gaza crisis, and asked him to convey to his Government our serious concerns about the extent of Israeli military actions in Gaza, which in our view were disproportionate and could not be justified. The same messages were conveyed directly to the Israeli authorities by our Ambassador in Tel Aviv, and in public statements at the UN Human Rights Council and during the special Seanad &Eacute;ireann debate which I addressed on 31 July. Since the ceasefire I have emphasised, notably in my address to the UN General Assembly last month, that unless the ceasefire is followed by political discussions to achieve a lasting arrangement involving the end of the blockade and an end to missile attacks, the recent dreadful conflict will soon recur.</p></reply>

Implementing outstanding elements of the Good Friday Agreement is a priority for the Government. Among the elements yet to be implemented are the establishment of a North South Consultative Forum, a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland and an Irish Language Act. The Government&rsquo;s priority remains to ensure that the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement function effectively to the benefit of all.</p><p>  Since the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland is a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive and in particular of the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms. Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA.  The Government continues to follow developments closely in relation to the proposed Act, as well as the overall enhancement and protection of the Irish Language in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  The Good Friday Agreement also provided for the establishment of an independent civic Forum representative of civil society in Northern Ireland. The St Andrews Agreement provided further that the Northern Ireland Executive would support the establishment of an independent North/South Consultative Forum.  In September 2008, the Irish Government submitted proposals for the role, format, membership and operation of a North South Consultative Forum to the Executive for its consideration, and facilitated three consultative conferences, the most recent of which was in January 2011.  The Government awaits a response from the Executive.  We have since raised the Forum at each Plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council and it was on the agenda for the plenary meeting of 3 October 2014.</p><p>  A Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland drawn up by agreement between the main parties of the Assembly could set out precisely and formally the rights underpinning a reconciled society in Northern Ireland. Officials of my Department keep in ongoing contact with representatives of civil society on the issue of a Bill of Rights. </p><p>  I will continue to press the importance of implementing outstanding elements of the Agreement in my discussions with the British Government and Northern Ireland Executive.  Officials in my Department will continue to monitor these matters in their ongoing contacts with the Northern Ireland Office and with officials of the Northern Ireland Executive.</p></reply>

Arrangements under which permission is granted for US military aircraft to land at Irish airports are governed by strict conditions.  These include stipulations that the aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and must not engage in intelligence gathering, and that the flights in question must not form any part of military exercises or operations.</p><p>  Under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, the carriage of weapons on commercial aircraft through Irish airspace and airports is prohibited unless an exemption has been obtained in advance from the Minister for Transport.  Ireland has made overflight and landing facilities at Shannon airport available to the United States for well over 50 years.  In relation to the transit of US troops through that airport, the Deputy will be aware that the majority of these personnel are carried on chartered civilian aircraft.  The carriage of personal weapons by US military personnel on board chartered aircraft in transit through Shannon airport is subject to the issuance of an exemption under the 1973 Order in respect of each individual flight.  The US authorities are aware of the requirement that all carriers are obliged to seek permission for the transit of these weapons through Irish airports.</p><p>  Dr. Horgan&rsquo;s 2003 High Court action failed because Mr. Justice Kearns found that, under the Constitution, generally recognised principles of international law do not create individual rights that can be enforced in the Irish courts.  Accordingly, while Judge Kearns made observations on the customary international law of neutrality, these were not relevant to the outcome of the case.</p><p>  The Government remains fully committed to the policy of military neutrality followed by successive Irish Governments, the central feature of which has been our non-membership of military alliances.  Ireland is not, and has never been, politically or ideologically neutral, as successive Governments have been of the view that proactive engagement is required to address challenges to global peace and stability.  Ireland is firmly committed to playing a positive and constructive role in the prevention and management of conflict.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the arrangements relating to the transit of US military personnel and landing of US military aircraft at Shannon airport does not challenge or undermine this policy in any way.</p></reply>

We can be proud that Ireland has contributed our full financial share to both of the main elements of the debt relief framework, namely the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).</p><p>  Malawi became a partner country for Ireland in 2007 and our aid budget in 2013 amounted to some &euro;19.5 million. Our current country strategy for Malawi links the crucial issues of food, nutrition and good governance with a focus on those communities most vulnerable to the interwoven challenges of poverty, hunger and climate change.</p><p>  As highlighted in the Department&rsquo;s Africa Strategy, Ireland supports a number of important initiatives to encourage more effective and equitable tax raising models in Africa. Following previous collaboration between the Revenue Commissioners and the Rwanda Revenue Authority, my Department is discussing a broader framework of cooperation between the Revenue Commissioners and our partner countries. This currently includes the possibility of bilateral collaboration with the Malawian Revenue Authorities based on their specific needs.</p></reply>

This support which enables the Palestinian Authority to build its institutions and provide essential public services to its people is critical to laying the foundations for a future Palestinian State. Ireland is providing a total of &euro;3 million in funding to the Palestinian Authority in 2014 in support of education and social development programmes.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s funding to the Palestinian people has traditionally had a strong focus on the education sector which is crucial to Palestine&rsquo;s long-term economic viability. Of the &euro;3 million total funding, we are providing &euro;1.5 million in support to the Palestinian Authority&rsquo;s Education Development Strategic Plan through a Joint Financing Arrangement along with a number of other donors.  We are also providing &euro;1.5 million to the Palestinian Authority through a mechanism overseen by the European Commission, known as PEGASE, mainly for the social development sector, enabling continued service delivery in the vital areas of health, education and social services.

Human rights and accountability form one of six priority areas for action.  The aim is to ensure that principles including non-discrimination, equality, empowerment and participation are integrated across all our development efforts.  In this way, we aim to contribute to the fulfilment of our international human rights commitments, including in the area of disability.<br/><br/>The recently released Framework for Action for <i>One World, One Future </i>aims to ensure effectiveness and accountability in achieving these policy commitments. To better address the rights of those with disabilities, the Framework identifies the need for the Government&rsquo;s overseas development programme &ndash; Irish Aid &ndash; to address the needs of the most vulnerable and consistently address inequalities in policy and programming.  It also identifies the need for a sustained focus on access to services, with a sharpened focus on reaching the most marginalised.<br/><br/>Through the Irish Aid programme there has and will continue to be a strong focus on addressing the needs of vulnerable groups.  We have provided support to a wide range of Irish-based NGOs, including Plan, Sightsavers, Christian Blind Mission, Children in Crossfire, to undertake work that specifically benefits people with disabilities.<br/><br/>Throughout our Partner Country programming there is also a strong focus on disability.  In Mozambique, Irish Aid is supporting NGOs to implement a project entitled &ldquo;Living without Limits&rdquo;.  In Vietnam, disability is one of the focus areas for Irish Aid&rsquo;s &lsquo;Civil Society Facility&rsquo;.  Under our Partnership Programme with the International Labour Organisation (ILO), a priority area of focus is on assisting people with disabilities and advocating on disability legislation in Africa.  Irish Aid support has facilitated access for women entrepreneurs with disabilities into mainstream women&rsquo;s entrepreneurship activities in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.<br/><br/>At the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly, Ireland called for an ambitious Post 2015 framework that can drive efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, reflecting the rights and priorities of the almost 1 billion people currently living with disabilities.  Ireland has successfully advocated for better and more disaggregated data, including for disability, to ensure that the Post 2015 agenda 'leaves no one behind'.  Such data can facilitate a clearer understanding of the relationship between disability and poverty and the barriers that disabled people face in fully participating in economic life.<br/><br/>These represent just some examples of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the needs of people with disabilities.  Through the implementation of <i>One World, One Future </i>and the associated Framework, the Irish Aid programme will continue to be strongly focused on supporting policies and programmes that eliminate exclusion, thus ensuring that the most vulnerable have access to essential services and opportunities throughout the developing world.</p></reply>

Our policy on International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo; clearly articulates our vision for a sustainable and just world, and sets out our goals and areas of focus for the coming years. The policy restates our commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA), when economic circumstances permit.</p><p>  Since coming to office, the Government has successfully managed to stabilise the budget for development assistance. This is a significant achievement, particularly in light of the difficult budgetary circumstances we faced. It is a clear demonstration of our commitment to the aid programme.  Since 2011 we have allocated in excess of &euro;2.5 billion to ODA, providing &euro;657 million in 2011, &euro;629 million in 2012, and &euro;637 million last year. For 2014 we expect to provide in excess of &euro;600 million for ODA.  These are substantial allocations of public funds and represent a genuine investment on behalf of the Irish people to assist those less fortunate than ourselves.</p><p>  The estimates process for Budget 2015 is now in its final stages.  As with allocations to all Government Departments, the 2015 budget for Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme will be framed in the context of our policy commitments and the overall budgetary circumstances we face.  The final allocation to ODA is ultimately a decision for Government, and will be announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on Budget Day next week.</p><p>  As the Deputy can appreciate I am not in position to announce next year&rsquo;s allocation but, as I have repeatedly stated publicly, and in response to previous Questions, I and the Minster for Foreign Affairs and Trade have made, and will continue to make, the strongest case possible for the allocation to the development assistance programme.</p><p>  I am determined to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme continues to be recognised as a world leader, focusing relentlessly on delivering real and sustainable results that provide lasting improvements to the lives of some the world&rsquo;s poorest people.</p></reply>

On 25 September, a High Level Meeting was held at the UN in New York to focus world attention on the crisis.</p><p>  The European Council considered the crisis at its special meeting on 30 August and called for increased response co-ordination across the Member States.  A comprehensive EU response framework is now in place and the EU has so far pledged &euro;180 million for the fight against Ebola, in addition to individual Member State contributions.  Foreign Ministers will focus on the crisis at the next meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council which will be held on 20 October.</p><p>  Ireland is also playing its part.  Liberia and Sierra Leone are the two countries most severely affected.  They are partner countries for Ireland&rsquo;s development aid programme, where we are providing a total of &euro;10 million in aid annually, much of it focused on supporting the health systems. We are also providing very significant funding for the long term development work of our NGO partners in both countries.</p><p>  We have provided humanitarian funding of &euro;350,000 directly to NGOs working on the Ebola response, and I recently announced additional funding of &euro;660,000 to UNICEF.  As a result of my visit to Sierra Leone, I have announced further funding of &euro;1.1 million for the management of two Ebola Treatment Centres in West Africa, one in Sierra Leone and one in Liberia.  We will continue to monitor developments very closely, and will examine what further assistance Ireland can provide, and how the effectiveness of the global response can be strengthened further.</p></reply>

I am appalled by continuing reports of other violent attacks and I remain seriously concerned by the security situation in Nigeria.</p><p>  The Government has given its full support to the clear demands of the United Nations Secretary General and the High Representative of the European Union that the abducted girls be released and that those responsible be brought to justice. The Government has also urged the Nigerian authorities to take all appropriate steps to protect their citizens and to accept international assistance to locate the schoolgirls.  While some of the girls escaped shortly after the kidnapping, it is difficult to confirm recent rumours that others may have escaped.</p><p>   The EU as well as several individual EU Member States, the UN and the USA continue to assist the Nigerian authorities in strengthening their ability to provide security and to combat terrorism. The EU is currently funding the provision of technical assistance to the Office of the National Security Advisor of Nigeria to implement and coordinate counter-terrorism legislation and crisis management structures and to develop capacity to address the problem of increasing radicalisation and recruitment. </p><p>  On 22 May, the Al Qaida Sanctions Committee of the UN added Boko Haram to its list of individuals and entities subject to targeted financial sanctions and an arms embargo. The EU has also added Boko Haram to its list of people and groups covered by the freezing of funds and economic resources with effect from 29 May. </p><p>  Ireland supports the decisions reached at the Summit on Security in Nigeria held in Paris on 17 May, at which Nigeria and its neighbours committed themselves to intensifying regional and international cooperation to combat Boko Haram terrorism. A follow-up conference was held in Abuja on 3 September. This process brought together Nigeria, its neighbours, the EU and other international partners to strengthen regional security cooperation in the fight against Boko Haram. The conference also underlined the importance of creating a secure environment in which the human rights of civilians in affected areas would be promoted and protected. </p><p>  Our Embassy in Abuja, working locally in cooperation with EU and other key partners, remains in close contact with the Nigerian authorities, which have primary responsibility for securing the safe release of the missing schoolgirls as well as addressing the broader security situation.  </p><p>  We will continue to support the Nigerian Government in its efforts to locate and free the abducted schoolgirls, to counter further radicalisation and terrorism and to promote full respect for human rights. Ireland has consistently supported the rights of women and girls, and in particular the right of girls to education. </p></reply>

In relation to sanctions, it is important to distinguish between the sanctions related to the dispute over Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme, and those related to human rights.  The sanctions related to human rights are limited and very focussed, and relate essentially to specific named human rights abusers.</p><p>  The broader sanctions which cover certain economic, financial and industrial sectors in Iran are related to the nuclear issue, and may be removed if and when the nuclear issue is resolved. I hope that will be the case. They were not imposed because of human rights concerns, and will not be removed because of progress in relation to those concerns.</p><p>  The Deputy will also note that in my earlier reply I stated that, while we are hopeful of a new and more positive dialogue with Iran on human rights, there has been little visible progress to date.</p></reply>

Although reaching a political resolution is a difficult challenge, it remains the best option and the only alternative to the further intensification of the military conflict.</p><p>  Ireland, and its international partners, are committed to working with the new UN Special Representative Mr Staffan di Mistura in his task of pursuing a negotiated end to the conflict. The UN will continue to play a central role in efforts to chart a political resolution to the conflict in Syria, in conjunction with the members of the UN Security Council and all relevant international and regional stake-holders, including the EU.</p><p>  We support Resolutions 2139 and 2165 on the humanitarian situation in Syria which were approved by the UN Security Council earlier this year and for which we had been calling for since last autumn. The latest report on the implementation of Resolution 2139 sets out very clearly that the fundamental obstacles to the provision of humanitarian assistance remain in place across Syria, and that the parties to the conflict remain in breach of international law. These resolutions make absolutely clear the obligations and duties on all parties, especially the Assad regime, to uphold humanitarian principles and international law. Full compliance without any further delay by all parties is the only acceptable response to their adoption. </p><p>  The growth of extremism and the threat posed by ISIS and other jihadist groups to the people of Syria and Iraq was extensively discussed at the UN General Assembly which I attended last week. As I made clear in my address to the General Assembly, there can be no complacency within the international community about the threat which ISIS and other extremists represent or about the need for urgent international action to confront this threat to us all. </p><p>  UN Security Council Resolutions 2170 and 2181 adopted in recent weeks require all UN Member States to implement comprehensive measures to address the threat of terrorism including through such measures as taking active steps to prevent travel by persons suspected of planning or intending to participate in terrorist acts; cooperation in exchanging information on actions and movement by terrorists; prevention of recruitment and radicalisation of possible members of such groups, including through community outreach initiatives, and denying financial transfers to terrorist groups; and supporting the provision of bilateral assistance to States in developing national capacities to respond to foreign terrorist fighters. The Foreign Affairs Council meeting which I attended on 15 August has also welcomed the provision of military support by individual member States to the Iraqi and Kurdish regional authorities at their request to combat terrorism, consistent with the provisions of UN Security Council resolution 2170. </p><p>  Ireland has so far disbursed over &euro;28 million in humanitarian relief since the beginning of the Syrian conflict.  The denial of access for humanitarian relief to the civilian population by the parties to the conflict is unacceptable and must end. So must such barbaric practices as besieging communities and attempting to starve them into submission.</p><p>  There must be full accountability for the very many horrific violations of human rights perpetrated against the Syrian people throughout this long conflict. We have consistently called on the UN Security Council to refer the many allegations of war crimes to the International Criminal Court and very much deplore the use of the veto by two Security Council members last May on a resolution calling for referral to the International Criminal Court. </p></reply>

In 2014,   some 398,000 people have been newly displaced in Darfur.  As a result of the ongoing conflict in South Sudan, large numbers of people are currently crossing the border into Sudan. In addition, during 2011 fighting between the Sudanese armed forces and the Sudan People&rsquo;s Liberation Movement- North erupted in South Kordofan and Blue Nile.  According to UNHCR, there are now 240,000 Sudanese refugees from these regions who have sought haven in South Sudan and in Ethiopia.</p><p>  Ireland is strongly supporting the efforts of the international community to provide a comprehensive response to the humanitarian needs of the Sudanese people. Through our aid programme we have so far in 2014 provided &euro;1 million to the UN - managed Common Humanitarian Fund for Sudan. We are also supporting a number of Irish NGOs working in the country.  Over &euro;3.3 million has been provided in 2014 to Concern, Goal, World Vision and Trocaire for  projects in conflict-affected regions of Sudan. These projects include the provision of food security and livelihoods, as well as health, education, and water and sanitation services. A number of Irish missionary organisations working in Sudan have also received support from the Government for their important work.</p><p>  Ireland has also been active at EU and UN level.  Most recently at the 27th Session of the UN Human Rights Council, of which we are currently a member, Ireland made a national statement on the Report of the Independent Expert on the Human Rights Situation in Sudan.  We share the concerns of the Independent Expert in relation to the increasingly difficult environment for civil society organisations working in Sudan.  We are also concerned about humanitarian access to a number of conflict affected areas.  The report notes that 160,000 children under the age of five have not received routine vaccinations in South Kordofan and Blue Nile States. Our statement to the Council strongly endorsed the call for armed movements in Sudan to facilitate humanitarian access to conflict areas. </p><p>  We are working with other EU members states to re examine the EU&rsquo;s engagement with Sudan from a political perspective, but also in terms of how the EU can best support the fight against poverty and hunger in Sudan.  I expect that the matter will be on the agenda for the Foreign Affairs Council on 20 October. </p></reply>

Enlargement is generally seen as one of the most successful foreign policy initiatives of the European Union. <br/><br/>In this context, we welcome the nomination of Johannes Hahn as Commissioner Designate for European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations and wish him well in his new role.  He has made clear that there will be &ldquo;no standstill in our activities &ndash; quite the contrary&rdquo;. <br/><br/>Accordingly, we hope to see active progress on the Enlargement portfolio during the tenure of the next Commission. <br/><br/>For Ireland, it is important to work intensively to advance the accession process with the current candidates and potential candidates, particularly with a view to overcoming the legacy of recent conflicts in the Western Balkans. <br/><br/>The EU enlargement process is founded on the Copenhagen criteria, which reflect the EU&rsquo;s founding values: peace, democracy, the rule of law, respect for fundamental rights, and a functioning market economy. Enlargement is a conditional process: prospective member states must achieve progress on reforms in order to move forward on their EU paths. <br/><br/>The European Commission actively supports the reform process by preparing annual country progress reports, which outline the extent to which the candidate and potential candidate countries have advanced to reach the necessary standard to join the EU. This year&rsquo;s reports are due to be published on 8 October. They will be examined in detail by all Member States, including Ireland, at official level, prior to consideration at the General Affairs Council in December. <br/><br/>As regards individual countries, following Croatia&rsquo;s accession on 1 July 2013, there are six candidate countries: Turkey, Iceland, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia and Albania. In addition, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo are potential candidate countries. <br/><br/><b>Turkey </b>was granted Candidate status by the European Council in December 1999 and the European Council agreed to begin accession negotiations in December 2004. Fourteen out of thirty-five Chapters have been opened and are now under negotiation. <br/><br/><b>Montenegro</b>began accession negotiations in June 2012 and twelve negotiating Chapters are now open, of which two have been provisionally closed. <br/><br/>The European Union began accession negotiations with <b>Serbia</b>on 21 January 2014, and since then, the screening process has been on-going. This process is designed to determine the extent of Serbian alignment with the acquis communautaire. A major focus of negotiations ahead will be on the normalization of relations between Serbia and Kosovo. <br/><br/>Association negotiations with <b>Iceland</b>remain suspended following a decision of the Icelandic Government in early 2013.<br/><br/><b>Macedonia </b>was granted<b></b>Candidate Status in 2005 but it has yet to open accession negotiations, pending a resolution of the name dispute with Greece.<br/><br/><b>Albania </b>was granted Candidate Status in June 2014. Ireland supported this step as a signal of positive encouragement to the Albanian Government, and the region as a whole, to maintain reform momentum.<br/><br/><b>Bosnia and Herzegovina </b>has not yet formally applied for EU membership and thus remains a potential candidate country. In recent years, Bosnia has been working to develop an EU coordination mechanism and to revise its complex power-sharing structures to facilitate the participation of minorities in political life. <br/><br/><b>Kosovo</b>has continued negotiations with the European Commission on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), the first step on the EU accession path.  The SAA was initialled in July and future steps will be further discussed this autumn.<br/><br/>Ireland looks forward to working with each country in support of their respective paths to EU membership. </p></reply>

The promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests overseas is vital to the recovery and development of the domestic economy. The Department is committed to using its full resources, at headquarters and through the Embassy network, to promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic and trading interests, cultural profile and reputation internationally. The work of the Embassy network is essential to efforts to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation and to drive economic recovery through the promotion of trade, tourism and investment.  The Embassy network is uniquely placed to influence key decision-makers and opinion formers around the world.  In the wake of the economic and financial crisis, the Embassy network has played a particularly important role in repairing and enhancing our reputation and promoting economic recovery.  In addition, our Embassies in the EU have played a key role in mitigating the impact of the crisis, through sustained engagement with EU institutions and member states, supporting the restructuring of the promissory note, the clean exit from the EU/IMF programme and the recent agreement on early repayment of IMF loans.</p><p>  In 2013, the Embassy network supported a total of 136 high-level visits with a significant economic or promotional dimension across 52 countries. The Embassy network also undertook more than 730 engagements to facilitate trade and investment supporting jobs in Ireland, as well as more than 660 specific engagements to promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic position to office-holders worldwide. Ambassadors and Embassy staff engaged with over 1,150 representatives of the international media to promote Ireland&rsquo;s profile and global reputation, and key messages on Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and its strengths as a location for foreign investment were promoted in opinion articles and interviews in the international media reaching more than 53 million people. Speeches and public presentations by Embassy staff promoted Ireland&rsquo;s interests directly to audiences of over 778,000 around the world.</p><p>  The Embassy network has continued this work throughout 2014. In particular, the unique promotional opportunity presented by St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day has been used to full effect to advance Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests. This year, our Embassies and Consulates, 60 percent of which are staffed by just one or two diplomats, helped to deliver an average of 17 promotional events and engagements each during the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period, across 133 cities in 68 countries, and supported 30 trade-focused high-level visits. The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, Ministers and the Embassy network promoted key messages on trade, tourism and investment in opinion articles and interviews in the international media reaching more than 23.5 million people. When overseas media coverage of events that were part of the high-level visits or supported by the Embassy network is added, wider audiences of at least 80 million people were reached.</p><p>  Our Embassy network plays an important role in the implementation of the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy. In priority markets, our Ambassadors chair Local Market Teams, which consist of representatives of the Embassy and State agencies that are present in the market and are responsible for the development of annual Local Market Plans. The implementation of these plans is reviewed by the Export Trade Council, which I chair, and which works to strengthen cooperation and coordination across all Government Departments and State agencies involved in the promotion and development of trade, tourism and investment.</p><p>  Recognising the important contribution that our Embassies and Consulates make to the promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests overseas, the Government decided in January of this year to open eight new diplomatic Missions &ndash; five new Embassies and three Consulates-General. These new Missions include newly-established Embassies in Bangkok (Thailand), Jakarta (Indonesia), Nairobi (Kenya) and Zagreb (Croatia), along with the reopening of the Embassy to the Holy See, and Consulates in Hong Kong (China), S&atilde;o Paulo (Brazil) and Austin (Texas, US).

Member States are resolved to do all they can to help facilitate an inclusive and negotiated settlement of the current conflict, and have actively engaged in efforts to promote dialogue between all sides, including the Russian Federation, since the outset of the crisis</p><p>  Ireland has previously welcomed the fact that the EU&rsquo;s relationship with Ukraine has been strengthened by the signature of the Association Agreement with Ukraine. I further welcome the simultaneous approval of this agreement by the Ukrainian Parliament and the European Parliament on 16 September. The Association Agreement is a blueprint for a closer relationship between the Ukraine and the EU based on common values, in particular full respect for democratic principles, rule of law, good governance, human rights and fundamental freedoms. The implementation of the Agreement will ensure progress towards not only peace and economic stability in Ukraine but ongoing reforms and the strengthening of democracy.</p><p>  Presidential elections were held in Ukraine on 25 May this year. According to the assessment of the OSCE/ODHIR, the election was characterised by a high turnout and the clear resolve of the Ukrainian authorities to hold a genuine democratic exercise in line with international commitments. The EU welcomed the outcome and encouraged the Ukrainian authorities to build on the legitimacy of the newly elected President. </p><p>  President Poroshenko has set 26 October 2014 as the date for fresh parliamentary elections in Ukraine.  The OSCE has confirmed that it will send an Election Observation Mission, comprising 80 long-term and 600 short-term observers, to oversee the election. The EU has agreed to cover the cost of 105 short-term observers, three from each of the 28 Member States as well as from EU candidate and potential candidate countries. Ireland is sending nine election observers as part of these monitoring missions.  We welcome this election, which offers the people of Ukraine an important opportunity to express their views clearly on their preferred future path.</p><p>  The EU stands by Ukraine in pursuing the process of reform ahead, and has reaffirmed the need for the Ukrainian authorities to ensure inclusiveness at all levels of government. This involves reaching out to all Ukrainian regions and population groups and ensuring the protection of national minorities in accordance with Ukraine&rsquo;s international commitments. In this regard, we encourage Ukraine to draw on the expertise of the Council of Europe and the OSCE.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme has always had a strong poverty focus and the new development policy &ldquo;One World One Future&rdquo; will strengthen that focus and adjust it to the changing context in developing countries. Our aid programme is recognised internationally as one of the most effective in reaching the poorest.</p><p>  Ireland directs the greater part of its assistance to some of the neediest countries in the world.  Approximately 80% of our bilateral assistance goes to Least Developed and Low Income countries and to Africa. Programmes funded with this aid are designed and monitored to ensure that our support reaches the intended beneficiaries.  They are appraised by Irish Aid staff using clear criteria, including quality of intended impact, sustainability and cost effectiveness. The programmes are subject to regular internal and external monitoring and are evaluated and audited by independent experts, as well as by my Department&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit. Qualified Irish and local staff manage in-country aid programmes and ensure that both financial and results reporting by partners is satisfactory. Having a presence on the ground in our partner countries ensures that the management of partners and the dialogue with partner governments are effective.  Programme monitoring visits are carried out regularly to assess that funds are appropriately used and programme objectives met.</p><p>  Robust accountability systems in Partner Countries are essential to ensuring that development assistance reaches the intended beneficiaries.  Ireland strongly supports the strengthening of these systems.  We provide assistance to national Government oversight institutions, such as the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committees of national Parliaments, to ensure Governments are held to account for the effective expenditure of public funds, including overseas development assistance.  Our own management and oversight systems are continually under review to ensure that Irish development funding goes to those most in need, and that we meet the highest standards of accountability.</p><p>  We will continue to encourage and work with all our partner governments, NGOs, multilateral organisations and others to ensure that they adhere to the high standards of accountability and transparency promoted by the Irish Government.  </p></reply>

Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world. We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official channels and non-governmental/civil society organisations. Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015.</p><p>  We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.  This includes support for the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedure Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. The EU regularly makes statements at these bodies on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.</p><p>  Since March 2006, when the UN Human Rights Council was formed, Ireland has engaged proactively with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism initiated by the Council. The UPR mechanism allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 193 UN Member States approximately every four and a half years, based on human rights obligations under UN human rights and other instruments. Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue (i.e. the actual examination of the State under review) and submit written questions in advance. Ireland was itself examined under the UPR process on 6 October 2011. The process enables UN Member States to raise issues, some of which would have been identified by members of the public and civil society, and to make recommendations about the protection and promotion of human rights in the State concerned.  Ireland has engaged fully with the UPR process and welcomes the open and constructive dialogue associated with it. We have also made numerous interventions during the UPR examination of other states, raising issues of concern such as gender-based violence, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly and the protection of human rights defenders within the State under review.</p><p>  The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law.  In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.  In June 2012 the EU adopted a Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.</p><p>  Ireland and its EU partners have been strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.</p><p>  Ireland has also consistently taken the lead in negotiating resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly and in the Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015, on the promotion and protection of human rights defenders, as well as on the implementation of EU Guidelines in relation to human rights defenders in third countries, the aim being to ensure that the latter can operate in an environment free from hindrance and insecurity.</p><p>  Mindful that the risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, the Government&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, Irish Aid, supports concrete actions designed to promote human rights, including strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions (in particular through legal training). Legal aid programmes targeted at victims of human rights abuses are also supported. Irish Aid, the aid programme operated by my Department, has a specific focus on governance in several programme countries.</p><p>  The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms and instruments with a view to highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.</p></reply>

Given the current political impasse, the British and Irish Governments have confirmed their intention to convene talks involving all of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s political parties and both Governments.</p><p>   The Government believes that the issue of dealing with the past should be addressed in the talks process, regarding which I am in close contact with Secretary of State Villiers, as well as on a wide range of issues relating to Northern Ireland.</p><p>  The Government continues to support the work of the PSNI in investigating the past and the work of the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland, Dr. Michael Maguire. The PSNI&rsquo;s proposal to effectively close the Historical Enquiries Team and the reduction in funding to the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s Office arises in the context of a difficult financial and political situation in Northern Ireland. However I am concerned about the potential impact of this decision on families who have already suffered so much as a result of the conflict.  The Government has consistently advocated that the rights of those affected by the conflict must be upheld and we will continue to do so.</p><p>  The Government remains fully committed, as co-guarantors of the Agreements, to supporting further progress towards reconciliation. Achieving a fair and balanced solution to dealing with the past is not easy, touching as it does so many of the unresolved issues in the conflict.  </p><p>  Notwithstanding these challenges, I am confident that a fair and balanced solution can be achieved. I will remain in close contact with Secretary of State Villiers, with Minister of Justice Ford, and with the Northern Ireland Parties on this matter.</p></reply>

Resources are not allocated directly to pupils. <br/><br/>  All schools have been allocated additional teaching resources to provide for children with special educational or learning support needs through general allocation processes.<br/><br/>  Additionally, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.<br/><br/>  The allocations to schools are likely to change each year as qualifying children leave a school and are replaced by qualifying children enrolling in the school. for each qualified child enrolling in the school, a new application is required so that the overall school's allocation can properly reflect the needs of all qualified children.  <br/><br/>  Schools who wish to make an application for additional low incidence resource teaching hours may make such an application to the NCSE. <br/><br/>  The NCSE are continuing to process applications for Resource Teaching support for the 2014/15 school year, where the necessary supporting documentation was not made available for the 26 March 2014 deadline.  Decisions in relation to the remaining applications received by 22 September 2014 are expected to issue to schools in mid October. <br/><br/>  I also wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education published its Report on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teachers for Students with Special Educational Needs on 18th June 2014. <br/><br/>  One of the principal recommendations of the policy advice is that a new model should be developed for the allocation of additional teaching resources to mainstream schools, based on the profiled need of each school, which will ensure that a more equitable resource allocation system will be in place for students.<br/><br/>  To assist with the process of considering the report recommendations, my Department has begun to gather information required to develop the proposed new model.  This will review how the proposed model will impact on schools.  There will also be full and comprehensive consultation with stakeholders and education partners, including the parents of special needs children.</p></reply>

The classroom teacher is responsible for educating all pupils in his/her class, including any pupil with a special educational need.  SNAs are recruited specifically to assist in the care needs of pupils with disabilities in an educational context.<br/><br/>  At pre-service level, the learning outcomes for graduate teachers, set out by the Teaching Council, encompass the standards of teaching, knowledge, skill and competence together with the values, attitudes and professional dispositions which are central to the practice of teaching.  They include the ability to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the role of teachers as educational leaders who contribute to creating and sustaining learning communities in their classrooms and in their schools, strategies for developing positive relationships and to communicate effectively with colleagues and to use appropriate class management and organisational skills to cater for a range of classroom situations. <br/><br/>  In addition my Department funds the national induction programme for teachers (NIPT) which provides an interactive workshop that focusses on the classroom environment and planning to support inclusion.  An integral part of this is awareness of the teacher's role and relationship with the special needs assistant in the classroom.<br/><br/>  My Department also provides for a comprehensive system of continuing professional development (CPD) for teachers in the area of special educational needs, including working with SNAs.  Central to this is the Special Education Support Service (SESS) which was established in September 2003.  The brief of the SESS is to enhance the quality of learning and teaching of students with special educational needs through the provision of CPD and support for teachers in mainstream schools, primary and post-primary special schools, and special classes.</p></reply>

Some 480 additional resource teaching posts were provided for the 2012/13 school year and an additional 480 posts have been made available for the 2014/15 year, in order to meet growing demand from schools for low incidence special educational needs support. <br/><br/>  No reduction was made to the amount of resource teaching time allocated to schools, per pupil in the 2013/14 school year, and no reduction is being made for the 2014/15 school year.<br/><br/>  There are now more additional resource teachers/learning support teachers in our schools than at any time previously. <br/><br/>  The General Allocation Model, which allocates over 4,200 Learning Support/Resource Teachers for all primary schools, is also now updated annually, based on the number of mainstream teaching posts in schools in the previous year, and is therefore updated annually to reflect growth in school size. <br/><br/>  Whereas I am not in a position to anticipate any future budgetary decisions or considerations, with regard to provision of resource teaching time, I can confirm that this Government will continue to do everything possible to protect the provision of services for children with special educational needs, and where possible to attempt to bring about improvements to services.<br/><br/>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education recently published its Report on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teachers for Students with Special Educational Needs.  This report is currently being considered by my Department and will assist my Department in considering how the resource teaching allocations process may be developed or improved for schools in the future.</p></reply>

The staffing schedule at primary level operates on the basis of 1 classroom teacher for an average of every 28 pupils.  More favourable ratios operate in DEIS schools.  Each one point adjustment to the current 28.1 schedule at primary level is estimated to cost of the order of 250 posts (&euro;15m). <br/><br/>  A significant amount of analysis would be required to provide an indicative estimate for the costings requested by the Deputy.  It is not possible in the time available, to undertake such an analysis. This information will be provided to the Deputy as soon as it can be gathered.<br/><br/>  Given the current budgetary environment there is no scope in the short term to consider improvements to pupil teacher allocation ratios.

As such it is the Council, not the Minister, that sets out the programme criteria.  Changes to the structure and content of the Gaeltacht Placement arose from the Teaching Council's new accreditation criteria, published in June 2011 (Initial Teacher Education: Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers) which provide, inter alia, for &quot;an extended and reconceptualised Gaeltacht residency which will now form part of the overall programme and be under the direct jurisdiction of the teacher education providers.&quot; <br/><br/>  The Teaching Council established a Gaeltacht Placement Working Group and published a report in May 2012 which, among other things, provides for the placement duration to be extended to take place in two blocks of two weeks and a common course content across all initial teacher education providers.  Initial teacher education providers have responsibility for quality assuring the content, teaching and assessment of the Gaeltacht element of initial teacher education programmes.  My Department supports the changes as contributing to overall quality improvement in initial teacher education.<br/><br/>  A decision was made to abolish payments by my Department towards the cost of attendance at Gaeltacht courses by initial teacher education students with effect from September 2012.  In making difficult decisions such as this, priority was given to protecting resources for front line education services as far as possible in the coming years, which is especially challenging with rising numbers of school-going children.  The changes to the gaeltacht placement grant were publicised in advance of implementation so that students would be aware of the new arrangements before embarking on Initial Teacher Education programmes. <br/><br/>  I can appreciate that supporting a student through third level education can be challenging.  However, I am not in a position to reinstate funding to this area.</p></reply>

Students who qualify under my Department's student grant scheme have the contribution paid on their behalf by the Exchequer <br/><br/>  I empathise with students and I am very conscious of the fundamental role played by the student grant scheme in supporting families who are putting their children through further and higher education.<br/><br/>  As the Deputy will be aware, the reality of our economic situation presents significant challenges that have to be reconciled with limitations on public resources.  This is a very stark reality, which, unfortunately, means that changes to any public service, including the student grant scheme, cannot be ruled out.<br/><br/>  For this reason it is the responsibility of Government to take into consideration all areas of public services when formulating Budget 2015.

It should be noted that some 50% of students who qualify for free fees have the Student Contribution paid on their behalf by the Exchequer under my Department's Student Grant Scheme.<br/><br/>  A 2012 Comptroller and Auditor General report noted that Universities and Institutes of Technology (IOTs) had cash balances of &euro;706 million at the end of the 2010/11 academic year.  When account was taken of restricted reserves and other capital funding requirements, and pension reserves, the cash balance for recurrent purposes was &euro;568 million which also included private sources of income. <br/><br/>  Due to the significant cash balances identified, a decision was taken in Budget 2013 to apply a reduction of &euro;25m to the sector so as to ensure a more prudent management of existing cash balances.  This funding was not restored in Budget 2014 as it was felt that the Higher Education Institutions still had significant amounts of cash at their disposal.<br/><br/>  The Deputy will appreciate that in line with normal practice I am unable to comment on the budgetary process.<br/><br/>  An Expert Working Group chaired by Peter Cassells is currently preparing a Report on future funding policy for higher education.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-07a.1130.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014100700075#WRX01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 471 to  475, inclusive, together.</p><p>  The purpose of the Home Tuition Scheme is to provide a compensatory educational service for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school and therefore it is generally the case that the tuition is provided at the child's place of residence. In the majority of home tuition cases there will be one child in receipt of an individualised educational programme on a 1:1 basis.</p><p>  A focus of my Department in the implementation of the scheme has been to ensure that the services which the Department pays for are delivered in line with the sanction provided.  My Department has no preference, from an educational perspective, in the delivery of the scheme for 1:1 provision. 1: 1 provision is not an educational feature of the scheme but is an effective consequence for these children, other than in the case of siblings, who are tutored in their homes.</p><p>  My Department has a responsibility to ensure that the funding for the scheme is managed and monitored appropriately.  To ensure that the funding is used fully for its intended purpose the Department specified in 2013, and subsequently, to parents of children, for whom the tuition is being provided in the home, that tuition must be  1: 1, again with the exception of siblings. This is to avoid the possibility that group arrangements would be arranged without the knowledge and authorisation of the Department.</p><p>  This is not a requirement of parents which have been approved for the group arrangements.</p><p>  Where parents of children who are eligible for home tuition have sought alternative arrangements to be put in place for the tuition my Department has responded and facilitated by putting arrangements in place with private commercial organisations which provide group tuition to children in a class type setting. Payment in these cases is made directly to the service provider and is calculated on a group rate basis.  My Department has no contract with these providers and therefore the question of procurement or tendering does not arise.</p><p>  The arrangements facilitate the transfer of home tuition payments, normally paid directly to the parents, to the provider and a reduction of the rates paid in recognition of the fact that the service is less expensive than normal, as the children are tutored together. The agreed group rate is not directly comparable to the cost of school based provision which includes teacher and SNA salaries, capitation and the various other supports provided by my Department, many of which, including capitation, are not available to the private providers referred to by the Deputy. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware home tuition is not an alternative to school and is provided in very limited and specific circumstances.  For children with a special educational need seeking an educational placement, tuition will be approved as an interim measure, until a school placement has been identified.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will assist parents experiencing difficulties in this regard. The arrangements in place with private providers are clear that where school placements are found for participating children the providers will support the child's integration into the school setting.  It is for this reason that the arrangement with the initial private provider was intended to be for one year only pending the roll out by the NCSE of school based provision.  However the arrangement has continued due to further requests from subsequent parents of children on home tuition to use such facilities.</p><p>  The Deputy has queried further to Parliamentary Question No. 223 of 30 April 2013, the reason the exception referred to in that reply was made by my Department for just one private commercial organisation involving the education of children with autism. At that time the organisation concerned was the only one with whom my officials had concluded an agreement.  Also at that point in time my officials were aware of other groups of parents of children on home tuition seeking similar arrangements.  Therefore there are now similar arrangements in place with other private commercial organisations which provide group tuition to children in a class type setting.</p></reply>

The overall value of the measure for the 2013/14 academic year was &euro;16.2m. The management of the Third Level Access Measure Fund rests with the Higher Education Authority and the allocation of funding for the sub-priorities in a particular year is a matter for the authority. </p><p>  The Student Assistance Fund is administered on a local basis by participating higher education institutions and targets those students most in need. The Fund provides financial assistance to students to contribute to the costs of participating in higher education and it is an important element of the student support framework in place. Typically, funding is provided for rent, child care, travel and general living expenses.</p><p>  The HEA approved in July of this year an allocation for the Student Assistance Fund for the 2014/15 academic year of &euro;6.6m. Each participating institution was advised of its individual allocation in advance of the academic year in order to facilitate timely planning and disbursement to students, and each institution has at this stage received 50% of their allocation in line with procedures for the Fund. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the reality of our economic situation presents significant challenges that have to be reconciled with limitations on public resources. This is a very stark reality, which, unfortunately, means that changes to any public service, including Third Level Access Measures, cannot be ruled out.</p><p>  For this reason it is the responsibility of Government to take into consideration all areas of public services when formulating Budget 2015. Ultimately, our budgetary decisions now will play a major part in creating a sustainable economy and in regaining our economic independence. As the Deputy will be aware all proposals made in relation to education expenditure including changes to student grants will be considered in the context of the Budget 2015.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that affordability is just one of the factors that impact on students continued participation in higher education.</p></reply>

This is on foot of recommendations set out in the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Policy Advice on &quot;Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools (May 2013) and the recommendations of the NCSE Working Group Report &quot;A Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs&quot;.<br/><br/>Following the publication of these reports, my Department advised that it would commence the process of gathering information which would be required to develop the proposed new model, to allow its impact to be assessed, and to assess if, and from when, the model could be implemented.<br/><br/>Part of this process involves the collection of information in relation to the social context of schools.<br/><br/>The working group report recommended that a school's social context should be used because it can contribute strongly to the level of learning needs that students have. The report considered that, on the basis of available research evidence, the use of a school's social context is valid in developing an educational profile, as socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with the incidence of certain types of special educational needs, including low achievement in academic learning and emotional or behavioural disorders. <br/><br/>The report also noted that a school within a disadvantaged social context may have a higher share of students presenting with emotional or behavioural disorders. While some of these needs are likely to be reflected in low test scores, others may not, as students with relatively high levels of educational achievement can have emotional and behavioural disorders. <br/><br/>Accordingly, it was recommended that consideration of a schools social context should form part of any proposed new resource allocation model.<br/><br/>In considering how a social context profile might be developed for schools, the working group noted that the Department currently holds information which underpinned the development of the Developing Equality in Schools (DEIS) schools programme. However, this information dates from 2005, and was not considered by the Working Group to be current enough to provide a social context component for any new SEN Resource Teacher/Learning support allocation model.<br/><br/>The group therefore recommended that a new social context schools survey should be conducted.Pending the availability of a more objective source of information, the working group stated that it was confident that survey reporting by school principals could produce robust up to date data on school context in a similar manner to DEIS and earlier initiatives.<br/><br/>The Department therefore, in conjunction with the NCSE, asked the Educational Research Centre (ERC) to conduct a survey of schools to assist the development of an educational profile.<br/><br/>It was considered that the issuing of a new survey was a preferable option to using existing data from 2005, or data from limited sources that may not capture the full current complexity of a schools school's make up.<br/><br/>Though recognising that all schools would not be able to have specific detail regarding all of the questions asked in relation to their pupil populations, schools were asked to provide their best possible estimates in relation to the questions being asked in the survey, in order to ensure that as accurate as possible a social context allocation component of any revised allocation model could be developed for each school.<br/><br/>At all stages of the development of the advice and in particular in the work of the working group there was comprehensive consultation with education partners and stakeholders and through this consultation there was awareness and broad support for the proposed approach including the deployment of a survey.<br/><br/>The data which schools were requested to return as part of the survey was non-personal, anonymised data. Schools were not asked to return data in relation to the social circumstances of individual pupils.<br/><br/>Schools were also advised that the ERC had put in place a dedicated phone help line in order to provide assistance and support to schools in completing the questionnaire. I understand that many schools used this help line to gain assistance in completing the questionnaire.<br/><br/>Whereas I understand that the return of this survey has caused extra work and some difficulties for some schools, I am confident that having up to date social context data will be highly beneficial to the Department and the NCSE in developing proposals for a new profiled allocation model for schools.</p></reply>

I understand that many schools used this help line to gain assistance in completing the questionnaire.</p><p>  The impact of a school not participating in a survey designed to assist in establishing a school profile is that it may be more difficult to establish an accurate school profile for that school, in the absence of data submitted by the school. </p><p>  I can advise that the Primary Online Database (POD) collects two personal sensitive data items on pupils from schools.</p><p>  These are collected on an optional basis only both of which require parental/guardian consent.  They are 1) pupil's religion, the purpose of collecting same is purely statistical, and; 2) pupil's ethnic and cultural background.  The purpose of collecting ethnic or cultural background is that this will help the Department to build up a more comprehensive statistical profile of the diversity of our primary school population.</p><p>  Data on the number of pupil who are members of the traveller community in mainstream schools is also required to pay the enhanced capitation for travellers to schools. </p><p>  Only the Departments statistics and IT sections will have access to this data. There is no impact on the schools if the information on religion is not returned.  There is no impact on schools at present if the information on Ethnic or Cultural Background is not returned, however, as POD has been developed to replace a number of data collections including the National School Annual Census, for the 2016/2017 academic year onwards, if pupils who are Members of the Traveller Community are not identified in POD the school will not be able to receive the enhanced capitation for travellers.</p><p>  Finally, I can advise that my Department also collects details of post-primary students enrolled as at 30th September each year. The number of students enrolled is used in the allocation of staff and funding to schools. The data on exam entrants for Junior and Leaving are passed to State Examinations Commission. Full details in relation to the details collected and the usage and purpose of these returns is set out in DES Circular 47/2010.</p></reply>

At a seminar in May of this year, my predecessor Deputy Quinn announced plans to commission one further piece of research in relation to DEIS which aims to collate all the evaluation work to date on the DEIS policy. This report will inform future policy development in relation to educational disadvantage, including the DEIS programme.

My key priority is to continue to prioritise and target resources at schools with the most concentrated levels of disadvantage.</p><p>  With regards to any additional schools joining DEIS, the current economic climate and the ongoing challenge to meet significant targets on reducing public expenditure means that there is no capacity to provide for the inclusion of additional schools in DEIS at this time. </p></reply>

Schools have autonomy in relation to the deployment of classroom teachers to individual classes. My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.). School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.</p><p>  The Staffing Schedule includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds. </p><p>  The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final. </p><p>  In addition, the staffing appeals process at primary level was extended for the current school year to allow schools that are not gaining an additional teaching post under the developing schools criterion to submit an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. This appeal criterion is targeted at those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places and so assist the response to demographic growth within their area and, as a result, are under significant pressure on their class sizes at infants level. Circular 0007/2014 provides details for schools wishing to make an appeal.</p><p>  The context for any discussion about class sizes is that my Department, like all other Government Departments, is operating within a budgetary programme that is designed to return the Government finances to a sustainable basis. This budgetary programme has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing some economic growth. It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth that will enable us to move to a point in future budgets where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about an improvement in PTR and class size. </p><p>  In the meantime, my Department's focus is on targeting any available resources to cater for the continued increase in student numbers across primary, post-primary and third level.</p></reply>

The focus under the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Programme 2012-2016 is on meeting the demand for additional school places. Consequently, there is no funding provided at this time in the 2014 capital allocation for the payment of a Minor Works Grant. Further, I cannot yet give any commitment to restore the Minor Works Grant on an annual basis.</p><p>  Funds transferred to schools under the Minor Works Grant must be spent on the physical infrastructure of the school or on items of furniture and equipment for educational use including IT related equipment. As the Minor Works Grant may not be used for items of a non-capital nature, it has no role to play in the day-to-day running costs of a primary school such as the payment of electricity and telephone accounts, the purchase of fuel and other current expenses.</p><p>  My Department has an Emergency Works Scheme whose purpose is to ensure the availability of funding for urgent works to those schools that are most in need of resources as a result of an emergency situation or on receipt of an enrolment application from a special needs pupil. An emergency is a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment, which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action and in the case of a school, if not corrected, would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.</p></reply>

The purpose of this period was to enable those English Language Training Organisations (ELTOs) which were ready to apply, and which had expressed a strong interest in gaining recognition for 2014, to do so through a revised and strengthened process.</p><p>  Providers were required to attend a briefing before making an application, and three such briefings took place during that period. I am informed by QQI that the briefings were held on 30 October 2013, 28 November 2013 and 9 January 2014 and that a total of 53 providers were represented.</p><p>  By 31 January, QQI/ACELS had received a total of 35 applications for recognition. As of 25 September, 5 of those applications had been successful, 1 application had been refused and 10 applications ceased due to closure, suspension or a change of circumstances post-application. The remaining 19 applications are still in process, with 14 of those applications being close to completion.</p><p>  With regard to the International Education Mark, QQI published its White Paper on the International Education Mark in May and published a draft Code of Practice, developed in cooperation with relevant stakeholders, last week. The final Policy on the International Education Mark and the Code of Practice will be published by QQI before the end of the year. QQI will begin to accept applications for authorisation to use the International Education Mark from English Language Training Organisations at the beginning of 2015 and higher education providers will then be able to apply in the second half of the year. Details of the application process will be made available when it is opened to providers.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act, 2012, sets out the legislative framework for the International Education Mark. The Act provides that the Mark will be authorised at provider level, rather than at programme level, and requires that providers will have to &ndash; </p><p>(1) agree quality assurance and access, transfer and progression procedures with QQI before applying for authorisation,</p><p>(2) ensure that their programmes lead to awards which are recognised through the National Framework of Qualifications (where they are capable of being so recognised), and</p><p> (3) demonstrate their overall compliance with the Code of Practice for the provision of education to international learners. </p><p>  Therefore, if the awards referred to by the Deputy are recognised through the Framework they would not prevent the provider concerned from gaining authorisation to use the International Education Mark.</p><p>  It should be noted, however, that authorisation to use the International Education Mark will not, on its own, allow providers to recruit non-EEA students from 1 January 2015. The regulatory reform of the international education, which I recently announced with the Minister for Justice and Equality, requires that the programmes concerned lead to awards made by Irish awarding bodies, such as the universities or QQI. Therefore providers will not be permitted to recruit non-EEA students to programmes leading to the awards referred to by the Deputy. </p><p>  From 1 January, eligible programmes will be listed on an Interim List of Eligible Programmes for Student Immigration Permission, and the detailed criteria for inclusion of programmes on that list can be found on www.intregister.ie.</p></reply>

One parent family payment (means tested) is also an eligible payment for the higher special rate of maintenance grant, subject to the other qualifying conditions. In addition, students experiencing financial hardship can apply to their higher education institution for support from the Student Assistance Fund.</p><p>  Many higher education institutions (including all of the universities) provide cr&egrave;ches or&mdash;in the case of some institutes of technology&mdash;childcare funds to subsidise students' childcare costs, thereby providing an additional element of support for students with children.

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support. To date, the NCSE have allocated over 10,900 SNA posts to schools for the 2014/15 school year.</p><p>  These details are available on the NCSE website, www.ncse.ie, and detail the allocations made for each school on a per county basis, including details of the SNA allocations made for schools in Counties Longford and Westmeath.</p><p>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

I would encourage all parties involved to use the appropriate industrial relations channels to resolve this current matter. School building projects which are funded from public moneys, including the school project in question, are required to use the forms of contract provided under the Capital Works Management Framework which includes a suite of public works contracts, standard conditions of engagement, model forms, suitability assessment questionnaires and guidance notes published by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). The OGP is an office within the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform which has been tasked with centralising public sector procurement arrangements for common goods and services.</p><p>  A building project is a complex arrangement of contractual relationships between the client, the main contractor, specialist sub-contractors, domestic sub-contractors, suppliers of materials, suppliers of plant etc. In general all sub-contractors employed on education sector building projects are employed directly by the Main Contractor or indirectly by the Main Contractor through other sub-contractors. It is a matter for all sub-contractors to agree terms and conditions and a schedule of payments with the Main Contractor as their direct employer.</p><p>  Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board is the Client/Employer under the Contract for the particular project to which the Deputy refers. While my Department is the funding authority for the project, it is not a party to the Contract and, as such, my Department has had no direct dealings with the Contractor regarding this particular project.</p></reply>

This is supported by the recent expansion of the range of evaluation models deployed by the Inspectorate, to include short, one-day, unannounced inspections, more rigorous whole-school type evaluations, and follow-through inspections.<br/><br/>In general, the criteria used to select schools for evaluation include:<br/><br/>- The inspection history of the school (date of the last inspection visit and, where relevant, the subject(s) inspected)<br/><br/>- Size of school (to ensure spread across small, medium and large schools)<br/><br/>- Data from previous inspections, including data from short incidental inspections, whole-school evaluations and follow-through inspections<br/><br/>- Nature of recommendations made during previous inspections<br/><br/>- Availability of inspectors with the necessary skills as, for example, subject inspections at post-primary level are conducted by subject specialist inspectors<br/><br/>- Medium of instruction (to ensure that both Irish medium and English medium schools are inspected)<br/><br/>- School management and patronage type to ensure that schools from each sector are well represented.<br/><br/>Whilst the programme of inspection includes schools identified through the Inspectorate's risk procedures as likely to benefit from external evaluation, schools at all levels of quality of performance are also included. This allows the Inspectorate to recognise, affirm and disseminate very good and exemplary practice across the system through the publication of inspection reports.</p></reply>

The NPPR Charge of &euro;200 per annum, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.</p><p>  It is a matter for an owner to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the charge. A number of exemptions from the charge are set out in section 4 of the 2009 Act and section 4(6) provides for an exemption from the charge in a situation where a residential property is occupied rent-free as the sole or main residence of a relative of the owner and the sole or main residence of the owner is either on the same property or within two kilometres of it.</p><p>  Furthermore, the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; in relation to a residential property under the Act refers to a person (other than a mortgagee not in possession) entitled to receive the rent of the property. There may, however, be situations involving an exclusive right of residence in respect of a relative residing in such a property. In such cases the owner would not be in a position to receive rent and therefore the owner in question would not be liable.</p><p>  In any event, under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect NPPR charges and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p><p>  All persons who are unsure as to whether they have a liability or not should contact their local authority as a matter of urgency.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the 2009 Act, as amended, provides that the owner of a liable property who fails to pa y the charge, in addition to him or her being liable to pay the Charge, is liable to pay to the relevant local authority a &euro;20 late payment fee in respect of each month or part of a month in which the Charge, any late payment fee, or any part of such Charge or fee, remains unpaid.<br/><br/>Part 12 of t he Local Government Reform Act 2014 also deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR Charge. The Act provided for a period from 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014 during which time no new late penalties were applied to existing liabilities. If payment was not made in full or if settlement terms were not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date applied on 1 September 2014. As the Charge applied in each of the years from 2009 to 2013, there were five liability dates &ndash; 31 July 2009 and 31 March for each of the years 2010 to 2013. In addition to this late payment fee to be applied per liability date, the entire NPPR liability is then increased by a factor of 50% and frozen.<br/><br/>A residential property not in use by an owner as his or her sole or main residence is liable for the Charge. This may not necessarily be a second home; a person may have vacated a property and be living in rented accommodation elsewhere for work or other reasons, for example, and, in such a case, the property that the owner is no longer living in is liable for the Charge, even if it is the only residential property that person owns. It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable.<br/><br/>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR Charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted. The guidelines, which are available at, encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner and include guidance in respect of dealing with hardship cases . It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR Charge liability from owners. In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by instalment. The Act places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority. All non-compliant owners or owners with queries should log on to <font color="#0000FF"> </font>or, alternatively, contact their local authority to discuss any matters they wish to clarify and to make any outstanding payments.</p></reply>

This will apply even where a water meter has been installed and will ensure that those customers will not be liable for additional costs arising from their medical conditions. <br/><br/>This is an inclusive approach and there is no list of qualifying medical conditions.  There is no requirement for the customer to state on the Irish Water application form the particular medical condition giving rise to the need to use additional water.  Customers simply need to request the registration form and information on special and priority services from Irish Water. Those who have already completed the application form but who did not request the additional registration form should make contact with Irish Water. <br/><br/>To ensure that the scheme is not subject to abuse, Irish Water may selectively audit a customer&rsquo;s circumstances, including requiring supporting evidence from a medical practitioner and it may also investigate instances of high usage to determine if there is other water use or leakage at the property. <br/><br/>This process will be in place for the first regulatory period which runs to end of 2016 and in light of the experience further refinements could be made.<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

My Department publishes a wide range of housing statistics, including historical data on social housing output since 2005.  These statistics are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:  <br/><br/>The main areas of social housing capital investment are the local authorities&rsquo; own social housing construction and acquisitions programme, the Capital Assistance Scheme though which funding is provided to the approved housing bodies, and the Regeneration Programme. Expenditure under these programmes for the years in question is as follows:<table><tr><th><div>Year </div></th><th><div>Local Authority Housing </div></th><th><div>Capital Assistance Scheme </div></th><th><div>Regeneration Programme </div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2010 </div></td><td><div>&euro;417.5m </div></td><td><div>&euro;113.6m </div></td><td><div>&euro;115.7m </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011 </div></td><td><div>&euro;189.2m </div></td><td><div>&euro;38.0m </div></td><td><div>&euro;117.0m </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012 </div></td><td><div>&euro;116.9m </div></td><td><div>&euro;58.0m </div></td><td><div>&euro;100.6m </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013 </div></td><td><div>&euro;83.3m </div></td><td><div>&euro;36.7m </div></td><td><div>&euro;69.4m </div></td></tr></table><br/><br/>These amounts are in addition to other areas of social housing investment, such as energy efficiency and retrofitting works; returning vacant properties to productive use; Traveller specific accommodation and housing adaptation grant schemes for older people and people with a disability. <br/><br/>Earlier this year, my Department announced some &euro;68 million for the local authority housing construction programme 2014-15, to deliver 449 new units of accommodation for people on housing waiting lists.  In addition, some &euro;46 million is being provided for approved housing bodies under the Capital Assistance Scheme, for the construction and acquisition by them of some 416 new homes for persons with specific categories of housing need over the same period.<br/><br/>Some &euro;70 million is being provided in 2014 to support the completion and advancement of regeneration projects at a number of locations around the country, including large scale projects in Ballymun, Dublin City, Limerick and Cork and smaller scale projects in Tralee, Sligo and Dundalk.<br/><br/>Capital funding provided for social housing is supplemented by current expenditure and the totality of expenditure on social housing from my Department is expected to yield in the region of 6,000 social housing units this year.<br/><br/>Plans in relation to the future delivery of social housing are now being developed as part of a new Social Housing Strategy, which will be considered by Government shortly.  The Strategy will contain clear, measurable actions to increase the supply of social housing, based on innovative solutions that will harness new funding streams, in order to continue to protect the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society.</p></reply>

Every meter is fitted with Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) technology which maintains a record of the reading at midnight on the last day of each month.  This provides Irish Water with an accurate month end / month start cumulative consumption on an on-going basis. A meter read at midnight on 30 September 2014 will be collected for each installed meter, and this is the &ldquo;opening&rdquo; read for that household.</p><p>  The AMR technology allows the meters to be read by Irish Water by scheduled drive-by reading.  During the period October to December 2014 Irish Water will read all meters installed to capture the September month end read.   In January 2015 all these meters will be read again to capture the December end of month read.  By capturing these two reads it will allow Irish Water to accurately calculate the consumption of a metered customer from 1 October to 31 December 2014.   </p></reply>

The Act defines the customer as the occupier of the premises in respect of which the water services are provided. It also provides, unless the contrary is proved, that the owner of a premises is also the occupier of the premises.<br/><br/>Irish Water is currently undertaking a customer verification exercise to obtain the details of customers in receipt of services from Irish Water.  This process gives tenants the opportunity to apply and avail of their relevant allowances and this will continue until the deadline date for applications of 31 October 2014.  After this date Irish Water has advised my Department that it intends to initiate a further campaign to allow landlords provide proof that their property is occupied by a tenant and that they are not the occupant.  This will remove liability from the landlord in compliance with Section 21(5) of the Act.  Irish Water has an ongoing engagement with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and will ensure compliance with data protection legislation. <br/><br/>The Act also requires that Irish Water prepare, for the approval of the CER, codes of practice on a range of matters, including standards in relation to the performance by Irish Water of its functions and billing by Irish Water of persons in respect of water services provided.

There will therefore be no water supply charge to customers in this case.  These customers will continue to be charged for their wastewater where they are a customer of Irish Water.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the existing arrangements for all non-domestic customers are remaining in place with no changes for the time being. On this basis, any arrangement charitable or voluntary groups have with their local authorities will remain, and the local authorities will continue to bill for non-domestic water services as agents of Irish Water.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water is responsible for public water services and that it shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation, the CER, which has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers of Irish Water.<br/><br/>In advance of the introduction of domestic water charges, the Government made certain decisions on 6 May 2014 relating to the structure of water charges including, inter alia, a free allowance per household and an additional free allowance for children on the same qualifying conditions as the Child Benefit payment from the Department of Social Protection. <br/><br/>As these allowances are to be funded by Government, Irish Water needs to ensure it has the appropriate and sufficient information to reflect these entitlements. Irish Water is a specified body under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended by Section 20 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014, and is therefore permitted to request Personal Public Services (PPS) numbers to authenticate the identity of the person being provided with an allowance. <br/><br/>Irish Water will treat applicants&rsquo; personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. In complying with these Acts, Irish Water must ensure that the data are only used for the purpose collected and must also ensure that any data collected are stored securely.  The collection of PPS numbers allows Irish Water to confirm and validate the entitlement to allowances for each customer. This information will not be shared with any organisation other than the Department of Social Protection for the purpose of verification, to ensure that each household receives the allowances it is entitled to, be it the free allowance per household or any additional allowance for children in receipt of Child Benefit at that address. It will also allow Irish Water to provide lower charges to owners who have unoccupied dwellings.<br/><br/>With charges effective from 1 October 2014 Irish Water is in the process of compiling the relevant data to ensure that customers can be billed accurately based on the tariff structure approved by the CER. Throughout the last number of weeks , Irish Water has been sending application packs to approximately 2 million households, which refer to the effective charging date and the fact that billing for domestic customers in receipt of public water services will start in January 2015.  The application process will enable customers to confirm their details for billing and, by providing the relevant PPS numbers, claim the allowances that they are eligible for. <br/><br/>Last week the CER made a determination on the water charges plan, submitted to it by Irish Water, which sets out the position if customers do not validate their details.  In these circumstances, a default charge which does not include the free allowances will be applied to such customers.  The relevant details of the determination are available on the CER website (). <br/><br/>Irish Water has an ongoing engagement with the Data Protection Commissioner and has advised my Department that it has been asked to provide clarity on some aspects of the legal language of its data protection notice as published on its website, . It has confirmed that this notice was, and is, fully compliant with data protection requirements. However, by providing additional clarity, it will re-assure customers that data are held securely, used properly and not shared with third parties, except where necessary for the delivery of water services such as contractors repairing leaks.  Any advice given to Irish Water from the Data Protection Commissioner will be further incorporated into its data protection notice.<br/><br/>Customers wishing to avail of the direct debit payment facility can do so by providing Irish Water with bank details on the application form.  This is optional for customers and in its customer handbook Irish Water has outlined several other methods of payment that will be available to its customers. <br/><br/>Management companies of student accommodation and businesses such as summer colleges are already categorised as non-domestic customers for water services. Local authorities, acting as agents of Irish Water, continue to bill such companies who recover this cost via the rent/fees charged for the accommodation, as is the case with other utility bills.<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

The approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a Water Charges Plan (WCP) submitted to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) in line with the provisions of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013.</p><p>  Following a recent consultation process the CER announced its decision on the Irish Water WCP.  The amount billed to domestic customers for the year 2015 based on the charging structure announced will be in the order of &euro;300 million.  A key component of the strategy to establish Irish Water is that Irish Water will be classified as a Market Corporation under EUROSTAT rules and as a result, will not, other than in relation to Government operating subvention, be included in the calculation of the General Government Balance (GGB). The Market Corporation Test is a requirement that income from customers be greater than 50% of production costs. </p><p>  If this test is not met, then Irish Water&rsquo;s borrowings would be considered as part of the General Government Debt. This would have implications for the overall fiscal policy and would significantly constrain Irish Water&rsquo;s capacity to accelerate necessary investment in public water infrastructure. The funding model, based on the introduction of domestic charges, provides for more sustainable funding for the sector for the future and will allow Irish Water, like other commercial State bodies, to access capital for investment from commercial lenders. </p></reply>

Irish Water has advised that the majority of leaks are underground on both public mains and on customers&rsquo; supply pipes, requiring significant effort and specialist technology to find them.<br/><br/>Water usage is monitored using district bulk meters (DBMs) linked to central telemetry.  Flow is monitored and collated based on usage patterns and population. Daily inputs are calculated for non-domestic usage, estimates for domestic usage, estimates for private side losses and the balance was referred to as &ldquo;unaccounted for water&rdquo; which was assumed to be leakage . This methodology underpins the leakage/unaccounted for water data included<b></b>in the annual Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) Service Indicators report.The most recent of these is the <i>Service Indicators in Local Authorities 2012</i><i>Report</i>, which was published in March 2014. This report is available on the LGMA&rsquo;s website at: <br/><br/>Irish Water is now collecting relevant information from each local authority and planning on a national basis.  Reducing and controlling leakage requires good information, expert knowledge, specialist equipment and rigorous management. The establishment of Irish Water has made it possible to take an integrated national approach and Irish Water is committed to moving to a proactive approach with the long-term objective of ultimately reducing public and customer side leakage nationally by over 50%.<br/><br/>The installation of domestic water meters is the first significant step for effective management of domestic water supplies by providing the means to quantify the actual volumes of water utilised in areas where meters are installed. This is allowing for a more accurate determination of leakage as actual data is being used to replace estimates.  The meters are also identifying significant customer side leaks. This in turn results in Irish Water being able to refine asset investment to the worst performing public mains.<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

The subsequent Independent Evaluation of the Planning Review Report 2012 prepared by Mr. Hendrik van der Kamp cost &euro;12,096.  The settlement cost to my Department in respect of the judicial review proceedings in respect of the Donegal part of the Planning Review Report 2012 was &euro;25,000.   </p><p>  MacCabe Durney Barnes Consultants were appointed in February 2014 to carry out an independent planning review on the performance of planning functions in six selected planning authorities (Carlow, Cork, Galway and Meath County Councils and Cork and Dublin City Councils) in accordance with section 255 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. This review is expected to cost &euro;76,000.  I expect to receive the final report from the consultants in the coming weeks and I subsequently intend to publish it having considered its contents. My focus will be in considering and responding to any recommendations made in the report and I have no plans to undertake any further planning reviews at present.  However, I will be bringing legislative proposals to Government to establish a new Office of the Planning Regulator, which will have a number of roles including the undertaking of reviews of the systems and procedures applied by planning authorities in the performance of their functions under the Planning and Development Acts. </p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. <br/><br/>The proposed approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act.  The CER recently held a public consultation on this plan which covered a range of issues relating to water charges and allowances.  The CER issued a determination on the water charges plan on 30 <sup></sup>September 2014 and details are available on the CER website (). <br/><br/>In making its determination on the water charges plan, the CER had to take account of the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water and a direction made under Section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 in July 2014.  This policy direction addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including the provision of a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply and a free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as for child benefit.  As the assessed charge is based on occupancy, Irish Water require information on the number of people residing at that address.  Therefore students residing outside of the family home should not be included in the application details for their family home. <br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.  They may be contacted via email at or by telephone on 1890 278 278. </p></reply>

I am conscious of the difficulties caused by rising rents and the problem of sourcing suitable accommodation, especially in Dublin and other urban centres. <br/><br/>Part 3 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 deals with rent and rent reviews.  Under the Act, rent may not be greater than the open market rate and may be reviewed (upward or downward) only once a year unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation that warrants a review.  Tenants must be given 28 days notice of the new rent and may ask their landlord to review the rent if they feel it exceeds the market rate for the property.  Disputes about any aspect of rent may be referred to the Private Residential Tenancies Board ( PTRB ).<br/><br/>The fundamental reason behind the rise in rents is a lack of supply.  Increasing both public and private housing supply is a critical issue and earlier this year the Government published <i>Construction 2020 - A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector</i>.  It includes a commitment to a social housing strategy which is being finalised and will be considered by Government in the coming weeks<b>.</b><br/><br/>In addition, the PRTB was asked to conduct a study to explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector due to rising rents and to report back to me with policy options.  This report, with a specific focus on rent stability, was completed recently and is the first of two studies on the private rented sector.<br/><br/>It explores a range of issues in regard to rent stability, ranging from an examination of rent regulation regimes to the tax treatment of the private rented sector and the role of rent supplement.  It will require careful consideration before deciding on the best options to address the current difficulties in the market.  The overriding objective is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.</p></reply>

Developments in the broadband market over recent years means that there is now a choice of commercial operators offering broadband services over a diverse range of technology platforms throughout much of rural Ireland, including the area previously covered by the National Broadband Scheme. Details of commercial services available in each county can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual operators.</p><p>   The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS). Following a competitive tendering process, my Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS. The Scheme offered a basic and affordable broadband service to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated rural areas where the extent of broadband coverage by commercial operators, at the time the Scheme was launched in 2008, was deemed to be inadequate. EU State Aid approval was granted for a scheme of limited duration. As a consequence, following a 68 month operational period, the Scheme expired on 25th August 2014.</p><p>  &ldquo;3&rdquo; have confirmed that, following the expiry of the Scheme, they will continue to provide coverage throughout NBS areas on a commercial basis offering consumers the same choice of Broadband plans and tariffs as those offered to consumers outside of the NBS areas. Furthermore, they have also informed my Department of their plans to extend 4G coverage across all of the NBS Coverage Areas within the next three years.</p><p>  The correspondence refers to customers previously served by the NBS satellite service, which was utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises. Digiweb, who provided the NBS satellite service on behalf of &ldquo;3&rdquo;, continue to offer broadband services on a commercial basis to these customers. My officials understand that Digiweb have recently contacted customers regarding an increase in tariff to rates similar to those charged by Digiweb outside of NBS areas. For this increase the majority of customers will receive increased download and upload speeds and a 37% increase in data allowance. A very limited number of customers affected by this tariff increase cannot receive the upgrade in speeds and data allowance as the technology deployed does not allow for an upgrade to their service. Digiweb have advised my officials that they are investigating a plan to transfer these customers to the newer technology.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s Statement of Priorities for the period 2014 to 2016 reaffirms our commitment to delivering a State-led broadband intervention in rural areas. Through the National Broadband Plan (NBP) the Government aims to ensure that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses in Ireland. This is being achieved through measures designed to accelerate commercial investment and the development of a State-led intervention for non-commercial areas.</p><p>  Under EU State Aid Guidelines Member States cannot intervene where commercial investors have plans to roll out services. A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department to identify those areas that require a State intervention. An initial list of areas has already been identified and includes 59 areas in County Kerry. I am also aware of extensive rollout of high speed broadband services in County Kerry by at least one commercial operator.</p><p>  As part of the mapping process, an initial stakeholder consultation on certain technical aspects of the proposed Plan was launched in June with a deadline of 15th September. 31 submissions were received as part of this process and non-commercially sensitive versions of these responses will be published over the coming weeks.</p><p>  I expect to publish the maps for public consultation later this year. These will include details of the areas requiring State intervention. The maps will be dynamic and will be subject to change if new commercial investments are announced in the future.</p><p>  A further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy will be launched in mid-2015.</p><p>  EU State Aid clearance will be required for the State intervention. My Department will be working closely with the European Commission on this important aspect of the programme.</p><p>  Finally, a detailed procurement process will have to be undertaken in order to select a potential preferred bidder(s) prior to commencing the roll out of high speed broadband services.</p><p>  This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government and for my Department. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in a sustainable and meaningful way. Our goal is to ensure that quality broadband services are available to all citizens regardless of where they are located.</p></reply>

On 8 October 2013, the Government approved the appointment of Capita Business Support Services Ireland Limited as the company which will develop, roll-out and operate the National Postcode System.  During the tender process for the project, the consultants retained by the Department evaluated a range of options for the postcode structure, including the recommendations contained in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee. After detailed consideration an approach using a unique identifier was recommended to Government by the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The postcode design and brand &lsquo;Eircode&rsquo; was approved by Government in April this year.<br/><br/>There has been widespread support from both public sector bodies and private businesses with particular interest from the retail and financial industries for the introduction of postcodes nationally. In addition, the emergency services see the introduction of postcodes as facilitating the speedier deployment of their services. An Post, who were actively involved in the design process, and who are fully committed to using Eircodes, are currently updating their mail sortation systems to fully integrate with Eircodes. Eircodes will facilitate improved efficiencies and quality improvements in the mails sector and provide a stimulus to mail volumes through improved marketing capabilities. The consortium developing the system has also undertaken a significant programme of business engagement with both private and public stakeholders.<br/><br/>Concerns have been expressed by a number of logistics bodies in connection with the Eircode, most specifically in relation to the non sequential nature of Eircodes. Capita, the Postcode Management Licence Holder, has met with a number of these bodies to discuss these concerns and to, <i>inter alia, </i>explain that a sequential postcode structure is not feasible or necessary. <br/><br/>Eircode is expected to be launched by the middle of next year.</p></reply>

Operators tend to exceed these coverage requirements for commercial reasons. However, given that mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by several factors including topography, the capacity of the network and more generally the quality of access customers have to mobile telephone antennas.</p><p>  ComReg's 2012 multiband spectrum auction has released additional radio spectrum which is expected to further improve the coverage and quality of mobile services. Since the auction, three mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile services and rollout is continuing. There has also been continued investment in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements.</p><p>  Local Authorities also have a strong role to play in facilitating the roll-out of the necessary telecommunications infrastructure.

The system requires a non-use declaration (off road declaration) for a vehicle to be made in advance of its motor tax expiry date thereby replacing the system whereby owners could declare the non-use of a vehicle retrospectively, commonly referred to as &lsquo;gapping&rsquo;, and thereby avoid payment of motor tax.<br/><br/>The Deputy's statement that the online motor tax renewal service does not work in the case of off-the-road declarations is incorrect.  Since 1 October 2013 non-use declarations may be made online, via the online motor tax website, .  Similar to the renewal of motor tax, vehicles owners use the Personal Identification Number (PIN) on the motor tax renewal notice to declare the non-use of a vehicle through the online system. The online service has operated successfully and in excess of 46,000 non-use declarations have been notified via that channel to date, over 35,000 of which were declared during the August/September 2014 period.  This represents 47% of all such declarations made in that period.</p></reply>

As a result the bulk of the Exchequer funding for rail goes towards asset renewal and maintenance across the network under the terms of Infrastructure Manager Multi-Annual Contract. Under this contract Irish Rail will be funding works on the  Dublin-Belfast line in order to protect the existing infrastructure and maintain safety standards.</p><p>  There is limited funding for enhancements and upgrades but some funding has been allocated for projects such as the Dublin City Centre Resignalling, which when completed would have the potential to improve  the Enterprise service.</p></reply>

They replace the 1994 and 2005 Guidelines and in doing so, reflect the outcomes of a number of State aid cases heard before the European Court of Justice.  Rather than interpret the Guidelines, each Member State is required to give their explicit unconditional agreement to their implementation.  Ireland has already done so.</p><p>  In terms of operating aid to airports, the 2014 Guidelines recognise that smaller airports may have difficulties in ensuring the financing of their airports and, accordingly, provide for a 10 year transitional period once certain conditions are met.  In addition to the recommendations arising out of the IWAK Study Group, the Department&rsquo;s draft Regional Airports Programme for 2015 &ndash; 2019, which sets out the policy with respect to State supports for regional airports for that period, also reflects the criteria set out in the 2014 Guidelines.</p><p>  That Programme, which is currently with the EU Commission for approval, does not contain a proposal to introduce an alternative transitional period to the one set out in the 2014 Guidelines.  It will be a matter for Government to decide on whether to put in place a follow-up programme beyond 2019 depending on the availability of resources.</p><p>  Neither the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) nor any other agency within the remit of the Department were consulted in relation to the preparation of the new Programme.  State airports are not included in the Regional Airports Programme and get no Exchequer funding.</p></reply>

The commemorations to mark the centenary of the Easter Rising will be a major event in a programme in place since 2012, commemorating the events leading to the proclamation of the Irish Republic.  These have included the introduction and progress of the third Home Rule Bill in the Westminster parliament, the formation of Volunteer movements, and the outbreak of World War I.  Economic and social issues were examined in 2013 on the Centenary of the 1913 Lockout along with the role of suffragettes.  This year has seen significant attention to the mobilisation in Ireland and across Europe for the First World War.  In the coming year, alongside the continuing experience of World War I, this commemorative programme will address the cultural revival in Ireland, which reflected the strengthening sense of national identity and determination to achieve autonomous government.</p><p>  As part of the 2016 commemorations, arrangements have been made for a number of significant capital projects.  These include the renovation of Kilmainham Courthouse to enhance the visitor experience at Kilmainham Gaol, the development of a permanent exhibition space and interpretative centre at the GPO and the development of visitor facilities at Teach an Phiarsaigh, Ros Muc.  The development of a Tenement Museum is moving ahead and I was also pleased to have been present last week at the announcement of the renovation works to take place at Richmond Barracks.  Additionally, a permanent visitor facility is being built at Cathal Brugha Barracks for the Military Service Pensions Archive.  Following on the inaugural online release of records in January last, the Minister for Defence last week released the second collection of files from this collection.</p><p>  An inclusive and detailed programme of events for the commemoration of the 1916 Rising is being developed with a view to having a draft of that programme available this autumn.  This will be subject to consultation with stakeholders before finalisation.</p></reply>

While this period is recognised as the nesting and breeding season for birds, vegetation such as hedgerows and scrub is also important as wildlife habitat generally and needs to be managed in the interests of both farming and biodiversity.</p><p>  My Department is undertaking a review of the current legislation to ensure that it remains both effective and balanced.  As part of that review, the position in comparable jurisdictions is being examined.</p></reply>

A number of the programmes are delivered through agencies and other intermediary bodies, which operate across county boundaries and in respect of which there is no detailed breakdown on a county basis held by my Department.  In addition, groups and organisations that receive grants directly from my Department are not necessarily constituted on a single-county basis.<br/><br/>In view of the wide range of my Department&rsquo;s schemes and programmes, and the large volumes of payments and grants thereunder on an ongoing basis, it is not clear that it would be feasible to compile and collate the breakdown of expenditure sought by the Deputy.  However, if the Deputy has specific queries relating to a particular programme or grant, I would be glad to seek to provide him with relevant information in that regard.  Similarly, if the Deputy would like specific information in relation to a particular scheme, I would be glad to arrange to have any such request from him examined.</p></reply>

Cultural events held in museums to attract a local and tourist audience, and/or to promote museums as focal centres of the local community, have also been supported through this scheme, which is known as the Local and Regional Museums Scheme.  Details of the 2014 Scheme and the funding awarded under it can be found on my Department's website at: and My Department has also operated a small programme to encourage the mobility of exhibits/exhibitions between National Cultural Institutions and local/regional facilities.</p></reply>
