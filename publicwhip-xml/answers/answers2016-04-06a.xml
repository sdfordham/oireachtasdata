    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-04-06a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016040600041#WRA00300"><p>A total of 4,661 census enumerators have been recruited for the 2016 census.  All recruitment for the census field operation was carried out by the CSO under licence by the Commission for Public Service Appointments and complied with their strict recruitment principles regarding fairness, equality, openness and transparency.</p><p>Applications for enumerator positions were taken on-line from 9am on Tuesday 5<sup>th</sup>January 2016. It was advertised in advance that applications would close at 5pm on Friday 8<sup>th</sup>January or once the total number of applications reached 15,000. Applications were capped at 15,000 for operational reasons as all applicants for enumerator positions are called to interview. </p><p>Regarding the criteria for selection, the role of census enumerator requires a good general education, ability to follow detailed instructions, and other skills such as map reading. The job also entails a significant amount of walking or driving, interacting with a wide range of people, and also working to very strict deadlines. As the enumerators are the CSO representatives on the ground they must also be capable of representing the Office in a professional manner, and be completely trustworthy. They should ideally have experience of dealing with the public, enjoy being outdoors, and be available to work between 22 to 25 hours a week over the ten week period.  </p><p>The CSO received applications from people in all situations &ndash; retired persons, the unemployed, homemakers, those in part-time work, and also people in full-time jobs. </p><p>All applicants for enumerator positions were assessed at interview.  It was not open to the CSO to discriminate in favour of any one group and many enumerators in the past have successfully combined the job with other part-time or even full-time work.  While it was not the only criterion used in assessing candidates, the availability of candidates to undertake the work was taken into account during the selection process.  </p><p>The table below shows the number of applications and enumerators broken down by county.  The CSO is currently compiling data on the breakdown of applicants by employment status and will make that available in due course.<table><tr><th>County or City</th><th>No. of applications</th><th>Number  placed on panel</th><th>Number  of enumerators</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td><div>179 </div></td><td><div>101</div></td><td><div>56</div></td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN CITY</td><td><div>1,341</div></td><td><div>784</div></td><td><div>594</div></td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN SOUTH</td><td><div>802</div></td><td><div>460</div></td><td><div>227</div></td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN FINGAL</td><td><div>891</div></td><td><div>538</div></td><td><div>240</div></td></tr><tr><td>DUN LAOGHAIRE RATHDOWN</td><td><div>710</div></td><td><div>468</div></td><td><div>198</div></td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td><div>765</div></td><td><div>515</div></td><td><div>187</div></td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td><div>306</div></td><td><div>204</div></td><td><div>94</div></td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td><div>263</div></td><td><div>174</div></td><td><div>78</div></td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td><div>166</div></td><td><div>106</div></td><td><div>43</div></td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td><div>383</div></td><td><div>227</div></td><td><div>122</div></td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td><div>679</div></td><td><div>418</div></td><td><div>164</div></td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td><div>242</div></td><td><div>158</div></td><td><div>73</div></td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td><div>285</div></td><td><div>186</div></td><td><div>88</div></td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td><div>471</div></td><td><div>279</div></td><td><div>156</div></td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td><div>417</div></td><td><div>255</div></td><td><div>133</div></td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td><div>444</div></td><td><div>296</div></td><td><div>122</div></td></tr><tr><td>CORK CITY</td><td><div>262</div></td><td><div>134</div></td><td><div>128</div></td></tr><tr><td>CORK COUNTY</td><td><div>1,095</div></td><td><div>694</div></td><td><div>393</div></td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td><div>410</div></td><td><div>288</div></td><td><div>167</div></td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK CITY</td><td><div>128</div></td><td><div>71</div></td><td><div>62</div></td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK COUNTY</td><td><div>419</div></td><td><div>213</div></td><td><div>133</div></td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY NR</td><td><div>230</div></td><td><div>152</div></td><td><div>74</div></td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY SR</td><td><div>248</div></td><td><div>172</div></td><td><div>96</div></td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD CITY</td><td><div>175</div></td><td><div>109</div></td><td><div>50</div></td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD COUNTY</td><td><div>244</div></td><td><div>153</div></td><td><div>70</div></td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY CITY</td><td><div>332</div></td><td><div>211</div></td><td><div>79</div></td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY COUNTY</td><td><div>643</div></td><td><div>396</div></td><td><div>189</div></td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td><div>200</div></td><td><div>126</div></td><td><div>38</div></td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td><div>576</div></td><td><div>391</div></td><td><div>144</div></td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td><div>285</div></td><td><div>211</div></td><td><div>67</div></td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td><div>354</div></td><td><div>221</div></td><td><div>74</div></td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td><div>248</div></td><td><div>156</div></td><td><div>79</div></td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td><div>612</div></td><td><div>395</div></td><td><div>180</div></td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td><div>139</div></td><td><div>87</div></td><td><div>63</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>14,944</div></td><td><div>9,349</div></td><td><div>4,661</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-04-06a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016040600041#WRA00500"><p>The coverage of the Census extends to everyone who is in the State on the night of 24th April and this includes all those currently experiencing homelessness. For the most part homeless persons will be identified by where they are on census night and this will be done by first identifying the establishments where homeless persons are accommodated, and then classifying all those within such accommodation as homeless. There is no facility on the census form for individuals to self-identify as homeless, so the above approach has been  taken to ensure not only consistency across the sector in terms of definition but also to protect the individuals involved.  </p>  <p>  In addition, there are at present some 500 families being accommodated in what is termed Private Emergency Accommodation in Ireland, namely commercial hotels and B&amp;Bs, which contain a mix of both regular guests and persons who are homeless. The CSO, in conjunction with both the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government and the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, have put in place specific measures to enumerate this group by appointing three special enumerators who will deliver by hand and collect census forms to each family involved. The enumerator will contact the families in advance, will explain the census and the importance of participating, and then make arrangements to deliver the census form. They will then call back to collect the form at a later time. Where necessary the assistance of other local homeless service providers outside of Dublin will be sought. </p>  <p>  The CSO is highly conscious of the sensitivity around this issue and the importance of protecting the confidentiality of the information of all those involved and will do our utmost to ensure that  not only are all homeless persons counted in the 2016 census but also that their particular circumstances are recorded. </p>  <p>  The CSO will publish a dedicated report on homelessness in Ireland using the data collected and this information will be critical to all those providing services in this area. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-04-06a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016040600041#WRA01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 128 together.</p>  <p>  Rent supplement plays a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme supporting approximately 57,600 people for which the Government has provided approximately &euro;267 million for 2016. </p>  <p>  There were over 20,100 rent supplement tenancies awarded during 2015 and over 3,000 awarded during the first three months of 2016 showing that landlords are accommodating significant numbers of people under the scheme. I fully welcome recent amendments in equality legislation which prohibits discrimination in the letting of residential property to people who are in receipt of a Rent Supplement or Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Department officials had engaged with the owners of the larger property websites in advance of the enactment of this legislation and progress had already been made in this area. </p>  <p>  Persons who feel they have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent may wish to contact the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission or make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  In terms of rent limits, the Department undertook a review of these limits in 2015 and found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply in the private rented market will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients. The Department has instead implemented a targeted policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits for both existing customers and new applicants to the rent supplement scheme. The circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits, as appropriate.  In addition, the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans underway to extend this to other urban and commuter areas. This flexible and targeted approach has assisted over 7,300 rent supplement households nationwide to retain or acquire rented accommodation through increased rent payments.  </p>  <p>  I believe these measures and the reforms announced to the private rental sector provide stability in what has become a highly volatile rental market.  I am keeping this matter under close review.</p></reply>

One of the functions of the CIB, as defined in the Comhairle Act 2000 and the Citizens Information Act 2007, is to directly provide or support the provision of advocacy services to individuals and in particular to assist those with a disability to secure their entitlement to social services. </p><p>One of the main ways in which the Citizens Information Board supports advocacy services to the general public is through its network of 42 Citizens Information Services (CIS&rsquo;s), where information providers advocate on behalf of their clients mainly in relation to access to public and social services such as social welfare, housing, health and employment. Information providers support their clients to act on their own behalf wherever possible (self-advocacy). They also advocate directly on behalf of their clients through contacting and negotiating with third parties or attending meetings, hearings or appeals.  </p><p>In 2011, the National Advocacy Service (NAS) was established under the Citizens Information Board to provide an independent, confidential, and free representative advocacy service to vulnerable people with disabilities who cannot self-advocate, while supporting others to use mainstream services. NAS is currently staffed by 28 Advocates and 8 Senior Advocates, managed by 4 Regional managers and a National Manager and supported by 5 Administrative staff.  It is worth noting that in many cases, due to the nature of advocacy work, more lengthy engagement is required between an advocate and each client, including those who have communication difficulties.</p><p>The waiting lists as of March 2016 are as follows &ndash;<table><tr><th>-</th><th>Greater Dublin</th><th>Midlands &amp;amp; North East</th><th>Western</th><th>Southern</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Cases awaiting assignment to an advocate</td><td>14</td><td>2</td><td>9</td><td>24</td><td>49</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In every case where a one parent family payment is awarded, the Department seeks to trace the other parent (liable relative) to ascertain whether he/she is in a financial position to contribute towards the cost of this payment. This does not alter an individual&rsquo;s obligation to pay maintenance pursuant to a Court Order. </p>  <p>  Currently, once the one-parent family payment recipient&rsquo;s youngest child reaches age 7, and their entitlement to the one-parent family payment ceases, the liability assessed under the liable relative provisions no longer applies. The Department advises the liable relative accordingly. It is important to note that this does not affect any other maintenance arrangements that may be in place. </p>  <p>  My Department has indicated its intention to review the current maintenance and liable relative procedures since the introduction of the one-parent family payment reforms. This work is being actively pursued. However it is a complex area that involves undertaking a detailed review and any change would require legislation.</p></reply>

The corresponding appeal processing times in 2015 were 25.9 weeks and 20.6 weeks respectively, and in 2014 were 34.4 weeks and 30.1 weeks.</p><p>The unprecedented increase in appeal receipts since 2009 placed considerable pressure on the appeals office and impacted adversely on processing times.  The overall number of appeals received increased from an average of 15,000 per year up to 2009, to a peak of 35,500 in 2012, reducing annually thereafter to just below 25,000 in 2015.</p><p>Significant effort and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeals process in recent years:</p><p>- Additional appeals officers were appointed to the office</p><p>- An overhaul of the operating model was undertaken</p><p>- New technology to support appeals officers was introduced</p><p>- Work was undertaken with the Department to reduce delays in responding to requests from the appeals office for appeal submissions.</p><p>This resulted in a marked improvement in overall appeal processing times. The average time taken to determine an appeal requiring an oral hearing reduced from 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 25.5 weeks in 2015 and the average time taken to finalise an appeal decided by way of a summary decision dropped from 25.1 weeks in 2011 to 18.1 weeks in 2015.</p><p>The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved. The system is designed to be flexible and fair and allows for review and submission of further information up to and including the oral hearing. The time taken is proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal, which require a high level of judgement and often involve complex legal questions.</p><p>A number of elements within the process are time-consuming including the need to ensure due process, natural justice and compliance with the statutory obligation to obtain the Department&rsquo;s appeal submission. If an oral hearing is requested by the appellant or is required to resolve conflicts, the processing time is prolonged.</p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer assures me that appeals processing times are continuously monitored and that, although significant progress has been made in reducing appeal processing times in recent years, continued improvement in this area remains a priority.</p></reply>

There were over 20,100 rent supplement tenancies awarded during 2015 and over 3,000 awarded during the first three months of 2016 showing that landlords are accommodating significant numbers of people under the scheme.</p>  <p>  With social assistance payments, including rent supplement, the maximum rate of entitlement is payable where a claimant&rsquo;s means are nil. It is in the nature of means tested schemes that where means exceed a certain amount, no entitlement exists. I understand that the person referred to by Deputy &Oacute; Broin does not qualify for rent supplement as a result of their means.  The assessment of means is a way of checking if a person has enough means to support themselves and what amount of payment, if any, for which they may qualify.</p>  <p>  Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances less a weekly minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. When a revised decision on entitlement has been made on a rent supplement claim, the person is informed of the decision and has the right to have the decision reviewed by the Department or to appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. Staff in the Department make every effort to ensure customers are informed of any change in entitlement in a timely manner. The Department is currently reviewing processes in this regard for schemes administered under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, including Rent Supplement. The combination of the means test and awarding differentiated rates of payment is premised on ensuring that social welfare payments, including rent supplement, continue to be paid to those most in need.</p></reply>

Mindful of the current and ongoing discussions on Government formation, any further development of policy will be a matter for the incoming Government.</p>  <p>  The current position is that the department has a cohort of jobseeker customers who are classified as casual jobseekers. These are in-work customers who can claim a jobseeker's payment for 2 to 3 days per week or who work week on/week-off.  These customers are paid by cheque each week. Not all customers will be paid every week due to their changeable work patterns.</p>  <p>  These customers have been paid by cheque due to the changing nature of their work/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue payments.  It is critical to note that they are not paid via post offices under the department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post.</p>  <p>  In line with the National Payments Plan, my department is seeking to reduce cheque usage in the economy; this is not only a matter of decreasing the significant costs associated with cheques in the department and wider economy but also of moving to a more secure method of payment and enhancing customer convenience.</p>  <p>  When paid by cheque, customers have the option of lodging them direct to their accounts or negotiating them at banks or the Post Office.  The vast majority of the department&rsquo;s customers paid by cheque choose to lodge them direct to their accounts.</p>  <p>  The department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns and is able to offer payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual Jobseeker customers thereby increasing customer convenience.  This is in line with wider departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that in-work customers are paid by the most convenient method possible.</p>  <p>  Consequently the department has written to its casual Jobseeker customers asking them to provide their account details to enable direct payments to financial institutions.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the department does not issue these cheque payments to Post Offices. This process does not reduce the number of existing cash payments through Post Offices under the current contract between the department and An Post.</p>  <p>  I want to reiterate that what the department is doing is moving customers from cheque payments to the much more secure, customer convenient and cost effective payment method of payment directly into accounts in financial institutions. This is entirely consistent with the National Payments Plan and in line with payment methods that now prevail across the economy.  The department must consider the most efficient payment method for our customers who are in employment most of whom get their salary payment into bank accounts.  To have weekly income (work + welfare) payable in two different ways is a highly inappropriate and costly way of dealing with people in employment. The department&rsquo;s focus must be on our customers.</p>  <p>  Customer choice will be maintained.  Customers, if they wish, may continue to receive cheque payments in the medium term.  To date the take-up of this option has been minimal.</p>  <p>  In respect of working groups arising from the &ldquo;Kerr&rdquo; Report, The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is actively working with An Post and others to set out a clear implementation plan for all of the actions in the Kerr Report.</p>  <p>  The report clearly sets out the challenges that An Post and Postmasters face as they ensure that the network remains relevant in the context of an inexorable shift in consumer preferences, including the trend towards digital transactions.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources anticipates that this work will take no more than 6 months.  The Department of Social Protection is engaging with this process as appropriate.</p></reply>

In every case where a one parent family payment is awarded, the Department seeks to trace the other parent (liable relative) to ascertain whether he/she is in a financial position to contribute towards the cost of this payment. This does not alter an individual&rsquo;s obligation to pay maintenance pursuant to a Court Order.</p>  <p>  Currently, once the one-parent family payment recipient&rsquo;s youngest child reaches age 7, and their entitlement to the one-parent family payment ceases, the liability assessed under the liable relative provisions no longer applies. The Department advises the liable relative accordingly. It is important to note that this does not affect any other maintenance arrangements that may be in place.</p>  <p>  My Department has indicated its intention to review the current maintenance and liable relative procedures since the introduction of the one-parent family payment reforms. This work is being actively pursued. However it is a complex area that involves undertaking a detailed review and any change would require legislation.</p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s Language Scheme 2015 &ndash; 2018 took effect from the 16th March 2015 and will remain in force for a period of 3 years or until a new Scheme has been confirmed by the Minister for Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  This Scheme, which sets out the Department&rsquo;s commitments to customer service in Irish and advises of the availability of services through Irish, was published on Department&rsquo;s website in March 2015.</p><p>Due to the large number of Departmental offices nationwide, it is not possible to have staff members with sufficient fluency to deal with a customer through the medium of Irish available at all times in every location.  However, following a Departmental-wide survey in 2015, some 172 staff (2.6% of total staff) stated that they were willing to provide a service to customers in Irish on a voluntary basis. In areas where the staff available are unable to deal with a person through Irish, a language interpretive service is offered to the customer. This service, which can be arranged at very short notice, enables customers (through a 2nd telephone handset or headphones) to have a conversation with staff through a language interpreter.</p><p>The following public offices of the Department<b><font color="#FF0000"> </font></b>are located in Gaeltacht areas: Acaill, An Cloch&aacute;n Liath and Beal an Mhuirthead Intreo Centres and An Daingean branch office. All of these offices can currently provide a direct (telephone/ face to face) service through Irish. The Department is currently in the process of arranging to fill three vacant posts which require the assignment of a bilingual staff member.  A review is currently under way to determine the overall number of functional bilingual posts that are required in the Department and assignments will be made to fill vacant bilingual posts as they arise.</p><p>The Department is committed to the continued development and training of staff to facilitate the provision of services through Irish.  A range of supports is available to equip frontline staff with the necessary skills and confidence to deliver a quality customer service in Irish by phone, letter and in person. Supports available include funding for attendance at Irish language training courses; training resources such as language discs and books are made available; and funding through the Department&rsquo;s Refund of Fees scheme, to encourage staff to pursue Irish Language education outside of work hours.</p></reply>

No. 142 of 2007. There are two elements to the test - the person must have a disability which has continued or may reasonably be expected to continue for a period of at least one year; and they must, by reason of that disability be substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment having regard to their age, qualifications and experience.</p>  <p>  In the case of the person concerned, I am advised that the Appeals Officer disallowed the appeal following an oral hearing, having considered all of the available evidence. I am advised that while the level of medication prescribed was one determining factor, there were a number of factors which led to the Appeals Officer&rsquo;s disallowance of the appeal. These factors were summarised in the appeal decision which issued to the person concerned. However, in case there is any confusion about the reasons for the disallowance of the appeal, I have asked the Appeals Office to arrange for a copy of the report of the oral hearing to be sent to the person concerned.</p>  <p>  Under social welfare law an Appeals Officer&rsquo;s decision is generally final and conclusive and can only be revised in certain limited circumstances, for example in light of new facts or evidence which were not before the Appeals Officer when he made his decision; or if it can be established that the Appeals Officer made an error of fact or law in reaching his decision. </p>  <p>  If the person concerned wishes to have his appeal decision reviewed on the basis of new facts or evidence which would support his contention that he meets the above legislative conditionality, it is open to him to send this evidence to the social welfare appeals office and to request a review in light of this new evidence. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.The Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment, education or training within four months of becoming unemployed. The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs. There is monthly engagement with all young jobseekers.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  There are a number of conditions which must be met in order to qualify for a State pension (contributory).  One of these is the condition mentioned by the Deputy, that they should have a minimum of 520 paid contributions.  However, it is not the only condition which must be met.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  </p>  <p>  A credited contribution is a pay related social insurance (PRSI) contribution awarded to an insured person under certain circumstances, such as proved unemployment. PRSI credited contributions are an integral part of the social insurance system. For the most part they are linked to having an underlying entitlement to a social welfare payment while temporarily detached from the labour force or having entitlement to statutory leave.  The primary purpose of PRSI credits is to secure social welfare benefits and pensions of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI such as during periods of unemployment, illness, etc.  Credits ensure that a person&rsquo;s insurance record is maintained and can be helpful at a later stage to qualify for other social welfare benefits, such as pensions. </p>  <p>  If someone qualifies for a State pension (contributory), their rate of entitlement is calculated by the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system, where the total number of contributions paid or credited by the pensioner during his or her working life is divided by the number of years of the person&rsquo;s insurance record.  In calculating the yearly average, the number of reckonable contributions paid and/or credited since entering insurable employment (after the age of 16) are counted up to the end of the tax year before reaching pension age (66), and this total is divided by the duration (in years) of their record up to that point.  For example, 1,800 contributions over a period of 45 year duration might attract a yearly average of 40 (i.e. 1,800 divided by 45), depending on the circumstances of the pensioner.</p>  <p>  There are six banded rates of the State pension (contributory), ranging from the maximum personal rate of &euro;233.30 (paid to pensioners with a yearly average of 48 or more contributions) to the minimum personal rate of &euro;93.20 (paid to pensioners with a yearly average of 10-14 contributions).  Such entitlements are subject to satisfying the qualifying conditions of this pension, including the minimum 520 paid contributions criterion.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that, where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p></reply>

The department received an application for IP for the person concerned on the 05 January  2016.  A deciding officer (DO) refused IP to the person concerned on the grounds that the medical conditions for the scheme were not satisfied.  The person concerned was notified on the 05 February 2016 of the decision, the reasons for it and of their right of review and appeal.</p>  <p>  The person concerned requested an appeal of this decision and submitted further medical evidence in support of their request.  Following a review of all the information available the DO is now satisfied that the medical conditions for the scheme are satisfied. As a result the appeal is no longer necessary.  Invalidity Pension will be awarded to the person concerned provided they satisfy all other conditions for the scheme.  The IP claim is currently with a DO who will be in direct contact the person concerned regarding their application.</p></reply>

Such criteria in the cases of rent supplement and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance include a means test, and satisfying the habitual residence condition.  In all cases, decisions on the eligibility of persons to these schemes are made following consideration of all the circumstances of the person concerned.  With respect to habitual residence, the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s published guidelines on the application of the condition specifically address the issue of returning emigrants stating that such persons may be regarded as habitually resident immediately on resuming their long-term residence in the State.</p>  <p>  The primary responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with local authorities.  The Department of Social Protection's role with regard to people who are homeless is mainly income maintenance.  Under the social welfare system, people who are homeless and people in temporary accommodation have entitlement to the full range of social welfare schemes, including supplementary welfare allowance, subject to the normal qualifying conditions.  </p>  <p>  Where a person is residing in homeless accommodation, such as bed and breakfast or long term hostel, steps are taken to verify their address in order to facilitate the payment of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Where a person is homeless and has no fixed abode or has night by night accommodation then he or she is referred to the Community Welfare Service for support under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</p>  <p>  In applying for rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the tenant&rsquo;s engagement with the Department usually takes place after the tenant has reached an agreement with the landlord, and would therefore detail the address for the proposed tenancy.</p></reply>

The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Regulations.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  Parents may apply to the scheme on behalf of their child, who would be a disabled passenger in the parent's car, once the child satisfies one of the six qualifying criteria as outlined in the Regulations.</p>  <p>  To qualify for the Scheme an applicant must be in possession of a Primary Medical Certificate.  To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;48.6 million to the Exchequer in 2014, of which &euro;7.6m related to excise relief on fuel costs, and &euro;41m related to remission or repayment of VAT and VRT.  This represents an increase of &euro;5.1 million on the 2013 cost of the Scheme.  This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I understand that there are sympathetic cases of individuals that do not come within the remit of the Scheme.  Furthermore I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities.  I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  Unfortunately, the current context is still one of constrained resources.  In the still challenging fiscal environment and given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

This strategy is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland which provides for the transfer by the OPW of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes to the insurance industry, which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed.  </p>  <p>  The OPW has advised me that Athleague is one of the 300 areas being assessed under the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) project and will therefore be the subject of a Flood Risk Management Plan (FRMP) to be produced by the end of 2016.  Decisions on future investment in relation to flood risk management will be informed by the FRMPs.</p>  <p>  The current flooding crisis has raised issues in relation to insurance and flooding.  The Taoiseach and some other of my colleagues in Government met the insurance industry on Tuesday 12th January 2016 to discuss the industry's role in providing flood insurance and to obtain the industry's views on flood insurance issues. </p>  <p>  In addition, my officials are undertaking research in the area of flood insurance which will include a comparative analysis of the different approaches to flood insurance taken in other countries.</p></reply>

The decision as to whether an individual is &quot;employed&quot; or &quot;self-employed&quot; is arrived at by looking at the terms and conditions under which he or she is engaged, be they written, oral or implied.  It is not simply a matter of labelling a job an &quot;employment&quot; or &quot;self-employment&quot;. </p><p>There are widely accepted criteria in case law that help determine whether a worker is an employee or self-employed.  Revenue's approach is to examine cases having regard to The Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self Employment Status of Individuals (which is available on the Revenue website at ) and relevant case law.  The Code sets out the various factors to be considered in determining the employment status of individuals.  An important consideration in making this determination will always be whether the person performing the work does so &quot;as a person in business on their own account.&quot;</p><p>Having considered the circumstances surrounding the engagement of dental associates and dental hygienists in a number of cases it is the Revenue view that, generally speaking, associates and hygienists engaged by dental practices are engaged under a contract of service (i.e. they are employees) and their remuneration comes within the scope of PAYE.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, it is accepted that there may be exceptional cases where the terms of engagement differ from the norm and in these instances Revenue is prepared to look at these on a case-by-case basis.  Revenue will consider each case on its own merits and in cases of doubt a submission, outlining the terms and conditions of the engagement should be submitted by the dentist or the hygienist to their local Revenue District for consideration.  It is not clear from the Deputy's question as to how the classification of dental hygienists as employees could affect payments received by them per patient.  However, if the Deputy can submit additional information, I would be happy to have my officials look further into the matter.</p></reply>

This department then asks my department to include the qualification on the Schedule 2B list by way of a provision in the next available Finance Bill. </p>  <p>  Alternatively, the stamp duty exemption is available where Teagasc certifies that a particular educational qualification corresponds to a qualification included on the Schedule 2B list and that the qualification is deemed by the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland to be at least at a level equivalent to that of the particular Schedule 2B qualification.</p></reply>

"Principal home purposes" means a residential property which a borrower uses or intends to use for the purpose of his or her principal home.  The Regulations make no distinction as to the current country of residence of the borrower and do not require the lender to apply a lower threshold to mortgage applications by people currently based in another country. </p>  <p>  The Regulations are not designed as a substitute for lenders' responsibilities to assess affordability and lend prudently on a case-by-case basis and these decisions are a matter for the banks themselves. </p>  <p>  Section 57 BX of the Central Bank Act 1942 , as amended, provides that an eligible consumer may complain to the Financial Services Ombudsman about "a failure by the financial service provider to provide a particular financial service that has been requested."

The estimate does not include a yield from the Rent Tax Credit which is currently being withdrawn on a phased basis, ending in 2017.  These estimates also take no account of any change in taxpayer behaviour which might arise on foot of the introduction of such a measure in terms of assessment status and claiming of credits.</p>  <p>  Finally, I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, given the current tax structures, major issues would need to be resolved as to how, in practice, the tapering out of tax credits could be integrated into the current system, and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners.</p></reply>

Any such taxpayer is not considered a chargeable person and has no obligation to file an annual tax return. Revenue may, however, exceptionally request a tax return from such taxpayers.  </p><p>Where a taxpayer is obliged to complete a tax return, or has been requested to complete a tax return by Revenue, they have the option to file the return online.  Chargeable persons can file an electronic Form 11 through the Revenue On-Line Service and taxpayers who are taxed under the PAYE system can file an eForm 12 through the myAccount service.  The electronic tax returns are simpler to complete than the paper versions and are pre-populated with certain information Revenue has in relation to the taxpayer to help them complete their return.  This includes pay received and tax/USC deducted details from employers or pension providers and information from the Department of Social Protection such as pension details.  Support is also provided for customers who are experiencing technical computer difficulties in accessing or navigating the electronic tax return form via a dedicated helpline at 1890 201106.</p><p>I am also informed that a simplified, four-page paper Form 12S is also available for taxpayers who are taxed under the PAYE system.  In addition, any taxpayer who is obliged to complete a tax return, or has been requested to do so by Revenue, can also contact their local Revenue office if they have any difficulties in completing the return.  Contact details are available from the telephone directory or online at .</p><p>While I acknowledge that some individuals may suffer a decline in the level of their income as they get older, it is the case that the income of many such individuals remains at a level that is taxable.  The obligation to make tax returns is determined by a person's economic circumstances and I have no plans to remove this obligation from persons in receipt of taxable income on the basis of an age threshold.</p></reply>

In its feedback statement on Consultation Paper 76 (CP76), containing a two-tiered regulatory structure, the Central Bank stated that the majority of submissions received indicated that it was not the appropriate time to introduce a tiered regulatory approach.  While its second consultation paper, CP88, did not contain a tiered approach the Central Bank stated that where credit unions set out a clear path on how they wish to develop, it will consider any amendments to the regulations that may be appropriate.</p>  <p>  The Commission on Credit Unions recommendations provide the basis for the 2012 Act and the regulations.  I have invited the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) to carry out a review of implementation of the Commission on Credit Union's recommendations.  This review is underway and is expected to be completed by end June 2016.  The report will take account of various matters, including the need for credit unions to develop their business model and grow income in a prudent manner. </p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement. </p></reply>

They use a combination of rating factors in doing this, such as the age of the driver, the type of car, claims record, driving experience, number of drivers, how the car is used, etc. Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, prices vary across the market, and consumers are free to choose.</p>  <p>  In the event that a person is unable to obtain a quotation for motor insurance or feels that the premium proposed or the terms are so excessive that it amounts to a refusal to give them motor insurance, they should contact Insurance Ireland (5 Harbourmaster Place, IFSC, Dublin 1, Telephone +353 1 6761820, quoting the Declined Cases Agreement.

Prior to that Act, any person taking a pension from a Defined Contribution (DC) scheme or a Retirement Annuity Contract had no choice but to purchase an annuity with their remaining pension pot after drawing down the permissible tax-free retirement lump sum.  The ARF arrangement extended the options at retirement so that, in addition to the annuity option, the balance of a pension fund could be taken in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate) or be invested in an ARF or an approved minimum retirement fund (AMRF), subject to certain conditions. </p>  <p>  ARFs and AMRFs are investment products into which the proceeds of certain pension funds of an individual can be invested at retirement.  Beneficial ownership of the assets in an ARF/AMRF vests in the individual owner of the ARF/AMRF.  An ARF/AMRF must be managed by a Qualifying Fund Manager and, as would be the case as a member or holder of a DC pension scheme or personal pension plan, the ARF/AMRF owner also bears the investment risk of the funds.  Tax is not payable on the investment income or gains while the funds are invested in an ARF/AMRF.  Distributions from an ARF or AMRF are taxable at the owner's marginal rate of tax and, in the case of ARFs, a certain percentage of the assets are imputed as distributed each year and taxed accordingly unless actual distributions equivalent to the imputed amount are made.</p>  <p>  The ARF option was extended in Finance Act 2000 to the part of an employee's occupational pension fund built up from Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) and more recently, in Finance Act 2011, it was further extended to cover an employee's entire pension fund where the fund is a DC occupational pension scheme.</p>  <p>  The ARF option does not apply to the main benefits paid from defined benefit (DB) pension schemes, generally, since it was never intended or considered a necessary requirement for such schemes.  Among other reasons, this is because such schemes pay out a specified pension benefit to members on retirement based on their service and remuneration.  Furthermore, unlike in DC pension arrangements, there are no individual funds or pension pots attributable to individual members of DB schemes and, as such, DB scheme members do not individually bear the investment risk of the scheme and are not required to make their own investment decisions.

There are clear obligations on lenders to act in the best interests of customers, to disclose relevant material information to customers and/or to bring key items or key information to the attention of customers.  Furthermore the Consumer Protection Code 2012 sets out specific requirements in respect of the treatment of personal customers exiting tracker rate mortgages.  In the case of accounts in financial difficulty, the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears applies to properties occupied by the borrower in the State or where the property is the only residential property owned by the borrower in the State.  Under the CCMA a lender is permitted to offer a borrower an alternative repayment arrangement which requires the borrower to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another rate, but only as a last resort, where: all other options, which would retain the tracker rate, have been considered to be unsustainable; the arrangement offered is affordable for the borrower; and the arrangement is a long-term sustainable option.</p>  <p>  I would also note that if a mortgage holder is not satisfied with a financial service provider's decision, the customer can make a complaint, using the financial service provider's internal formal complaints procedure. If they are not satisfied with the outcome they may wish to refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman to have it independently investigated. </p>  <p>  In addition, it may be useful to know that the Central Bank has embarked on a broader examination of tracker mortgage-related issues covering, among other things, transparency of communications with, and contractual rights of, tracker mortgage borrowers.  The Central Bank has informed me that it expects significant progress to be made by all lenders before the end of 2016 and will provide an update on progress on its website by end April 2016.</p></reply>

Last May, I requested a report from the Central Bank on the topic which was subsequently published.  I also met with the six main mortgage lenders in May and outlined my view that the standard variable rate being charged to Irish customers was too high.  The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers.</p>  <p>  In September I concluded a series of follow up meetings with these banks and the reality is that the majority have put options in place to allow many borrowers reduce their repayments.  These options range from lower variable rates to new suites of variable rates based on loan-to-value and reductions in fixed rates. </p>  <p>  I therefore encourage borrowers to contact their bank to see what is available to them in their circumstances or consider moving to another bank, where possible, if the offer is not satisfactory.  I understand that this is not possible in all circumstances.</p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) website www.consumerhelp.ie is a valuable source of information on the rates charged by various financial institutions.  In addition, the CCPC are currently running a mortgage switching campaign and have a mortgage switching tool on their website which should allow borrowers compare rates charged across institutions.  Furthermore, I am pleased to note that some lenders offer incentives to borrowers switching mortgage provider.  These initiatives illustrate the increasing competitive dynamics in the market which should benefit all borrowers.</p></reply>

The DGS protects depositors up to &euro;100,000 per person per institution. </p>  <p>  While Article 13(1) of the DGS Directive states that Member States may provide for lower contributions for low-risk sectors regulated under national law, this must be read in conjunction with the entirety of Article 13 and, in particular, Article 13(2) which states that the method for calculating contributions to the DGS shall be approved by the competent authority which is the Central Bank, in co-operation with the designated authority, which also the Central Bank.  </p>  <p>  In accordance with the requirements of Article 13, the European Banking Authority (EBA) issued guidelines on methods for calculating contributions to DGSs.

The Central Bank as the competent authority has indicated that it intends to follow those guidelines.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the calculation methodology currently being developed will assess and rank each credit institution separately.  Therefore, individual credit unions will be separately assessed and ranked, and those deemed to be lower risk under the risk categories as set out in the EBA guidelines will pay a lower contribution.  Conversely, individual credit unions deemed to be higher risk under these risk categories will pay a higher contribution.  </p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that neither the Minister for Finance nor the Central Bank can act outside the parameters of Article 13 as a whole, which gives the Central Bank the mandate to determine and calculate risk based contributions.</p></reply>

The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which come into operation on 1 July 2016.</p><p>Landlord-tenant relations are also governed by multiple pieces of legislation (mainly under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government) and the landlord/owner of the property is restricted in what they can do in relation to removal of tenants from a property.  I understand that these restrictions are the same whether the landlord bought the property, built the property themselves, became a landlord as a result of renting out what was formerly a principal dwelling house or acquired the property by other means such as enforcing loans secured on the property. </p><p>In relation to SMEs or farm borrowers, the Credit Review Office helps those who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  In addition, the Credit Review Office website, , contains an article with useful information to assist borrowers whose loan has been sold on to another lender.</p></reply>

The strategy provided for the establishment of a working group to examine the viability of off-balance sheet mechanisms for the delivery of new social housing.  In this context, the Group is considering proposals from a wide variety of developers, investors, financiers, Approved Housing Bodies and others who expressed an interest in being involved in the provision or financing of social housing across the country.  This work is still ongoing and officials in my Department are assisting the DECLG, which is primarily responsible for the formulation and implementation of the social housing strategy.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be further aware that officials from my Department and DECLG have met with Credit Union sector representatives to examine how they can assist in the area of social housing.

Within that context, policy initiatives in the area of housing must seek to address all of the various sectors of the market, including the private owner occupier market, the rental market and social housing provision.</p>  <p>  In line with its statutory mandate, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is examining opportunities to make, on a commercial basis, strategic investments that have the potential to support increased private and social housing output.</p>  <p>  In the private market, the Fund is already involved in a number of important initiatives which cumulatively can make a contribution to increased housing output.  This includes its investments in Activate Capital, which is an innovative non-bank financing platform that has the potential to provide funding for substantial numbers of new homes in Dublin and the other major urban centres in which demand is most pronounced; Ardstone Residential Partnership, which is a residential equity investment fund that is focused on delivering residential units to the market over the short- to medium-term; and the Wilbur Ross Cardinal Commercial Real Estate Mezzanine Debt Fund, which has funded a number of residential developments in recent months.</p>  <p>  The Fund is also engaging across a wide range of stakeholders, including private sector investors, with a view to identifying opportunities to invest in the area of social housing.  Key factors which must be addressed to facilitate ISIF involvement in such projects include the commercial viability of proposals, EUROSTAT treatment of fund structures which receive the majority of their revenue from Government sources and the ability to create off-balance sheet vehicles, outside of PPPs, which is a requirement to make proposals work.  While, to date, no investable projects or initiatives have emerged, the Fund is continuing to engage proactively with possible social housing investment structures and opportunities and will continue to do so in accordance with its statutory mandate to invest on a commercial basis in a way that supports wider economic additionality.</p></reply>

Officials examined how local public banking, with a focus on supporting SMEs, could complement existing Government policy and other initiatives already in place in a range of areas such as improving competition in the banking market, augmenting competition and innovation in the SME finance market and regional development.</p><p>Local or public Banks, such as <i>Sparkassen</i>in Germany, focus on the needs of SMEs in their catchment area rather than profit maximisation.  This is very similar to the business model of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  It is encouraging to note that to the end of December 2015 almost &euro;172 million has been lent through the SBCI to approximately 4,600 SMEs across Ireland in a wide variety of sectors and regions. </p><p>Additionally, the Government has to date delivered a number of initiatives that already support increased access to finance for SMEs such as: The Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices and the Credit Review Office.  Given the significant SME supports that have already been put in place by the Government to support SME financing it is not clear at present how local public banks could create a distinct product offering that would avoid replicating supports that are already available. </p><p>The Department of Finance, working with other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor and analyse the SME finance market in Ireland and will keep the concept of local public banking under review within the parameters of overall banking policy.  This will be done with a view to taking appropriate actions as warranted in order to ensure that SMEs in Ireland have the opportunity to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.</p></reply>

This optionality remains in place however, unlike back in 2012, the ESM is no longer the only option open to us to recover the money provided to recapitalise our banks.</p>  <p>  I have previously stated that I see no benefit in making an application to the ESM at this time.  Investors are now willing to support Irish banks again and the market value of our investments has improved accordingly.  Ultimately it will be an assessment as to which route - ESM or the markets - represents the best value which will determine these decisions.  My overall objective in relation to the State's investments in the banks has always been to maximise the return to the Irish taxpayer. </p>  <p>  In relation to AIB specifically, which is our largest investment, I have previously stated that an Initial Public Offering or IPO on the stock market looks like the most likely exit route for the State, however there is still work to be done in assessing how we might structure our gradual exit from the bank and particularly when we should start this process.  My Department has recently appointed an Independent Financial Advisor, Rothschild, to provide advice in this regard.  The appointment will help provide the Government with all the information and optionality needed to make an informed decision about our investment.</p></reply>

The Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23% in Ireland, unless there is a provision in the Directive that permits a lower rate.  Settled case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) requires that the limited circumstances in which rates other than the standard rate are used be strictly interpreted and narrowly applied so as not to create or increase divergence of VAT treatment in the EU Member States.  These limited circumstances are set out in the Schedules of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 </p><p>Schedule 1 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 lists activities that are exempt from VAT and in respect of which the supplier has no entitlement to deduct input VAT.  Schedule 2 lists supplies that are liable at the zero rate and in respect of which the supplier has an entitlement to deduct input VAT.  Schedule 2 includes international services, human and animal oral medicines, children's clothing and footwear, books and a range of food and drink items.  The range of food products that can benefit from the zero rating is constrained by Article 110 of the VAT Directive which permits the retention of the zero rate for &quot;clearly defined social reasons&quot; where the products were liable to VAT at the zero rate on 1 January 1991.</p><p>Schedule 3 lists the goods and services that are liable to VAT at the reduced rates of 9% and 13.5%.  The goods and services currently liable to VAT at the 9% rate are ones listed in Annexe III of the VAT Directive and Ireland was permitted under Article 113 of the Directive to apply a rate lower than 12% to these goods and services.  The goods and services liable to VAT at the 13.5% rate are ones that are not listed in Annexe III, but in respect of which Ireland is permitted under Article 118 to retain a reduced rate.  The goods and services to which the 9% rate applies include:</p><p>- the supply of food and drink (excluding alcohol, soft drinks and bottled water) in the course of catering;</p><p>- hot take-away food and hot drinks;</p><p>- hotel lettings, including guest houses, caravan parks, camping sites etc.;</p><p>- admissions to cinemas, theatres, certain musical performances, museums, art gallery exhibitions;</p><p>- amusement services of the kind normally supplied in fairgrounds or amusement parks;</p><p>- the provision, by a person other than a non-profit making organisation, of facilities for taking part in sport;</p><p>- printed matter e.g. newspapers, magazines, brochures, leaflets, programmes, maps, catalogues, printed music (excluding books);</p><p>- hairdressing services.</p><p>The goods and services to which the 13.5% rate applies include:</p><p>- The supply of gas, electricity, solid fuel and home heating oil;</p><p>- The supply of new buildings, concrete block and ready to pour concrete;</p><p>- The supply of photographic services, agricultural services and photographic services;</p><p>- The hire of cars and boats;</p><p>- Beauty services such as facials, nail treatments, tanning and sunbed services.</p><p>The supply of goods and services not listed in the Schedules to the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 is liable to VAT at the standard rate.  Where a good or service is not specified in the Schedules mentioned then the correct rate is the standard rate.  Revenue does have a VAT rates database on its website<i>(</i>) that lists thousands of product and services types and gives the correct VAT rate by reference to the Schedules. </p><p>It is widely recognised that there are anomalies in the rates applying to goods and services and I receive Parliamentary Questions concerning particular anomalies from time to time.  Under the VAT Directive the apparent anomalies can generally only be eliminated through applying higher rates to goods and services currently liable at the zero- rate or at one of the reduced rates.  </p><p>Any changes to VAT rates outside of what is currently permitted though the EU VAT Directive must be negotiated at EU technical working groups and ultimately agreed at ECOFIN.  As with all tax files, any changes require unanimous agreement from all Member States.  The EU Commission is planning to launch an Action Plan on VAT in the very near future which I expect to open up the possibility of adding more flexibility to the application of VAT rates by Member States.  I expect technical discussions at an official level to begin during the current Dutch Presidency of the EU.  My officials will engage fully in these discussions.</p></reply>

Therefore, the condition of a property is not relevant where the property is actually occupied as a dwelling house.</p>  <p>  Where a property is not occupied and is in such bad condition that it is not suitable for occupation as a dwelling house, it is not liable to LPT.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to provide a prescriptive set of criteria that a property must meet to be treated as not suitable for occupation as a dwelling house.  As LPT is a self-assessment tax it is up to a property owner to assess whether a property is liable or not, and to assess the chargeable value of the property where it is liable.  In cases where the property owner assesses a property as non-liable due to its being unsuitable for use as a dwelling or assesses a property at a reduced value because of fire safety or other structural issues, Revenue will consider the facts and circumstances of the particular case.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to introduce an exemption along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Rather, NAMA has acquired loans that are secured by property, which in some cases may be residential property.  The properties that secure these loans are owned by NAMA borrowers, in the same way a homeowner owns a home which is subject to a mortgage provided by a bank.  NAMA's legal relationship to those properties is similar to a bank which holds security over a property.</p><p>NAMA, unlike other lenders, generally owns no residential mortgages, owner-occupier or buy-to-let, in its loan portfolio.  In a very small number of cases the principal private residence of a NAMA borrower may be pledged as security for a NAMA loan.</p><p>A property securing a NAMA loan may be brought to the market for sale by the borrower or receiver in one of two ways, either (1) as part of a portfolio of assets, or (2) individually, in each case to generate proceeds to repay the borrower's loan to NAMA.  Again, in much the same way a homeowner may sell their home and use the sale proceeds to repay their mortgage.  The sale of properties securing NAMA's loans is managed directly by the borrower/property owner or, where the property is the subject of enforcement, by the appointed receiver/administrator acting on behalf of the borrower/property owner.  NAMA requires that the sale of properties by borrowers and receivers are openly marketed to ensure that the best available price in the market at the time of the sale is achieved.</p><p>In its capacity as a secured lender, I am advised that NAMA approved the sale by borrowers and receivers of 5,345 residential property units in 2015.  89% (4,783 of the 5,345 units) were sold on the open market by NAMA borrowers and receivers in individual sales transactions to individual property purchasers. </p><p>I am further advised that the remaining units, 562 units (11% of the total), were sold on the open market by NAMA borrowers and receivers as part of larger group or portfolio sales.  The properties that were sold in groups or portfolios were typically already tenanted and vacant possession was not sought prior to the sale.  Such portfolios are, as a consequence, generally acquired by investors seeking long-term rental streams and therefore existing tenancy arrangements tend not to be impacted by such sales.</p><p>I would also refer the Deputy to NAMA's Annual Report and Accounts, which are available on the NAMA website, .These reports cover each full year of NAMA's operations and provide a breakdown of disposals by transaction type, sector, and location, as well as the number of property units disposed of by NAMA borrowers and receivers.  In particular, I would refer the Deputy to pages 14 -19 of NAMA's 2014 Annual Report for the most recent breakdown.  I expect that NAMA's upcoming 2015 Annual Report will be published within the next two months and will contain an update of this information.</p><p>More generally, it is NAMA's policy that, where possible, borrowers and receivers should avoid seeking vacant possession of residential property in advance of asset sales conducted by the borrower or receiver and in loan sales conducted by NAMA in order to minimise disruption to people living in these homes.  As a consequence, such assets and loans are acquired typically by investors seeking long-term rental streams.  Therefore existing tenancy arrangements tend not be impacted by such sales.  NAMA expects every acquirer of its loans to comply with their legal requirements to respect tenant rights in accordance with their lease terms.</p><p>Prior to facilitating the sale of any assets or loans secured by residential property, NAMA ensures that all avenues to use the properties for social housing have been exhausted.  The Deputy will note that NAMA made practically all of the vacant residential stock in its original loan portfolio available for social housing.  I am advised that NAMA identified 6,635 units for social housing.  Local authorities confirmed demand for 2,531 of these units and 2,042 of these have been delivered. </p><p>Also, before facilitating the sale of assets or loans, NAMA reviews the assets of every debtor to establish if they could be used for residential development.  In the context of a recently advertised loan sale, for instance, NAMA removed 16 borrowing connections from the proposed sale as it identified properties owned by these borrowers that could be used to deliver additional residential supply on a commercial basis, funded by NAMA.  These sites will contribute to the achievement of NAMA's stated commercial objective of funding the construction of 20,000 new homes in Ireland by 2020, subject to commercial viability.  This represents a significant contribution by NAMA, in line with its commercial mandate, to future residential supply in Ireland.  The residential units delivered by borrowers through NAMA's residential funding programme will be sold in individual lots on the open market. </p><p>Aside from the sites being developed through NAMA's residential funding programme, it is my understanding that there are relatively few loans remaining in NAMA's portfolio that are secured by residential properties.  Furthermore, it is decision for NAMA, in line with its independent commercial mandate, to ascertain the appropriate, value maximising strategy for any such loans.</p><p>It is important to highlight that the purchase or sale of a loan or a residential unit from one entity to another does not increase or reduce the supply of housing in the market.  It is through the construction of new residential units that supply is increased.  It should be noted that, in addition to repaying its debt, NAMA is using the proceeds of loan repayments and loan sales to fund the construction of new homes on a commercial basis.  This is in accordance with NAMA's Section 10 obligation to seek to protect or enhance the value of its acquired assets.  In this way, NAMA's loan sales do contribute to increase the supply of residential units in the market.</p><p>Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was enacted on 8 July 2015.  This Act ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including those provided by various statutory codes such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, and the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises.</p></reply>

The option was available for a three year period from 27 March 2013, the date that Finance Act 2013 was passed into law, and came to an end on 26 March 2016.</p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons why pre-retirement access to pension savings is not permitted on a general basis, the principal one being that these arrangements (and the associated tax reliefs on contributions and pension fund growth) are designed to be long term savings vehicles based on the principle that the benefits will be "locked away" to help fund an adequate income in retirement. </p>  <p>  The pre-retirement access to a portion of AVCs which I introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2013 was allowed on a tax-neutral basis the contributions were tax-relieved at the individual's marginal rate on the way in and were taxed at the individual's marginal rate on withdrawal.  This was a measure designed to enable rather than incentivise individuals to access part of their pension savings beyond their regular or compulsory pension contributions and the take-up of the measure has not been particularly significant.  It is important that individuals continue to provide for their retirement and, it would appear, most individuals with AVCs decided to preserve their AVC pension savings.  I have no plans to reintroduce the measure along the lines suggested in the question.</p></reply>

The exemptions/exclusions include:</p><p>- interest paid to or by a bank carrying on business in the State;</p><p>- interest on certain securities issued by certain certified companies or specified collective investment undertakings;</p><p>- interest paid by a company to an investment undertaking that is within the gross-roll-up taxation regime;</p><p>- interest paid by a company in a fiduciary or representative capacity (except when paid to non-residents);</p><p>- interest on Government securities and securities issued by certain State-sponsored bodies;</p><p>- interest paid without deduction of tax by credit unions;</p><p>- interest which is a distribution under 'close company' rules;</p><p>- interest paid by a company authorised by the Revenue not to deduct tax;</p><p>- interest paid by a company or an investment undertaking to a company in another EU Member State, in a country with which Ireland has a tax treaty in force or in a country with which Ireland has signed a tax treaty which has yet to come into force, provided certain conditions are met;</p><p>- interest paid by finance and other companies that make loans but are not licensed banks or building societies (subject to certain conditions);</p><p>- interest paid to a special purpose securitisation company and interest paid by such a company to a person who is resident in another EU Member State, in a country with which Ireland has a tax treaty in force or in a country with which Ireland has signed a tax treaty which has yet to come into force;</p><p>- interest paid to or by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland; and</p><p>- interest paid to the National Treasury Management Agency, the state acting through the National Treasury Management Agency or a National Treasury Management Agency Fund investment vehicle.</p><p>Therefore where a special purpose vehicle (SPV) has acquired a distressed loan book including the loans of an SME, there may be a requirement for the SME to operate interest withholding tax at the standard rate on any loan repayments it makes to the SPV.  As the SME is not a party to the disposal of the loans, on occasion, they may not be aware of the corporate identity of the acquirer.  Therefore, they may not have enough information to determine if they are required to operate the interest withholding tax.  I understand that Revenue will be issuing an e-Brief this week to address the matter which will encourage SMEs in this situation to contact them about a resolution.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-04-06a.538.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016040600047#WRG03600"><p>In June 2015 Government agreed to my proposals for a significant phased restoration of most of the cuts affecting public service pensions due to the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR).  These proposals reflected my commitment to restore the pensions of retired public servants as early as economic and fiscal progress allowed. </p>  <p>  These PSPR ameliorative proposals were legislated in late 2015 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) 2015 Act, with changes occurring in three stages, on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.</p>  <p>  On 1 January 2016, increases in the annual pension thresholds before PSPR applies were activated.  These exemption threshold increases remove PSPR entirely from a significant number of pensions with relatively lower values, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR receive a boost of &euro;400 per year.</p>  <p>  On 1 January 2017, additional PSPR amelioration, acting principally via further exemption threshold increases, will fully remove PSPR from another significant tranche of public service pensions, while at the same time boosting those pensions which remain affected by PSPR by &euro;500 per year. </p>  <p>  On 1 January 2018, the third stage of PSPR amelioration will ensure that all PSPR-impacted pensions with values up to &euro;34,132 will be fully restored, meaning that PSPR will not longer affect such pensions, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR will get a boost of, in most cases, &euro;780 per year.</p>  <p>  These legislated PSPR ameliorative measures, which are in the process of being implemented, constitute a fair and sound basis on which, with the restricted resources available to Government, public service pensions may benefit from significant restoration, with those on lower PSPR-impacted pensions benefitting to a greater extent.  The extent of the legislated restoration, when fully in place from 2018, is substantial, carrying an annual cost estimated at &euro;90 million, and ensuring that only the top 20% higher value public service pensions will continue to be impacted by the PSPR.</p>  <p>  Under section 12 of the FEMPI Act 2013, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is required to review the necessity of the FEMPI legislation annually and cause a written report of his or her findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  In that context, I believe that economic progress and fiscal consolidation in the years ahead will determine the scope and timing of the possible further scale-back or elimination of the financial emergency measures, including the PSPR.</p></reply>

While, for example, the seeking of expressions of interest from public servants in respect of specific posts  did allow for some movement between sectors such moves were, in the main, designed to address specific skills shortages.    </p>  <p>  I understand from my colleague the Minister for Health who has responsibility for the HSE that the agreed arrangements for the redeployment staff within the Health, Education, and Local Government sectors are managed directly by those sectors. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Health has also informed me of the following.</p>  <p>   A National Transfer Policy Scheme for the HSE was introduced in April 2007.  It was developed as part of the framework agreement between IMPACT &amp;amp; the HSE and applies to clerical/administrative staff.  The Central Transfer Processing Unit in HR Services, Shared Services, Manorhamilton, manage requests for clerical/administrative grades who wish to transfer.  The feedback on the current operation of the scheme was that it was proving difficult to facilitate requests from employees who wish to transfer to a different location due to the fact that their current posts were not being backfilled under the moratorium on recruitment and promotion. </p>  <p>  As an interim arrangement in May 2015 the HSE introduced an Employee Swap/Exchange System applicable to all HSE employees who are employed in a permanent capacity and have completed their probationary period at entry grade.  This system allows an employee to arrange a job swap with an employee of the same grade employed in a different location of the HSE, thereby enabling both employees to change to their desired locations.  This Swap/Exchange System does not restrict a line manager's ability to reassign staff in line with service needs.  A joint review of the Swap/Exchange System is currently underway.</p>  <p>  There is a current Public Health Nurses Transfer Policy which came into effect on 1st April 2015.  The purpose of this policy is to give effect to the LRC proposals of 23 July 2014 to the HSE and Irish Nurses Midwives Organisation, to establish a transfer panel specifically for Public Health Nurses and has been agreed by all parties to the process.  The policy replaces any existing local or regional system used to fill vacant Public Health Nurses posts. </p>  <p>  The HSE National Ambulance Service has operated a Transfer Policy since 2014 to allow for a mechanism to facilitate the placement, where possible of all National Ambulance Service personnel in or as close as possible to the Divisional area nearest their home.</p>  <p>  Discussions are currently ongoing with the National Joint Council of Unions(NJC) around the operation of transfer panels in the Health Services.</p></reply>

This Table sets out the Current Expenditure Ceilings across Government Departments for the three year period 2016 to 2018.  As the Deputy will be aware, three year Ministerial Expenditure Ceilings have a statutory basis in the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2013.  </p><p>Excluding the impact of the Lansdowne Road Agreement, the gross current expenditure ceilings increase by &euro;0.4 billion in 2017 and &euro;0.3 billion in 2018. These increases take into account:</p><p>- projected expenditure pressures in Health, Education and Social Protection arising from demographics;</p><p>- projected additional expenditure in Agriculture arising from the roll-out of the Rural Development Programme; and</p><p>- the projected carry over impact of certain Budget 2016 measures.</p><p>It should be noted that the ceiling for the Department of Social Protection reflects an adjustment to take account of expected lower numbers on the Live Register, with expenditure being reallocated to meet demographic demands.</p><p>Ministerial Expenditure Ceilings in respect of current expenditure have not been set for periods after 2018. Consequently, the figures included in Table A9 of the Budget book published by the Department of Finance for periods post 2018, use the aggregate overall amount of &euro;0.3 billion included for 2018, adjusted for a lower amount being available for reallocation within expenditure from Live Register savings.</p></reply>

Options have been devised to deal with flooding problems in the town and a public information day will be held on Friday, 8th April to ascertain the public's view on the proposed measures.  Subject to agreement on the proposed measures, the scheme will be brought through further investigation, formal public exhibition and onto detailed design and construction.</p><p>The River Moy Arterial Drainage Scheme was carried out by the OPW under powers contained in the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  The purpose of Arterial Drainage Schemes was primarily to improve the drainage of agricultural lands to enhance production. This typically involved lowering or widening river beds to facilitate the drainage and discharge of neighbouring lands and drainage channels. While not the primary purpose of the Schemes, they did also provide enhanced conveyance capacity where they passed through towns, villages and dispersed rural communities that in turn has reduced the flood risk to properties in these areas.</p><p>Under the Act, the OPW has a statutory duty to maintain completed schemes in proper repair and in an effective condition.  In compliance with this duty, the OPW carries out an ongoing programme of maintenance work on the River Moy scheme.  The annual maintenance programme typically involves some clearance of vegetation and removal of silt build-up on an average five-yearly cycle.  The OPW is not involved in any flood prevention scheme on the River Moy outside of its maintenance programme.</p><p>The OPW is currently considering applications received from Mayo County Council under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme for Crossmolina, Ballina and Foxford, and will communicate with the Council when decisions are made on these applications.

The assessment of tenders is ongoing and the appointment of a contractor is expected by mid-May. Construction of the Scheme is expected to commence shortly thereafter. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that construction of the Skibbereen Scheme will take approximately 24-30 months to complete.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Clonakilty Flood Relief Scheme, a preferred scheme design option was presented at a statutory Public Exhibition which took place from 15 December 2014 to 20 January 2015.

The estimate for this vote for 2016 is &euro;15.338m. Part of this estimate included a contingency fund of &euro;300,000. As a result of the damage inflicted by Storm Imogen on the embankments on the Maine C.D.S this fund has been allocated to carry out repairs to said embankments. </p><p>  The Government has allocated &euro;52.561million towards capital flood relief measures in 2016 which allows for the design, planning and construction of major flood relief schemes, the funding of minor works projects undertaken by local authorities and the progression of Strategic Studies and Programmes including the CFRAMs, Flood Studies Update and Flood Risk Data Management.  There are almost 40 major schemes currently at various stage of advancement and it is hoped to commence construction on up to eight major schemes this year. It is therefore envisaged that the full allocation under the Capital Programme will be fully spent in the current year.</p><p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) sees no scope to transfer funding to the maintenance budget. The OPW maintenance programme and funding nationally including the South West is fully committed for 2016 in any event.  However, the OPW continuously monitors the projected outturn on each of the Subheads of expenditure on the OPW Vote. In the event of possible savings or excesses the OPW may apply to the Department of PER to vire funding between Programmes or Subheads. </p><p>Local Authorities also have responsibilities for maintenance under the Drainage Districts under their control in respective areas.

It provides that certain companies must prepare consolidated financial statements (or &ldquo;group financial statements&rdquo;) in conformity with international accounting standards (i.e. International Financial Reporting Standards or &ldquo;IFRS&rdquo;), where those IFRS standards have been adopted by the European Commission.  The Regulation also allows Member States to require or permit such companies to prepare their entity financial statements in conformity with IFRS and to require or permit other companies to prepare their entity and/or consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS.The Regulation sets out the procedure by which the Commission adopts or endorses the IFRS standards and states, in Article 3(2), that those standards can only be adopted if: </p><p>- they are not contrary to the principle set out in Article 2(3) of Directive 78/660/EEC and in Article 16(3) of Directive 83/349/EEC and are conducive to the European public good and, </p><p>- they meet the criteria of understandability, relevance, reliability and comparability required of the financial information needed for making economic decisions and assessing the stewardship of management Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC applied to entity financial statements and consolidated financial statements respectively. </p><p>Article 2, points 3 and 4, of Directive 1978/660/EEC, stated:</p><p>3. The annual accounts shall give a true and fair view of the company&rsquo;s assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss. </p><p>4. Where the application of the provisions of this Directive would not be sufficient to give a true and fair view within the meaning of paragraph 3, additional information must be given.</p><p>Directive 83/349/EEC applied to consolidated accounts and Article 16(3) of that Directive required such accounts to give a true and fair view.</p><p>As both Directives have been repealed and replaced by Directive 2013/34/EU, referred to as the new Accounting Directive, references in Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 to those 2 Directives should be construed as references to the new Accounting Directive. Article 4(3) of that Directive states:</p><blockquote>The annual financial statements shall give a true and fair view of the undertaking&rsquo;s assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss.  Where the application of this Directive would not be sufficient to give a true and fair view of the undertaking&rsquo;s assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss, such additional information as is necessary to comply with that requirement shall be given in the notes to the financial statements.</blockquote><p>This wording is quite similar to the wording that has been repealed. </p><p>Article 52 of Directive 2013/34/EU also provides that references to the repealed Directives are to be construed as references to Directive 2013/34/EU.</p><p>To date the European Commission has not proposed any amendment to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 in this regard. If it does, the proposal will be considered by the Council and the European Parliament.</p></reply>

With regard to the Law Clerks JLC, the review found, following consultation with relevant parties in the sector, no economic justification for the retention of the JLC and it was abolished by Ministerial Order on January 28 2014 -  .</p><p>While the ERO system was found to be unconstitutional and there is no longer a JLC for Law Clerks it should be borne in mind that workers that were covered by EROs  before the July 2011 ruling, continue to be protected by their individual contracts of employment (employees have a contract of employment or terms of employment whether notified in writing or not). </p><p>Any change in an employee&rsquo;s terms or conditions of employment would normally be by agreement between the parties. Such agreement can be expressed or implied, tacit or by acquiescence (i.e. it can be formally agreed, informally or verbally agreed or accepted by the employee).</p><p>Furthermore, the amount of pay an employee receives is a matter for negotiation and agreement between the individual and the employer. This is subject only to the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000. There is nothing to prevent employees reaching individual or collective agreements with employers on higher rates based on qualifications or other agreed criteria.</p><p>The questions raised in relation to the state contributory pension fall outside the remit of my Department and are proper to my colleague the Minister for Social Protection. </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment (written or verbal), on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees, including entitlement to the national minimum wage. </p>  <p>  Where the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), which is responsible for securing compliance with employment legislation, receives a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, the WRC will investigate with a view to establishing whether a person has statutory entitlements under employment law. Complaints involving au pairs are considered on a case-by-case basis, in the light of the facts of each case.</p>  <p>  The national minimum wage (NMW) legislation provides for the maximum monetary deduction which can be made from the statutory minimum pay of an employee if the employee is provided with board and/or lodgings.  Statutory Instrument No. 95 of 2000 provides that an employee for whom board and lodging are provided may have the following amounts deducted from their minimum wage calculation: - &euro;54.13 for full board and lodgings per week, or &euro;7.73 per day</p>  <p>  -	&euro;32.14 for full board only per week, or &euro;4.60 per day</p>  <p>  -	&euro;21.85 for lodgings only per week, or &euro;3.14 per day</p>  <p>  Any persons with questions or complaints regarding their rights under employment law should contact the Workplace Relations Customer Service on lo-call 1890 808090 or at www.workplacerelations.ie.</p></reply>

I am pleased to report that the negotiations between the EU and the US have accelerated and significant progress has been made.  During this round, negotiators discussed all three pillars of the proposed agreement namely market access for EU and US companies, regulatory cooperation and trade rules.  The US and EU exchanged government procurement offers and continued discussions on rules of origin as well as intellectual property rights. </p><p>There was particular focus on two of the three pillars; regulatory cooperation and rules.  An exchange of new textual proposals on regulatory cooperation took place aimed at refining ideas about how to create a system within TTIP which facilitates current and future regulatory cooperation in both manufacturing and services. </p><p>Both parties also discussed the EU's revised draft chapter on good regulatory practices and other regulatory issues, such as technical barriers to trade (TBT), sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS).</p><p>Concerning Rules, the US tabled its proposals on labour and environment, in response to the EU's previous proposal for a sustainable development chapter.  A detailed examination of each side's proposal took place.  Discussions also covered other areas such as competition, customs and trade facilitation as well as state to state dispute settlement and Small &amp;amp; Medium Enterprises.</p><p>The EU presented its new and reformed approach to investment protection and investment dispute resolution for the first time in detail during this round &ndash; the Investment Court System (ICS).  The proposal is available on the Commission&rsquo;s website at .  </p><p>The EU Commission&rsquo;s proposal aims at safeguarding Government&rsquo;s right to regulate and creates a new system composed of a first instance tribunal and an appeal mechanism based on clearly defined rules, and operating on similar principles to the WTO Appellate Body, with qualified judges and transparent proceedings.  The ability of investors to take a case before the Tribunal would be precisely defined and limited.  The proposal also includes specific measures on access to the new system for small and medium sized companies.  The aim is to promote more two-way investment between the EU and the US with high standards of protection for investors while safeguarding government&rsquo;s right to regulate.  All of the EU&rsquo;s Free Trade Agreements seek to provide EU investors abroad with a level of protection similar to that which they would obtain in the EU.  Equally US investors in the EU expect common investment protection standards and common redress mechanisms, and not 28 different set of standards and 28 different redress procedures.</p><p>The advantage for Irish firms investing in the US would be that a single arbitration procedure would be available to firms under the Trade Agreement in cases of disputes over investment.  In the same vein, US firms investing in the EU, including Ireland, would have access to a single arbitration procedure in the event of investment disputes under the Trade Agreement.</p><p>There was an exchange of views on both the EU and US textual proposals.  Discussions focussed primarily on understanding the respective approaches and on identifying areas of convergence.</p><p>The EU and US also discussed market access areas, most notably services, tariffs and public procurement.  On procurement, there was an exchange of offers, followed by discussions between the negotiating teams on both the offers.</p><p>Finally, both parties agreed to accelerate their work between negotiating rounds with a view to increasing the pace of negotiations.  Two additional negotiating rounds are planned between now and the summer, though dates have yet to be confirmed.  The pivotal and overarching objective is to negotiate an ambitious, high standard Agreement that responds to both EU and US interests.</p></reply>

The Scheme provides funding in respect of costs necessarily incurred in clearing the site and reconstituting the forest, subject to the maximum limits laid down.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is restricted to forestry and currently there are no plans to either broaden the scope of the Scheme or to introduce any other Scheme for individuals or nurseries that have been affected by outbreaks of plant diseases including ash dieback.</p></reply>

Farmers will only see the full value of their contracts when payments are calculated for 2016, the first full year of their five-year contracts.</p>  <p>  In terms of the average annual value of payments it is not possible to establish this accurately until payment claims are submitted as part of the 2016 Basic Payment Scheme process and the 2016 full year calculations and pre-payment validations are completed.</p></reply>

In October 2015 the second application tranche was launched with the objective of increasing overall participation levels to at least 35,000 and possibly up to 40,000 and I am pleased to confirm that some 38,000 farmers have now been approved into the scheme.</p>  <p>  The unprecedented level of applications to the Scheme has meant that for the second tranche of GLAS (GLAS 2), priority was given to Tier 1 and Tier 2 candidates, i.e. those who either manage key environmental assets such as endangered birds, protected habitats or high-quality water courses, or who have committed to undertake particularly valuable environmental actions such as growing feed-crops for wild birds, adopting low-impact tillage techniques or using low-emission slurry spreading methods.</p>  <p>  Farmers had been urged to present the highest standard environmental plans under GLAS 2, and to adopt actions that would promote them from Tier 3 to a higher tier, thereby significantly increasing the chance of selection.  Over 80% of applicants in this second tranche of GLAS opted to do so, and with the funding available have been approved.</p>  <p>  In addition all GLAS 2 applications from new entrants to farming in 2015, and from new farm partnerships, have been granted priority access under this round, because of difficulties they had in applying under GLAS 1.  This includes applications by new entrants or partnerships from Tier 3.</p>  <p>  A third tranche of GLAS (GLAS 3) will open later this year.  Any applicant who was previously unsuccessful has the opportunity to re-examine their proposed farm-plan, in consultation with their advisor, with a view to improving the plan to increase their chance of selection under GLAS 3 and to submit a new application for GLAS 3 when the scheme is opened.</p></reply>

Public procurement competitions for the supply of bovine tags are arranged on a periodic basis which facilitates developments in technology, level of service and competition.  My Department will shortly be publishing a Request for Tenders (RFT) for the provision of a new contract for a three year term that will commence on 1 November 2016.  Following consultation with stakeholders my Department has again made a policy decision to seek a single supplier for provision of the service for the supply of bovine tags.  A single supplier is deemed to be the optimum approach to meeting the identification requirements of the bovine sector in Ireland for superior quality bovine tags that meet the high standards needed to support a secure bovine identification and traceability system.  This approach also ensures that tags are made available to herd keepers at a competitive price with a single supplier benefitting from economies of scale.</p>  <p>  The RFT published by the Department will comply with the requirements in procurement legislation for a competitive tender. </p></reply>

A number of horse carcasses were also removed. None of the rescued horses or horse carcasses were microchipped and, while my Department has a policy of prosecuting for suspected cases of animal neglect and cruelty, it is not possible to bring about a successful prosecution in the absence of a microchipped horse/carcass.  My Department does not have information on the questions relating to the resources allocated to the prevention of cruelty and neglect in animals and the number of prosecutions in each local authority area as these are matters to be addressed by the relevant local authorities.</p>  <p>  My Department provides substantial financial assistance, amounting to almost &euro;1m in 2015, to local authorities in the context of implementation of the Control of Horses&rsquo; Act by these bodies. In addition, my Department awarded grants of &euro;2.54m last December to 140 organisations involved in safeguarding animal welfare throughout the country. Some  &euro;94,000 of these grants were awarded to animal welfare bodies based in Galway, including &euro;40,000 to GSPCA to assist their work this year in protecting animal welfare throughout the county.</p></reply>

As part of the design process the consulting engineers are engaging with interested bodies and local organisations regarding the proposed project.  The project will include the dredging of a quantity of silt, gravel and rock.</p>  <p>  During the previous harbour development project completed in 2004, the sediments in this location were examined and some areas were deemed to exceed the chemical limits acceptable for disposal at sea.  A chemical re-evaluation of the sediments was carried out in 2015 and early 2016, as part of the current development proposal.  Results currently indicate that at least 85% is suitable for disposal at sea, subject to EPA approval.  The reduction in the degree of contamination has occurred naturally in the intervening period, as would have been expected.</p>  <p>  My Department intends to submit a Dumping At Sea Application to the Environmental Protection Agency in the coming months.  For material intended to be dredged that proves to be unsuitable for disposal at sea, other options are being considered, including disposal on land or other remediation measures.  The issue of disposal of quantities of contaminated dredge spoil is a matter which is regularly encountered in marine dredging works.  A variety of appropriate solutions exist to address such situations.</p></reply>

In this regard it has requested financial support from my Department.  However in the absence of economic data it is difficult to determine what the industry can contribute.  My Department will carry out a comprehensive economic analysis of the harness racing industry to determine its current and potential return to the Irish economy.  This will require the commissioning of an independent economic consultant to carry out the task.  My Department is at present deciding on the terms of reference for such a study.  Once the terms of reference are agreed the tendering process will commence.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime my Department has been working with the IHRA to provide some support for the industry.  The IHRA is to be a beneficiary in 2016 for the first time of an Equine Infrastructure grant scheme operated by my Department.  Under the Scheme, the IHRA has been approved for grants totalling &euro;21,704 for projects involving the up-grading of the Association&rsquo;s  Registration System and Website, a presence at the RDS Horse Show to promote the trotters and Pacer Studbooks, a Conference and Presentation to promote breeding and for developing its links with international organisations.

This follows on from an earlier package of measures agreed in September of last year and takes account of the ongoing difficulties being experienced in the sector, where the duration of market turbulence has gone well beyond previous expectations.</p>  <p>  The package reflects the majority of the demands presented by Ireland to the Commission and other Member States in advance of Council, in particular the doubling of the intervention ceiling for skimmed milk powder and butter. I also welcome the Commissioner&rsquo;s undertaking to consider further flexibilities in the PSA scheme for Skimmed Milk Powder, and to look at further flexibilities in the State Aid regime.</p>  <p>  At all times I remain concerned about the references to supply control in run-up to Council and in the Presidency conclusions which emerged after Council. We have been very consistent in our view that milk quotas did not serve Ireland well and their abolition was a welcome development which will allow our dairy sector reach its full potential. I am assured by the fact that the measures proposed at Council are voluntary, agreed at the level of the first purchaser of the milk and are strictly temporary in nature. They do not constitute a return to quotas and both the Commission and the Presidency were extremely clear on this point. I am also opposed to allocating new EU funding to incentivise such reductions.</p>  <p>  In terms of input costs at farm level, I have called on the Commission to consider looking at temporary suspension of EU import tariffs on fertilisers to reduce input costs for Irish and EU farmers and I understand that the Commissioner is looking favourably on this request.</p>  <p>  The Presidency conclusions also refer to the possibility of advance payments under CAP, as was done in 2015. In addition I can confirm that the direct top-up will issue to young dairy farmers in the near future. This is the final stage in the payment of &euro;26.4m direct aid to dairy farmers funded by the exchequer and the EU.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, with respect to financial instruments, I welcome the proposal for the European Investment Bank (EIB) and member states to work together with the Commission on the feasibility of an EU export credit tool. However, I believe the EIB needs to be more proactive in designing loan products in partnership with member states.</p>  <p>  It remains clear that we need to deal urgently and effectively with this temporary problem. We must ensure that EU farmers are protected from the worst impacts of low commodity prices in an appropriate way, but remain well placed to avail of emerging opportunities when markets recover.</p></reply>

In 2015 export volumes increased by approximately 8%, with growth to the UK, Continental Europe and International markets. Export values at &euro;570 million, fell marginally by 2% during 2015 due to lower pig prices. Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices followed by a supply response and/or a recovery in demand. My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure over the last year and a half and the difficulties that this is causing for producers. This is not an exclusively Irish phenomenon, and Irish prices have actually remained ahead of the EU average for the last five months. However I would also add that like any other EU Minister I do not have a role in the setting of prices. This is a function of the market.</p>  <p>  At the March meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels, I put forward a number of measures for the pigmeat and diary sectors which I believe were needed immediately to help producers through their current difficulties. On pigmeat my priority was to secure the re-opening of the Pigmeat Private Storage Aid Scheme as I believe its closure did not appear justified by the current state of the EU and global pigmeat market, given that the sector does not enjoy direct EU supports, market tools available in times of extreme price volatility must be deployed when necessary. I am pleased to note that the Commissioner has agreed to the re-opening of this scheme in 2016.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Russian pigmeat ban, the adverse effects of the effective closure of this market are still being felt by farmers. Ireland has requested the Commission to continue and intensify its political, technical and diplomatic efforts to unlock the Russian market for EU pigmeat. We proposed that the Commission re-engage and secure access for products outside the scope of the Presidential decree, such as pig fats and offals.  In the interim, a direct aid package payment will issue to all pig farmers in Ireland with a minimum level of supply of 200 pigs slaughtered in 2015 very shortly. This means a flat rate payment of over &euro;3,000 to each farmer. This will ensure that the payment is directed to those farmers most affected by the price volatility, thus meeting the requirements of the EU Regulations providing the funding. Furthermore, Commissioner Hogan has reiterated his determination to promote the EU&rsquo;s interests and open up new markets for EU products, with a specific &euro;30 million envelope for dairy and pigmeat available under the EU Promotion Scheme to reflect the market disturbances in those sectors. Ireland, through Bord Bia, will be making an application for a proportion of this funding in the very near future.</p></reply>

These adverse effects are still being keenly felt by farmers. While this is a difficult issue, Ireland has continued to urge the Commission at every opportunity over recent months, both at official and political levels, to intensify its political, technical and diplomatic efforts to unlock the Russian market, particularly in relation to products outside the scope of the Presidential decree, such as pig lards, fats and offals.</p>  <p>  For its part, the Commission has been working to make progress on this issue. It has been in regular, direct communication with the Russian authorities in relation to the ASF ban, arguing that an EU-wide ban is totally disproportionate given the limited incidence of ASF in a small number of Member States.  It has also taken a case against Russia to the WTO&rsquo;s dispute settlement panel, in respect of which a final ruling is awaited. In the meantime, the pigmeat sector continues to be supported via the exceptional market support measures agreed by Member States in recent months.</p></reply>

It provides for the gradual unwinding of the pay reduction measures imposed on public servants at a cost of &euro;844m over three years. It is underpinned by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015 (FEMPI). That Act makes the following provision for pay restoration:</p><p>On 1 January the exemption threshold for payment of Pension Related Deduction (PRD) increased from &euro;15,000 per annum to &euro;26,083 per annum and on 1 January 2017 it will further increase to &euro;28,750. This means for all public servants, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that by the start of 2017 remuneration below &euro;28,750 will no longer be liable to PRD which will reduce the impact for PRD affected public servants by &euro;1,000. By operation of the tax code those lower paid public servants on lower rate of tax will profit to a greater extent.</p><p>For the majority of public servants, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to the PRD benefits outlined above, there is a significant reduction, weighted in favour of the lower paid, of the pay reductions suffered under the 2009 FEMPI legislation. These come in the form of increases in gross pay in 2016 for those on lower pay (up to &euro;31,000) and in 2017 for all on pay up to &euro;65,000. The 2015 FEMPI legislation also provides for the suspension of the operation of incremental pay scales in respect of any public servant who is not encompassed by a collective agreement. The application of this provision will fall to be considered in relation to those public servants who are not encompassed by the LRA come the expiry of the Haddington Road Agreement on 30 June 2015.</p><p>Negotiations on the LRA were facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission (now the Workplace Relations Commission) and were open to all Public Sector Unions and Associations including the Garda representative associations.</p><p>In relation to the pay rates applicable to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the position is that trainee Garda&iacute; are supported while completing their 2 year BA in Police Studies. For the 32 week duration of phase 1 of their training they receive a basic weekly allowance of &euro;184 and full board in the Garda College. After 32 weeks they are fully attested and move onto the first point of the Garda incremental pay scale of &euro;23,750. The incremental scale rises to &euro;42,138 per annum after 8 years with two further increments after 13 and 19 years' service which bring the maximum of the pay scale to &euro;45,793 per annum after 19 years.  It is important to recall that the Garda pay scale does not represent the full earnings of a Garda as it does not include any allowances. Garda&iacute; assigned to frontline duties work the Garda Roster which attracts unsocial hours payments. Such payments amount to between 25% and 30% of their earnings. Even at the entry level of &euro;23,750 and the lower end of unsocial hours scale, this will add almost &euro;5,950 to the salary. Other allowances may also be payable, as may overtime.</p><p>Regarding the 2014  finding by the European Committee of Social Rights in <i>EuroCOP V Ireland </i>that the State was not in compliance with a number of aspects of the Charter on Social Rights I have made it clear in the State's formal response that while the finding is not binding I am committed to seeking solutions to these issues which respect the Charter. The breaches identified were:</p><p>- Article 5 (the right to organise) on grounds of the prohibition against police representative associations from joining national employees' organisations</p><p>- Article 6.2 (the right to bargain collectively) on grounds of restricted access of police representative associations into pay agreement discussions; and</p><p>- Article 6.4 on grounds of the prohibition of the right to strike of members of the police.</p><p>The findings in relation to Articles 5 and 6.2 have been referred for consideration as part of the independent review being conducted by Mr Ray McGee, former Deputy Chairperson of the Labour Court as part of the commitment under the Haddington Road Agreement to a review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including appropriate industrial relations mechanisms. This review is ongoing and will be completed as soon as possible. The breach of Article 6.4 (prohibition on the right to strike) is under separate consideration. It raises complex questions for the State from a legal, operational and management perspective which require detailed and considered input from various parties including the Garda Commissioner, the Attorney General and indeed Government itself.</p><p>All public servants, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, played a significant part in stabilising the public finances and bringing about the economic recovery and I am very conscious of their frustrations at the pace of pay restoration. However, it is essential that a prudent and sustainable approach is adopted given the current resources available and fiscal restraints on spending.</p></reply>

The Roadmap to Ratification, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, sets out the substantial legislative agenda required for ratification.</p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015, and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 was passed by the Seanad on 26 January this year.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.</p>  <p>  Work is also under way on drawing up an Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification.

The Strategy sets out a coordinated ten-year approach with rolling three year action plans to ensure that people with disabilities, who can and want to work, are supported and assisted to do so. It involves a whole of Government approach aimed at bringing together the actions of different Departments and state agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.  The Strategy&rsquo;s six strategic priorities are:</p><p>- Build skills, capacity and independence</p><p>- Provide bridges and supports into work</p><p>- Make work pay</p><p>- Promote job retention and re-entry to work</p><p>- Provide coordinated and seamless support across Government</p><p>- Engage employers</p><p>The Government has already taken a number of key decisions as recommended in the Strategy including:</p><p>- the public service employment target of people with disabilities will be increased on a phased basis as set out in the Strategy from 3% to 6% over the life time of the Strategy;</p><p>- special public service competitions for people with disabilities will be arranged and we will open up alternative recruitment channels for people with disabilities;</p><p>- the establishment of a national help line and disability information service launched on 2 January last to provide expert guidance and peer support to employers in relation to the employment of staff with disabilities.</p><p>Given the complex cross-government nature of the strategy an oversight implementation group has been established under the independent chairmanship of Fergus Finlay. This group is tasked with monitoring the progress of the six strategic priorities of the strategy ensuring that each Government Department is fulfilling its obligations and meeting its targets.

The Group serves a central role in shaping the new National Disability Inclusion Strategy currently under preparation and in respect of which my Department is undertaking a wide ranging consultation process with relevant stake holders.

Paragraph 16(a) of Schedule 4 is the relevant provision in this case.</p>  <p>  The position under the Valuation Acts regarding claims from whatever source for exemption on charitable grounds, requires consideration of two issues. In order for a property occupied by an organisation to be exempt from rates under the terms of Schedule 4 - Paragraph 16(a) of the Act, that organisation must firstly, be a "charitable organisation" and secondly, the use of land, buildings or part thereof must be "exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for private profit".</p>  <p>  The definition of a "charitable organisation" in the context of Paragraph 16(a) of Schedule 4 was originally set out in section 3 of the Valuation Act 2001. This definition has been repealed  and a new definition has been substituted following implementation of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015. As a result. "charitable organisation" now means a charitable organisation within the meaning of Section 2 of the Charities Act 2009 that is entered in the register of charitable organisations pursuant to Part 3 of that Act. This has simplified the law in this particular regard.</p>  <p>  However, the other element to be satisfied under paragraph 16(a) of Schedule 4 has not been amended and still remains in place. Accordingly, the requirement that the land or building in question be used exclusively for charitable purposes, and otherwise than for private profit, continues in force.</p>  <p>  Shops operated by charitable organisations are rateable on the basis that conducting retail activity is not considered to be "exclusively for charitable purposes" within the meaning of the legislation. This is in line with established case law. As a result, a distinction has been drawn between properties which are operated by charitable organisations and used exclusively for charitable purposes and properties occupied by charitable organisations which are not used exclusively for charitable purposes, albeit where the proceeds may be used exclusively for charitable purposes.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's reference to childcare facilities, the position is that certain childcare facilities provided on a not-for-profit community basis are exempt from rates under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015. However, a shop operated as a business or by a voluntary group is a retail activity in competition with other retail outlets and is therefore rateable and forms part of the commercial valuation base in all rating authority areas.</p>  <p>  If an occupier is dissatisfied with a determination of the Valuation Office, including as to whether a particular property is or is not rateable, there are a number of avenues of redress provided for in the Valuation Acts. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation. Following consideration of the representations and determination of the valuation, there is a statutory right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal. Finally, there is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law.</p></reply>

Phase 1 (identification of key themes for the new Strategy) and Phase 2 (identification and agreement of high level objectives under each agreed theme) of that consultation process have been completed.  The final phase, Phase 3 (identification of detailed actions to achieve each agreed objective, with associated time-scales, key performance indicators, institutional responsibilities and monitoring arrangements), will commence in May 2016 and will conclude with submission of a final draft version of a new Inclusion Strategy to Government as soon as possible thereafter. This process will provide a new set of specific actions that need to be taken to bring about a real improvement in quality of life for Travellers and Roma. It is intended that the revised Inclusion Strategy will run from 2016 to 2020 and that it will be in place as early as possible in 2016. A number of cross-cutting themes have emerged in the consultation process such as accommodation, employment, health and education.  My Department's role is that of policy coordination; implementation of policy in the areas of accommodation, health, education and employment is a matter for the Departments with responsibility for each of these areas.</p>  <p>  The question of whether revised institutional arrangements for delivery of services to Travellers are necessary to bring about greater coherence in, and improve the effectiveness of, statutory services for the Traveller community has been raised during the ongoing consultation process and, as indicated on behalf of the Government during the November 2015 debate in the House on the question of recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group, will be considered in the drafting of the new Inclusion Strategy.</p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to conduct a review of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 to determine if amendments to the legislation or further measures are necessary to ensure the purposes of that Act are fully achieved. I might also mention that, where criminal offences such as assault, criminal damage or public order offences are committed, they are prosecuted through the wider criminal law. The trial judge can take any aggravating factors, such as a hate/racist/bias motivation, into account at sentencing.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s human rights and equality infrastructure has been strengthened by the establishment, in November 2014, of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) as an independent statutory body following the merger of the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority. IHREC will support public bodies in placing equality and human rights consideration at the heart of decision making. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 provides for an extensive range of functions for IHREC, including "to encourage the development of a culture of respect for human rights, equality and inter-cultural understanding in the State&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  A significant innovation in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 is the introduction of a positive duty on public bodies to have due regard to human rights and equality in their work and to conduct their business in a manner that is consistent with individual human rights. Under that Act (section 42), public bodies are obliged to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect human rights. The Commission will assist public bodies to comply with the positive duty, including by producing guidelines and codes of practice. This means the systematic integration of an equality and human right perspective into everyday work, including changes to organisational cultures, so that such a perspective is an integral part of the organisation.</p></reply>

After three years, recorded calls (other than those relating to an incident that is deemed active) shall be deleted from the Storage Area Network. The reason for this policy is the high cost of retention of and access to prisoner telephone calls. This Policy has been in place since May 2015.</p>  <p>  The records for the person referred to by the Deputy were deleted week beginning the 23 November 2015.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that on the 23 November 2015 there was one outstanding request by the person referred to for "any recordings of telephone conversations between him and his solicitor during a specified period of time in 2009" which was at that time the subject of clarification between the Irish Prison Service and the person concerned. However, as advised to his solicitor, due to legal privilege, it is not Irish Prison Service policy to record telephone conversations between solicitors and clients on designated phone lines. The recordings that were destroyed would not have included any phone calls to persons who were nominated as solicitors. There were no phone calls in existence or destroyed which corresponded to the clarified request.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-04-06a.1023.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016040600053#WRN01400"><p>Pending commencement this year of the relevant provisions of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, under the current regulatory regime the Law Society of Ireland, the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal and the Office of the Independent Adjudicator are the independent statutory bodies charged with investigating or resolving complaints against solicitors under the Solicitors Acts 1954-2011 and their attendant regulations. Under these statutory complaints structures the Law Society is, therefore, the main route of redress for aggrieved clients of solicitors, outside of the courts. The Society&rsquo;s Complaints and Client Relations Committee, which includes lay members, determines complaints in relation to misconduct, inadequate services or excessive fees made directly to it by members of the public. Under current law, therefore, it is not my function as Minister to determine or to otherwise intervene in disputes or difficulties between solicitors and their clients. Rather, these are matters to be dealt with by the designated statutory bodies or, as may be the case, through the courts. </p>  <p>  The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal deals with complaints of serious misconduct and such complaints are either referred to it by the Law Society or made directly to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal by members of the public. The Tribunal members are appointed by the President of the High Court and act independently of the Law Society. In more serious cases, where the Tribunal considers that a solicitor should be suspended or struck off it will make such a recommendation to the President of the High Court. Further details are available on the Tribunal&rsquo;s website www.distrib.ie. An aggrieved client can, therefore, bring a case directly to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal which in turn is amenable to the High Court.</p>  <p>  Members of the public who are dissatisfied with the way the Law Society has dealt with a complaint may also refer it to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (www.independentadjudicator.ie). The Office of the Independent Adjudicator was established to provide an independent point of contact to which members of the public could have recourse if dissatisfied with the manner in which the Law Society had dealt with a complaint. While it is important to note that the Adjudicator&rsquo;s role is to investigate the handling of the complaint by the Law Society and not to investigate the substance of the original complaint, the issue of delay in follow-up to a complaint is something that may be taken into appropriate consideration. </p>  <p>  In addition to the remedies available under the statutory complaints handling framework that I have just outlined, aggrieved clients of solicitors may also choose to seek redress through the courts. This typically arises in cases of alleged negligence on the part of a solicitor which have had serious negative consequences for the client concerned. As with any court proceedings, it is considered prudent that persons considering taking such legal action seek independent legal advice on the strength or otherwise of their case and its possible cost implications. It will then be a matter for the aggrieved client concerned to decide which course of action might be best suited to the circumstances of their particular complaint. It is also understood that the Law Society maintains a list of solicitors who are prepared to act in such negligence proceedings against another solicitor and this list can be obtained upon request.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also wish to be aware that, under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, preparations are already underway for the establishment of the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority which will have responsibility for the oversight of both solicitors and barristers. There will be a new framework to deal with complaints about professional misconduct independent of both the Law Society and the Bar Council. This, in turn, will be backed up by the establishment of a new Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal which will also deal with both legal professions. Members of the public who wish to make complaints will, therefore, no longer do so through the Law Society or the Bar Council as they do at present, but through the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority. This and other reforms being made under the 2015 Act will continue to be rolled out on a phased basis between now and the end of this year. However, I would point out that any complaints against solicitors made to the Law Society prior to the forthcoming commencement of the new complaints provisions of the 2015 Act will be brought to their completion under the current law and complaints procedures.</p></reply>

This provision introduces a new &lsquo;court review&rsquo;, where creditors such as a mortgage lender refuse an insolvent borrower&rsquo;s proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement to resolve debts which include the mortgage on their home. Previously, the creditors&rsquo; rejection was final. Under the new provision, the borrower can seek review by the relevant Court of the creditors&rsquo; refusal. The Court will consider the borrower&rsquo;s proposal using the criteria set out in <b><i></i></b>the 2015 amending legislation (Section 115A) and  the Court  may, if those criteria are satisfied, impose the personal insolvency arrangement proposed by the borrower. </p><p>The review provision came into effect on 20 November 2015, under  S.I. no 514/2015 which I signed on 18 November.To coincide with the introduction of the new provisions, the Insolvency Service of Ireland held a number of training sessions around the country with Personal Insolvency Practitioners.</p><p>All applications for review under s. 115A are notified under the Insolvency Acts to the Insolvency Service, which will be publishing information on outcomes as part of its quarterly reports. As of 1 April 2016, 39 Circuit Court applications under s. 115A have been notified to the Insolvency Service. To date, nine of these have been determined by the Courts or settled between the parties. My officials will, of course, be carefully monitoring the operation in practice of this important reform.</p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Court review is also being complemented by a new Scheme of access to independent legal and financial aid and advice for those in home mortgage arrears, which I announced on 22 January this year. Intensive work on implementing this Aid and Advice Scheme has been under way across Government Departments and other relevant bodies. This has been led by my Department and by the Department of Social Protection, with the participation of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, the Legal Aid Board, the Citizens&rsquo; Information Board and MABS, the Money and Budgeting Service. It builds on a network of Dedicated Mortgage Arrears Advisers established in MABS offices across the country, which was announced by the Tanaiste and Minister for Social Protection in December 2015. </p><p>MABS will act as a single Government gateway to the new  Scheme, for people who are deep in debt and are at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears. MABs advisers will help these borrowers, and advise them on their best options for returning to solvency and where possible for remaining in their homes. The MABS adviser will refer them, as needed, for financial advice to a Personal Insolvency Practitioner from a panel supervised by the Insolvency Service or an accountant  from a panel overseen by the Department of Social Protection, and for legal aid and advice to a solicitor from a panel operated by the Legal Aid Board. The Scheme will also provide for support in Court for an insolvent borrower subject to repossession proceedings affecting their home, under a new &lsquo;duty solicitor&rsquo; service, also operated by the Legal Aid Board. The aid and advice will be provided by the panel professional under a &lsquo;voucher&rsquo; system, and without charge to the borrower. A key element of the Scheme is a component which provides for legal aid to an insolvent homeowner in relation to the new Court review under s.115A of the Personal Insolvency Acts. This will also be operated by the Legal Aid Board.</p><p>Work on implementation is almost complete, and I expect the  Scheme to become operational in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

However it is currently being complied and will be forward to the Deputy as soon as it is to hand. </p><p>Details of compensation paid in relation to the recorded assaults is a matter for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, under the <i>Scheme of Compensation for Personal Injuries Criminally Inflicted on Prison Officers. </i>Awards under this scheme are made directly to prison officers by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal (CICT) which is a non-statutory agency of the Department of Justice and Equality and is independent of the Minister in its decision making.</p><p>The amount of compensation paid to prison officers during the years requested is included in the table below.  This figure includes, but is not solely restricted to, compensation paid as a result of an assault by a prisoner.  It should be noted that the injury or injuries which gave rise to these claims are likely to have occurred in the preceding years.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Amount</th><th>No. of Claims</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;816,441.66</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;977,717.95</td><td>47</td></tr></table></p><p>Details of compensation payments made under this scheme for 2015/2016 will be available when the Appropriations Account for 2015/2016 are published.

No level of inter prisoner violence is acceptable and every effort is made by prison staff and management to limit the scope of acts of violence.  However no regime can completely eliminate the possibility of violent incidents happening in a prison setting where a large number of dangerous and violent offenders are being held.</p><p>The Irish Prison Service has successfully introduced a number of measures across the prison estate such as hand-held metal detectors, netting over prison yards, boss chairs and security screening machines to detect and prevent weapons from entering the prison to limit the scope of acts of violence.  In addition, new prisoner programmes have been introduced such as the Incentivised Regimes policy which provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour.  The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment. </p><p>The Irish Prison Service will continue to review procedures and progress on an ongoing basis, in order to ensure and improve staff safety.</p></reply>

The Inter-Departmental Working Group on Future Investment in Childcare in Ireland included representation from the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The report of the Inter Departmental Working Group, published in July 2015, made a number of recommendations in relation to childminders, and highlighted that greater supports and incentives may be required.  Work is continuing in my Department on foot of this report.</p>  <p>  As regards childcare provided in the home, a number of supports are currently in place for childminders.  For example, my Department provides annual funding of &euro;340,000 to Childminding Ireland.  It also funds childminding development grants, amounting to &euro;250,000 in total, which are distributed annually by the county child care committees, CCCs.  In addition, childminders taking care of three or fewer children under the age of 18 may be entitled to avail of the child care services relief from the Revenue Commissioners, provided their annual childminding income comes to no more than &euro;15,000. </p></reply>

Special care is used to address the risk of harm that may be caused to a child's life, health, safety, development or welfare by their behaviour.  There are three special care units in the country which are operated by the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, under the governance of National Special Care Services. </p><p>The refurbishment works at Crann&oacute;g Nua, Portrane are currently ongoing and are due to be completed in the fourth quarter this year.  When the works are completed Crann&oacute;g Nua will have an operational capacity of twelve special care places.  It is envisaged that initial referrals to the Centre will commence in the first quarter of 2017, on a staggered basis. </p><p>Details of the three special care units with a total of 17 places are as follows:-</p><p>-Ballydowd, Dublin - a mixed gender unit, capacity for 10 children</p><p>-Coovagh House, Limerick - a  mixed gender unit, capacity for 3 children</p><p>-Gleann Alainn, Cork - a female only unit, capacity for 4 children</p><p>Tusla has provided the following information on the number of children residing in special care units from January to December 2015.</p><p><b>Number of Children residing in Special Care Units 2015</b><table><tr><th>Month (As of the last day)</th><th>Ballydowd</th><th>Gleann Alainn</th><th>Coovagh House</th></tr><tr><td>January</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>February</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>March</td><td>10</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>April</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>May</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>June</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>July</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>August</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>September</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>October</td><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>November</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>December</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Number of Children residing in Special Care Units 2016 (Jan-March)</b><table><tr><th>Month (As of the last day)</th><th>Ballydowd</th><th>Gleann Alainn</th><th>Coovagh House</th></tr><tr><td>January</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>February</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>March</td><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr></table></p><p>It should be noted that the capacity of the centres can change depending on the needs of the children placed.  </p><p>Tusla seeks to place children with complex needs within Ireland, in placements such as special care; however, in some limited circumstances children are placed abroad, under an order of the High Court, where their specific needs can be met.  These children often present with a complex range of needs due to injury, accident or childhood experiences.  The needs of the child are prioritised over the location of the placement when seeking such specialist services.  Children placed abroad remain in the care of the State, have an allocated social worker who visits them in their placement, and have a care plan which is reviewed within the statutory framework.  At the end of December 2015, there were 4 children in a secure care placement out of state.  All four children were placed in the United Kingdom, had an allocated social worker and up to date care plan. </p></reply>

The child is not detained as a result of criminal offences, but for their own safety and welfare. </p><p>Children are admitted to Special Care following a successful application to the Child and Family Agency's Special Care Referrals Committee and then to the High Court for a special care order, in line with the provisions of the Child Care Act 1991, as amended.  The criteria for admission to a special care unit are the age of the child, the concerns and risk assessment of the child, and a risk management plan.  The age range for admission is 11 to 17 years.  There are currently 5 young people approved and awaiting a Special Care intervention.  One new referral is currently being processed.  The current average waiting time is approximately 4 weeks.</p><p>The Special Care Referrals Committee meets on a fortnightly basis.  During 2015, the Committee convened 5 emergency meetings outside of regular meetings.  To date, there have been no emergency meetings in 2016.</p><p>The referrals process for Special Care includes the provision for resubmissions of referrals where the social work department wishes the Referrals Committee to reconsider the referral.

The age range for eligibility for children enrolling for the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme in September 2016 is 1 January 2012 to 31 August 2013.  </p>  <p>  Currently, children are entitled to one year&rsquo;s free pre-school (i.e. 38 weeks during the pre-school year) under the programme.  It is my understanding that the child in question is currently availing of this entitlement during the 2015/2016 programme year.  As this child will be outside the eligibility age range in September 2016, she will not therefore be eligible to re-register for free pre-school then.</p>  <p>  However, an application for an overage exemption can be made if a child has been diagnosed as having a special/additional need.  Current policy requires that any request for an exemption from ECCE eligibility criteria must be supported by a medical assessment report from the HSE/medical specialist, specifying the child's special need and  diagnosis.  Application should be made to the Early Years Policies and Programmes Unit of my Department, attaching a supporting medical report.</p></reply>

Almost 93% of children in care were in a foster care setting.  Of all children in care, over 93% (5,937) had an allocated social worker.  Tusla's policy is that all children coming into care and those in high risk placements have an allocated social worker.  Subsequent gaps may be attributed to a number of factors including maternity leave, vacancies and competing priorities. </p><p>Where a child is awaiting the allocation of a social worker, this is responded to by a social work duty team on a risk management basis.  During this time, work with the child and their family may be undertaken by the social work team leader or social workers in the duty system.  Some of these children may have had an allocated social worker, but due to a social worker leaving, they are reclassified as awaiting a social worker.  The increased budget for Tusla for 2016 should result in higher levels of children in care having an allocated social worker.</p><p>My officials have engaged with Tusla regarding local areas with a high number of children in care without an allocated social worker, and the steps that are being taken, as a priority, to remedy this situation. </p><p>The following table represents the data available as at 31 December 2015.<table><tr><th>Area</th><th>No. of Children in Care</th><th>No. of Children in are without Allocated a Social Worker</th><th>% of Children in Care without Allocated Social Worker</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin South Central</td><td>393 </td><td>15</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South East/ Wicklow</td><td>306 </td><td>0</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South West/ Kildare/ West Wicklow</td><td>461 </td><td>77</td><td>17%</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>371 </td><td>34</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN MID-LEINSTER TOTAL</td><td>1,531 </td><td>126</td><td>8%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City North</td><td>625 </td><td>25</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North</td><td>331 </td><td>22</td><td>7%</td></tr><tr><td>Louth/ Meath</td><td>390 </td><td>0</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan/ Monaghan</td><td>170 </td><td>0</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN NORTH EAST TOTAL</td><td>1,516 </td><td>47</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>899 </td><td>39</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>145 </td><td>0</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow/ Kilkenny/South Tipperary</td><td>382 </td><td>51</td><td>13%</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford/Wexford</td><td>447 </td><td>23</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>SOUTH TOTAL</td><td>1,873 </td><td>113</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>Mid West (Clare, Limerick &amp;amp; North Tipperary)</td><td>605 </td><td>113</td><td>19%</td></tr><tr><td>Galway/ Roscommon</td><td>407 </td><td>8</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>136 </td><td>0</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>210 </td><td>44</td><td>21%</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/ Leitrim/ West Cavan</td><td>110 </td><td>0</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>WEST TOTAL</td><td>1,468 </td><td>165</td><td>11%</td></tr><tr><td>NATIONAL TOTAL</td><td>6,388 </td><td>451</td><td>7%</td></tr></table>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the number of children in care in the Galway/Roscommon area without a social worker has decreased from 47 children in October to 8 children in December 2015.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people.  The voluntary youth sector involves approximately 1,400 paid staff, including youth workers and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Budget 2016 provided an additional &euro;1.1m in current youth funding to my Department bringing the total allocation for the youth services to &euro;51m in 2016.  This additional funding will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;2.25m in capital funding, also provided in Budget 2016, will be used to support small scale projects, including refurbishment, health and safety fit-outs and accessibility improvements in local youth services.</p>  <p>  In addition, a new &euro;600,000 Youth Employability Initiative, funded under the Dormant Account Funding Scheme and launched in October 2015 will provide grants to youth services for innovative programmes that target young people who are not in education, employment or training to improve their employability skills.</p>  <p>  These additional investments in the voluntary youth services in 2015 and 2016 have been widely welcomed by youth sector interests.</p></reply>

The overall expectation of expenditure is estimated to be approximately &euro; 1,000,000.</p><p>Consideration of ongoing financial contributions by my Department over three years gives rise to a number of issues; the availability of funding, the prioritisation of expenditure and competing demands in the area of research and requisite public procurement arrangements. </p><p>In relation to funding, apart from the funding of existing commitments relating to the <i>Growing Up in Ireland</i>Study, my Department has only a very limited commissioned research budget.  The majority of this budget has been committed for 2016, 2017 and 2018. </p><p>My Department has ascertained from the Child and Family Agency that priority of relevant expenditure by it at present is aimed at enhancing its business intelligence around Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence in order to support planning and commissioning of services.  To this end, the Agency is working with funded service provider organisations to implement standard data gathering and reporting mechanisms and address data quality issues.  In implementing its obligations under both the Istanbul Convention and commitments under the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, the Agency will be looking at how to address specific research and evidence needs to inform future commissioning and to support measurement of outcomes.</p><p>I have also mentioned public procurement considerations, and it remains the case that any commissioned research funded by my Department is subject to a procurement process on foot of a call under our funded research programme or similar, and is done in line with Departmental research priorities.</p><p>As regards co-ordination with other Departments in relation to Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, this has occurred in the context  of the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, which was published by the Minister for Justice and Equality in January 2016.

This year the Government will provide &euro;1.56 billion for health-funded services and supports to enable each individual with a disability to achieve their full potential and maximise their independence.  The quantum of service to be provided, together with key deliverables and priorities, are outlined in the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2016.  The HSE is committed to protecting front-line services for people with disabilities, with targeted improvement in priority areas: </p><p>- the reconfiguration of children's therapy services, for which an additional &euro;4m has been provided; </p><p>- the provision of services for 1,500 young people on leaving school and rehabilitative training, which has been allocated an additional &euro;7.25m;</p><p>- the development of alternative respite models, with &euro;1m targeted funding;</p><p>- the reconfiguration of residential services, supported by &euro;20 million in capital funding, and</p><p>- quality improvements to increase compliance with <i>National Standards for Residential Centres for Children and Adults with Disabilities.</i></p><p>Disability service provision is moving towards a community-based and inclusive model of person-centred day and residential supports, as recommended in the <i>Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in Ireland</i>, and is being implemented through the<i>Transforming Lives</i>programme.  This transformation programme means that person-centred and individually chosen community based supports are progressively becoming the norm, and is a distinct move away from the group-based, often segregated approach of the past.  This new approach will be underpinned by a more effective method of assessing need, allocating resources and monitoring resource use. </p><p>A key element of <i>Transforming Lives</i>is the implementation of national policy on supporting people who live in congregated settings, defined as residential settings where ten or more people with disabilities live together, to move to the community.  This policy is described in the HSE&rsquo;s report on <i>Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion,</i>and is underpinned by the<i>National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability 2011 - 2016</i>, published jointly by the  Department of Health (DoH) and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLG).</p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s Social Care Directorate has prioritized the accelerated implementation of the de-congregation policy in 2016.  The HSE's 2016 National Service Plan has set a target of 165 people to move from institutions into suitable accommodation this year.  This is being supported by &euro;20 million in capital funding from the DoH in respect of acquiring and renovating properties to support the de-congregation process.  In addition, the DECLG will provide &euro;10 million under the Capital Assistance Scheme to provide suitable accommodation for people transitioning from institutions in 2016.  The HSE estimate that a further 100 people could benefit from this initiative.  &euro;1 million in ring-fenced leasing funding is also being made available by the DECLG in 2016 to support people moving from institutions into suitable social housing in the community. </p><p>In total, this represents a significant investment and commitment by Government to ensure that citizens with disabilities are given the opportunity to live as ordinary a life as possible in suitable accommodation in the community in line with their own choices and preferences. </p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE), unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.  In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p>  <p>  The issue of increasing awareness of fibromyalgia has previously been brought to the attention of the National Clinical Programme for Rheumatology.  The programme advised that it is estimated that in region of 30% of referrals to rheumatology services in the hospital setting are related to fibromyalgia. </p>  <p>  The National Clinical Programme has no specific fibromyalgia study planned; however, healthcare professionals can apply to the Health Research Board for research funding into fibromyalgia.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-04-06a.1216.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016040600055#WRP02700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 421 and 457 together.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there is a lot of concern and worry among cystic fibrosis (CF) sufferers and parents and families of children who have CF about the current debate on the cost and availability of this medicine.  I met with Cystic Fibrosis Ireland on Monday 25th January to discuss the matter.</p>  <p>  Orkambi is a combination drug for the treatment of CF in patients with two copies of a specific CF gene mutation.  The drug was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2015 and by the European Medicines Agency on the 19th of November 2015.  In other words, Orkambi has only been licensed for use in the European Union within the last few months.  To date, it has not been approved for reimbursement by any public health service in Europe. </p>  <p>  Each country has its own process for approval. The Irish process is laid down in law in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  Under this law, the HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the law.  It is appropriate that these should not be political decisions and that a scientific and evidence based approach is taken to determine the extent to which patients would benefit from treatment with expensive new drugs.</p>  <p>  Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness, and the resources available to the HSE.  The process for approval of high-tech new drugs in Ireland involves three steps.  The first step involves a Rapid Review, which has been done.  The second involves a full Health Technology Assessment by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  This expert assessment is scientific and objective and will evaluate whether the claims being made about the benefits of a new drug are valid, and to what extent, in terms of its impact on life expectancy, quality of life, reducing hospital admissions, reduced need for transplants etc.  The NCPE will also consider which patient groups might benefit, how the drug compares with existing treatments and if it is cost-effective at the price being quoted by the manufacturer.  This usually takes about 90 days.  Orkambi's manufacturer, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, submitted an application to the HSE on 3 February 2016.  I have requested the NCPE to expedite this part of the process to less than 90 days, and the Director has confirmed that he believes this can be achieved.  However, it is not possible to provide status updates on the NCPE assessment while the assessment is still ongoing. </p>  <p>  Once the assessment is complete, a recommendation is made to the HSE, which may then engage in price negotiations with the manufacturer. </p>  <p>  A similar process is carried out in England by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which does not expect to make a recommendation until July.</p>  <p>  The process being followed is the same as that for other CF drugs like Kalydeco, new drugs to treat cancer and other rare diseases.  Orkambi will be treated in the same way as these were, and has to be, under the law.  This process is designed to secure the best value for the HSE, and the savings that accrue from this process can be used to fund other health service developments, for example isolation rooms for CF and cancer patients, better ambulance services, home supports for the elderly and safer maternity services.</p>  <p>  I hope that it will be possible for Orkambi to be approved for patients who will benefit from it, and at a fair price, but it must go through the normal approval procedure first, like all other high-tech medicines.</p></reply>

Usually, the applicant furnished her birth certificate and copies of hospital records establishing that she had undergone a symphysiotomy.</p>  <p>  Hospital records received by the Scheme were copy documents and any medical reports obtained by the applicant&rsquo;s solicitor in support of a claim for significant disability were also copy documents.  The Scheme did not receive any originals of these records and the original documents remain in the hospitals&rsquo; records storage, local and national archives and in GP offices.  Contrary to recent reports in the media, it is important to note that the integrity of applicants' original records is not affected in any way by receipt of copy documents by the Scheme for the purpose of carrying out assessments.</p>  <p>  Over the last few weeks the Scheme has been writing to each applicant regarding her records.  More than two thirds of the women concerned have replied by the end of March, with 70% of the women seeking the return of their personal documents and 30% asking for the records to be confidentially shredded.  The Scheme is cognisant of an applicant&rsquo;s right to privacy protected by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and in line with this will ensure that documents containing personal information are not returned to anyone other than the woman herself. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Assessor of the Scheme received these copy records for the purpose of determining awards to women who met the criteria of the Symphysiotomy Payment Scheme only.  The Assessor is not at liberty to hold the records, or to request that they be archived, for any other purpose.  The Data Protection Commissioner has confirmed that data may only be used for the purpose for which it was supplied and for no other purpose.</p>  <p>  I have not received a request to meet the Groups representing the women affected by symphysiotomy to discuss the shredding of records.  Copies of records containing personal information were submitted to the independent Scheme directly by the women themselves, or their legal advisors.  Accordingly the Department does not have ownership or control of the documents and could not therefore have any role in the process.   </p>  <p>  The Assessor to the Scheme has informed my officials that she is aware that some applicants may have very particular and personal reasons for the non-delivery of documents to their home and the Scheme will respect those wishes.  Accordingly, the documents will be returned either to the applicant herself or, will be disposed of confidentially in accordance with the applicant&rsquo;s wishes.</p></reply>

The National Standards, which are based on the legislation, set out what is expected in terms of the service provided to residents, with a focus on continuous development of safe and effective care. </p><p>The Regulations are aimed at ensuring proper standards of care for nursing homes and include provisions on residents' rights and protection from abuse.  Nursing home providers must ensure that all reasonable measures are taken to protect residents from all  forms of abuse, and these measures include staff training on the detection and prevention of and response to abuse.  Any incident or allegation of abuse must be investigated by the provider and policies must be in place for the prevention, detection and response to abuse.  Furthermore, nursing home providers must notify HIQA of any allegation, suspected or confirmed, of abuse of any resident within 3 working days of its occurrence. </p><p>HIQA takes into account and uses all information received to inform and plan its regulatory activity.

BCG vaccine has not been available in Ireland since the end of April 2015.  Consequently, BCG vaccination clinics in HSE Clinics and Maternity hospitals have been postponed until new stock arrives.</p>  <p>  There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland and to other countries within the EU.  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG vaccine to ascertain when the vaccine might be available.  The HSE has also asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which licenses and regulates all human medicines in Ireland, to source an alternate supplier of the BCG vaccine.  Efforts have been made to find a company who can provide the vaccine for use in Ireland which satisfies all the HPRA requirements on safety and efficacy.  To date no suitable alternative BCG product has been found.  Therefore the HSE has been unable to procure the BCG vaccine from any other source and still awaits the product from the HPRA licensed supplier of the vaccine. </p>  <p>  The supplier has indicated that supplies of the vaccine are not expected to be delivered into Ireland until early 2017.  When the HSE receives the vaccine, they will arrange appointments for vaccination clinics ensuring that those at high risk are offered vaccination first.</p></reply>

The Department of Health requested the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to conduct a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) to review the implications of this change.  </p>  <p>  The HTA was published by HIQA on 8 December 2015.  It recommended that sufficient resources for enhanced TB control and public awareness efforts must be provided before there is any change in national vaccination policy and strategy.  However, HIQA has recommended that any change in strategy must be supported by a clear commitment to enhanced systematic and comprehensive tuberculosis (TB) control measures.</p>  <p>  Tuberculosis (TB) is a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 452 of 2011).  In 2015, 318 cases of TB were notified to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, giving a national TB notification rate of 6.9 per 100,000, the lowest rate reported since surveillance commenced.  According to the World Health Organisation, the definition of a low incidence TB country is one with a national TB notification rate of less than 10 cases per 100,000, Ireland is in this category.</p>  <p>  In Ireland the number of cases of TB has been falling.  Most European countries, including the UK, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland do not give BCG vaccine to all babies.  Babies are not at risk of TB because of the delay in getting BCG vaccine in Ireland.</p></reply>

As negotiations are ongoing, it would not be in the best interests of the State to provide further comment at this time. </p>  <p>  I am aware that there is a lot of concern and worry among cystic fibrosis (CF) sufferers and parents and families of children who have CF about the current debate on the cost and availability of this medicine.  I met with Cystic Fibrosis Ireland on Monday 25 January to discuss the matter.</p>  <p>  Orkambi is a combination drug for the treatment of CF in patients with two copies of a specific CF gene mutation.  The drug was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2015 and by the European Medicines Agency on 19 November 2015.  In other words, Orkambi has only been licensed for use in the European Union within the last few months.  To date, it has not been approved for reimbursement by any public health service in Europe. </p>  <p>  Each country has its own process for approval.  The Irish process is laid down in law in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  Under this law, the HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the law.  It is appropriate that these should not be political decisions and that a scientific and evidence based approach is taken to determine the extent to which patients would benefit from treatment with expensive new drugs.</p>  <p>  Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness, and the resources available to the HSE.  The process for approval of high-tech new drugs in Ireland involves three steps.  The first step involves a Rapid Review, which has been done.  The second involves a full Health Technology Assessment by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  This expert assessment is scientific and objective and will evaluate whether the claims being made about the benefits of a new drug are valid, and to what extent, in terms of its impact on life expectancy, quality of life, reducing hospital admissions, reduced need for transplants etc.  The NCPE will also consider which patient groups might benefit, how the drug compares with existing treatments and if it is cost-effective at the price being quoted by the manufacturer.  This usually takes about 90 days.  Orkambi's manufacturer, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, submitted an application to the HSE on 3 February 2016.  I have requested the NCPE to expedite this part of the process to less than 90 days, and the Director has confirmed that he believes this can be achieved. </p>  <p>  Once the assessment is complete, a recommendation is made to the HSE, which may then engage in price negotiations with the manufacturer. </p>  <p>  A similar process is carried out in England by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which does not expect to make a recommendation until July.</p>  <p>  The process being followed is the same as that for other CF drugs like Kalydeco, new drugs to treat cancer and other rare diseases.  Orkambi will be treated in the same way as these were, and has to be, under the law.  This process is designed to secure the best value for the HSE, and the savings that accrue from this process can be used to fund other health service developments, for example isolation rooms for CF and cancer patients, better ambulance services, home supports for the elderly and safer maternity services.</p>  <p>  I hope that it will be possible for Orkambi to be approved for patients who will benefit from it, and at a fair price, but it must go through the normal approval procedure first, like all other high-tech medicines.</p></reply>

Cannabis and certain cannabis-related compounds are controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 to 2015 and are listed in schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988, as amended. </p>  <p>  Cannabidiol, the substance referred to as CBD by the Deputy, is not subject to control under these Acts.  However, CBD is derived from cannabis which is a controlled drug.  Due to the manufacturing processes, CBD extracts may contain a number of other ingredients, some of which may be controlled.  In order to elucidate and define the ingredients of a CBD oil product, a full certificate of analysis would be required for that product.  If a CBD oil product does not contain an ingredient which is a controlled substance, it may be feasible to have that product imported and used in Ireland, in accordance with specific conditions.</p>  <p>  Cannabis oil or CBD oil are not an authorised medicinal products in Ireland.  Products for which medicinal claims are made, or which contain certain substances likely to have pharmacological actions on the body are considered as medicinal products.  Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market, the manufacturer must seek an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) or, in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  A determination on an application for authorisation of a medicine is based on a rigorous scientific assessment of the application against the criteria of safety, quality, efficacy, legal and regulatory requirements.  I have no role in the process of authorising medicinal products.</p>  <p>  The HPRA is responsible for the assessment of clinical trials with medicinal products conducted in Ireland.  Before a medicinal product can be authorised for use, it must go through the clinical trials process to ensure that it is safe and effective, and also that the quality of the product is sufficient.  The publicly-accessible EU Clinical Trials Register of trials being conducted in the EU and European Economic Area currently lists 38 trials authorised using cannabis.  These trials are mainly investigating the safety and efficacy of cannabis in neurological and psychiatric conditions. There are currently no clinical trials using cannabis taking place in Ireland.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable.  It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need.  Patients with the greatest level of need are provided with treatment by the HSE.  At the end of Q4 2015, waiting times in the HSE South region were as follows:<table><tr><th>Waiting time from assessment to commencement of treatment</th><th>Less than 2 years</th><th>2 to 4 years</th><th>More than 4 years</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>Number of patients</td><td>2,483</td><td>1,364</td><td>164</td><td>4,011</td></tr></table></p><p>In line with the HSE's aim to reduce the proportion of patients on the treatment waiting list for longer than four years, the number of patients waiting more than 4 years has fallen from 7.3% (306 patients) in Q3 2015 to 4.1% (164 patients) in Q4 2015.  Following a national procurement process, a panel of independent practitioners will be contracted by the HSE in the coming weeks to provide treatment for certain categories of misalignment.  The practitioners will be under contract over the next three years, with consideration of an extension to four years.  This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for four years or longer who are generally 16 years and over.  It is expected that this initiative will have a positive impact on waiting times. </p><p>In addition, a pilot scheme in the Dublin North East area (DNE), which involves upskilling staff to work as orthodontic therapists is currently under way.  A dental hygienist and a dental nurse qualified as orthodontic therapists in September 2015 and are now working in the HSE under the supervision of specialist orthodontists.  The scheme is currently undergoing an evaluation, which includes consideration of how the scheme is affecting waiting lists.  Figures are currently being collated and early indications are positive.  It is planned to extend the scheme nationally after the evaluation has been completed. </p></reply>

This type of service can be provided by a range of trained health professionals and delivered to meet a clinical need at either primary or secondary care level.</p>  <p>  The Counselling in Primary Care (CIPC) service is a national service funded from the Programme for Government investment in Mental Health, to increase the access to counselling and psychotherapy and supplementing existing services provided by Primary Care.  Since 2012, &euro;7.5 million has been provided to develop the CIPC service.  The service provides short-term counselling for adults with non-complex psychological problems aged 18 years and over and who hold a valid medical card.  Every effort is made to see people as quickly as possible, however there are a number of people waiting extended periods many of whom will have specific requirements, for example, they can only attend on a specific day or time or may wish to be seen in a particular area.  In some areas, there is a particular difficulty accessing accommodation in which to see clients, which in turn impacts on waiting times.  This is an issue in some of the smaller rural areas and one that the HSE is working to resolve.</p>  <p>  Within the specialist secondary care mental health service counselling and psychotherapy are provided within community mental health teams when service users are clinically assessed as requiring this intervention and they are provided by a health professional on the team.  Counselling is also provided by a range of voluntary organisations across the health service and HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention funds voluntary organisations such as Pieta House and Console to provide support across a range of needs.</p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Plan for 2016 commits to ring-fencing a proportion of the &euro;35m programme for Government funding for counselling services for young people under 18 years to be developed in collaboration with HSE Primary Care.  In addition, the programme for Government funding will also be utilised for continued development of general adult teams and child and adolescent mental health services, as well as improved 24-7 responses and liaison services and to address specific mental health care needs of homeless persons in 2016.</p></reply>

This function is currently being carried out by the HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) which was established in 2005 to oversee the implementation of the then national suicide prevention strategy and to co-ordinate suicide prevention initiatives around the country.</p><p>In June last year, the Government launched &lsquo;<i>Connecting for Life&rsquo;</i>, our new strategy to reduce suicide for the period 2015-2020.  The new Strategy, which has an implementation focus on youth mental health, sets out a vision where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and wellbeing.  This includes a greater focus on the important area of support for families and communities in suicide prevention, and will include providing community-based organisations with guidelines, protocols and training on effective suicide prevention.  </p><p><i>Connecting for Life</i>provides a detailed and clear plan to achieve each of the goals it proposes, with defined actions and a lead agency and key partners in place for each individual objective.  This plan will be supported by robust implementation and governance structures, as well as resourcing and communications frameworks.  The Strategy assigns specific responsibility to the NOSP as a statutory agency to fulfil a number of tasks, including the development and implementation of surveillance systems, the implementation and evaluation of the Strategy, the development and provision of suicide prevention training and education programmes, increasing national awareness about suicide prevention and setting out a national suicide research and prevention programme.  NOSP, together with the Department of Health, other Government Departments, NGO and community partners are proceeding with the implementation of <i>Connecting for Life</i>.</p><p>Funding for suicide prevention has increased significantly in recent years from &euro;3.7 million in 2010 to the current level of &euro;11.55 million, which includes an additional &euro;2.75 million provided in 2015 for additional Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention and for priority actions in <i>Connecting for Life</i>.  I would like to assure the Deputy that dealing with the high levels of suicide and deliberate self harm is a priority for this Government, and this is reflected in the significant investment in suicide prevention and mental health services generally in recent years.</p></reply>

Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available to the HSE.</p>  <p>  The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  They are not political or ministerial decisions. </p>  <p>  Sapropterin (Kuvan&reg;) was previously considered under the national pricing and reimbursement processes in 2009.  At that time, insufficient evidence was available to support the pricing and reimbursement application submitted by the manufacturer.</p>  <p>  The manufacturer recently submitted a new application for pricing and reimbursement of Kuvan; this application is now being considered in line with criteria set out in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 and using the processes outlined in national pricing framework agreements.  Based on previous pricing information supplied by the company, reimbursing Kuvan to phenylketonuria patients in Ireland could cost somewhere between &euro;3m  and &euro;10m per year, given an estimated treatment cohort of 60-180 patients.</p>  <p>  As the application process is ongoing, it is not possible to discuss potential outcomes or comment further at this time.</p></reply>

This year the Government will provide &euro;1.56 billion for health-funded services and supports to enable each individual with a disability to achieve their full potential and maximise their independence.  The quantum of service to be provided, together with key deliverables and priorities, are outlined in the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2016.  The HSE is committed to protecting front-line services for people with disabilities, with targeted improvement in priority areas:</p><p>- the reconfiguration of children's therapy services, for which an additional &euro;4m has been provided;</p><p>- the provision of services for 1,500 young people on leaving school and rehabilitative training, which has been allocated an additional &euro;7.25m;</p><p>- the development of alternative respite models, with &euro;1m targeted funding;</p><p>- the reconfiguration of residential services, supported by &euro;20 million in capital funding, and</p><p>- quality improvements to increase compliance with <i>National Standards for Residential Centres for Children and Adults with Disabilities</i>.</p><p>Disability service provision is moving towards a community-based and inclusive model of person-centred supports, as recommended in the <i>Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in Ireland</i>, and is being implemented through the<i>Transforming Lives</i>programme.  This transformation programme means that person-centred and individually chosen community based supports are progressively becoming the norm, and is a distinct move away from the group-based, often segregated approach of the past.  This new approach will be underpinned by a more effective method of assessing need, allocating resources and monitoring resource use.</p><p>The allocation of dedicated capital funding of &euro;100m for disability services over the period 2016&ndash;2021 (including the &euro;20m in 2016 for reconfiguration of residential services), together with the establishment of a Service Reform Fund which has been agreed between Atlantic Philanthropies, the DoH, HSE (Social Care and Mental Health Services) and Genio will support the phased transition to the person-centred model of services and supports.</p></reply>

The aim is to reduce consumption to 9.1 litres of pure alcohol per capita and the harms caused by alcohol.  This is part of a suite of measures agreed by the Government in 2013 on foot of the recommendations in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, 2012.</p>  <p>  The European Court of Justice ruled on 23 December 2015 on proposals by the Scottish Government to introduce Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP).  The Court judgment is broadly in line with the Advocate General&rsquo;s opinion in October last year when it states that the legislation may be justified on the grounds of the protection of health if it is proportionate to the objective pursued, and cannot be achieved by other measures such as taxation.</p>  <p>  A strong and convincing case can be made in favour of MUP over other measures.  I believe that MUP is a proportionate measure and the only measure that would effectively target the widespread access to alcohol that is very cheap relative to its strength.  This was backed up by the research conducted by Sheffield University which showed that MUP changes behaviour in those most at risk.</p></reply>

The report recommended that the number of critical care beds in the system should increase from 289 to 579 over the period 2010 to 2020 and the development of a  &lsquo;hub-and-spoke&rsquo; Model of Care for Adult Critical Care.  Since its establishment the HSE critical care clinical  programme has been working with service providers to develop the hub and spoke model whereby the more complex work is undertaken in the larger regional hospitals and critical care services in the some of the smaller hospital have been decommissioned.  The Model of Care for critical care was launched in October 2014. </p>  <p>  The Programme has carried out an annual census of critical care capacity and activity.  Based on the recently completed 2015 national census, there are currently 237 adult critical care beds in public hospitals.  It is acknowledged that there is a need to address the overall critical care bed capacity requirements.  The initial approach underway in the HSE is to work to opening the 25 exiting critical care beds that are closed due to nursing shortages and difficulties in recruiting nurse for critical care.  The HSE is putting in place a Critical Care Nursing Career Pathway initiative, facilitated by the Critical Care Programme, aimed at increasing the number of critical care nurses.     </p>  <p>  While it has not been possible in 2016 to provide for additional resources for critical care within the limited envelope of additional funding and competing priorities for acute services I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department and the HSE are committed to working together to try to address the capacity deficit over the coming years by prioritising this area for capital and revenue investment.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular queries raised by the Deputy regarding capacity and waiting times, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days he should contact my Private Office and my officials will follow the matter up.</p></reply>

Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care infrastructure is subject to suitable locations being offered/provided/available, to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff. </p>  <p>  There will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer.  As with all capital projects, the further development of the primary care infrastructure, including facilities in County Kilkenny, must be prioritised and considered within the context of the overall capital envelope available to the health service.  The HSE will continue to apply the available funding for infrastructure development in the most effective way possible to meet current and future needs.</p>  <p>  As it is responsible for the management of the health care estate the HSE has been requested to reply directly to the Deputy on the matter.

This provisions would enable the Minister for Health to issue licences permitting the establishment of supervised injecting facilities to provide enhanced clinical support to, and mitigate the problem of public injecting by, chronic drug users.  </p>  <p>  Drafting of the Bill by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel is at an advanced stage and, subject to approval by Government, it is anticipated that it will be published in coming months.</p>  <p>  In the event of the planned legislation becoming law, it is envisaged that initially one supervised injecting facility would be established on a pilot basis in Dublin city centre.  An independent evaluation would be an intrinsic element to this initiative; determining the utility, safety and cost-effectiveness of the supervised injecting facility in an Irish context.  The outcome of such an evaluation will inform any decision to licence further facilities.  In line with the experience of other countries which have established such facilities, it would be expected that the numbers would be few and the locations carefully selected to address most effectively the requirements and concerns of the service users and the wider community.</p></reply>

Co-locating maternity hospitals on the sites of acute hospitals is in line with international best practice, and helps ensure that mothers have immediate access to a full range of medical and support services, should the need arise.  The relocation project is still in its formative stages.  The Rotunda has established a Clinical Vision and Scope Working Group to scope out the design requirements for the new hospital. </p></reply>

There have been a number of high level actions initiated by the HSE, including a much greater focus at hospital level on EWTD compliance and recruitment of a number of additional NCHDs and consultants.  Changes also include revised rostering arrangements with ongoing moves to reform and reconfigure non-compliant rotas, and greater use of off-site on-call. </p>  <p>  As a result of the focus on achieving compliance, the HSE has made significant progress in implementing the EWTD, particularly in the last two years.  It is now close to full compliance with most of the provisions of the Directive, including daily, weekly and fortnightly rest; and daily breaks.  Compliance with the 48 hour week, which now stands at 82%, has improved significantly in the past number of years - up significantly from the 30% level of compliance when the Government took office.  Compliance with the maximum 24 hour shift has also increased with an average of 96% compliance.  The HSE has achieved 97% compliance with the 11 hour daily rest requirement and 99% compliance with weekly/fortnightly rest break requirement.</p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to reply on the matter of the number of hospitals that have been sanctioned for non-compliance with the EWTD.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

Our Embassy in Singapore has consistently encouraged the Irish citizen concerned to continue to engage in the legal process and to keep the Embassy aware of developments.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy will continue to monitor the case closely and will continue to offer consular assistance.</p></reply>

Ireland has been a strong and consistent advocate of this position.</p>  <p>  The European Union has taken a number of steps to differentiate between its treatment of imports from Israel and the importation of goods coming from illegal Israeli settlements.  Settlement goods are not entitled to the lower tariffs that are the norm in the EU, and meat from settlements may not be certified by Israeli veterinary authorities.  EU research funding may not be spent in settlements.  Most recently, the European Commission published guidelines clarifying that goods from Israeli settlements may not be misleadingly labelled as being produce of Israel.  Ireland has supported all of these measures. </p>  <p>  There is no prospect at present of obtaining agreement at EU level on a ban on the import of goods from the settlements.</p></reply>

The violent events in recent months have clearly demonstrated the risks of the continued political vacuum.  I note with concern the statement of 24 March to the Security Council by the UN Special Coordinator that &ldquo;the two state solution is slipping from our fingers&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The March Foreign Affairs Council discussed the latest developments and High Representative Mogherini updated Ministers on plans by the Middle East Quartet to prepare a report with recommendations for de-escalating the violence and promoting a two-state solution.  France also updated the Council on its plans to convene an international conference of key stakeholders in Paris by summer 2016, with the aim of re-launching the peace process.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently given a high priority to the achievement of a &ldquo;two state solution&rdquo;.  The Middle East Peace Process remains a key national foreign policy priority.  Along with our EU partners, Ireland supports all efforts to restart comprehensive negotiations for an overall peace agreement.</p></reply>

Our Embassy in Washington and Consulates elsewhere in the US are active in advocating immigration reform and the issue is also the subject of high level political contacts between Ireland and the US Government. </p>  <p>  During the Taoiseach&rsquo;s recent visit to Washington for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, he met with President Obama, Vice President Biden, Speaker Ryan, Senator Schumer and other key Congressional contacts from both sides of the aisle.  At these meetings the Taoiseach raised the situation of the Irish undocumented in the US and encouraged them to work towards a comprehensive package of immigration reform measures.  The Taoiseach also took the opportunity to address the issue of immigration reform in his speech at the Speaker&rsquo;s lunch at Capitol Hill, where he urged Republicans and Democrats to work together to find a way to resolve the plight of the undocumented Irish in the United States.  I also raised this issue during my visit to Washington and New York for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.</p>  <p>  Following my visit to Washington DC in September 2015, a Bill was tabled by Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner in the US House of Representatives.  The Bill is aimed at providing access to several thousand E3 visas for Irish citizens.  Although I warmly welcome this positive step towards meeting the desire of many Irish people to live and work in the US for a time, I would also point out that there is much work to be done in both Houses of Congress before this Bill might become law.  While this particular measure would advance our objective of securing improved legal migration channels, it would not address the concerns of undocumented citizens currently in the US.  These remain a key priority and continue to be the subject of ongoing contacts with the US authorities. </p>  <p>  The judicial case on President Obama&rsquo;s Executive Actions on immigration reform has now been referred to the US Supreme Court, with a decision expected by the early summer.  If the appeal succeeds and the measure is implemented, President Obama&rsquo;s Executive Action could benefit a significant number of our citizens by lifting the threat of deportation and allowing work and travel more freely within the United States to those undocumented immigrants who meet its conditions.</p>  <p>  The Government as a whole, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin and our Embassy in Washington, will continue to actively pursue all opportunities to advance immigration reform that would benefit our citizens with the US Administration, Congress, the Republican leadership and the US Embassy in Ireland.  In addition, the Government continues to provide significant financial support, &euro;1,592,627 in 2015, to assist the work of various Irish immigration centres across the US.</p></reply>

Successive Irish Governments, in our ongoing bilateral relations with the UK and through the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg, have consistently raised the issue of collusion with the British Government.  </p>  <p>  Many families, including those bereaved by incidents in which collusion has been alleged, continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one, but with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events.  I understand and acknowledge the frustration of families who for too long have had to contend with inadequate mechanisms for addressing their cases.  </p>  <p>  I remain convinced that the provisions of the Stormont House Agreement for dealing with the legacy of the past offer the best possible way of bringing whatever healing is possible to those affected by the Troubles, including those affected by collusion.  When discussing the past in Northern Ireland and its legacy of loss and hurt, tragedies such as the attack on the Rock Bar remain central to our work.  I believe these new institutions can help to deliver truth and justice to families who have waited too long.  It is therefore vitally important that the new institutions have the trust and confidence of the victims and survivors and their families.  Their needs will therefore remain central to the Government&rsquo;s work in this area. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year I wrote to a number of Victims&rsquo; Groups inviting them to submit their perspectives on how best to progress the establishment of the legacy institutions and to put forward their views on possible solutions to outstanding issues, including on the issue of onward disclosure and national security.  Over the last two months, Senior Officials in my Department have consulted with these groups and taken note of their input on this crucial issue. </p>  <p>  I believe that the sharing of such perspectives and ideas will make a valuable contribution to resolving all outstanding issues and securing an agreed basis among the political parties in Northern Ireland for the establishment of the new legacy institutions.  I have of course also discussed the crucial need to deal with the legacy of the past with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on a number of occasions, most recently by telephone on 24 March. </p></reply>

I am particularly conscious of the two all-party motions of this House on the Dublin Monaghan bombings and I hope that we will continue to work collectively to advance their implementation in this new D&aacute;il term. </p><p>In relation to Dublin/Monaghan, the Government fully supports the all-party D&aacute;il motions of July 2008 and May 2011 urging the British Government to allow access by an independent international judicial figure to all original documents in their possession relating to the Dublin-Monaghan<font color="#002041"> b</font>ombings.  I have raised this issue with the British Government on a number of occasions, including most recently on 14 January with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach has also raised this issue with Prime Minister Cameron emphasising the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the D&aacute;il motions.</p><p>I am disappointed to report that despite our urging, the British Government is still considering how to respond to the D&aacute;il motions.  However, I have received assurances from Secretary of State Villiers that the issue remains under consideration by the British Government.  I have made clear to the Secretary of State that there is a pressing need to provide answers to the families of the victims and underlined the fact that this will remain firmly on the political agenda of the Irish Government given that there is an all-party agreement as set out in the D&aacute;il motions of 2008 and 2011. </p><p>I met Justice for the Forgotten on 27 January and updated the group on the Government&rsquo;s more recent discussions with the British Government.  I agreed that the Government will consult the group on any response from the British Government to the D&aacute;il motions.  Given the All-Party nature of the D&aacute;il motions, it will also be important to consult the parties in this House on any such response.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-04-06a.1798.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016040600062#WRW02300"><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that Section 2 of the Official Languages Act 2003 states that &quot;the official languages&quot; of the State are (a) the Irish language (being the national language and the first official language) and (b) the English language (being a second official language) as specified in Article 8 of the Constitution.</p><p>  I can also advise the Deputy, however, that Irish Sign language (ISL) has formal recognition in the Education Act, 1998. Under the Act, it is a function of the Minister for Education and Skills to ensure, subject to the provisions of the Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person.  This includes provision for students learning through ISL.  </p><p>  There are a number of specific supports in place for students who learn through Irish Sign Language (ISL) and a number of initiatives which seek to promote, develop and implement ISL in order that it will achieve greater recognition and use in the education system. These include:</p><p>-  the special schools for the deaf have been encouraged in relation to the use of sign language in class.</p><p>-  funding for an ISL weekly home tuition service through which deaf tutors visit the homes of deaf pre-school children and deaf school-going pupils to provide training in ISL for the deaf children, pupils, their siblings and parents.</p><p>-  funding is also made available through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to enable individual teachers and whole school staff to undertake courses in Irish Sign Language which are available throughout the country  through a variety of providers.</p><p>-  DES Circulars 0071/2011 and 30/2014 in relation to Special Needs Assistant (SNS) restated the role of the SNA to ensure that it includes the necessary duties that are required to support the care needs of Deaf and hard of hearing students, including in relation to provision of ISL support and assistance.</p><p>In addition, the Visiting Teacher Service for Children and Young People with a Hearing Impairment is provided by my Department from the time of referral through to third level education.  The Visiting Teacher service provides advice and support to ensure that the needs of children and young people with hearing impairment are met.  This service is available at pre-school, primary and  post-primary levels.  Specifically, the service works in partnership with parents of pre-school children with hearing impairment, visiting their homes and/or meeting them in groups to inform, advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to their education and overall development and in helping their children to derive maximum benefit from the educational opportunities available.  </p><p>  My Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA), has established and funds a Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for ISL/English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies.  The course modules deal with issues such as sign linguistics, bi-lingualism and socio-linguistics of sign language.  The course is delivered in seminar  sessions/group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design.  </p><p>  Sign language is an option in the Leaving Certificate Applied. There is also an opportunity for students to learn sign language in the course of Transition Year.  </p><p>  In addition, the Post-Primary Languages Initiative has developed a specification for a short course in Irish Sign Language (ISL) which is available as part of the new Junior Cycle.  The emphasis is on developing communication skills in ISL at level A1 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages).  This course develops students' ability to understand ISL in live and in recorded situations, to produce the language and to interact with other signers in a simple way and on familiar topics.  A link to the course is available at:  .</p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published its Policy Advice on the Education of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children in Ireland which makes a number of recommendations for the improvement of educational provision for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children, including recommendations relating to ISL provision.  This policy advice is available on the NCSE's website www.ncse.ie.  A number of the recommendations contained in the policy advice on the Education of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children have been, or are currently in the process of being implemented.  My Department will continue to implement the recommendations in conjunction with other Departments and agencies where necessary, subject to the availability of resources. </p><p>  The National Council for Special Education has also published a parental information leaflet for parents of children who are Deaf of Hard of Hearing, which provides details of the supports which are available for such children.  </p><p>  Finally, the Deputy may be aware that assessment, rehabilitation and information services for children with hearing impairment and their families are funded by the Health Service Executive (HSE), either directly or indirectly.  Services provided include communication therapy and lip reading classes as well as sign language classes.</p></reply>

The focus of both current and future provision is on the development of an inclusive school environment through the whole school planning process, teaching practice, admissions policies, codes of behaviour and whole school evaluation.  In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system for children are allocated on the basis of identified individual educational need.  This includes Traveller children who require additional resources based on need and not on their identity as Travellers. </p><p>  The cuts to which the Deputy refers relate to the reduction in funding for segregated Traveller specific programmes such as Resource Teacher for Travellers, Visiting Teachers Service and the phasing out of Senior Traveller Training Centres.  A portion of the funding previously allocated to segregated education provision for Travellers has been redeployed to mainstream programmes in line with the principle of inclusion. </p><p>  My Department continues to spend in the region of &euro;10m annually on the implementation of the recommendations of the Strategy to complete the transition to full integration of supports for Travellers within the education system.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual pupils but to schools, as a school based resource, in the same manner that teachers are allocated to schools.  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school, taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of all of the children concerned, rather than solely by reference to a pupil's disability categorisation.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where a child has qualified for access to SNA support and a parent feels that their child is not receiving sufficient care support in school, the parent should raise this concern in the first instance with the School Principal or the School Board of Management.</p>  <p>  School management authorities have responsibility for the appointment, management and deployment of SNAs in their school and, therefore, have the potential to adjust or moderate the level of support which is being given to a child in the school.</p></reply>

Many of our schools have special education units included within them.  However, special schools are also necessary to meet the educational needs of pupils whose needs cannot be adequately catered for in a mainstream school.</p>  <p>  The need to establish a new special school would be identified by the National Council for Special Education in conjunction with the Department.  My Department is currently aware that there is an emerging need for Special School placement options in County Cork and consideration of how this need can be met is currently underway.</p></reply>

The previous Government decided to reduce the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.</p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.  Overall, the removal of qualification allowances had the effect of further reducing the pay of new entrant teachers by between 5 and 7 percent.</p>  <p>  The measures above &ndash; which applied to new entrants only and which were in addition to the pay reductions imposed on public servants generally - were implemented at a time of extraordinarily difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.  It is estimated that some 6,700 teachers who entered the profession since 2011 have been affected by the measures.</p>  <p>  The Haddington Road Agreement re-aligned the pay scale for teachers who entered teaching between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 with that of pre-2011 entrants.  An improved pay scale for post-1 February 2012 entrants was also agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement will begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years.  The flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement are proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.</p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  I would advise that if there are concerns in relation to the educational development of the student referred to in Deputy's question these should be raised, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist.</p></reply>

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  Under the Equal Status Act, schools are not permitted to discriminate in admission on any of the grounds set out in the Act.  However the Act contains an exemption which permits schools in which the objective is to provide education that promotes certain religious values, to admit a student of a particular religion in preference to others. </p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015 published in April of last year contained a number of important changes to make enrolment policies fairer and more transparent.  The issue of the need to amend the Equal Status Act was not a feature of the consultation paper published in advance of the Admission to Schools Bill. When the Oireachtas committee considered this matter, it simply noted that "there is a potential tension between Articles 42 (Education) and 44 (Religion) of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, and this poses a particular difficulty when legislating in this policy area."  No amendment to the Equal Status Act has been included in the published Admission to Schools Bill.  I have subsequently made clear my view that this is a matter that does need to be reviewed and addressed, and will need to be a priority for the next Government.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Advisory Group to the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector which was published in April 2012 made a series of recommendations which included a recommendation that the Rules for National Schools, published in 1965, be reviewed and updated, beginning with the deletion of Rule 68.  Rule 68 stated that Religious Instruction was the most important part of the curriculum and that a religious spirit should "inform and vivify the whole work of the school."  </p>  <p>  I accepted this recommendation and rescinded Rule 68 in January of this year.  Its removal is designed to ensure that the basis on which schools operate is in keeping with the diverse and welcoming nature of our modern school system. </p></reply>

The additional safety measures demanded by the Company includes the procedures that it has put in place with random checks of maintenance standards and audits on Bus &Eacute;ireann and Contractors buses equally.  This investment in best practice vehicle maintenance improves the standards of all vehicles that are used to provide services under the School Transport Scheme nationally, and not only those operated directly by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann also conducts thorough six-weekly preventative maintenance checks incorporating stringent safety inspections on all of its school transport vehicles.  Similarly, Contractors are contractually obligated by Bus &Eacute;ireann to carry out a safety inspection of each school bus at a maximum of six-weekly intervals in line with guidelines issued by the Road Safety Authority.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann obliges all Contractors to sign a Contract Agreement with onerous conditions as additional safety measures.  Contractors are contractually obligated, for example, to use only approved vehicles, to operate services in accordance with Bus &Eacute;ireann's instructions, to pick up at approved pick up points, and to provide documentary evidence that safety critical documents such as vehicle roadworthiness certificates, motor insurance with appropriate levels of cover, and PSV Licences are kept current and up to date.  Contractors must advise Bus &Eacute;ireann immediately of any contemplated change of vehicle, and their drivers must be vetted, be medically fit, be licensed to drive the size of vehicle, be able to communicate in English without the aid of a translator, and must comply with Driver CPC regulations.  </p>  <p>  The contract obliges each contractor to keep themselves informed and comply with all recommendations issued by the manufacturer of each school bus as well as all guidelines and recommendations relating to the services including those issued by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Road Safety Authority.    </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the safety of children travelling on the school transport service continues to be of paramount importance to my Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann and the measures put in place by Bus &Eacute;ireann serve to provide assurance that all services provided under the School Transport Scheme are operated to a high standard of safety.</p></reply>

This Government has made considerable progress in implementing the recommendations set out in the Strategy, significantly advancing the goal of achieving a modernised, more flexible and responsive higher education system that is accountable for high quality performance across the full range of higher education activities. </p>  <p>  With regard to the institute of technology sector, the Strategy recommended significant reforms to position the sector to meet national strategic objectives.  In particular, the Strategy recommended consolidation within the sector and a pathway of evolution for those consolidated institutes of technology, to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria and to apply to become technological universities. </p>  <p>  The main purpose of the Technological Universities Bill, which was published in December 2015, is to give effect to the recommendations set out in the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 with regard to the institute of technology sector, including the development of a new technological university model.  In addition, the Bill provides for a number of important reforms to the governance and operation of the existing institutes of technology.</p>  <p>  The Bill sets out the process for the establishment of technological universities.  These institutions will be distinctly different from traditional universities and institutes of technology by virtue of their mission. This differentiated mission includes &ndash;</p>  <p> - a systematic focus on the preparation of graduates for complex professional roles in a changing technological world, </p>  <p> - the advancement of knowledge through applied research and scholarship and the dissemination of this knowledge to meet the needs of society and enterprise, and </p>  <p> - the particular contribution the university will make to the needs of the region in which it is located. </p>  <p>  The Technological University Bill, as published, reflects technological universities' multi-campus nature and their regional focus.  Merging institutes will be multi-campus entities which will continue to provide a broad range of programmes of education and training in each of their campuses.  These institutions will be linked to industry, and will have an enormous impact on our capacity to create and retain jobs in regions such as the South-East and the North-West.</p>  <p>  I want to be very clear on this point - the development of technological universities has the potential to deliver greater opportunity to students in these regions, to staff working in the institutions, and to the broader local economy and society.  While merging institutes will be required to establish unified governance and management structures, they will be multi-campus entities which will continue to provide a broad range of programmes of education and training in each of their campuses.  Indeed, by creating institutions of greater scale and strength, high quality multi-campus technological universities will be able to bring greater social and economic benefits to their respective regions through the delivery of a broad range of high quality education and training in each of their campuses.  </p>  <p>  I would also like to underline that this is much more than a rebranding exercise &ndash; the institutions concerned are required to merge and to achieve high standards across a range of areas before being designated as technological universities.  These include standards relating to the qualifications of staff, the quality of research output, the proportion of students engaged in lifelong learning, and other relevant issues.</p>  <p>  I would also note that the policy underpinning the Technological Universities Bill has been developed over a significant period.  The National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 was adopted in 2011, the Programme for Government included a commitment to the establishment of a multi-campus technological university in the South East, the Higher Education Authority published the criteria for designation as a technological university in 2012, the General Scheme of the Bill was published, and was subject to Oireachtas Scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection in April of 2014.  I am aware that the TUI participated in this process, and many of the Committee's recommendations have been taken into account during the drafting of the Technological Universities Bill. </p>  <p>  The procedure for application for designation as a technological university, as set out in the Technological Universities Bill 2015, is a reiteration of the fourth and final stage of the earlier published 'process and criteria for designation as a technological university'.  The proposed consolidations now emerging within the institute of technology sector, and the development of technological universities as a result, will protect and enhance the distinctive career and enterprise focused missions of institutions in the traditional institute of technology sector while also enhancing their strength and scale.  This improvement in scale will be particularly important in relation to the challenge that applicants for technological university status must address in improving their competitive position nationally and internationally.</p>  <p>  Two of the consortiums have successfully passed stage 3 of the four-stage process which involved the assessment of their project plans by an international panel of experts.  These are the TU4Dublin consortium, made up of Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology, Tallaght and the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, and the Munster Technological University consortium, made up of Cork Institute of Technology and the Institute of Technology Tralee. </p>  <p>  As these proposals have progressed through the four stage process I have reiterated the importance of, and the need for, a process of consultation and engagement with all staff and students. </p>  <p>  The mergers outlined above cannot proceed until the Technological Universities Bill has been enacted and the relevant provisions commenced.  Therefore this Bill, in providing the legislative underpinning for those institutes of technology who have established partnerships and wish to merge, represents an essential milestone in the modernisation and reform agenda for higher education institutions.</p>  <p>  I would also like to point out that institutes of technology which do not choose to follow the evolutionary path set out in the National Strategy for Higher Education, and in this Bill, will continue to make an important contribution to higher education and particularly to the development of their region. </p>  <p>  The National Strategy recommended that the governance structures of all higher education institutions should be reformed to ensure that they are fit for purpose and have the expertise relevant to the governance of a modern higher education institution.  The Technological Universities Bill 2015 sets out a detailed and appropriate legislative framework for the reform of the institute of technology sector and for the establishment of a new type of higher education institution, technological universities.</p>  <p>  I am firmly of the view that its passage will enable the technological sector to continue to provide high quality education and research as part of a more coherent and coordinated higher education system.</p>  <p>  In relation to the position of the Technological Universities Bill, this Bill was at Report Stage at the time of dissolution of the previous D&aacute;il in February 2016.  There is no finalised timeframe for the enactment of this legislation; however, since the Committee Stage of the Bill, my Department has engaged directly with the TUI on its concerns in relation to the Bill.  I have also met directly with TUI representatives.  As a result of this engagement and the Committee Stage debate, I tabled a number of amendments at Report Stage to deal with some of the concerns raised directly with me.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to re-iterate that the TUI, as staff representatives, have consistently sought a full process of consultation in relation to both the process and the legislation, and this has been followed through on by myself, as Minister, the Department and the respective institutes involved in the process.</p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary and this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  There is no requirement on schools to report to my Department on such arrangements.  The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The EWS can be contacted at 01-7718500.</p>  <p>  My Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide.  The system uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and information from the Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and at post-primary level.  The outcome of the latest demographic exercises was that in November 2015, I announced that 4 new primary schools and 9 new post-primary schools will open in 2017 and 2018 to cater for increased demographic needs.  A range of areas nationwide are experiencing increased demographic pressure and these will be kept under ongoing review by my Department.</p>  <p>  In relation to the school referenced in the details supplied I can advise that a building project to provide for a 24 classroom primary school is currently under construction and is expected to be ready for occupation in May 2016.</p></reply>

In this regard, new arrangements were put in place in 2011 for the establishment of new primary and post-primary schools.  These arrangements give parents an opportunity to express their preference for the type of new school to be established.  Thirty-six new schools have opened under this new process since 2011, thirty-four of which are multi-denominational.</p><p>  Parental preferences will also be key to the patronage of the new schools opening in September 2016 and subsequent years to meet demographic demand for school places, including those opening in areas adjacent to the Dublin 6W area.  My Department officials will keep the demographic data for a number of areas nationwide, including the Dublin 6W area, under review, taking into account updated enrolment data and the impact of ongoing and planned expansion of capacity in this, and adjacent, feeder areas.</p><p>  My Department has also been working on expanding diversity of provision in the existing primary school network.  To this end, my Department officials have been in on-going engagement with Catholic Church representatives to progress the reconfiguration of school patronage in particular areas.  To date, eight new primary schools have opened under the patronage divesting process and work is on-going to deliver further options for school patronage diversity in other areas as quickly as possible.</p><p>  In this regard, my Department officials and Archdiocesan authorities have agreed in principle to bring a former school property in Dublin 12 back into use as a school to provide public primary education under new patronage arrangements.  My officials and the Archdiocesan representatives are continuing to work closely on the practicalities of the transfer issues involved.</p></reply>

Being tentative in nature, this estimate is not sufficiently robust for use as a final estimated expenditure figure.  As I noted in my reply, it is difficult to accurately forecast final expenditure on this programme as it will run until next September and public beneficiary bodies generally fund the cost of EGF measures from national budgets and subsequently submit expenditure declarations/claims during and following completion of the programme.  I did however, indicate that take-up of EGF support measures was less than anticipated.  Lower take-up will result in lower than expected expenditure.</p><p>The 3rd implementation report on the programme, published on the dedicated website <i>www.egf.ie</i>, recorded 352 participants in EGF programme measures by mid-December 2015, including 215 former workers and 137 young people under 25 years who are not in employment, education or training (NEETS).  Compared with the targets of assisting 250 former workers and 200 young people, these figures suggest a reach of 86% and 68% respectively.  In terms of the former workers, the report notes the evidence of the improving national economic climate in the re-integration into employment of 65% of the LTAI workforce as at December 2015.  While a positive development, a high re-integration rate will reduce the need to call on EGF supports.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware the Andersen Ireland EGF programme closes next month.  The published implementation reports on that programme indicate a reach of 96% of former workers and 95% of young unemployed people.  The re-integration into employment rate for Andersen former workers at October 2015 was 69%.</p><p>The PWAI EGF programme is at an earlier stage of implementation and will run until June 2017.</p><p>While I am arranging for details of my Department's internal working estimates to be forwarded to the Deputy as requested, I would similarly caution that the figures are tentative and liable to change.</p><p>Efforts will continue until the end of all current EGF programmes to maximise the supports provided to programme beneficiaries.  Each programme has a consultative forum in place, with an independent chairperson, worker and NEET representatives as well as the relevant State bodies and service providers.  These structures facilitate programme implementation to be monitored and the proposal of new measures within the relevant EGF programmes.  Increased emphasis is being placed on supporting NEET persons within the current EGF programmes, with ongoing engagement with both mainstream public and private service providers, the Department of Social Protection and various community and voluntary organisations.  In this context a number of new tailored programmes are currently being developed for NEET persons.</p><p>The EGF process in Ireland was comprehensively reviewed by the Department in 2012 including a public consultation element.  A survey of those eligible under the current EGF programmes is being commissioned by the SOLAS National EGF Coordination Unit.  The results of these surveys will be examined prior to considering the need for a further review of the programmes.</p><p>There are a range of support measures available to eligible beneficiaries under the approved EGF programmes.  Ultimately the take-up of supports is dependent on a large measure of personal choice by, and the personal circumstances of, hundreds of individuals across a two year timeframe.  Where the take-up of EGF measures turns out to be less than initially estimated two years previously, including where different, sometimes less costly or shorter term measures are availed of by individual beneficiaries, this impacts on final expenditure.  Therefore, a range of factors, including the prevailing national, regional or local economic and employment situations, dictate final expenditure on any EGF programme.</p><p>This situation is not unique to Ireland with the majority of EU Member States returning co-funding balances at programme end.  For example, the average EGF budget implementation rate for all 73 EGF programmes encompassed by the European Commission's ex-post evaluation report 2007 &ndash; 2013, which was published in August 2015, stood at 55%, with the lowest being only 3%, whereas the average rate for the first seven completed Irish EGF programmes was 60%.</p></reply>

It is intended that this new model will reduce the inequities in the current system, and also ensure that we are not unnecessarily labelling children from a young age in order to access resources. </p><p>Although there was widespread support for the implementation of the new model, there was not time to address all of the issues in relation to the proposed new model in time to allow for it to be implemented this year.</p><p>  I therefore established a pilot of the new model, which is currently underway in 47 schools, and which will run for the duration of the current school year. </p><p>  This pilot has been developed in order to test the model in a number of schools and to allow for the practical effect of the application of the new model in pilot schools to be gauged.</p><p>  It will also allow us to take into account the learning experiences of schools, principals, pupils and the views of parents over the course of the pilot, prior to the full implementation of the proposed new allocation model. </p></reply>

The change in payment arrangements has not altered this.  Home tutors do not have a contractual relationship with the Department of Education and Skills. </p><p>  The change in payment arrangements from September 2015 was on foot of instructions from the Revenue Commissioners that payments under the Home Tuition Scheme are subject to statutory deductions at source. </p><p>  In order to facilitate parents, my Department agreed to act solely as payroll agents on their behalf.  Payment of the home tuition grant now issues directly to the approved tutor via my Department's Non-Teaching Staff payroll.  Home tutors continue to be engaged by the parent/guardian to provide tuition. </p><p>  Any further queries in relation to PAYE and USC should be directed to the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  The Department of Social Protection has determined that Home Tutors are engaged under a contract for service and are therefore self-employed and subject to PRSI Class S.  Any further queries in relation to PRSI Class should be directed to the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>  A Payroll Information Note for Home Tutors, which is published on my Department's website, will be forwarded to the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-04-06a.2090.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016040600065#WRZ03600"><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that additional teaching supports for pupils with special education needs is provided in two ways. </p><p>  In primary schools, under the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, schools are resourced to cater for pupils whose educational psychological assessment places them in the high incidence, or less complex, disability category.  All mainstream primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources under the GAM to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs or learning support needs.  In post primary schools, similar general allocations have been made to schools to support pupils with high incidence, or learning support, needs.</p><p>  It is a matter for individual schools to use their professional judgement to identify pupils who will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils.  Schools are supported in this regard by guidance from the National Educational Psychological Services.</p><p>  Separately, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular SP. Ed 02/05. </p><p>  I am advised that the diagnosis of Global Development Delay is generally reserved for children under the age of 5 years, when the clinical severity level cannot be reliably assessed during early childhood.  This category is diagnosed when an individual fails to meet expected developmental milestones in several areas of intellectual functioning, and applies to individuals who are unable to undergo systematic assessment on intellectual functioning, including children who are too young to participate in standardised testing.  This category requires reassessment after a period of time.</p><p>  Pupils who have learning support needs, and who have a diagnosis of Global Development Delay, may therefore receive resource teaching/learning support from a schools General Allocation Model, pending further assessment. </p><p>  Where pupils with Global Development Delay may be subsequently assessed as having a low incidence special educational need, such as a moderate general learning difficulty, or one of the other categories of low incidence disability set out in DES Circular 02/05, an additional allocation of resource teaching time may be made to the school to support the child. </p><p>  The criteria for the provision of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support is set out in my Departments Circular DES 30/2014. </p><p>This Circular details that SNA support will be provided to assist children with special educational needs, who also have assessed additional and significant care needs, in an educational context.  As such, support is provided on a basis of an assessment of special educational care needs, as opposed to being based primarily on a diagnosis of a particular disability.  Pupils who have Global Development Delay, and who also have been assessed as having significant care needs may therefore qualify for SNA support, if required.</p><p>  The NCSE will consider all applications for SNA or resource teaching support made by schools.  Schools will be advised of their resource teaching allocations for the 2016/17 school year, prior to the end of the current school year.</p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

In circumstances where children with special educational needs require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.</p><p>  The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools and it does not maintain details of waiting lists in schools.  Parents can choose to enrol children with autism in an early intervention class from the age of three and where such a placement is not available home tuition may be approved.  Children with autism over the age of four may also be eligible for home tuition if a school placement is not available for them.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p><p>  The NCSE continues to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new special classes where necessary subject to the willingness of schools to open classes. </p><p>  I understand that the number of special classes for students with ASD in north Dublin is 86, 16 of which are at post primary level, 59 at primary level and 11 are early intervention classes.  The NCSE have advised that SENOs are currently liaising with schools regarding the establishment of further classes in the Dublin city and Dublin North areas for 2016/17 school year.</p><p>  I have arranged for the Deputy's request for specific detail in relation to placement availability in the area referred to, to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

The Strategy recognises that schools require public investment in their ICT equipment infrastructure and accordingly a fund of &euro;210 million to support the implementation of this Strategy is available beginning with an investment of &euro;30 million in the next school year (2016/2017) rising to &euro;50 million a year towards the end of the Strategy.

However, HAP recipients may access other forms of social housing supports by applying to go on the local authority transfer list.</p>  <p>  I issued a statutory direction to the local authorities involved in the HAP statutory pilot, including those involved in the HAP pilot with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households, instructing them to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefiting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through the transfer option.  I also directed that HAP recipients, who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list. </p>  <p>  In practice, housing authorities inform HAP recipients in writing of their entitlement to apply to go on the transfer list when they are approved for HAP.  As of 31 March 2016, 83 households have transferred from HAP to other forms of social housing support.</p></reply>

Since HAP commenced in September 2014, some 8,000 households have been supported by the scheme and HAP is now available to all qualified households in 19 local authority areas.</p>  <p>  HAP provides for the transfer of responsibility for long-term recipients of rent supplement who have a recognised housing need from the Department of Social Protection to the local authority sector, thus bringing all long-term social housing supports provided by the State together under the local authority system.  Upon its introduction in a local authority area, HAP will replace rent supplement for those with a long-term housing need and who qualify for social housing support; rent supplement will no longer be an option for applicants in such cases.  Local authorities are taking an incremental approach to the transfer of recipients from rent supplement to HAP in their own areas.  This involves close co-operation with local Department of Social Protection offices and individual tenants.  An existing rent supplement recipient who has been determined as eligible for the HAP scheme may transfer to HAP and remain in their current accommodation where the landlord is in agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions of the scheme being met.  Since commencement of the scheme, 2,895 households have transferred to HAP from the Rent Supplement scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, the tenancy agreement is between the landlord and the tenant, not the local authority.  The tenancy is covered by the terms of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended).</p></reply>

Where the estimated requirement is 25,000 new units per annum the construction sector is currently delivering around half that. The supply issue is putting upward pressure on rents which in turn is pushing vulnerable persons into emergency accommodation.</p><p>A number of important measures have been taken already aimed at improving housing viability and increasing supply, through the actions set out in Construction 2020 and the Social Housing<i></i>Strategy 2020.  While I am satisfied that a solid foundation has been laid to ensure that the problems in housing can be overcome it will take an on-going and increased commitment from all stakeholders to deal with the issues comprehensively .</p><p>In order to stimulate the extra supply of houses, in line with the Government&rsquo;s Construction 2020 Strategy, which is available at <font color="#1F497D">,</font>a number of important measures have already been taken. The measures are aimed at improving housing delivery viability and increasing supply. The measures include:</p><p>- the introduction of a vacant site levy;</p><p>- reductions in development contributions and a targeted development contribution rebate scheme in Dublin and Cork to encourage large scale developments at affordable prices;</p><p>- revised Part V provisions;</p><p>- initiatives to improve financing;</p><p>- implementation of new apartment guidelines; and</p><p>- legislative amendments to introduce greater flexibility and streamlining to the Strategic Development Zone provisions of the Planning and Development Acts.</p><p>It is estimated that the measures taken to reduce input costs have decreased the cost of building new residential units by between &euro;20,000 and &euro;40,000, depending on whether apartments or houses are being constructed. The measures should make more housing developments viable at more affordable prices.</p><p>In addition, NAMA is aiming to deliver 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020, with 90% of these units to be in the greater Dublin area.</p><p>With regard to the supply of social housing, the Social Housing Strategy 2020 includes targets and actions to increase the supply of social housing by 110,000 additional units, with 35,000 new units to be delivered by local authorities and approved housing bodies and 75,000 households to be supported mainly through the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme.</p><p>The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>The Social Housing Strategy is being supported through the sanctioning of more than 450 new housing staff for local authorities and the provision of &euro;4 billion in funding. The funding of &euro;1.7 billion already provided for under Budgets 2015 and 2016 supported the delivery of 13,000 social housing units in 2015 and is supporting the achievement of an ambitious target of 17,000 in 2016. The 2015 output represents an increase of 86% on the circa 7,000 units delivered in 2014.</p><p>The report, Social Housing Output in 2015, which I published on 26 January 2016, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>With regard to protecting those renting privately we have significantly strengthened the rights of tenants through the changes introduced under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, enacted last December.</p><p>The Rapid Build Housing Programme will provide solutions, in the shortest possible timeframe, to support families who find themselves in emergency accommodation. The houses in question are high quality, A-rated homes, which, if delivered on a sufficient scale, offer real hope for people in the immediate term.</p><p>While a lot has been achieved, it is clear that further sustained effort is required. To ensure that supply increases on the scale required, all key stakeholders will need to work together to continue to deliver on the two strategies referred to above and to deal with issues such as input costs, investment in key facilitating infrastructure, further legal protections for those renting privately and land prices.</p><p>In relation to legal protections for those renting and land prices, in particular, in my view there may need to be a further debate on the relevant provisions of the Constitution to examine whether we have the right balance between the protected and legitimate rights of individuals, as property owners, and the wider needs of society, including housing needs.</p></reply>

However there is currently a civil remedy available concerning branches or roots of neighbouring trees encroaching on a person&rsquo;s property.</p><p>The previous Minister of State for Housing and Planning wrote to the Minister for Justice in June 2012 to explore the possibility of providing a broader civil law remedy for parties affected by high trees and hedges on adjoining properties. In this regard, advice was sought on the possibility of legislative provision being made whereby a person substantially deprived of the enjoyment of their property, such as the deprivation of light caused by high trees on a neighbouring property, could apply to the Courts for an order, and that the Courts could make an order as they see fit, e.g. to cut the trees back to an appropriate height. Safety considerations relating to overhanging trees could also potentially be addressed in any such provisions.</p><p>The Minister for Justice responded in July 2012 suggesting that disputes of this nature between neighbours could perhaps be more appropriately dealt with through mediation &ndash; which is being increasingly used internationally as a tool for the resolution of civil disputes - rather than through the Courts. In this regard, I understand that the Department of Justice is giving consideration to a Mediation Bill which would assist in<b></b>speeding up the resolution of civil disputes of this nature, reduce legal costs and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings.</p></reply>

Local authorities, the HSE and Tusla (the Child and Family Agency) try to practically support families in emergency accommodation as much as possible so as to minimise any detrimental effects. In addition, 25 additional staff have recently been added to Focus Ireland&rsquo;s Family Homeless Action Team.</p>  <p>  Because of the lack of social housing available and a tightening rental market, move-on options for families in hotels are limited until a reasonable supply of accommodation becomes available under the Social Housing Strategy 2014-2020. In order to help address this, in September 2015 Government specifically approved the initiation of a rapid-delivery housing programme for 500 units for homeless families across Dublin. This programme of rapid-delivery housing provision is being implemented to provide appropriate family accommodation for homeless families currently residing in hotels. The units will provide temporary accommodation in the first instance, offering a greater level of stability, while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured. Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support planning for access to all required services, including welfare, health and housing services.</p></reply>

Prior to their commencement, following careful consideration, the Central Bank made a number of modifications including to Regulation 25(2) which makes reference to the fact that the Central Bank may prescribe, in accordance with section 43 of the Credit Union Act 1997, further classes of investments for credit unions which may include investments in projects of a public nature. The effect of these modifications is that regulation 25(2) now provides that investment in projects of a public nature can include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the recent modifications made by the Central Bank and the willingness of credit unions to actively seek a role in financing the delivery of social housing. I look forward to the ILCU&rsquo;s further engagement with the Central Bank on foot of the regulatory changes made and my Department will continue to engage constructively with the ILCU in relation to their proposal.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.</p>  <p>  With regard to rapid-delivery housing, Government has approved the delivery of 500 units of rapid-delivery housing for homeless households across Dublin.  This programme of rapid-delivery housing provision is being implemented to mitigate the issues associated with an increasing volume of homeless households accommodated in inappropriate commercial hotel arrangements.  The units will provide emergency accommodation for those families currently in hotels in the first instance, offering a greater level of stability while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support planning for access to all required services, including welfare, health and housing services.  The temporary assignment of these units to homeless households, and the duration of occupancy by them, is a matter for housing authorities.  Given that the units will have a 50 to 60 year lifespan, it is intended that they will be available to local authorities for social housing use when they&rsquo;re no longer required to facilitate homeless families moving from hotels.</p></reply>

A planning authority may, when granting a permission under section 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), include conditions requiring the payment of a contribution in respect of public infrastructure and facilities benefiting development in the area of the planning authority.</p><p>Development contributions are levied by planning authorities on the basis of a development contribution scheme approved by the elected members which sets out how contributions are to be applied in their respective functional areas.  The level of contribution, and the types of development to which development contributions should apply, is therefore determined at local authority level in accordance with the powers vested in elected members in this connection.  My role as Minister with regard to development contributions is to provide the necessary overarching legislative and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority.  The adoption of these schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority and it is a matter for the members to determine the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply in their respective functional areas. In effect, local authorities set their own policies in relation to their development contribution schemes, including exemptions from charging in specific circumstances if that is deemed appropriate.</p><p>The practice adopted by Dublin City Council since the introduction of development contribution schemes pursuant to Section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, has always been to exempt social housing from such charges. The current development contribution scheme adopted by Dublin City Council covering the period 2016-2020 which was adopted by the Elected Members on 7 December 2015 provides an exemption for development contributions for &lsquo;<i>Social housing units, including those which are provided in accordance with an agreement made under Part V of the Planning and Development Act (as amended) or which are provided by a voluntary or co-operative housing body, which is recognised as such by the Council&rsquo;.</i>Therefore, the non-application by Dublin City Council of development contributions in respect of houses purchased by recognised housing bodies for social housing purposes is in accordance with the terms of its development contribution scheme as adopted by its elected members.</p></reply>

In this way, the Strategy recognises the record of steady achievement by AHBs over the past 20 years in providing in excess of 28,000 units of quality accommodation.</p><p>Under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), my Department, together with local authorities, can support AHBs to construct, purchase or lease housing units and make them available for social housing.  The housing units are secured under long-term leases/availability arrangements between local authorities and AHBs.</p><p>In addition, capital support is made available to AHBs through the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF), which provides an up-front capital payment of up to 30% of the relevant construction or acquisition cost of a project, facilitating AHBs in raising private finance, including from the Housing Finance Agency (HFA), to acquire or build new social housing units.  The capital advance is repayable by the AHB to the local authority at the end of a payment and availability agreement, usually 30 years.  All proposals for CALF are submitted to my Department by AHBs for review and to ensure that the project complies with the terms of the CALF and that there are sufficient funds available.  The local authority is also required to examine the proposal and report to my Department that it is suitable to meet housing need in the local area; that the properties comply with relevant standards and regulatory requirements; and that the objectives of sustainable communities are being met (for example, that there is not already an over-concentration of social housing in the area).  A detailed independent financial appraisal of the proposal is then conducted by the Housing Agency on my Department&rsquo;s behalf, including a review of the acquisition or construction costs and details relating to the market rents and availability payments sought by the AHB, in order to ensure that the project is sustainable in the long-term and represents value for money.</p><p>Subject to my Department&rsquo;s approval to the proposal, the local authority then enters into a Capital Advance Agreement (CAA) and a payment and availability agreement with the AHB concerned whereby the properties in question are provided for social housing support purposes for a specified period between 10 and 30 years.  Monies paid by the local authority to the AHB for these units are recouped to the local authority from my Department. </p><p>The projects specifically referred to by the Deputy, both of which involve the acquisition of units by an AHB in new residential developments, were assessed by my Department and the relevant local authorities, including from the sustainable communities point of view.  The relevant AHB has received approval for CALF assistance in both cases, subject to the normal terms and conditions of the scheme.  I understand that the balance of loan finance required to meet the purchase price of the units is being acquired by the AHB from the HFA.  The units secured in both developments represent good value for money and will provide secure high quality social housing for around 115 households, including many families currently living in emergency accommodation, in areas of high social housing demand.  </p></reply>

Kerry County Council indicated that its refusal rate is 11.3% and the reasons given for refusals are generally location related.   </p>  <p>  In order to address the refusals issue on a sectoral basis, every local authority has been requested to consider the introduction of a Choice Based Letting (CBL) allocation system to allow social housing applicants to choose properties themselves from those available from the Council&rsquo;s stock.  This regime operates very effectively in some local authorities already. Local authority Chief Executives are currently considering the optimum approach to the introduction of CBL across the entire local authority system.</p>  <p>  Information on the number of households currently on local authorities&rsquo; housing transfer lists is not held by my Department.  The management of transfer lists is a matter for individual housing authorities and the numbers fluctuate continually as, for example, households are granted transfers in accordance with an authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme to take up other accommodation options.  </p></reply>

These programmes include the return of vacant properties to productive use, improving the energy efficiency of social housing stock and providing funding towards the cost of adaptations and extensions to meet the needs of tenants with a disability or to address serious overcrowding.  Allocations for 2016 in respect of these programmes will be formally notified to local authorities shortly and in the meantime, local authorities are progressing the implementation of these services. </p><p>My Department also provides funding for the adaptation of privately owned homes under the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability.

A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented, in line with Government policy.  The introduction of pay-by- weight (PBW) charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure.</p><p>From 1 July 2015, the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2015 required that household kerbside waste collected in approved reusable receptacles (such as bins or caddies) must be weighed by appropriate weighing systems and that this weight reported to the householder at a frequency of at least once a month.</p><p>Roll-out of those requirements was very positive, with local authorities and industry engaging on an extensive compliance assistance programme.  By end July 2015, over 80% of all household waste collectors were compliant with the 2015 legislation.  The majority of those not fully compliant at that time had either equipped their fleet but not had the weighing mechanism calibrated or had ordered but not yet installed the technology.</p><p>Amendments to the Waste Management Act 1996, introduced through the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015, provide the necessary enabling powers to facilitate mandatory <i>charging</i>for household waste collection on a PBW basis and the new charging regime will come in to operation on 1 July 2016.  The Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2016 provide, inter alia, for the introduction of new permit conditions for collectors of household waste, including the obligation to charge on a PBW basis.  Local authorities and industry have already begun engaging on a second compliance assistance programme ahead of the 1 July 2016 deadline.</p><p>It is important to note that some households are already being charged on a PBW basis.  </p><p>This charging mechanism gives households more control over their waste costs and data from county Leitrim, where PBW was introduced in December 2014, estimated an overall saving of approximately 20% under PBW when compared with pay per lift or flat charge schemes that operated in that local authority area.</p><p>However, it is important that all households prevent waste where possible and ensure that they correctly use the food waste and recycling bins to minimise costs.  The less waste you generate and the more you recycle, the less you will pay under PBW: an awareness and education campaign will be rolled out shortly which will assist householders in this regard.</p><p>It is also important to note that waste management costs may vary over time due to market factors such as fluctuations in labour, fuel, treatment or export costs, regardless of the charging mechanism used to collect waste.  However, as set out above, under PBW, householders will now have more control over their costs and will have an opportunity and incentive to minimise such costs.</p></reply>

The first bundle of PPP sites - which is to provide over 500 units in the greater Dublin area - was announced in late 2015.  Site selection for the second bundle is currently being finalised.  A third bundle will be finalised by end of 2016.</p><p>Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) have a key role to play in the provision of high quality sustainable social housing and this is recognised in the Social Housing Strategy.  The Strategy recognises the record of steady achievement by AHBs over the past 20 years in providing in excess of 28,000 units of quality accommodation.  Under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), my Department together with local authorities, can support AHBs to construct, purchase or lease housing units and make them available for social housing.  The housing units are secured under long-term leases/ availability arrangements between local authorities and AHBs.</p><p>To date, 149 units have been constructed by AHBs (31 in 2015 alone) and are available for social housing under long-term lease/availability agreements with local authorities and are being funded through SHCEP.  In addition, funding approval for an additional 591 units to be constructed by AHBs is also in place.  The majority of these units are expected to be constructed and made available for social housing by the end of 2017.  </p></reply>

This funding is provided to compliment the efforts that local authorities make from within their own resources to repair and re-let vacant social houses.  The latter activity has always been part of the ongoing work that local authorities carry out on their social housing stock as part of their responsibilities as housing authorities under Section 58 of the Housing Act, 1966.</p>  <p>  The exchequer funding provided by my Department under the current programme for the return of vacant social houses to productive use is up to &euro;30,000 per unit, which is a strong level of funding support for the repair of a social housing unit.  In fact the average amount claimed under this programme is &euro;12,000 per unit.  Alongside the latter programme, my Department has also recently implemented a new exchequer funding programme to support local authorities in remediating more seriously derelict social houses.  Allocations to local authorities in respect of their proposals under this programme will be made shortly and it is expected that the average cost of remediation per unit will be in the region of &euro;50,000. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the backlog of vacant social housing units that had built up has been strongly addressed as a result of the actions taken by local authorities under their own resources, alongside the two funding programmes my Department supports, both the main programme to support local authorities in addressing vacant social units at up to &euro;30,000 per unit and the programme to remediate more seriously derelict units.</p>  <p>  While these programmes deliver support for the span of repairs, ranging from those units requiring minimal repair before re-letting, up to units that are derelict but repairable and lettable, it is also vital that local authorities continue to play their part in avoiding any future build-up of vacancies through proactive maintenance and repair programmes and the early re-letting of vacated units to those on the waiting list.  </p></reply>

The primary purpose of the Scheme was to assist in the gradual unwinding of loans taken out by housing authorities to purchase land for the social and affordable housing investment programme.  </p><p>Applications to the value of some &euro;163 million in loans were accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme. In respect of &euro;111 million, the loans were fully redeemed by local authorities with funding recouped from my Department, under the original terms of the Scheme.  The remaining &euro;52 million is in the form of annuity loans, for which local authorities are making repayments to the Housing Finance Agency.  Such annuity repayments are recoupable from my Department subject to the local authority complying with the terms of the Scheme.</p><p>In 2013, following a review of the Scheme carried out in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it became evident that further expenditure on the Land Aggregation Scheme, in terms of accepting new applications, was no longer a sustainable option.  The review concluded with the issuance of Circular 35/2013 on 11 December 2013, notifying Local Authorities of the discontinuance of the Scheme in respect of new applications.</p><p>The focus of the Scheme has now shifted to the management and future utilisation of the lands included in the Scheme.  The Housing Agency is the primary body with responsibility for bringing forward recommendations for the optimum utilisation of LAGS lands in consultation with relevant local authorities and subject to Ministerial approval. Details of the sites accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme are set out in the tables below.</p><p>The Housing Agency, in consultation with my Department and local authorities, is updating data and developing a detailed database and GIS map of local authority owned lands, as well as the Land Aggregation Scheme lands, showing their location, size, boundaries and other information.</p><p>The Housing Agency is also responsible for managing the transfer process including technical and legal aspects.  Of the 73 sites accepted into the Scheme, 67 have now fully transferred to the ownership of the Agency.  The remaining 6 sites are at an advanced stage in the transfer process.</p><p>It is a matter for the relevant local authority and the Housing Agency to resolve all outstanding matters affecting the transfer.  In particular, each local authority must ensure that transfer conditions are met.  The Housing Agency must satisfy itself that any required actions have been satisfactorily undertaken prior to any land transfer taking place.</p><p>My Department maintains regular contact with the Agency regarding progress made on land transfers and the potential development of such lands.  I have asked the Agency to continue to prioritise the transfer of lands and to work with the local authorities concern ed in finalising outstanding transfers.</p><p><b>Table 1: Sites accepted under the first phase of the Scheme</b>(<b>Loan capital &amp;amp;

To enable delivery to commence as quickly as possible, the PPP programme is being rolled-out in three bundles. </p><p>The identified site is one of six locations in the greater Dublin area and in the East of the country that were announced as part of the first bundle of sites on 13 October 2015.  The social housing is being developed at these six sites in co-operation with the local authorities in each area.  Two of the sites are located in Dublin City with one each in South Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Louth.</p><p>In accordance with guidance,<i></i>which is published by the Central PPP Unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, there are four specific value for money, or VFM, tests that are applied in the case of PPPs over the course of the planning and procurement process.  These tests focus on assessing whether or not the PPP approach compares favourably with the alternative cost of using traditional procurement to achieve the same result as the PPP.  The purpose, sequence and format of the four VFM tests in the PPP approval process are set out clearly in the central PPP guidance in order to ensure that all PPPs are regularly assessed and do, indeed, offer value for money.  These VFM tests apply in respect of the social housing PPP programme.</p><p>In order to assess the suitability of social housing to be delivered as part of a PPP programme, in 2014 the National Development Finance Agency prepared a <i>Provisional PPP Assessment Report</i>on behalf of the Department of Finance, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department.  This report provided a provisional version of the first of the four VFM tests that are required for all PPP projects.  The other VFM tests are being/will be undertaken as part of the process of assessment and planning involved in the further development of the bundles of sites identified for the programme.</p><p>The units to be delivered under the programme will use what is termed an &lsquo;availability-based&rsquo; PPP model, in which a private sector company designs, builds, finances and maintains the social housing units in return for a &lsquo;unitary payment&rsquo;.  Principally the new model is purely to facilitate the delivery of social housing units for the State.  It does not include private housing.  The &lsquo;availability based&rsquo; model being applied has been used successfully in Ireland for over 15 years to deliver roads, schools and courthouses.  It involves the procurement of a consortium to design, build, finance and maintain, for 25 years, social housing units on sites provided by the State.  During the 25-year contract period the sites remain in State ownership, as distinct from previous housing PPP projects.  The housing units are then handed over to the State after 25 years in a predefined, good quality condition.</p><p>The relevant local authorities will retain responsibility for tenant management during the contract period.  Tenants allocated to PPP units are drawn, in the normal manner, from the local authority social housing waiting list in accordance with that local authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.  The tenants are subject to standard arrangements as apply to other social housing allocations, including in respect of the charging of differential rent.  </p></reply>

The deployment of solar PV in Ireland has the potential to contribute to our renewable energy targets and is one of the technologies being considered in the context of the new support scheme for renewable electricity generation which is expected to be available towards the end of 2016. </p><p>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) provides supports for the use of solar thermal heating technology to both large industry and SMEs.  Households can also avail of grant support for investment in renewable energy installations, including solar thermal, under the Better Energy Homes Scheme.  In addition, the current tax-based support incentives include the Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme which allows individual investors to obtain income tax relief on investments in renewable energy in each tax year.  Moreover, an Accelerated Capital Allowance scheme allows companies to offset the cost of investment in qualifying renewable energy generation technologies, against their tax liabilities in year 1 rather than over a more prolonged period, thus aiding their cash flow.</p><p>Before a final decision is taken on introducing a new support scheme - which may include support for solar PV - my Department will run a public consultation, which will give all interested parties an opportunity to participate in the development of the scheme.  Subject to Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission, i<font color="#0D0D0D">t is expected that a new scheme will be announced towards the end of 2016.</font></p></reply>

The public sector has been set an even more challenging target of 33%.  The strategic importance of public lighting for reaching this target was highlighted in the White Paper on Energy Policy, which I published in December last.  Local Authorities are among the largest energy users in the public sector, and public lighting accounts for the largest part of their electricity use.  Therefore, the upgrading of public lighting by Local Authorities, using proven energy efficient technologies, will be an important project in the forthcoming Public Sector Energy Efficiency Action Plan.</p>  <p>  A National Public Lighting Steering Group was established in 2014 to provide strategic direction for the upgrading of public lighting in Ireland.  The Group is chaired by the City &amp;amp; County Managers Association (CCMA) and includes representatives from Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and my Department. </p>  <p>  The Group&rsquo;s work programme includes completion of an inventory of public lighting assets, working with ESB Networks to ensure the timely implementation of the necessary supporting technical requirements, and the procurement of new, energy efficient, public lighting.

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services in the last four years, and is continuing to invest.  These very significant investments represent a step change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>On 22 December 2015, I formally launched the procurement process for the State intervention to provide high quality, high speed broadband to all premises in Ireland  that may not be served through commercial investment.  The formal procurement process commenced with the publication of the Pre-qualification Questionnaire and Project Information Memorandum.  Five responses were received  from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March.  The responses are now being assessed in line with criteria set down by the Department  with a view to  selecting qualified provider(s) to proceed to the next stage of the procurement i.e. Invitation to Tender (ITT).</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map 2020, which is available at shows the extent of the State Intervention area.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The areas marked AMBER represent the target areas for the proposed State intervention and includes the townland of Cornode, Portroe in the Townland of Garrykennedy, Boherlahan in the townland of Nodstown South and the townland of Knockvilla, County Tipperary.</p><p>The intention is to build out the network in the AMBER area as quickly as possible.  The procurement process is underway and it is proposed to engage with the winning bidder(s) in due course on the optimum rollout strategy, and on the sequencing of the network deployment to maximise efficiencies during network build, having regard to business and consumer needs, and to areas of particularly poor service and areas of strong demand.  All these factors will need to be balanced against the most efficient network rollout and will be agreed during the procurement process.</p><p>Engagement with industry stakeholders as part of the pre-procurement consultations has indicated that the rollout in the Amber area could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award.  In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of addresses in Ireland will have access to high speed services by 2018, with all addresses passed by 2020.</p></reply>

This policy is set out in the White Paper published in 2015, Ireland&rsquo;s Transition to a Low Carbon Future 2015-2030.  The Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy is a charge on all electricity consumers and is a support mechanism used for two very important objectives.  Firstly, it supports electricity generation which was constructed for security of supply purposes, including peat generation.  Secondly, it supports the development of renewable electricity, which is important for both security of supply and for reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation.  The PSO levy is vital to enable Ireland to meet its 40% target for electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020, which in turn is important for the achievement of Ireland's 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy.</p>  <p>  The levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers.  It has been in place since 2001. The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002).  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy in accordance with the legislation, which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception.  Electricity consumers are classified into the following three groups: i) households ii) small users (maximum import capacity of less than 30 kVA) and iii) medium to large users (maximum import capacity of equal to or greater than 30 kVA).  The annual PSO levy amount for 2015/2016 is &euro;325.3 million compared to &euro;335 million in 2014/2015.  This equates to &euro;60.09 per annum for residential customers, &euro;214.50 per annum for small business consumers and &euro;30.14/kVA for medium and large business users.</p>  <p>  While I fully understand and appreciate concerns about the cost of the PSO levy to customers, it is the Government&rsquo;s position that increasing the share of renewable energy in electricity generation in Ireland will enable Ireland to reduce its fossil fuel dependence and vulnerability to rises in international fossil fuel prices.  The PSO levy supports that development and increased security of supply in electricity generation.</p></reply>

However, as mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets, the capacity of the network and proximity to mobile telephone antennas.</p>  <p>  Any customer, including those in Cavan and Monaghan, who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider, in the first instance.  If this fails to resolve matters, customers can refer a complaint to ComReg, who will investigate the service provider&rsquo;s compliance with its contractual obligations.</p>  <p>  My Department has contacted ComReg to seek an update in relation to complaints about coverage in counties Cavan and Monaghan.  Our understanding is that ComReg has been in contact with mobile operators regarding this issue and is awaiting the outcome of these deliberations.</p>  <p>  Upgrades to mobile networks can cause temporary disruptions to coverage, as new equipment is installed and commissioned.  The positive outcome of such disruption is, however, a deployment of an improved service.  My Department has been advised by two mobile operators that they are in the process of upgrading their networks in the Monaghan and Cavan area.  Further significant investment, particularly in 4G technology, is planned throughout 2016.</p>  <p>  While investment in communications infrastructure and services is primarily a matter for the private sector, the National Broadband Plan commits to a range of actions that will facilitate the more efficient commercial investment in the rollout of communications infrastructure.  To this end, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is chairing a working group with the objective of addressing infrastructure access issues identified by industry.  The group includes representatives from my Department, the Local Government Management Agency, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and Local Authorities, and is currently consulting with industry on a range of issues relating to the siting of telecommunications infrastructure.  My Department will continue to actively engage on this issue with a view to facilitating the removal of barriers and the improvement of mobile service nationwide.</p>  <p>  Local Authorities also have an important role to play in terms of facilitating the siting of necessary infrastructure such as masts and antennae.  The Telecoms and Internet Federation, part of IBEC, has been proactive in seeking to meet with Local Authorities and public representatives to fully discuss the various issues around mobile coverage and the factors that can impact on the quality of service consumers&rsquo; experience.  I would encourage all Local Authorities and public representatives to engage with the Telecoms and Internet Federation on these important issues.</p></reply>

The work of the Group will build upon An Post's existing five-year strategy for the network and will address the number and spatial distribution of branches, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts, and training and qualifications for post office employees.

Following the Government decision, my Department requested (Circular RW 3 of 2016) local authorities to submit an immediate list of proposed road repair works by the 5th February 2016.  It was indicated to local authorities that funding would be allocated in 2 tranches with the initial allocation facilitating local authorities to start repairs as quickly as possible and the allocation of a 2nd tranche in May intended to allow some time for the further investigation and evaluation of proposed works, for example in relation to bridges.</p>  <p>  Following receipt and consideration of the returns received from local authorities, the Department announced on the 18 February &euro;85 million in grant allocations to assist local authorities in commencing repairs on regional and local roads.  Local authorities were informed that the Department of Public Expenditure, in approving the additional funding for repair works, has stipulated that the monies involved have to be drawn down this year and that for that reason works listed in returns for implementation in 2017 could not be considered for funding.  Local authorities were also informed that it is very important for them to plan their work programmes so that funding can be fully drawn down by the 30 November 2016. </p>  <p>  The cost of the proposed repair works to national, regional and local roads included in local authorities' returns, together with the allocation provided by my Department in relation to regional and local roads is set out in the table provided.  In addition an &euro;8 million allocation was provided to Transport Infrastructure Ireland for works on national roads damaged as a result of the storms and flooding.  As details of allocations to local authorities in respect of damage to national roads is a matter for TII, I have referred the Deputy's question to TII for direct reply.</p>  <p>  Local authorities have until the 29th April 2016 to submit a second return in relation to additional works on regional and local roads.  Following the second submission, the Department will again assess the proposals received from Councils across the country and follow up as appropriate with a top-up severe weather allocation.</p>  <p>  I understand that local authorities have already started the repair works to remedy damage arising from the recent severe weather and I expect the severe weather allocations to be fully drawn down during the course of the year.  At the end of March 2016, one local authority (Waterford City and County Council) has drawn down severe weather funding of &euro;517,093.</p></reply>

One element of the ID verification procedure is the requirement for face-to-face image capture.  This means that people have to present themselves in person once, and once only, at an NDLS office in order to have their image captured digitally.  Once this has been done, there is no requirement to appear in future when renewing the licence.</p></reply>

At the meeting Uber briefed me on the development of their smartphone applications, the establishment of its Centre of Excellence in Limerick, with the creation of 300 jobs, and Uber's future plans, including the development of its ride-sharing service.  I welcomed the investment that Uber has made in Limerick and noted that Uber's existing services in Ireland fully meet the legal and licensing requirements of the National Transport Authority.  As I recently advised the House, Uber's ridesharing service, Uberpop, would not  comply with our primary legislation, specifically the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 which commenced in 2014. </p>  <p>  The core requirement, with a small number of limited exemptions, is that the carriage of passengers for reward in a public place in any mechanically propelled vehicle with nine or less seats (including the driver's seat) is permitted only in a licensed vehicle driven by a licensed driver. </p>  <p>  The underlying policy which governs this is a concern for passenger safety and a concern for passenger protection in relation to pricing.  The rationale for taxi regulation is to ensure that passengers have a safe vehicle for their journey, with appropriate insurance in place, driven by a driver who has been vetted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, in the case of taxis, with a pre-established and verified charging system. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government's policy is to ensure a high level of standards and professionalism in the industry for both the customer and the industry itself. </p>  <p>  My overall aim in relation to the taxi industry is to continue to strike the right balance between the interests and safety of consumers and having fair and transparent rules for taxi service providers.</p></reply>

The powers and duties of local authorities regarding Burial Grounds are provided for by the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878, as amended by the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1948 and the Local Government Act 1994.  Detailed regulations are made through the Rules and Regulations for the Regulation of Burial Grounds 1888 (as amended).  I understand that the Deputy is referring to land which falls within the Killarney National Park, and specifically within the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park.  The use and transfer of land and property within the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park is, under the Bourn Vincent Memorial Act 1932 (as amended) and the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015, a matter for my Department. </p>  <p>  The Bourn Vincent Memorial Park was formed out of those parts of the Muckross Estate gifted to the State in 1932 by Senator Arthur Rose Vincent, and William Bowers Bourn and Agnes M. Bourn.  A condition of the gift was that the land and properties transferred to the State should be used for the purpose of forming a National Park, and accordingly this is provided for in legislation through section 5(1) of the Bourn Vincent Memorial Act 1932.</p>  <p>  The totality of Killarney National Park is managed by my Department as a Category II protected area (i.e. as a National Park) in accordance with guidelines set down by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).  Moreover, the Park is subject to a number of significant EU environmental designations, including encompassing part of a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive 1992 and a Special Protection Area under the Birds Directive 1979. </p>  <p>  In light of the above and of the statutory obligations contained in the Bourn Vincent Memorial Act 1932 to use the land gifted to the State as National Park, it is appropriate that any development in an area designated as a National Park, a Special Area of Conservation and a Special Protection Area should be limited to what would enhance the conservation status of the area or to necessary works for which no alternative location is possible.</p></reply>

I understand also that no cuts have been applied to the current funding rate for the ECCE programme.<font color="#2F2F2F">In this context, I should mention the role of Gaelscoileanna Teo. as the lead organisation in the Irish-medium Immersion Education and Preschool sector with effect from July 2014.  Under that role, Gaelscoileanna is funded by Foras na Gaeilge to provide advice, assistance and support to people who wish to have their children educated through the medium of Irish, in addition to providing support services for those working in the sector.  </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  Gaelscoileanna currently administers three schemes which provide funding for na&iacute;onra&iacute;.  The Language Support Scheme supports na&iacute;onra staff and non-teaching school staff members who undertake training to improve their Irish language proficiency.  Another </font>scheme - Sc&eacute;im Le Ch&eacute;ile Tr&iacute; Ghaeilge &ndash; makes grants<font color="#2F2F2F">available to na&iacute;onra&iacute;, Irish-medium schools and Gaeltacht schools to fund events through the medium of Irish.  In the case of start-up na&iacute;onra&iacute;, a third scheme offers support to committees who are working to expand the provision of Irish-medium education at preschool level.</font></p></reply>
