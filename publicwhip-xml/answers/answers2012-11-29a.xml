As I noted when I addressed the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland (IBI) Annual Conference earlier this year, &ldquo;Local radio gives a voice and enhances social dialogue for people of all ages ... it provides a forum for local communities; it enhances a local community; it gives confidence to people and indeed is an expression of the community in which the station is broadcast&rdquo;.</p><p>  However, it should be borne in mind that these stations were founded as commercial operations, with the profit motive as their primary objective.</p><p>  Station owners sought and accepted licences on clear terms; terms which included a limited amount of &lsquo;public service&rsquo; type content.  Moreover, in many cases, their success in the licence application process was assisted by the voluntary commitments they gave in regard to the provision of public service type content, over and above that required by the relevant legislation.  The licences were accepted in the knowledge that public funding was not available for small broadcasters.  The fact that some of these stations are now undergoing an understandable degree of financial stress does not mean that the State should immediately step in and provide funding &ndash; they are and remain commercial enterprises.</p><p>  Moreover, it should also be noted that their very popularity in the communities they serve is, in many cases, as a distinct result of the local news content and current affairs type programming that they provide and which, in turn, gives them a strong advertising presence and thus earning potential.</p><p>  Also, I would like to clarify for the Deputy that, even if I were minded to provide public monies to private investors as the Deputy seems to be suggesting EU State Aid rules very definitely apply in this case.</p><p>  It is categorically not possible for the State to simply decide to fund a set of incumbent licence holders during a licence period.  Such a move, quite apart from the reaction of the European authorities, would expose the State to the risk of prosecution from other operators who may have considered applying for a licence were the revenue stream available.</p><p>  Overall, I can see no reason to consider dispersing licence fee revenue to private broadcasters.</p></reply>

This has already been the practice in Ireland in the case of exploration for oil and gas.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Prior to the launch of a Licensing Round for the award of exploration licensing options in Ireland, a Strategic Environmental Assessment or SEA is undertaken.  An SEA, which includes both public consultation and consultation with prescribed bodies, is the process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of Plans and Programmes and prior to their final adoption.  The objectives of the SEA process are to provide for a high level of protection of the environment and to promote sustainable development by contributing to the integration of environmental considerations into the preparation and adoption of specified Plans and Programmes.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  In the event that a project progresses to production, an application for approval of a Plan of Development pursuant to a Petroleum Lease would be subject to a full Environmental Impact Assessment or EIA.  </font>The EIA Directive ensures that the environmental implications of projects are taken into account in the permitting process, before the final decisions are made and it involves the public in the decision&#8211;making process making it more transparent.  The specific requirements of the Directive entail consideration of the potential impacts of the project on population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, including the architectural and archaeological heritage, landscape and the inter-relationship between the above factors.</p><p>  Under the Directive it should be noted that it is not possible to permit a project unless it can be determined following assessment that it would not have an unacceptable environmental or social impact.</p></reply>

The sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy will support this dynamic, successful company and its employees to continue to invest and grow while enhancing competition in the energy market for the benefit of the economy and consumers.</p><p>  Significant progress has been made in implementing the asset disposal programme, in line with our commitments under the EU/ECB/IMF Funding Programme.</p><p>  Tender processes for the appointment of advisors to oversee the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy are significantly advanced.  NewERA is the agency with responsibility for oversight of the sale transaction on behalf of the Government.  My Department is also progressing priority actions to address necessary legislative, regulatory and financial issues with a view to commencing the disposal process in 2013.</p></reply>

The Contract Awards Committee makes arrangements to invite, consider and recommend to the Authority proposals for the provision of broadcasting services additional to the existing broadcasting services provided in the State.</p><p>  Section 25 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides that the Authority and its statutory committees, in performing their functions shall endeavour to ensure that the number and categories of broadcasting services made available in the State best serve the needs of the Irish people bearing in mind their languages and traditions and their cultural diversity.  Section 24 of the Act states that the Authority and its statutory committees shall be independent in the performance of their functions and therefore, I, as Minister have no role in the area of examining the adequacy of the current levels of Irish language broadcasting in this country nor do I have a role in commissioning increased levels of Irish language broadcasting.  These matters fall solely within the remit of the Authority.</p><p>  The Deputy will doubtless be aware that a dedicated independent public service Irish language channel, TG4, is already provided for in this State and has been established since 1996. Section 118(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 outlines the objects of TG4 and Section 118(3) provides that TG4 shall ensure that its programme schedules are primarily in the Irish language.</p><p>  Furthermore, Section 120 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides that RT&Eacute; shall provide to TG4 programme material in the Irish language that will be the equivalent of one hour of daily programming throughout the calendar year.  Section 98 of the Act provides that RT&Eacute; and TG4 shall be independent in the pursuance of their objects.  There are no proposals at present to alter the statutory requirements on RT&Eacute; or TG4 in this regard.</p><p>  I should also point out to the Deputy that both TG4 and RT&Eacute; are reviewed on an annual basis by the Authority to the extent that they are meeting and fulfilling their commitments in respect of their public service objects including their commitments in respect of the Irish language.  The most recent annual review has found no inadequacy in the levels of Irish language broadcasting on RT&Eacute; or TG4.</p></reply>

The objectives of the Children&rsquo;s Code are as follows:</p><p>  To offer protection for children from inappropriate and/or harmful commercial communications;</p><p>  To acknowledge the special susceptibilities of children and ensure that commercial communications do not exploit these susceptibilities;</p><p>  To ensure that commercial communications are fair and present the product or service promoted in a way that is easily interpreted by children and does not raise unrealistic expectations of the capabilities or characteristics of the product or service being promoted, and;</p><p>  To provide unambiguous guidelines to broadcasters, advertisers, parents, guardians and children on the standards they can expect from commercial communications on Irish broadcasting services.</p><p>  With regard to advertising to young people in particular, the BAI is also represented on the Alcohol Marketing Communications Monitoring Body, established by, and reporting to, the Department of Health with the aim of ensuring industry compliance with voluntary codes of practice, agreed by that Department and representatives of the advertising, drinks and media communications industries.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 2009 permit the BAI to provide adequate protection to children from inappropriate media advertising and I have no plans, therefore, to amend the current regime.</p></reply>

The mechanisms by which renewable energy can be traded with another country are provided for under the Renewable Energy Directive in Articles 6-12 on cooperation mechanisms.</p><p>  Countries can agree statistical transfer, which involves the purchase of renewable credits by the importing country in order to meet their target or they can agree joint projects, which involves identifying specific projects for the purpose of renewable trading and agreeing how the projects will be financed and how the renewable value will be counted towards each country&rsquo;s renewable target under the Directive.</p><p>  The use of these cooperation mechanisms under the Directive requires formal agreement between two or more Governments.</p><p>  I have had a number of bilateral discussions with my UK counterpart in this regard and we are actively exploring the possibility of trade in renewable energy between the two jurisdictions, with a view to reaching a Memorandum of Understanding by end year.</p><p>There is no specific target for the volume of 'exported' renewable electricity. Following on from the agreement between the two Governments, this would depend on the ability of project developers to progress successfully through the planning systems and build out their proposed projects.  There are a number of potential developers of large scale projects, some of whom have already entered the public domain.</p></reply>

In the event that Barryroe were to be declared commercial and advance to the production stage then under the 2007 fiscal terms a tax rate of up to 40% would apply.  Additional benefits would flow from the economic activity generated by a new development project.</p><p>  The fiscal terms, which were last revised in 2007, seek to strike a balance between maximising the financial return to the State and the need to set the terms at a level that will encourage mobile international exploration investment to the Irish offshore.  While there have been some positive indicators in terms of a modest upswing in the number of exploration companies active in the Irish offshore over the past decade, the last discovery to be declared commercial was the Corrib gas field which was discovered in 1996.

It is estimated that 8.4% of the energy in transport in Ireland will be achieved by deployment of biofuels.  The Biofuel Obligation currently requires that the amount of biofuels brought to the market is not less than 4% by volume of the relevant disposal of petroleum road transport fuels.  This obligation will increase over time with first increase happening from 2013.</p><p>  Recently, the European Commission circulated a proposal to amend sections of the Renewable Energy Directive.  This proposal will be discussed during the Irish presidency of the EU next year.  One of the amendments proposed is that no more than 5% of the energy in the transport sector should come from biofuels produced from certain crops.  My Department is currently examining the proposal and its implications for meeting the target of 10% renewable energy by 2020.</p><p>  In order to maintain progress towards achieving targets, I intend to increase the Biofuel Obligation from January next year.  This increase will not be affected by the proposed amendment on crop based biofuels as the overall energy content of the obligation will not breach the proposed 5% cap. The rate of the obligation will remain the same until the end of 2014.  Decisions on further increases after 2014 will be taken after any amendments to the Renewable Energy Directive have been finalised.</p></reply>

They calculate that wind generation alone would account for an estimated &#8364;240 million of the &#8364;300 million in avoided gas imports.</p><p>  The calculation is based on a methodology set out in SEAI's Renewable Energy in Ireland &#8211; 2011 report, where the avoided primary energy from the various renewable energies are estimated based on the technologies they would be replacing.  For wind it is assumed that they are replacing marginal gas generation.  This results in a more conservative estimate of avoided primary energy and emissions than taking say the average system generation as used in the International Energy Agency&#8217;s Partial Substitution Methodology.  The estimated avoided primary energy is then used to arrive at an estimated avoided gas import cost figure using the price of natural gas for electricity generation (IEA Energy Prices &amp; Taxes).</p><p>  The above figures relate only to avoided energy import costs.  There is currently sufficient conventional capacity on the grid to cope with a &#8216;no wind&#8217; situation so there wouldn&#8217;t be any additional investment costs.</p><p>  The methodology set out in Renewable Energy in Ireland draws on approaches that were developed for use in baseline studies in credit-based emission trading systems and the IEA partial substitution method.</p><p>  For reference see: Kartha S., Lazarus M. and Bosi M, 2004<i>.

Therefore operational matters are a matter for the Board and management of An Post.  These are areas in which I have no statutory function.</p><p>  Nonetheless, it is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable State company, providing high quality services on a nationwide basis through a network of economically viable post offices.</p><p>  I firmly believe An Post has many strengths.  It is a trusted brand and it also has the largest retail presence in the Country.  I have impressed on the Company the need to further exploit its unique position in this regard and have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins.</p><p>  However, the reality is that the core mail business has suffered a major fall and this has impacted seriously on the Company&rsquo;s revenue flow.  In response, the Company is proactively seeking to keep costs down and diversify its business.  Control of costs must, in particular, be rigorously pursued by the Company in light of the continuing drain on revenue arising from the core mails business.  It is incumbent that it remains in a financially sustainable position.</p><p>  As regards diversification, An Post announced that following the decision of AIB to close a number of branches, an extended range of AIB services will be available through Post Offices in the locality of the closures.  This is beneficial not only to An Post as a commercial body but also to the local communities.</p><p>  Furthermore, in May this year I welcomed the arrangement between An Post One Direct and Aviva which saw 23 Aviva insurance branches become One Direct Outlets.  This not only secured some of the jobs that were at risk due to Aviva's restructuring but it broadened An Post's portfolio of financial services offering to customers.</p><p>  In the context of the public sector reform and service delivery agenda, I continue to engage with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and other Ministers in relation to consideration, as appropriate, of the post office network for transactional elements of the business of Government Departments and Agencies.  I have stressed to my Government colleagues that the network is ideally configured for over the counter transactions.</p></reply>

The scheme is a demand-led programme and the Government has committed &euro;76.146 million in Exchequer funding to the programme in 2012.</p><p>  The Better Energy Homes scheme provides financial assistance for improving energy performance of older homes, built any time before 2006.  The scheme enables homeowners to save money, while improving comfort and reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions.  Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER).</p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to roll out a Pay-As-You-Save (PAYS) retrofit scheme after 2013, to replace the Exchequer funding currently being provided to the Better Energy Programme.  The PAYS concept is an innovative financing mechanism that will allow consumers to finance energy efficient upgrades.  The PAYS scheme proposes that the current suite of Exchequer funded grants for energy efficiency measures, excluding the low-income housing retrofit programme, will be replaced by a comprehensive national energy efficiency scheme open to households and commercial operators.  This should allow consumers to avail of energy efficiency measures using the money that they would have spent on their energy bill.</p><p>  I am pleased to report that the Department, with the assistance of the SEAI, has commenced a project team, staffed with a wide range of industry experience, to deliver a project design to Government in 2013.

ComReg&#8217;s Information Notice, available on the ComReg website , sets out the population coverage obligations that apply to these licences.  In this regard it requires that all licence holders must attain and maintain a minimum coverage of 70% of the population within 3 years.</p><p>  The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.</p><p>  The National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&#8217;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  This plan follows on from the publication of the report of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce and a period of public consultation.  Full details of these reports can be found on my Department&#8217;s website at the following link: </p><p>  The National Broadband Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &#8211; specifically: </p><p>-  70Mbps &#8211; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015;</p><p>-  At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and </p><p>-  A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.</p><p>  It is intended that the private sector will be the key driver of investment with potential State intervention only where the market is unlikely to invest. </p><p>  The plan contains actions for: investment, demand stimulation, infrastructure barrier removal, spectrum policy, potential contribution of State entities, and policy and regulation.  This approach seeks to achieve a step-change in the level of services available throughout the country, by accelerating private sector investment through a range of actions by public stakeholders, and particularly with regard to rural areas where the State expects to co-invest with the private sector in areas where the commercial case for infrastructure investment does not exist. </p><p>  During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.</p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&#8217; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.</p><p>The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This process is expected to take at least a number of months to complete and will identify the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention to ensure that the Government&#8217;s commitment that a minimum of 30Mbps be available throughout the country, is realised.  </p></reply>

The energy efficiency measures, which it funds, are targeted at low income families and will make a lasting impact on energy poverty in the case of individuals benefiting under the scheme.  Exchequer funding of &#8364;23.646 million has been allocated to this programme in 2012, including for an area-based pilot.  The scheme has addressed 87,789 energy poor homes since 2000.  By the end of 2012, the scheme will have delivered energy saving measures to 94,289 homes in energy poverty.</p><p>  There are forty-eight actions identified in the strategy that are being implemented over the lifetime of the report (3 years), including five priority measures: a commitment to review the National Fuel Scheme in the context of examining the feasibility of aligning income supports with the energy efficiency and income of the home, the phased introduction of minimal thermal efficiency standards for rental accommodation, ensuring greater access to energy efficiency measures, reforming the eligibility criteria for energy efficiency schemes and the introduction of an area based approach.</p><p> Work is ongoing by the IDGAE on the implementation of all the actions contained in the strategy, including the introduction of an area-based approach in 2012, reform of eligibility criteria and continued work on improving access to energy efficiency measures through better targeting of at-risk households. <i></i>The Fuel Allowance was reviewed by the Department of Social Protection as part of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in 2011 and in the context of the preparations for Budget 2013.  A dedicated review arising from the Warmer Homes Energy Affordability Strategy has not yet commenced.  </p></reply>

My Department will continue to monitor this situation.  I am assured, however, based on the number of calls received by the helpline being operated by my Department, that the actual figures are much less than that at this stage.  In this regard, call numbers have continued to drop since 24th October week on week and last week there were 44 calls.  The helpline will operate until the end of December to provide assistance and advice to those who have not yet switched to digital TV.  In regard to SAORVIEW, as with the analogue terrestrial TV network that it replaces, the new national digital terrestrial TV service operated by RT&Eacute; and which provides access to the national Irish TV channels on a non-subscription basis i.e. free to air covers 98% of the population.  100% coverage is not possible on a terrestrial network.</p><p>  RT&Eacute; has also rolled out a satellite TV service &ndash; called SAORSAT which is available to 100% of the population and provides access to the Irish public service TV channels on a non-subscription basis i.e. free to air.  It is worth noting that TV licence holders in Ireland are not required to use SAORVIEW and that the Irish TV channels are also available on subscription TV service such as UPC, (over cable or MMDS) or  Sky, (over satellite).  According to the latest figures from Neilsen, Sky has circa 49% share of the TV market in Ireland whilst UPC has approximately 25%.</p></reply>

The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately &euro;1.6 billion in avoided energy costs for the economy in 2020.  The second Action Plan was approved by Government recently and will be published shortly.  The Plan provides a progress report on delivery of the national energy efficiency objectives and shows that Ireland is on track to deliver the 20% energy savings target by 2020.  It will also set out a range of energy saving actions in the public sector, which will be prioritised between now and 2020.</p><p>  The public sector is estimated to spend more than &euro;500 million per annum on energy.  Achieving the 33% savings target for the public sector would save at least &euro;150 million each year in expenditure.  This Government remains firmly committed to meeting this target.  In order to underpin delivery of the national energy savings target, my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is working together to establish a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system whereby all energy usage in the Public Sector will be accounted for and progress will be systematically recorded.  I recently wrote to the head of each of the public bodies, reminding them of their obligation to report annually their energy usage to the SEAI.  Enclosed with each letter was the SEAI report: &lsquo;Energy Use in the Public Sector&rsquo;, which outlines savings achieved to date across the public sector to end-2010 amount to 650 GWh.</p><p>  This year the SEAI has targeted the top 135 public bodies, which account for over 95% of public sector energy consumption.  These organisations will submit detailed energy and activity data to the SEAI.  From this data, detailed progress scorecards will be produced for each organisation.  From 2013 on, an SEAI online energy data system will facilitate all public bodies and schools to report detailed energy data and allow the SEAI to prepare detailed scorecards for all public bodies.</p><p>  Since 2009, my Department through the SEAI has supported over 140 public sector retrofit projects.  This year the Better Energy Workplaces 2012 Fund has offered support to 145 projects &ndash; 44 of which are in the public sector.  This scheme has developed public sector and market competence and capacity for Pay-As-You-Save (PAYS) type models.  I recently approved the formation of an action group and work is underway to develop and deliver in 2013, a national framework for energy performance contracting, which will stimulate mass scale retrofitting projects across the public sector.  This has been complemented by the Government decision to require all public sector bodies to go out to the market for energy services if their energy spend is more than &euro;500,000 per year.  The energy performance contracting framework will allow public bodies to implement projects whilst, most importantly, not relying on additional public expenditure to do so, thus not impacting on their capital budgets whilst also reducing their operating costs.</p><p>  The recently adopted Energy Efficiency Directive will translate elements of the European Efficiency Plan into binding measures on Member States, including an annual rate of renovation for central Government buildings of 3%; an inventory of central Government buildings with a total useful floor area over certain thresholds; and an obligation on public bodies to procure products, services and buildings with high energy efficient performance.  The 3% renovation target for central Government buildings represents a challenge for the Office of Public Works (OPW), however, the energy savings will greatly outweigh the costs of renovation.  My Department will work closely with the OPW over the coming months to prepare a plan for the realisation of this target.</p><p>As outlined above, considerable progress with accompanying savings is being made in energy efficiency in the public sector.  The Deputy can be assured of my strong commitment to realising the goals we have set for energy efficiency in the public sector.  </p></reply>

In that regard, ComReg&#8217;s decision to grant liberalised use licences for an overall length of approximately 17.5 years reflected, amongst other things:</p><p>  -the need for regulatory certainty and efficient infrastructure investment provided by a duration that is compatible with the investment requirements of licensees; and </p><p>  -the importance of striking an appropriate balance between offering assurances to licensees to assist with their business plans, while also not potentially tying up spectrum for unduly long periods, which would stifle the potential for other interested parties to obtain access to this spectrum in the future.</p><p>  -ComReg therefore considered its proposed duration to be appropriate in the circumstances as it would strike an appropriate balance between the need to provide operators with the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment and the need to ensure efficient spectrum management and use (such as the flexibility to re-allocate the spectrum for other uses should the need arise).</p><p>  ComReg also notes its choice of duration is consistent with the durations for liberalised rights of use in the 800, 900, 1800 MHz and/or 2.1 GHz bands offered in other EU Member States.

Oil production is projected to rise from 84million barrels per day in 2011 to 97 million barrels per day in 2035 with the increase coming from natural gas liquids and unconventional sources.</p><p>  Energy policy objectives for Ireland and the European Union are delivering security of supply and reducing the impact of energy costs for consumers and business, through the development of renewable energy resources, enhanced energy efficiency and greater competition.</p><p>  National and EU energy policy objectives are also informed by the critical work of the IEA on all aspects of energy supply.</p><p>  Oil prices are impacted by geo-political uncertainties and fluctuating economic demand in OECD and developing economies.  Volatility in global oil prices underscore the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering national energy efficiency and renewable energy objectives which are aimed at moving the economy away from over reliance on imported carbon intensive fossil fuels.  Irrespective of new global oil and, in particular, gas scenarios, Ireland needs to sustain all efforts to reduce the fossil fuel bill and reduce emissions.  </p><p>  The electrification of transport offers potential for Ireland, not just in terms of energy savings but also because of the opportunity to better utilise grid sourced renewable electricity, as work continues to progressively deliver on the target of 40% renewable generation by 2020.</p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme is also enabling the sustainable growth of an Irish biofuels market affording opportunities for indigenous biofuel producers and displacing traditional oil products in the transport sector.</p><p>The Government is also committed to continuing and enhancing the delivery of significant energy efficiency improvements across the commercial, public and private sector.  Energy efficiency will progressively reduce Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on imported fossil fuels, while supporting energy competitiveness and security as well as employment and economic activity and reducing emissions.  </p></reply>

ComReg is, of course, independent in the exercise of this spectrum management function. </p><p>  As you may be aware ComReg recently completed a multiband spectrum auction process and awarded spectrum rights in the former 800, 900 and 1800 MHz bands.  In the run up to the auction and in accordance with its statutory functions, ComReg consulted extensively on its proposals for the release of spectrum rights of use in these bands.  This award process marks a vital step in allowing for the next generation of advance mobile services to be made available for Irish consumers and businesses from next year.  It was also an extremely good outcome for the Exchequer and the taxpayer with &euro;855m being paid for the spectrum of which over &euro;450m will accrue in 2012.</p><p>  The analogue television network was switched off on 24th October 2012, and the replacement Digital TV service (DTT) Saorview is operating from over 60 transmission sites which provide coverage to over 98% of the population.  In common with the analogue television service before it, DTT does not use all of the available UHF spectrum which is standardised for use by television receiving equipment.  The unused spectrum blocks interleaved between the DTT transmissions are known as &ldquo;white spaces&rdquo;.</p><p>  The future development of DTT and the surrounding white spaces needs further consideration both at a national level as well as at an EU level.  Significant research on future possible uses of white spaces and potential equipment has been undertaken within Ireland.  It is my objective that any further release of spectrum will be done in a way that maximises the economic value of the spectrum whilst ensuring value for money for the taxpayer.  </p></reply>

Responsibility for the regulation of the retail electricity market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Since 4 April 2011 prices in the electricity retail market have been fully deregulated and accordingly the CER no longer sanctions or approves electricity prices in the market.  Business and domestic customers can as a result of deregulation avail of competitive offerings from a number of electricity supply companies.</p><p>  The Public Obligation Service (PSO) levy has been in place since 2001 and is the support mechanism for peat generation and the development of renewable electricity.  The PSO also supports the output of two gas fuelled power plants built in 2005 to secure much needed generation capacity at the time.  The levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by the three peat stations and renewable energy sources.  The levy has supported the connection of more than 1,400 MW of renewable energy, mostly wind, to the electricity grid over the last decade.</p><p>  The CER determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers.  Its legal basis and method of calculation are set out in the regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  The CER publishes its decision on the total amount of the PSO as a result of these calculations annually for the purposes of determining the amount of the PSO to be charged for the forthcoming year starting 1st October.  In August 2012 the CER published its decision paper on the PSO levy for 2012/2013, which came into effect on 1st October 2012.  A total PSO levy of &euro;131.2m has been calculated for 2012/13, of which &euro;47.4 million of the cost is attributable to renewables (i.e. just over one third of the PSO).  The PSO levy amount per customer is estimated by the CER for the coming year to be &euro;27.82 per domestic customer (&euro;2.32 per month), of which approximately &euro;9 per annum would be attributable to renewable energy on this basis.  This is among the lowest costs to consumers for the support of renewables in any EU Member State.</p><p>  It is the case that the development of renewable energy in Ireland is lowering our exposure to the volatile fossil fuel imports market in the long run and that the existing feed-in tariff reflected in the PSO levy is essential to support this development.</p><p>  Under Directive 2009/28/EC Ireland is required to achieve a legally binding renewable energy target by 2020 and as part of the Directive, each Member State was required to produce a National Renewable Energy Action Plan for submission to the European Commission setting out how the target would be achieved.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s target is 16% overall, with a minimum of 10% in the transport sector.  The target has to be met across heat, electricity and transport, which each represent approximately one third of our energy consumption.</p><p>  At end 2011, 6.5% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy consumption was from renewable resources and a further 9.5% is required in the next 8 years if Ireland is to meet its target.  This will require a significant expansion in renewables.  In terms of the electricity sector, Ireland&rsquo;s intention is to meet a large proportion of the national target (40%) through onshore wind, which is cost effective to the electricity consumer.  A decision was taken earlier in 2012 to pursue onshore wind over offshore wind in meeting Ireland&rsquo;s national target in the first instance on cost grounds and in this regard a new feed in tariff scheme was introduced for onshore wind, while it was decided not to introduce a tariff for offshore wind.</p><p>  A number of studies have to date been undertaken to examine the effect of renewables on electricity prices by various bodies including the ESRI, the Irish Wind Energy Association (IWEA) and jointly by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland SEAI) and EirGrid.  The ESRI and IWEA studies both looked at 2020, while the SEAI and EirGrid study looked at 2011.  The SEAI and EirGrid study found that because wind reduces the cost of wholesale electricity when wind is available on the system, the effect of the PSO was cancelled out and the cost was effectively zero.  While this is true for 2011, it is acknowledged that a significant amount of grid build and grid upgrading is required to achieve the 2020 target and the same might not hold true for 2020.  The ESRI study found that wind is a hedge against high fossil fuel prices.  In that regard wind also provides security of supply benefits along with climate and sustainability benefits.</p><p>  My Department, together with the SEAI, CER and EirGrid, are conducting a joint study to look at the anticipated effect of renewables in 2020, taking into account the requirement to upgrade the grid.  </p></reply>

In March 2012 Revenue facilitated a four year phased payment arrangement, which is in excess of normal timelines for such agreements, to help the business pay arrears of tax that had accumulated over the previous number of years.  A condition of the phased arrangement is that current taxes are paid as they fall due, but unfortunately there have been a number of occasions where the business has failed to honour its commitments in this regard. Currently there are both VAT and PAYE/PRSI payments and returns outstanding, as well as certain payments due to the Sheriff, which were agreed by the business separate to its agreement with Revenue.</p><p>  Revenue is conscious that the current economic climate is exerting financial pressure on some businesses and in such circumstances is prepared to work with them to meet their tax obligations, as has been the situation in this case.  However any such assistance must take account of Revenue&rsquo;s responsibility to maintain a level playing field for other businesses that are tax compliant and in that context a moratorium on tax debt cannot be considered.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, Revenue remains committed to engaging with the business but can only do so if there is meaningful engagement and a clear commitment from the business to honour terms as agreed.  In circumstances where the terms of the agreement are not adhered to and where the business does not put realistic alternative proposals to Revenue, then Revenue has no choice but to commence enforcement proceedings to secure the outstanding tax debts.</p></reply>

De-leveraging is achieved through the separation of assets into &lsquo;core&rsquo; and &lsquo;non-core&rsquo; elements, and the gradual run-off and disposal, avoiding a fire-sale, of these non-core assets. The Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR) included assumed losses of &euro;13.2bn for the sale of such assets and as such the banks were assumed to be able to absorb this level of loss from disposal without affecting future capital. The figure of &euro;13.2bn was not broken down by bank by the Central Bank in the FMP Report due to commercial sensitivities.    In this regard, deleveraging has progressed well. Deleveraging of &euro;49.9bn has been achieved by Allied Irish Banks (AIB), Bank of Ireland (BOI) and Permanent TSB from 31 December 2010 to 30 September 2012. Aggregate losses have not been disclosed by the Central bank due to commercial sensitivities and confidentiality of information, however the Pillar Banks where disposals have been concentrated, have disclosed that overall cumulative losses incurred have been within PLAR assumed losses.  </p><p>  The on-going progress in deleveraging and deposit gathering activities has seen BOI make further progress towards improving its Loan to Deposit (LDR) ratio reducing from 136% at June 2012 to less than 130% in November 2012. Similarly, AIB&rsquo;s LDR reduced to less than 120% at the end of October (including loans held for sale) from 125% at end of June.	</p></reply>

However the key general advice for any mortgage holder experiencing difficulties with their mortgage is to engage at an early stage with their bank.    From an overall public policy perspective, a number of steps have been taken to protect all homeowners experiencing mortgage difficulty.  The Central Bank&#8217;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears is a key protection and provides that each bank must put in place a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process to deal with its mortgage customers who are in arrears or pre-arrears and for the establishment of dedicated arrears support units and appeals processes to handle such cases.  The Code highlights the importance of a borrower contacting their lender when they are in arrears or pre-arrears.  The Central Bank has published a guide for consumers on mortgage arrears called &#8216;Mortgage Arrears &#8211; A Consumer Guide to Dealing with your Lender&#8217; and this is available on the Central Bank website:  </p><p><i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>   .   </p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing genuine difficulty.  In this regard, the Government is now actively implementing the main recommendations contained in the &#8216;Keane Report&#8217;.</p><p>   A number of significant milestones have now been achieved:-</p><p>-  The Personal Insolvency Bill was published last June and the Bill has been progressed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence. The D&aacute;il Report stage of the Bill has recently concluded and it is now before the Seanad;</p><p>-  The Minister for Housing and Planning has formally launched the &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme on a nationwide basis;</p><p>-  Lenders have provided details to the Central Bank on their proposed forbearance and loan modification options for appropriate cases.  The roll out of these options has commenced overseen by the Central Bank.</p><p>-  An extensive independent mortgage advice framework has been put in place by the Minister of Social Protection comprising (i) an enhanced website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.keepingyourhome.ie</font></i> (ii) a Mortgage Arrears information helpline and (iii) the provision of free independent &#8216;one-to-one&#8217; professional financial advice to borrowers when considering a long term forbearance/resolution offer from their lender.  The list of accountants providing this service is located on the <i><font color="#0000FF">www.keepingyourhome.ie</font></i> website.</p><p>  The general policy issue of mortgage arrears is of the utmost importance to Government and in recognition of this, the Taoiseach is chairing a special Government committee on mortgage arrears to oversee the overall Government response to tackle the problem. In addition, a high level Steering Group, chaired by the Department of Finance, is continuing to drive the implementation of the recommendations set out in the Inter-Departmental Group on Mortgage Arrears (the &#8216;Keane Report&#8217;).</p></reply>

Pension benefits for those who were members of the scheme prior to 1 January 2010 are based on final salary. The pension benefits of members who joined the scheme on or after 1 January 2010 are based on career average earnings. Unlike most public pension schemes which are funded on a pay as you go basis, the NTMA superannuation scheme is a funded scheme. The NTMA contribution to the scheme is determined on the advice of an independent actuary and is at present set at a level of 25% of payroll in respect of members prior to 1 January 2010 and 10.5% of payroll in respect of members who joined the scheme on or after 1 January 2010.   Pension entitlements are within the standard entitlements in the model public sector defined benefit superannuation scheme. Pension contributions are not paid to individual employees &ndash; they are paid into the scheme. The level of potential pension payments to members is dependent on length of service, based on final salary or career average earnings, with 1/80th of salary accruing for each year of service.</p><p>  In relation to the pension entitlements of the Chief Executive of the NTMA, his contract provides that his pension will be based not on his salary as Chief Executive but on his salary as a director of the NTMA prior to his appointment as Chief Executive.</p><p>  The pension of the Chief Executive of NAMA will ultimately be based on a pro-rata average of his final salary as NAMA Chief Executive and his final salary as an employee of the NTMA. He was appointed to the position of Chief Executive of NAMA on 22 December 2009 and his contract as NAMA Chief Executive is a specified purpose contract, linked to the lifespan of NAMA.</p><p>  The Chief Executives of NTMA and NAMA have waived 15% of salary through the gifting of a proportion of salary to the Exchequer under Section 483 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Gifting of a proportion of salary to the Exchequer under this provision does not affect the calculation of pension benefits.</p><p>  The salary of the Chief Executive of NTMA for 2011 was &euro;490,000 before the voluntary reduction. The salary of the Chief Executive of NAMA for 2011 was &euro;430,000 before the voluntary reduction. The public service Pension-Related Deduction is applied to the Chief Executives of the NTMA and NAMA.	</p></reply>

The purpose of transition management is to enable the market risks, operational risks and costs incurred to be managed systematically. </p><p>  The C&amp;AG Report states that the NTMA outlined the context for the overcharging and that it engages large regulated organisations of scale and substance as transition managers and implements robust contractual arrangements. The NTMA noted that the pricing amendments improperly applied by State Street Bank Europe Ltd were never visible to the NTMA and that the NPRF had been reimbursed for the overcharged amounts. The NTMA stated that it had identified three actions, which were set out in the C&amp;AG Report, which it will implement to mitigate risks specifically associated with activities similar in nature to those encountered on transition number 14. The C&amp;AG made four recommendations which the NTMA will implement to the greatest extent possible, as reflected in the Chief Executive&rsquo;s responses as set out in the C&amp;AG Report.</p><p>  I am satisfied that there is no requirement for any additional measures to be taken. </p></reply>

The responses I have received from each institution are set out below:</p><p><b>PTSB</b></p><p>I have been informed by PTSB that it has not made any such contributions in the period while it was in state ownership.</p><p><b>IBRC </b></p><p>Since nationalisation, I have been advised that the former Anglo Irish Bank made one payment of c. &euro;150,000 to an employee pension scheme in March 2009 that could be considered to fall outside of normal employer contributions. This payment was made in connection with litigation.</p><p>I have been informed that the Bank, in conjunction with its pension advisors, has uncovered no evidence relating to additional payments having been made by the former INBS to their employee pension schemes during the period in question, that could be deemed to fall outside of normal employer contributions.</p><p><b>AIB</b></p><p>AIB (including EBS) has informed me that during the calendar year 2007 it made contributions to its pension schemes in accordance with agreed actuarial funding plans and as required by regulation. Contributions in excess of these were made to address a combination of unscheduled early retirements including ill health related circumstances and the exercise of contractual early retirement rights and amounted to &euro;11m.</p><p>The amounts paid to date are:</p><p><table><tr><th></th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012 to date</th></tr><tr><td>Allied Irish Banks (including EBS)</td><td>&#8364;11m</td><td>&#8364;3.5m</td><td>&#8364;2m</td><td>&#8364;4m</td><td>&#8364;3m</td><td>&#8364;1,101m*</td></tr></table></p><p>* The 2012 figure for AIB includes one off exceptional contributions made in 2012, these contributions were made in the form of a transfer of loans to the pension scheme. The gross value of the loans transferred was &euro;1.1bn but the carrying value of these loans prior to transfer was significantly less than this. This transfer has enabled the early retirement program which is required in order to reduce the cost base of the bank by over &euro;200m per year.</p><p><b>BOI</b></p><p>Bank of Ireland has informed me that it has disclosed the additional deficit-reduction contributions paid to its employee pension schemes in its Annual Report. On Page 265 of the 2011 Annual Report in the &ldquo;Group Pensions Review&rdquo; section, Bank of Ireland discloses the amounts paid in 2010 and 2011 and the expectation for 2012, as a result of the agreement with staff to reduce benefits payable under the Group Pension review. To date the payments are in line with expectations. These payments are consistent with those disclosed in the 2011 Prospectus under risk factors (page 59).</p><p>Prior to 2010 there were a number of smaller contributions made to schemes in deficit, in line with the requirements of the Pensions Regulator in the UK and the Irish Pensions Board, following actuarial valuations of those smaller schemes. The scale of these payments did not warrant separate disclosure in the published accounts.</p></reply>

The Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the current version of which came into effect from 1 January 2011, was issued under the provisions of section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989.  The Code applies to the mortgage lending activities of all entities regulated by the Central Bank, except for credit unions, in respect of loans which are secured by the borrower&#8217;s primary residence.  The Code sets out the framework within which a regulated mortgage lender must engage with a borrower who is in arrears, or pre-arrears, in respect of a loan secured on the borrower&#8217;s primary residence and who is co-operating with the lender.</p><p>  This revised Code sets out new and more detailed requirements that a lender must comply with when dealing with mortgage holders experiencing genuine arrears and financial difficulties.  In particular, it provides that each lender must establish a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) and use this framework when dealing with its mortgage holders experiencing difficulty.  This framework provides for a number of steps such as:</p><p> - communication with borrowers;</p><p> - the use of a standard financial statement to obtain financial information;</p><p> - assessment of the customer&#8217;s circumstances by dedicated arrears support units;</p><p> - resolution, which require the lender to explore all options for an alternative repayment arrangement in order to determine the most viable option in each case, and</p><p> - an appeals process, which initially will be an internal Appeals Board within the institution, to reconsider the matter if the borrower is not satisfied with the proposed resolution response.  There is then the further option if necessary, to appeal to the Financial Services Ombudsman after the internal appeal process has ended.</p><p>  MARP, therefore, is not a scheme as such but rather is a process put in place to govern the interaction between mortgage borrower and lender in circumstances where the former is experiencing genuine difficulty and allows both parties to assess the current situation with a view to coming to an optimal solution.  In particular, a lender is required to explore all options for an alternative repayment arrangement to determine which options are viable for each particular case.</p><p>  Other protections offered to borrowers under the CCMA include the following:</p><p> - all cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the lender;</p><p> - a lender must not apply to the courts to commence legal action for repossession until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower;</p><p> - where a borrower co-operates with the lender, the lender must wait at least 12 months from the date the borrower is classified as a MARP case before applying to the courts to commence legal action;</p><p> - each branch or office of the lender must have one person responsible for dealing with borrowers in difficulty and must also have a dedicated Arrears Support Unit to deal with all MARP cases;</p><p> - lenders are restricted from imposing charges on arrears arising on a mortgage account in arrears where the borrower is co-operating with the lender;</p><p> - all communications about arrears and pre-arrears must be provided in a timely, clear and consumer friendly manner, e.g. information booklet providing details of MARP and dedicated section on website. </p><p>  Quarter 2 2012 Mortgage Arrears Stats published in August shows the number of mortgages secured on Private Dwelling Homes (PDH&#8217;s) which are in arrears. This is also broken down into restructured number and type.  <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>.  The publication of Quarter 3 data is expected in mid-December, will also include information on Buy to Let properties for the first time.</p><p>  Regarding complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman, I am informed by that Office that it introduced a policy last April in response to a number of complaints being submitted to his Office regarding mortgage arrears/pre arrears, to deal with such cases. This policy states that a complainant must first engage with the financial institution in question and fully exhaust the MARP process. The Financial Services Ombudsman will not investigate such complaints where the MARP process has not been exhausted. This gives both parties the opportunity to re-engage with the process and find, where possible, an alternative resolution.  If a complainant uses the MARP process, with either party failing to come to a resolution, the complainant can revert back to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  In that regard, the above procedure has proved relatively successful as it ensures that the respective parties engage with one another, before referral to the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office. However, there have been cases where MARP has been exhausted, and the Ombudsman followed up by investigating such complaints.  Thus far, there have been 6 not upheld, with 5 partly upheld. There have been no cases where the Ombudsman fully upheld such a complaint.</p><p>  The Central Bank also informed me that a review of lenders compliance with the CCMA was carried out by it in 2011, focussing on charges imposed by lenders. Please see a link to the Press Release on the outcome of this review below.  <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></p><p>  Also attached, for information, is a link to the CCMA and the Central Bank&#8217;s Consumer Guide to dealing with your lender below.</p><p><i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></p><p><i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></p><p>  The Central Bank has informed me that it will commence a review of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears in the first quarter of 2013.   The Central Bank would normally conduct a review following a reasonable time after implementation and the Code will require updating due to the introduction of the Personal Insolvency Arrangement insolvency framework as provided for in the Personal Insolvency Bill which is currently before the Oireachtas as well as longer term mortgage resolution options.  The review will take into consideration recent developments that may be relevant to the issue of mortgage arrears.</p></reply>

An independent selection panel met to evaluate and short-list the proposals for oral presentation on 4th March 2011.  Those who did not make the short list were informed of the selection panel's decision on 4th March 2011 and an invitation issued on the same date to those who were short-listed to make an oral presentation.</p><p>  Oral presentations were made to the selection panel by the four short-listed bodies on 31st March and 1st April 2011.

Each of the bodies who made oral presentations on their proposals were informed of the selection panel's decision by letter on 11th April 2011.  The selection panel recommended that CDVEC be designated as the single grant awarding authority on this basis.  My Department acted as secretariat to the independent selection panel.</p><p>  The composition of the independent selection panel was as follows:</p><p>  1. Mr. Pat McLoughlin (Chair) - Chief Executive of the Irish Payment Services Organisation (former Chief Executive of the Eastern Health Board, chair of the Local Government Efficiency Review Group and a member of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes) 2.

The closing date for application under this circular was Friday, 20 April, 2012. Under the staffing arrangements for the current school year which are set out in Department Circular 0007/2012 the latest date for filling a permanent post on a permanent basis through the subsidiary/supplementary panels was the first working day of November. Thereafter, unless there is a surplus permanent teacher to be redeployed, posts are filled on a fixed term basis and if sustained by a school will be filled from the relevant redeployment panel in the 2013/14 school year.</p><p>  My Department has just recently published Circular 0038/12 setting out the arrangements for panel access for fixed term (temporary/substitute) and part-time teachers to the Supplementary Redeployment Panel for the 2013/14 school year. The closing date for application is 14 December, 2012. </p><p>  The core function of the redeployment arrangements is to facilitate the redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers to other schools that have vacancies. The redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers is key to the Department's ability to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers.</p><p>  Thereafter, schools are required under the panel arrangements to fill permanent vacancies from panels (subsidiary and supplementary) set up of eligible fixed-term (temporary/substitute) and part-time teachers. For the 2012/13 school year there were close to 1,700 such teachers on these panels. In any given year there will be a number of teachers on these panels that do not secure a permanent post. </p><p>  All circulars referenced are available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  All schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, have been advised by the NCSE of their SNA staffing allocation for the current school year. Details of the allocations which have been made to each school are available at www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  The NCSE allocates a level of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school. SNAs should then be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  Where schools have enrolled new pupils with special educational needs who were not considered at the time that the allocations for the 2012/13 school year were made, or where schools are in a position to demonstrate that they cannot cater for the care needs of qualifying children from the level of SNA support which has been assigned to them, they may apply to the NCSE for additional SNA support or for a review of their SNA allocation. The NCSE has capacity to allocate new SNA posts to schools where these criteria are met.</p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

It does not, in any way, seek to tamper with the allocation of resources for schools, further education centres, or other educational programmes provided by the VECs.  Each of the new Boards together with the CEO as the accountable person will have to account for the use of resources provided to the Board for education provision in the entire area which it covers.  Existing processes within the Department for resource allocation in respect of educational establishments under the auspices of any Education and Training Board will still continue and the Board/CEO will be accountable for deployment of any such resources for the purposes for which they have been allocated.</p><p>  Consequently, I am satisfied that allocation of the 10 local authority members where more than one local authority will fall within the ETB area, on the basis of population, based on the most recent census, is the most appropriate and fair way to devise the proportions in which each local authority will be represented on the new boards.</p></reply>

An example of the latter would be a vocational education committee.</p><p>  Under Circulars 59/2009 (VEC schools) and 60/2009 (all other schools) procedures were agreed relating to both professional competence issues and procedures relating to work, conduct and matters other than professional competence.  This agreement was made under the terms of Towards 2016 and the procedures were issued in September 2009.</p><p>  The Department is informed of a case going through the disciplinary procedures in two situations.  The first is in the case of unsatisfactory performance where the Inspectorate may be required to participate in an assessment of performance under Stage 3 of the agreed procedures.  The second is in the event that a teacher wishes to appeal the proposed disciplinary action.  In this case the appeal is to a Disciplinary Appeal Panel appointed by the board of management or VEC.  The Department nominates the chairperson of the panel and provides a secretariat to support the work of the panel.  The final decision in respect of the appeal panel recommendation rests with the school's employer.</p><p>  Under Stage 3 of the agreed procedures the Inspectorate have been informed of 2 cases of unsatisfactory performance, 1 in respect of a primary teacher and 1 in respect of a post-primary teacher. In both cases the Inspectorate could not complete their assessment of performance as the teachers resigned from their posts prior to the completion of their assessments.</p><p>  Since the introduction of the agreed procedures, a total of 15 appeals (Stage 5) under the disciplinary procedures have been received.  Of the 6 cases that related to dismissal, 2 were not upheld, 2 were upheld, 1 was upheld with a recommendation and 1 is pending.</p><p>  Outside of these processes, the Department does not keep statistics on individual cases.</p></reply>

The Registrar may make an order to remedy the breach, which is binding and conclusive, and not subject to appeal (section 3(2) of the Trade Union Act 1913).</p><p>- to investigate complaints under section 16(5) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 concerning the operation of secret ballots, following which the Registrar may instruct a trade union to comply with the secret ballot provisions of the Act (section 14(2)). Where such instruction is disregarded the Registrar must inform the Minister, who may revoke the union&rsquo;s negotiating licence.</p><p>- to hear disputes referred to the Registrar under section 10 of the Trade Union Act, 1975 concerning the passing of resolutions approving amalgamations of trade unions.  Under this section, the Registrar may, at the request of the complainant or of the trade union, state a case for the opinion of the High Court on a question of law arising in the proceedings.</p><p>  The powers of the Registrar in relation to such matters have rarely been exercised.  The Registrar has no independent powers of investigation, and can only act where requested to do so on the specific areas mentioned above, or to refer a matter to the court in relation to wilful or fraudulent withholding of money.  This latter option is also available to &ldquo;any person&rdquo; acting on behalf of a trade union.</p><p>  I have no plans to provide for the introduction of a Trade Union Ombudsman as suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.</p><p>  Part-time fire-fighters are entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment in respect of days that they are engaged in fire-fighting or training.

Currently there are 28,295 families in receipt of FIS, getting an average payment of &euro;106.34 per week.  The estimated scheme expenditure for 2012 is &euro;199.46 million.  It is not possible to differentiate the amount representing arrears payments from the amount representing normal weekly payments in the total scheme expenditure.  When cases are decided customers are awarded arrears back to the date of application. Deductions are made for any overlapping Social Welfare payments that may have been made in the period concerned.  I can confirm that almost all FIS claims, both new and renewal, which were awarded during 2012, approximately 32,560 cases up to the end of October, will have received some payment of arrears.</p><p>  An in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project has recently been completed for the FIS scheme.  This project focused on optimising output, improving customer service and the elimination of backlogs.  Part of the project was a detailed examination of workloads and a full assessment of existing capacity within the area and what capacity is needed in order to process the volumes of claims, both new and renewal, being received on a weekly basis.</p><p>  The outcome of this review is a detailed plan outlining the process required to manage both the continuous weekly intake and backlog claims clearance.  This plan sees the current weekly new claim and renewal intake processed by one team, while the backlog is ring-fenced and a focused team assigned to this work with a clear plan for its elimination.</p><p>  The team including additional temporary resources has been identified and is already assigned and working on the backlog claims.  In order to reduce the time it will take to eliminate the backlog, some claims are being processed outside of Longford Social Welfare Services Office.  This team is fully focussed on the elimination of the backlog of claims in the shortest possible timeframe, concentrating in the first instance on those claims which were previously in payment but where payment has expired and continuing on to first-time new claims.  Within those categories, those waiting the longest will be processed first.</p><p>  While it is not possible to clear all claims in the backlog before Christmas, every effort will be made to pay as many eligible claims as possible in that timeframe.  It is expected that the backlog will be fully eliminated by the end of March 2013.  Claims which are approved by the backlog team will be backdated to the date of claim or the date of expiry of the previous claim, as appropriate, and all arrears due will be paid.</p></reply>

The Act provides for a statutory language planning process under which language plans will be prepared at community level in areas seeking to achieve statutory recognition.  This approach puts communities at the centre of the language planning process since it gives them the opportunity to take ownership of their own plan in their own community.</p><p>  In addition to Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas, areas located outside the Gaeltacht may achieve statutory recognition as Gaeltacht Service Towns or as Irish Language Networks, subject to fulfilling language planning criteria. Gaeltacht Service Towns are defined as towns in, or adjacent to, Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas which play a significant role in the delivery of services to those areas.  Irish Language Networks are defined as areas, located outside Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas, in which there is a basic critical mass of community and State support for the Irish language.</p><p>  Since &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is central to community development in the Gaeltacht and provides funding to various community-based organisations, it will assist communities in preparing and implementing language plans in the 19 Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas. &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, or Foras na Gaeilge, as appropriate, will assist organisations in towns seeking statutory recognition as Gaeltacht Service Towns with the preparation and implementation of language plans, depending on whether the town is located inside or outside the Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas.  In addition, Foras na Gaeilge will assist organisations in areas seeking statutory recognition as Irish Language Networks with the preparation and implementation of language plans in those areas.</p><p>  All of these communities will be central to the implementation of the <i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030</i>.  Under the Gaeltacht Act, it is envisaged that language plans will be prepared and implemented by these communities with the support of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta or Foras na Gaeilge, as appropriate.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding some positive recent indications, it is worth recalling that the Corrib gas field, which was discovered in 1996, was the last discovery in the Irish offshore to be declared a commercial discovery.  The only producing gas fields in the Irish offshore are those in the Kinsale area and no oil has been produced to date.</p><p>  The fiscal terms, which were last revised in 2007, seek to reflect the reality of Ireland&rsquo;s exploration experience and seek to strike a balance between maximising the financial return to the State and the need to set the terms at a level that will encourage a greater share of mobile international exploration investment to the Irish offshore.  Without a substantial increase in the level of drilling activity in the Irish offshore, from the current level of about one well per year, the true potential of our natural resources will not to be proven.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal terms are set at a level similar to countries such as France, Portugal and Spain, who, like Ireland, have limited petroleum production and with whom we compete for investment, rather than at a level comparable to countries such as the UK and Norway who are major petroleum producers.   </p></reply>

This target must be met across the electricity, heating and transport sectors, with a sub-target of 10% in transport.  In order to meet 16% of total energy, Ireland requires 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heat in 2020. </p><p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has recently published a report entitled Energy in Ireland.  It shows that in absolute terms, the total use of renewables in Ireland has almost trebled between 2003 and 2011.  In 2011, renewable energy accounted for 6.5% of overall energy:</p><p>-  17.6% of electricity usage</p><p>-  5% of thermal energy</p><p>-  3.6% of transport energy</p><p>  The use of renewable energy avoided the emission of about 3.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2011.  The use of wind energy in 2011 in Ireland is estimated to have reduced fuel imports by about &euro;300 million.  Achieving the requisite increase to meet our legally binding target in the relatively short timeframe available will be challenging.</p><p>  In the electricity sector, EirGrid&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gate 3&rdquo; initiative provides for sufficient new renewable generation to meet the 40% electricity sub-target.  EirGrid is ensuring sufficient grid upgrade as part of its Grid25 programme as well as ensuring under the &ldquo;DS3&rdquo; programme that the necessary operational changes are made to the grid so that our 40% target can be achieved.  It is estimated that around 200 MW of new renewable generation needs to be connected per annum to ensure our target is met.  New renewable plants from onshore wind, hydro and biomass can apply to participate in the REFIT (Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff) scheme, administered by my Department.</p></reply>

This is supported from both national and EU sources.</p><p>  Such work can apply at various stages in the development path from idea to market: from basic research to applied research to development to demonstration to commercialisation.  In the case of renewable energies, depending on the state of maturity of the technology, such research can focus on proof of concept (early research), or performance improvement, or cost efficiency.  For the technologies referenced in the question, hydro and wind are more mature technologies whereas wave energy is still very much at the research and demonstration stage.</p><p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) hosts an energy research web portal on its website at    giving details on projects, technologies and research institutions.  SEAI also annually publishes an inventory of energy research in Ireland, including renewable energies, on those pages.</p><p>  The results of studies to date have indicated that wind energy is in the near term Ireland&#8217;s most abundant, technologically viable and cost competitive renewable energy resource and have further confirmed that the wind energy resource may contribute up to 40% of electricity demand without compromising a stable and reliable electricity system.  It is therefore a renewable energy policy priority to utilise Ireland&#8217;s wind energy resource to the fullest extent possible to meet national 2020 EU renewable energy targets.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the regulation of the retail electricity market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Since 4 April 2011 prices in the electricity retail market have been fully deregulated and business and domestic customers can as a result avail of competitive offerings from a number of electricity supply companies.  Price setting by electricity suppliers is a commercial and operational matter for the companies concerned.</p><p>  Global gas and oil prices have risen sharply since the start of 2011 driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan and demand from the emerging economies of China and India.  There are clear indications that international oil and gas prices will rise further over the coming months.  The Government is most concerned at the impact of higher electricity prices on residential and commercial consumers.  It is the case that in the main Ireland is at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices which dictate the retail price of electricity.</p><p>  At a national level, our competitive energy market helps put downward pressure on prices.  In addition, we must focus on all possible additional actions to mitigate costs where possible for business and domestic customers.  This is essential for competitiveness, employment and for economic recovery.  I am committed to working with enterprise and with the energy sector to ensure that the costs of energy are as competitive as possible through those measures at our disposal including sustained focus on energy efficiency and renewables.</p><p>  The latest analysis of data published by Eurostat for electricity and gas prices is published by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and covers the period July to December 2011.  As usual, price statistics are presented for a number of different business and domestic consumers, differentiated by consumption level.  This material is publicly available.  Most household electricity consumers saw increases of between 18% and 20% in prices during the second half of 2011.  For large domestic electricity consumers, comprising 50% of the share of the domestic electricity market, electricity prices were, on average, 98% of those in the Euro area and 105% of those in the EU area.  In the second half of 2011 prices to business users increased by just under 12% for most customers, on average.  This meant that in the various business user categories, depending on the level of consumption, prices were from 94% to 116% of the EU area average, and from 90% to 110% of the Euro area average.</p></reply>

Of these applications, wind represents 696 applications and other renewable sources represent 183 applications.</p><p>  372 of these applications were received and placed in the queue from the date that the Gate 3 applications were closed which was November 2007.  Until such time as any next gate process is decided upon these applications are not being processed further.</p><p>   It is not straightforward to provide an &ldquo;average waiting time&rdquo; however the majority of these unprocessed applications were received between November 2007 and December 2009.</p><p>  There has been considerable growth in the deployment of wind farms in Ireland from around 300 Mega Watts of capacity in 2005, to over 1,600 Mega Watts of capacity operational in the market today.</p><p>  The latest forecasts from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland as to the amount of renewable generation required to meet our 40% renewable electricity target is around 4000 MW of operational capacity, subject to achieving our energy efficiency goals.  Currently, approximately 2000 MW of renewable generation is connected to the grid including over 1600 MW of wind generation.  A further 1500 MW of renewable generation, almost all of which is new wind generating capacity, has contracted with either EirGrid or ESB Networks.</p><p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) operates a processing approach for wind projects looking to connect to the electricity grid.  This allows for a strategic view to be taken of network requirements and serves to put in place efficient connection solutions to cater for a large number of applications and to ensure optimum network development, minimising network costs and, where possible, avoidance of network bottlenecks.  The EirGrid GRID25 strategy was devised to put in place the necessary infrastructure needed to underpin this market growth.</p><p>  To date there have been 3 Gates and in the latest Gate 3 phase some 3900 MW of offers have issued to renewable generators.  The take up of Gate 3 offers cannot be quantified as yet.  Somewhere around 500 MW of Gate 3 have accepted their offers to date and have already contracted with EirGrid or ESB Networks.  It is expected that between what is already built in Gate 1 and Gate 2 and what has already contracted to build along with the remainder of Gate 3 is largely sufficient for the achievement of our 40% target, even if some Gate 3 developers ultimately decide not to accept their offer.</p></reply>

It is estimated that 8.4% of the energy in transport in Ireland will be achieved by deployment of biofuels by 2020.  The Biofuel Obligation currently requires that the amount of biofuels brought to the market is not less than 4% by volume of the relevant disposal of petroleum road transport fuels.  This obligation will increase over time with the first increase happening from 2013.  The biofuel obligation has successfully delivered increased amounts of biofuel in Ireland resulting in 145 million litres of biofuel being placed on the Irish market in 2011.  It will ensure the sustainable growth of the Irish biofuels market thus supporting the growth of sustainable indigenous production of biofuels.</p></reply>

This shows that Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy import dependency reached 90% in 2006 but has decreased to 88% in 2011.  The SEAI report highlights that a number of factors influence this trend, including reduced production of domestic gas and peat.  However, in recent years Ireland has begun to harness significant quantities of renewable resources.  In 2011, renewable energy grew by 24% to represent 6.4% of Ireland&rsquo;s gross final energy use.</p><p>  Energy policy objectives for Ireland and the European Union are delivering security of supply and reducing the impact of energy costs for consumers and business through the development of renewable energy resources, enhanced energy efficiency and greater competition.  National and EU energy policy objectives are also informed by the vital work of the IEA on all aspects of energy supply.</p><p>  Ireland, however, remains critically dependent on imported fossil fuels, particularly oil and natural gas, which are subject to price volatility and geopolitical risks.  This dependency underlines the immediate and long term imperatives of enhancing energy security and moving to more sustainable forms of energy.  It is also critical for climate change targets.  The Government is also committed to continuing and enhancing the delivery of significant energy efficiency improvements across the commercial, public and private sector.  Energy efficiency will progressively reduce Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on imported fossil fuels, while supporting energy competitiveness and security as well as employment and economic activity and reducing emissions.</p></reply>

Increased interconnection between the UK and Ireland offers Irish developers the prospect of being able to access a much larger electricity market.  </p><p>  The electricity market in GB is around ten times the scale of the electricity market in Ireland.  In the short term there are opportunities for on and offshore wind and biomass projects, but in the medium to longer term as technologies mature and become commercially deployable, there will also be opportunities for wave and tidal developers.  The volume of such trade that may develop over time depends on the ability of developers to successfully bring their projects through planning stages and achieve market access for their projects in the UK market.</p><p>  There are currently a number of potential project developers that have expressed interest in renewable export.  I have had a number of bilateral discussions with my UK counterpart in this regard and my officials are actively exploring the possibility of trade in renewable energy between the two jurisdictions, with a view to reaching a Memorandum of Understanding by end year.  If the Irish Government decides to enter an Inter-Governmental agreement under the Directive with the UK or another Government, it will have to ensure sufficient return and benefits to the state from such projects.  This would likely include either a share of the renewable value or the imposition of a royalty of some type.</p></reply>

Licences to provide mobile telephony services are granted by ComReg pursuant to the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, as amended, and have been issued to the following Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), Vodafone, O2, Meteor and H3G.  There are also a number of Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) in Ireland such as Tesco Mobile Ireland, E-mobile, Postfone and Lycamobile who have entered into commercial wholesale network access arrangements with MNOs.</p><p>  Their licences, among other things, require MNOs to provide a minimum level, of both population coverage and quality of service.  In practice in all cases networks exceed the minimum stipulated coverage and quality of service requirements for commercial reasons.  Compliance with licence requirements is assessed bi-annually by ComReg.  Any discrepancies with the requirements of the Licence, found during the assessment have to be addressed by the MNO concerned to ComReg&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p><p>Furthermore, if any consumer raises a complaint with an MNO and the consumer is unhappy with the MNOs response, then, I understand that the ComReg will progress such complaints with the MNO concerned in an attempt to reach a resolution.</p></reply>

I have impressed on the Company the need to further exploit its unique position in this regard and have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins.</p><p>  This strategy is bearing fruit with the enhanced arrangement with AIB and its agreement with Aviva for the transfer of Aviva Ireland&rsquo;s branch offices personal insurance business book to One Direct. </p><p>  In the context of the public sector transformation agenda, I will continue to engage with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to consideration, as appropriate, of the post office network for transactional elements of the business of Government Departments and Agencies and have stressed to my Government colleagues that the network is ideally configured for over the counter transactions.</p><p>  In relation to postal services, the Government&rsquo;s core policy goal for the postal sector is to ensure that Irish customers, both business and residential, enjoy competitively priced, high quality postal services.  The Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011 has put in place a robust and appropriate regulatory framework for the postal services market.</p><p>  While I have overall responsibility for the postal sector, the Act charges the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), as the postal regulator, with the promotion of the development of the postal sector and particularly the availability of the universal postal service, the promotion of the interests of users and the facilitation of the development of competition in the sector.  ComReg is in regular contact with my Department.</p><p>  Under the 2011 Act, An Post is statutorily required, as the designated universal service provider, to provide a universal postal service.  The essential element of this obligation is the collection and delivery of mail to every address in the State on every working day.</p><p>  The universal service obligation is a form of safety net, ensuring by way of regulatory obligations that a minimum set of services is provided at an affordable price for the benefit of all users, irrespective of their geographical location.  It is a fundamental principle of the regulatory framework for postal services and is an explicit requirement of the EU Postal Services Directive which has provided for the gradual and controlled opening of the postal services market to competition.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act of 2011 also makes provision for a compensation mechanism, to be met by the postal industry, if it is found that the universal service obligation is an unfair burden on the designated universal service provider.  </p></reply>

With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  </p><p>  The National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&#8217;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  This plan follows on from the publication of the report of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce and a period of public consultation.  Full details of these reports can be found on my Department&#8217;s website at the following link: </p><p>  The National Broadband Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &#8211; specifically:</p><p>- 70Mbps &#8211; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; </p><p>- At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and</p><p>- A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.</p><p>  It is intended that the private sector will be the key driver of investment with potential State intervention only where the market is unlikely to invest. </p><p>  The plan contains actions for: investment, demand stimulation, infrastructure barrier removal, spectrum policy, potential contribution of State entities, and policy and regulation.</p><p>  This approach seeks to achieve a step-change in the level of services available throughout the country, by accelerating private sector investment through a range of actions by public stakeholders, and particularly with regard to rural areas where the State expects to co-invest with the private sector in areas where the commercial case for infrastructure investment does not exist. </p><p>  During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.  </p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&#8217; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.</p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This process is expected to take at least a number of months to complete and will identify the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention to ensure that the Government&#8217;s commitment to ensure that a minimum of 30Mbps is available throughout the country.</p></reply>

Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:</p><p>- Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;</p><p>- Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;</p><p>- Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and</p><p>- Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents. Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorisation process include, <i>inter alia</i> :</p><p>- the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting facilities, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;</p><p>- the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;</p><p>- the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;</p><p>- the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;</p><p>- the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned and,</p><p>- where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with.</p><p>  This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.  Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge. The list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012. </p><p>  Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</p></reply>

This involves,<i> inter alia</i>, an enhanced role for local government in local and community development and seeks to create greater efficiencies in structural arrangements and service delivery to the citizen, at local level. </p><p>  In June 2012 my Department requested that CPLN Local Development Company, Dodder Valley Local Development Company and South Dublin County Council (SDCC) develop a plan to establish a single structure for Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) delivery in the two areas in question. The new structure will operate within the SDCC boundary and will facilitate the generation of efficiencies; in the longer term it will allow a more effective sharing of resources, reducing overall administration and operating costs, while at the same time preserving the core, front-line element of the LCDP. </p><p>  Following consultations between my Department, the Chairpersons, CEOs and Boards of Management of both companies and SDCC, an agreement was reached. This involves the establishment of a single Company to promote and deliver Local and Community Development Programmes in the South County Dublin Area. In advancing this work and the broader alignment initiative, I am concerned that the integrity of the local development model is protected as outlined in the Alignment Report, while bearing in mind our fiscal constraints. </p><p>Guidelines for the governance of all Local Development Companies were drawn up in 2007 and these include a structure for the Board of each Company. The Board structure of the new company will allow for a strong community presence commensurate with the catchment area for the merged entities.   </p></reply>

General Purpose Grants contribute to meeting the difference between the cost to local authorities of providing a reasonable level of services and the income available to them from local sources and from specific grants.     </p><p>  Local authorities cost and income bases vary significantly from one another and calculating an appropriate distribution of these grants is complex. General purpose grants from the Local Government Fund are structured to bring about equalisation over time; that is a position of balance where the financial needs of local authorities are met by their resources and they are able to provide an appropriate level of service to their customers.       </p><p>  In determining these grants a number of factors are taken into account including the overall funding available for this purpose, the estimated cost to each authority of providing a reasonable level of services to their customers, the income each authority should generate from local sources and the necessity to provide each authority with a baseline allocation that will support its financial stability .   </p><p>  In line with previous years, it is my intention to inform local authorities of their 2013 general purpose grant allocations following the announcement of Budget 2013. I will seek to contribute to the general purpose funding of local authorities to the maximum extent possible in 2013, having regard to the current pressures on the public finances and motor tax income. </p></reply>

The Limerick Regeneration Agencies (Northside and Southside) were established in June 2007 for a five-year term to 14 June 2012 for the purposes of building confidence and trust within the communities in Limerick and to facilitate a coordinated public sector response to the regeneration process. On the completion of their five-year term, the functions, assets, undertakings and liabilities of the Agencies were formally transferred to Limerick City Council, pending the establishment of the new Limerick Unitary Authority, with a new dedicated Office of Regeneration taking responsibility for managing and implementing the regeneration programme. </p><p>   The Office of Regeneration, with a dedicated staff of 23 administrative, technical and professional personnel, is headed by a Director of Regeneration, reporting directly to the Unitary Authority Manager. The Office currently has four staff at Senior Executive Officer/Project Manager level to administer the social and economic regeneration programmes and the delivery of the physical implementation plans for the relevant areas. Two senior staff members are located at Moyross and Southill respectively. A complement of staff, including technical and professional staff with appropriate skills in the areas of planning, design and engineering services, are deployed at the Office of Regeneration to support the delivery of regeneration in the city.   </p><p>  The Director is charged with overseeing the transfer of functions from the Agencies to Limerick City Council and progressing the compilation and implementation of strategies and programmes for the physical, social and economic regeneration of the four areas concerned. This new Office, with key decision makers working in a single, unified team, will accelerate the delivery of projects as the regeneration process transitions from the planning to the implementation phase. Regeneration is retained as a separate entity with its own dedicated staff and annual capital budgets which gives a new impetus to regeneration and builds on the foundations laid so far by the Agencies. </p><p>  Over the past five years, a robust framework has been put in place to facilitate consultation with stakeholder groups on wide-ranging issues relating to the development and implementation of social and physical regeneration strategies. The Office of Regeneration is engaging with this framework to deliver, as a priority, robust Implementation Plans which will act as a roadmap for regeneration in the coming years. An Implementation Plan for the physical, social and economic regeneration of the four areas will be published shortly by the Office of Regeneration   . </p><p>My Department retains overall responsibility for the policy and funding of the National Regeneration Programme. The programme is managed by an experienced team of administrative and technical personnel with a range of financial management, project management, planning, design, engineering and quantity surveying skills.   </p></reply>

The Garda Commissioner has assured me that each and every line of inquiry is being or will be pursued.  Upon receipt of a final report from the Commissioner I will review the situation.</p><p>  I understand that the officers carrying out the examination are continuing to keep the family members of the deceased updated on progress.  While I fully appreciate the concerns expressed about the case,  the best form of justice for the Molloy family would be for anyone with a criminal liability for their relative's death to be brought to account through facing charges.  This can only be achieved through a Garda investigation and, where evidence of criminal wrongdoing is available, through the submission of a file by the Garda&iacute; to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I hope the Deputy will therefore agree that, in the first instance, we need to allow the present Garda examination to proceed to its conclusion.</p></reply>

I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review. </p><p>  In this context the Courts Service has established a general framework within which venues are being considered for closure taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue which has now commenced. </p><p>  However, the Courts Service has assured me that no decision in relation to the future of any County Mayo courthouse will be taken without prior consultation with local interested parties and court users.  Such consultation has already begun and the views received will be taken into account in the decision making process which will be a matter for the Courts Service Board.    <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

To the extent that all prosecutions are disclosed under existing arrangements, a prosecution resulting in an order dismissing the charges under the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 would be disclosed. </p><p>  However, this will no longer be the case following the enactment and commencement of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012.  Under that Bill, &quot;criminal records&quot; which will be subject to automatic disclosure are defined (in section 2) as </p><p>  &quot;(a) a record of the person's convictions, whether within or outside the State, for any criminal offences, together with any ancillary or consequential orders made pursuant to the convictions concerned, or</p><p>  (b) a record of any prosecutions pending against the person, whether within or outside the State, for any criminal offence, </p><p>  or both;&quot;.</p><p>  As automatic disclosures will be limited to convictions or pending prosecutions, an order dismissing the charge under the Probation of Offenders Act 1907, will not be automatically disclosed on foot of an application for a vetting disclosure following the commencement of the new vetting legislation.  However, it may be information which could be disclosed under the category of 'specified information'.  Under the Bill, this is information, other than criminal records, which concerns a finding or allegation of harm to another person which is of such a nature as to reasonably give rise to a bona fide concern that the person may harm a child or vulnerable person.  However, the disclosure of such information is subject to the prior notice of the vetting subject and requires a pre-disclosure assessment as to the relevance of the information concerned to the type of work or activity to which the application for vetting relates.  There is also provision for the vetting subject to appeal a decision to disclose such information.    </p><p>  It is expected that the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill which is currently being considered by Seanad &Eacute;ireann, having passed all stages in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, will be enacted by Christmas with commencement scheduled for March 2013.</p></reply>

It also recasts a number of the key provisions in the 2010 Act in relation to instalments, recovery orders and community service orders, which will necessitate amendments to sections 15, 16 and 18 of the Act, as well as consequential changes to section 19.

Very difficult choices will have to be made in relation to the funding of schemes and services in order to remain within the reduced allocation.

This is not only the case in Ireland, where the CAP underpins our national agri-food development strategy, but also at European level, where the agriculture sector can contribute significantly to economic recovery.  My Government colleagues and I are fully committed to securing a properly funded CAP budget in the context of the ongoing negotiations on the EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the 2014-20 period.  We are also committed to defending Ireland's share of it by ensuring our levels of direct payments and rural development funding are protected to the maximum extent possible.  We are disappointed that it was not possible to reach a deal on the MFF at last week&rsquo;s European Council meeting, but we will continue to strongly support the CAP budget lines in the renewed negotiations.  As regards the overall level of CAP funding, the Commission&rsquo;s original proposal to maintain spending at 2013 levels in nominal terms was regarded by Ireland as a reasonable starting point in the negotiations.  At last week's European Council meeting, the Taoiseach again strongly defended CAP funding, as did some other Heads of Government.  Ireland will continue to work with others to get the best possible deal for the CAP in the MFF.  In relation to the distribution of CAP funds, Ireland is broadly supportive of the Commission's proposals on Pillar 1.  On the distribution of Pillar 2 funds, we still await a definitive proposal from the Commission but we will again be seeking to ensure that Ireland receives its fair share, recognising our effectiveness in using these funds in the past.</p></reply>

As total funding available under the Programme is &euro;1 million per annum, it was necessary, at the outset, to place an upper limit on the number of places in the Programme in order to maximise its effectiveness within the budgetary provision.  Since the numbers who applied to enter the Programme greatly exceeded the number of places available, all applications were assessed and ranked according to specific criteria.  The person named was an eligible applicant but did not score sufficiently highly on the basis of the criteria laid down to be included in the Programme.  The applicant was notified of this outcome by letter dated 29 July 2010.  Applicants were advised of the opportunity to appeal their scoring by 19 August 2010, should any of the data used have required correction.  The person named did not appeal at that time but has since appealed the Department's decision in a letter dated 6 September 2012.  Unfortunately, my Department had to reject the appeal as it was over two years late. </p></reply>

Information is also available on the Department&#8217;s website, including information on the symptoms of the disease and contact information for anyone who believes they may have infected trees.  A poster providing information about the disease is currently being distributed for display in the offices of my Department, Teagasc, Coillte and NPWS throughout the country, as well as other relevant private sector offices.  In addition, the Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, Shane McEntee, has had a number of meetings with representatives of the forest industry in relation to this disease, including forest nurseries, hurley makers, forest owner organisations, professional foresters and forestry contractors.  This week, my Department provided training to Coillte staff and registered private foresters on how to recognise <i>chalara fraxinea</i> infected ash trees in winter months.  It is envisaged that these measures will provide forest owners and managers with the knowledge and skills to identify the symptoms of the disease and allow for early intervention.  In terms of remediating forests affected by <i>chalara fraxinea</i>, my Department is examining the options available for re-establishing those forests and restoring them to their condition prior to the outbreak of this disease.</p></reply>

In addition, as the herd number was transferred to the company name from 30th May 2012 after submission of the 2012 Single Payment application, it was necessary to request that the company named complete a Declaration of Undertaking whereby the company undertakes all responsibilities relating to the Single Payment Scheme for that year.

Since 2008 the Forest Service of my Department has been carrying out surveys for the disease to determine its status in Ireland and has also been monitoring imports of ash plants and wood products.  This is a relatively new disease of ash which was first named in 2006 but the reproducing and harmful stage of the disease, <i>Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus,</i> was not scientifically described until 2010.  This is important because in drafting the legislation required to prohibit the importation of material from infected areas, it was necessary to accurately identify and name the causal agent.  Furthermore, in order to bring in emergency measures under the EU Plant Health Directive, a Member State must first demonstrate that a disease has not established itself in the territory.  There must also be a scientifically based Pest Risk Analysis or, at minimum, a Preliminary Pest Risk Analysis carried out for the disease.</p><p>  I can confirm that surveys have been carried out in respect of <i>Chalara fraxinea</i>   and we are continuing to carry them out.  The Preliminary Pest Risk Analysis has also been completed.  In addition, under the EU Plant Health Directive, the island of Ireland is treated as a single unit for Plant Health purposes so it was vitally important that any new legislative provisions on the importation of material from infected areas were jointly agreed with the Northern Ireland authorities.  We have this agreement and the required legislation to prohibit the importation of both plant material and wood has now been introduced in both jurisdictions, the only EU Member States to do so to date.</p><p>  Since the disease was first detected in Ireland in October 2012, my Department has issued several Press Releases to inform the public about the disease.  Information is also available on the Department&#8217;s website, including information on the symptoms of the disease and contact information for anyone who believes they may have infected trees.  A poster providing information about the disease is currently being distributed for display in the offices of my Department, Teagasc, Coillte and NPWS throughout the country, as well as other relevant private sector offices.  In addition, the Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, Shane McEntee, has had a number of meetings with representatives of the forest industry in relation to this disease, including forest nurseries, hurley makers, forest owner organisations, professional foresters and forestry contractors.</p><p>  The Forest Service of my Department has overall responsibility for the protection of the national forest estate from harmful insects and diseases.  Site surveys by Department Forestry Inspectors are continuing, focusing on sites which are at most risk from infection, including recently planted forests where ash plants imported from the continent were used.  Examinations of imported ash wood and planting material have also been increased to enforce recently enacted legislation.  Departmental Inspectors are also surveying for the disease in garden centres, nurseries and landscape plantings.  In addition specialist training on the winter symptoms of the disease has been provided to over 100 trained foresters in the Forestry Inspectorate, Teagasc, Coillte and  the private sector foresters, who are all assisting in the surveillance effort.  In relation to other disease threats I can confirm that Ireland has Protected Zone status for a total of 15 forestry related harmful organisms under the EU Plant Health Directive.</p></reply>

The aim is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit. Key services provided by FRCs include:</p><p>- Information, advice and support for groups and families at local level.</p><p>- Childcare facilities for those attending courses provided by the FRC.</p><p>- After-school clubs.</p><p>- Education courses and training opportunities.</p><p>- Assistance to community groups (such as training and the shared use of facilities).</p><p>  A key role for FRCs is in providing information and advice.  In 2010, over 136,000 people were advised directly by an FRC and a further 56,000 people were referred onwards to other information providers.  The VEC&#8217;s and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) were the services to which people were most frequently referred.  FRCs have a broad range of involvement with children and young people and work closely with many local schools.  The range of interventions include early childhood care and education, initiatives to retain children and young people in school, breakfast clubs, homework clubs, youth caf&eacute;s, community based youth work, facilities and services for young people, work with particular target groups of vulnerable young people and work on issues of particular concern/risk to young people e.g. alcohol and drugs prevention, etc.</p><p>  The Agency also provides funding to voluntary and community organisations providing marriage, relationship, child and bereavement counselling services.  Some 600 organisations are funded each year.  These services aim to support people deal with difficulties they are experiencing in their relationships, to help children whose lives have been affected by parental separation and to support families who have experienced the death of a family member.  Over 20,000 individual counselling sessions were delivered within FRCs in 2010.</p><p>  The pressures exerted by a range of issues - financial, interpersonal, behavioural, etc. - can have a negative influence on the family unit, and in turn impact on the health and/or welfare of a child or children.  Children in such circumstances must be protected.  In this context the  has a duty under the  to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  If a child is in need of care and protection and is unlikely to receive it at home, the HSE has a duty to ensure they receive the appropriate level of care.  Parents can and do seek the assistance of the HSE.  Through direct provision or through its funding of a variety of family support and related community/voluntary providers the HSE works to support families.  The HSE also receives children into care on a voluntary basis where parents indicate they need this support on a temporary or short-term basis because of their inability to cope.  At all times the HSE seeks to support families in accessing all of the services and benefits to which they are entitled to meet the needs of their children.  Only where there is a risk to the protection or welfare of a child does the HSE seek to take the child into care under a care order.</p><p>  Looking to the future, the Family Support Agency will, along with the HSE&#8217;s Children and Family Services, form an integral part of the new Child and Family Support Agency, due to be established in 2013.  Plans for the transition to this new entity are well under way.  I believe this will provide for greater integration of these complementary services, with their shared aims of supporting parents and families and ensuring the welfare and protection of children are adequately safeguarded.</p></reply>

Approximately 66,000 children are availing of the ECCE programme in the current school year and &euro;175.8 million has been provided in 2012 to cover the cost of the programme.</p><p>  The objective of the ECCE programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  To achieve this, services participating in the preschool year are expected to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort and therefore minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will qualify for the free preschool provision have been set.  Children qualify for the free preschool year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September in the relevant year.  Children born between 2 February 2008 and 30 June 2009 qualified for the free preschool year in September 2012 and children born between 2 February 2009 and 30 June 2010 will qualify for the programme in September 2013.  There are no exceptions for children who are below the qualifying age.  The child referred to by the Deputy is outside the age range for eligibility for the programme in the school year commencing in September 2012 but will be eligible for the programme in the school year commencing in September 2013.</p></reply>

To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.</p><p>  I am satisfied that these provisions address the concerns raised by the Deputies.</p><p>  It is important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine. All of the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012 was published on the 13th of July 2012. The Bill completed its passage through the Seanad on Wednesday, the 19th   of September, and is currently continuing its passage through the D&aacute;il. An Implementation Group on Generic Substitution and Reference Pricing has been established and it held its inaugural meeting on the 9th of August 2012. The Group met with the Irish Epilepsy Association, amongst others, on the 20th of November as part of its stakeholder meetings.</p></reply>

The Authority is responsible for driving improvements in the quality and safety of healthcare on behalf of patients.  In this context, it is a matter for the Chief Inspector to determine, for each health care centre, whether the staffing level and mix is appropriate.  However, it is the responsibility of the registered provider in each centre to ensure that there are sufficient appropriately qualified staff to ensure services are delivered in accordance with HIQA National Standards and the needs of the residents.</p><p>  Given the budgetary position and financial challenges, there is an ongoing need for reform, including greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters, as well as redeployment in the health sector.  The HSE is committed to fast-tracking new, innovative and more efficient ways of using reduced resources, including greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters (especially of nursing and medical staff) and changing skill-mix.</p><p>  Under the Public Service Agreement appropriate arrangements to redeploy staff within and across each sector of the public service have been agreed.  In relation to the health sector this protocol applies to all employees of the HSE and health employers funded by the HSE.  Redeployment of employees may be required for a number of reasons including to redirect or develop skills and competencies required to meet evolving patient or service user needs. </p></reply>

The 2008 KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin Area report noted &#8216;<i>it is well recognised that for optimal clinical outcome, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services, or in the case of neonatology and fetal medicine tri-located with adult and paediatric services&#8217;</i>. The report noted that Dublin&#8217;s model of stand alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be co-located with adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new national paediatric hospital. Maternity and paediatric service co-location has advantages for infants with congenital malformations, for fetal medicine or complications which require neonatal surgery.  Maternity and adult service co-location has advantages for mothers in providing on-campus rapid and ready access to non-obstetric specialist expertise, and to specialist surgery and intensive care in the case of major obstetric emergency.</p><p>  In this context the proposal in 2008 was that the National Maternity Hospital be relocated to St Vincent's Hospital, the Coombe to Tallaght Hospital  and the Rotunda to the Mater Hospital, and the maternity hospitals have been working with the relevant adult sites to progress this.</p><p>  Recently the Government made the decision to build the new national children&#8217;s hospital on the St James&#8217;s campus. Given the need to plan for the provision of  maternity services along with paediatric and adult services on the site selected for the new children's hospital,  there will be early discussions with the Dublin  maternity hospitals  regarding their maternity /adult co-location plans.  My Department will engage in discussion with the Coombe Hospital in relation to co-location plans in the near future.</p></reply>

I am advised by the HSE that the provision of nursing services in drug treatment centres will not change under the new arrangements.    However, access to nursing services in satellite drug clinics which deal with smaller numbers and cater for those whose drug use has stabilised, will be determined through referral from the clinic doctor.     An appointment system will be managed by nurse management.     In this way the needs of the service users attending satellite clinics will be accommodated and they will not be compromised clinically by this change.    The arrangements put in place by the HSE would appear to be reasonable in the circumstances.</p></reply>

As the HSE has no statutory obligation to provide patient transport, other than emergency transport, non-essential transport provision has been identified for budgetary control.  Accordingly, criteria have been revised considerably and a uniform approach to providing such transport is being rolled out across the health regions.</p><p>  In general, patients are expected to make their own way to and from hospital and OPD appointments, using private or scheduled public transport. The exceptions are for patients whose appointments are directly related to dialysis, radiotherapy and chemotherapy or post-operative transplant treatment. Transport may also be provided where, in the clinician's view, the patient would be unable to make the journey without clinical assistance or where the patient must be transported on a stretcher. </p><p>  Where transport has been withdrawn, having previously been provided, this may be as a result of the Local Health Office (LHO) beginning to implement the national criteria. If a patient feels there is a genuine case for provision, then they should approach the LHO and their clinician should make a clinical case for it.   </p><p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single payment to help meet exceptional expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as Exceptional Needs Payments (ENPs).  The amount paid, if any, is assessed by that department on a case by case basis. ere is no automatic entitlement to such payments and the fact that a person is dependent on a social welfare or HSE payment does not necessarily mean that they will qualify for an ENP. </p><p>  As this question relates to a query about an individual and is, therefore, an operational mater for the HSE, it has been forwarded to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy</p></reply>

Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the NTPF has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data. The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals. In the first instance, this will allow the SDU and NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013.</p><p>  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. </p><p>  Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.</p><p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

In recent years the RSA undertook a review of the policy options available for the mandatory introduction of DRL and concluded that DRL should not be made obligatory at this moment in time. Experience in other countries especially Sweden where DRL has been mandatory since 1977, shows that mandatory DRL works best where all vehicles are fitted with dedicated DRL and where there has been intensive promotion and awareness campaigns prior to DRL being made mandatory. In Ireland most vehicles do not yet have dedicated DRL and the RSA analysis has shown that the costs of retrofitting DRL at the current time outweighs the benefits. The RSA has recommended that the position be reviewed again in circa 4 years.</p><p>  In the meantime, the RSA will intensify the promotion of DRL with a view to significantly increasing the use of DRL on a voluntary basis, in particular, during the period September to March and in wet or poor conditions. With this in mind the RSA recently launched an awareness campaign promoting the use of DRL on national radio which is reinforced by &quot;<i>The Bright Way To Save Lives&#8221;</i> section on its website    which extols the benefits of DRL.</p></reply>
