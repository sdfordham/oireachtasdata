The centres providing Level 5 courses under the remit of the National Learning Network are not listed as approved institutions for student grant purposes.</p>  <p>  My Department, through SOLAS and the Education and Training Boards, funds the Specialist Training Provider (STP) programme.  The National Learning Network delivers the majority of STP courses.  In general, participants on STP courses are in receipt of income support in the form of a disability payment from the Department of Social Protection or a training allowance equivalent to their jobseeker payment entitlement.  These payments are generally at a level significantly above that available through the student grant scheme.  The principle of student grants not being awarded to students who are receipt of separate income support from public funds is well established.  A similar restriction applies to BTEA recipients who no longer qualify for SUSI maintenance grants.</p>  <p>  The current system of student supports is underpinned by the Student Support Act, 2011. It is my intention to initiate a review of this legislation later this year. </p></reply>

As previously indicated, my preference is to discuss this complex issue with the Oireachtas Committee at the earliest opportunity and I am open to hearing views on the best way to proceed within our existing constitutional framework.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to publish new School Admissions legislation taking account of current draft proposals and addressing issues including publication of school enrolment policies, an end to waiting lists, introduction of annual enrolment structures, and transparency and fairness in admissions for pupils and their parents.</p>  <p>  I have commenced a process of consultation with opposition parties to discuss my proposals to introduce a new Admissions Bill.  Following these consultations, it is my intention to publish a new Admissions Bill during the current D&aacute;il session.  The new Admissions Bill will bring tangible benefits to all parents.  The Bill will oblige all schools to admit pupils where there are available places. It is important to note that 80% of schools are not oversubscribed.</p>  <p>  It is my view that an effective way of providing diversity and choice for parents is by providing additional multidenominational schools for parents, and in this regard, I have committed to increasing the number of non-denominational and multi-denominational schools with a view to reaching 400 by 2030 as set out in the Programme for Government.  One of the aims to offer wider choice is so that parents can get access to a school that offers their choice of ethos.</p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.</p>  <p>  The Patron has advised the Department that there has been no change in the enrolment policy of the school referred to and that no pupil has been refused a place.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, since 2011 new schools are generally only established in areas of demographic growth.  My Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide.  The system uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and information from my own Department's databases.  With this information, nationwide demographic exercises are carried out to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary levels.  My Department will continue to analyse demographic trends and monitor enrolments, to determine where new schools will be required.  My Department has no plans currently to open a new school in this area.</p></reply>

A campaign to promote apprenticeship is currently being developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners including the Apprenticeship Council.  The campaign will raise awareness and promote the value of apprenticeship for individual apprentices and for employers and it will cover both existing apprenticeships and the new apprenticeships now coming on stream.</p>  <p>  This Government has committed to doubling the number of apprenticeship places.  In addition to rising numbers entering apprenticeships in the existing trades, the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers.  25 proposals have been prioritised by the Council for development, with employers on a number of these new apprenticeships planning to recruit in 2016.  The Council is working with partners to ensure that information on these new opportunities across a range of sectors and at a range of levels of the National Framework of Qualifications is made available as widely as possible.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-28a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062800058#WRA01600"><p> My Department will complete an Interim Review of the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy by September 2016.  The review was scheduled to begin in 2016 but was brought forward to 2015 as many of the targets set in the Strategy have already been achieved.  For example:</p>  <p>   - The 2020 target to reduce by at least 5% the cohort of primary children performing at the lowest levels of English Reading has already been achieved. In second class primary the percentage of pupils performing at the lowest reading level fell by 13%, while In sixth class the reduction was 10%;</p>  <p>  - Similar improvements were recorded in percentage increases for pupils performing at the highest reading levels;</p>  <p>  - Similar results were also recorded for primary pupils' performance in mathematics:</p>  <p>  - At post-primary level one target was to increase by at least 5% the cohort of 15-year olds performing at the highest levels in international reading, literacy and numeracy tests by 2020.  This target has been achieved for mathematics and exceeded for overall reading literacy.  Progress has also been made towards the 2020 targets for pupils performing at the lowest levels.</p>  <p>  The interim review will contain actions to embed the success of the first five years and prioritise our efforts in key areas.  It will involve a partnership approach between schools, parents, national and local agencies, from early years through to further education and training.  Supports for students in DEIS schools will require particular consideration, while improving supports for adults, to increase their awareness and involvement in their children's learning, will be important.</p>  <p>  One of the challenges remaining, however, is reducing the gap in literacy and numeracy outcomes for disadvantaged (DEIS) schools, compared to non-DEIS schools.</p>  <p>  International research argues that schools with high concentrations of disadvantaged students do not perform at the same level academically as schools with a more advantaged intake.  Social gaps in achievement reflect the broader societal processes influencing educational inequality.  One of the objectives of the New Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, which I have committed to publish by the end of this year, is to reduce this gap, in the context of reducing inequalities by individual background.  The plan will also be key in tackling literary and numeracy problems experienced by pupils in disadvantaged communities.  I recently announced my initial proposals for the new plan, which I expect will include a series of pilot schemes to introduce measures which have been shown to work well in improving results for disadvantaged children.  I also expect it to include measures in the areas of school leadership, literacy teaching methodologies, and ways in which supports to schools can be better integrated.  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to establishing a new Schools Excellence Fund under which applications to tackle educational disadvantage will be prioritised.</p>  <p>  Standardised tests were included as part of the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy so that schools could track and report the progress of pupils to parents and plan the next steps in children's learning.  They are also used by schools to improve their practice in school self-evaluation and aggregated data is reported to my Department for monitoring purposes.  I envisage that schools will continue to use and report data from the tests in these ways.  Primary schools have implemented the use of standardised tests in reading and mathematics consistently, and have reported this information to parents and, in aggregate form, to the Department.  They have also used it improve their teaching and learning practices through school self-evaluation.  One issue emerging from the Review is the need for schools to have available to them new sets of tests that are consistent with the revised primary languages curriculum and that take account of the improvements in standards that have been achieved.  There is also evidence from other sources, that teachers require greater support in interpreting the data to best effect.  These will be priorities for my Department.</p></reply>

To this end, my Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide.  The system uses a range of data sources in carrying out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.</p>  <p>  On foot of the latest demographic exercises, four new primary schools and nine new post-primary schools were announced to open in 2017 and 2018 to cater for increased demographic needs.  This includes a new post-primary school which will open in 2017 to serve the Carpenterstown/Castleknock, Dublin 15 area, which will provide an additional 1,000 pupil places, supplementing provision in the wider area.  Prospective school patrons were invited to apply for the patronage of each of the nine new post-primary schools, including the school to serve the Carpenterstown/Castleknock, Dublin 15 area, with a closing date of 8th June last.</p>  <p>  The criteria used in relation to patronage of new schools places particular emphasis on parental demand for plurality and diversity, with parental preferences at the centre of the process.  Prospective patrons must submit with their application a parental preference template in which parents have been requested to declare their preference for their child(ren) to be educated through that patron's school model and also their preference with regard to education through the medium of English or Irish.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently in the process of assessing the applications received as part of the patronage process for the nine new post-primary schools.  Following completion of this analysis, my Department will prepare detailed assessment reports in relation to each of these new schools based on the applications received, for the consideration of the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG), which will then submit a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.</p>  <p>  The group referred to by the Deputy has had a number of meetings with my Department concerning different proposals for the provision of Irish-medium education at second level to serve the Dublin West/East Meath area.  My Department has indicated that the issues raised by the group will be examined in the context of the assessment of parental demand for Irish-medium education emerging from the current patronage process, together with analysis of potential demand in the broader area.  Detailed information on the post-primary patronage process is available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

Some &euro;100 million is provided to give such additional language support to schools in this academic year.  The level of additional language support is determined by the numbers of eligible students enrolled and the associated assessed levels of those students' language proficiency.  The challenge for schools is to ensure that this very significant resource is used to maximum effect.</p><p>Secondly, the Department provides a programme of continuing professional development (CPD) for EAL (English as an Additional Language) teachers, principals and mainstream class teachers.  The range of supports offered includes: seminars/courses for teachers of EAL, staff and for principals.  The Department also funds the English Language Support Teachers Association to encourage teachers to network, to share experience and to provide a forum for discussion.</p><p>Thirdly, the Department provides support materials through CPD and has also provided materials for schools including the primary and post-primary assessment kits and the intercultural guidelines issued by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).  Web-based and multi-media supports have also been developed.  These, together with a range of other material, are available through AIM, the web-based portal for Accessing Intercultural Material.</p><p>The Intercultural Education Strategy requires that due cognisance be given to the importance of mother tongue by encouraging migrant students to maintain a connection with their mother tongue and culture to assist in the development of their sense of identity, belonging and self-esteem, as well as their proficiency in the language of instruction. </p><p>.</p></reply>

In our Programme for Partnership Government we have set out a commitment to introduce a new Leaving Certificate Physical Education syllabus.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has advanced this work.  It will be a priority of my Government to ensure its implementation.  When introduced, it will be on a par with English and History, for example.</p>  <p>  The provision of play space, where site conditions and circumstances allow, is one of the issues considered in the architectural design of new schools and major extensions.  My Department's design guidelines for schools include guidance in the provision of P.E. Halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts.</p>  <p>  I also wish to advise the Deputy that the Physical Education curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary.  Many post primary schools have a PE hall and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the P.E. programme.  In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including Community Halls, public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.  My Department continues to respond to the need to improve Physical Education facilities for all students attending schools within the constraints of the available funding.  An audit of second-level schools is not planned at this time.</p></reply>

The Strategy will consider foreign languages from the post-primary sector upwards.</p>  <p>  The strategy will take into account the findings of a public consultative process with education stakeholders held in 2014.  Following the analysis of the submissions received there were two further consultation events in 2015, one concentrating on schools and the second seeking input from stakeholders in the higher and further education sectors along with industry.</p>  <p>  Over 10% of our population are immigrants from over 200 countries with their many languages.  Our immigrants provide Ireland with a social, cultural and national resource that we welcome and want to nurture.</p>  <p>  For Junior Cycle, students may study French, German, Spanish and Italian.  A new specification for modern languages is being finalised by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) which includes these four languages and this framework could be used for other languages into the future.</p>  <p>  With the introduction of the new Framework for Junior Cycle in 2014, schools may now also offer their students short courses (of 100 hours duration) in foreign languages.  A short course in Chinese language and culture (as a foreign language) has been prepared by the NCCA.  Short courses are also available in two other languages of our new communities, Polish (for heritage speakers) to stimulate and maintain students' interest in the Polish language and culture and to nurture their desire to maintain proficiency in their Polish.  Russian (as a foreign language) is also available.  It is the eighth most spoken language in the world.  These latter two languages courses have been developed by my Department's Post Primary Languages Initiative (PPLI).  The PPLI is also in discussion with the Lithuanian, Latvian, and Romanian embassies in relation to developing short courses in these languages.</p>  <p>  At Senior Cycle, in addition to French, German, Spanish and Italian, schools may also provide Leaving Certificate choices to their students which include Russian, Japanese and Arabic.  In addition, the State Examinations Commission provides Leaving Certificate examinations in 'non-curricular EU languages'.  Students who are from EU member states may present their home language as a non-curricular subject at Leaving Certificate, if they comply with certain criteria.  For example, the non-curricular language must be their mother tongue.</p>  <p>  The future of foreign languages, including the non-curricular languages, in the post-primary sector is currently under consideration as the Foreign Languages Strategy is being finalised.</p>  <p>  It is also important that immigrant students gain proficiency in the language of instruction in the school they attend.  Alleviation measures were put in place in the 2012/13 school year for schools with a high concentration of students requiring language support.  These schools will continue to receive this allocation in 2016/17.  Schools where a significant number of the total enrolment is made up of language support students with less than B1 (Level 3) proficiency can lodge an appeal for a review of their proposed allocation.</p>  <p>  In the higher education sector, the different institutions provide courses in a number of the new communities languages.  These can be taken as core subjects or in combination with a range of other disciplines such as business and the sciences.</p></reply>

In that regard, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to publish new school admissions legislation taking into account current draft proposals.  The previously published Admissions to School Bill included a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school's arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  I believe this is an important measure which will help ensure and transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard.

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the 30 September 2015.</p>  <p>  There is a reduced enrolment requirement for the retention of the second and third teaching post in island schools where the school is the only school on the island.  The total number of pupils must be at 8 or above for the retention of the second teaching post.  This special provision has been in place since the 2006/07 school year.  Prior to that, island schools were subject to the enrolment thresholds of schools on the mainland.</p>  <p>  The staffing arrangements for the current school year provide an improvement to the staffing levels of small schools.  Improved appointment and retention thresholds for isolated one teacher schools were introduced for the 2015/16 school year.  Where previously an isolated one teacher school would have required an enrolment of 20 pupils in order to appoint a second teacher, this has now been reduced to 15 pupils.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government has a commitment to reduce class sizes at primary level and to commencing a review, within three months, of teacher appointment thresholds in small schools with four teachers or less.</p></reply>

The purpose of this reform is to ensure that we have a FET sector that is  flexible and responsive to the needs of learners and industry alike.</p>  <p>  Within the FET sector there is a  range of flexible high quality programmes on offer to meet the needs of young unemployed people to enable them to develop skills that are genuinely valued by employers.  The successful completion of these programmes can lead to awards of levels 1 to 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications which will enhance the individual's chances of gaining employment.</p>  <p>  Provision is made available in a wide range of venues including second level Community Schools, Further Education Colleges, Youthreach and adult education centres and training centres.  Guidance services are on offer within the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) that can offer valuable assistance in choosing the right programmes to assist them in planning progression to higher education and/or employment.</p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers.  25 proposals have been prioritised by the Council for development, with employers on a number of these new apprenticeships planning to recruit in 2016.  Some of these apprenticeships will be suitable for young people entering the labour market for the first time and the Council is working with partners to ensure that information on these opportunities is made available as widely as possible.</p>  <p>  The Momentum programme was created in 2012 as a new innovation in the provision of free education and training to address the needs of long term unemployed and young unemployed individuals.  To-date there have been two rounds of the programme with the second due to complete in mid-2016.  Under this round, funding of &euro;20m has been made available to SOLAS, to provide up 6,000 training and education places for the long-term unemployed.  In line with our commitment to Ireland's Youth Guarantee Initiative, 33% of those places are ring fenced for those under the age of 25.</p></reply>

The purpose of this new Strategy is to provide a framework for skills development that will help drive Ireland's growth both economically and societally over the next decade.  Through the vision, objectives, actions and indicators, the Strategy will support the development of a well-educated, well-skilled and adaptable labour force, creating and sustaining a strong pool of talented people of all ages throughout Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Strategy underlines the importance of employer participation in the development and effective of use of skills.  This can happen through influencing the skills development of graduates, upskilling existing staff and by supporting knowledge transfer between educational institutions and enterprises.  The Strategy sets out new structures to drive better engagement between employers, education and training providers and other stakeholders.  I will be appointing a new National Skills Council, which will oversee Strategy implementation and consider and respond to labour market trends and sectoral needs.</p>  <p>  A network of 9 Regional Skills Fora has also been established to foster greater engagement between the education and training system, employers and other enterprise stakeholders in building the skills of each region.  The fora provide a vehicle for close co-operation at regional level between education and training providers and enterprise, between the different education and training providers themselves and a local link with the implementation of other strategies such as the Regional Action Plans for Jobs and Pathways to Work.</p>  <p>  The expansion of the apprenticeship system is one of my key priorities and I am encouraged by the increase in apprenticeship registrations in existing trades and the progress being made in introducing new apprenticeships, focusing initially on the 25 priority proposals identified by the Apprenticeship Council through their public call. In the Programme for a Partnership.  Government we have committed to double the number of apprenticeships by 2020.  We will target 100 different apprenticeship schemes spread across sectors of the economy and in every region of Ireland.</p></reply>

Legal advice indicates that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has published a Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act.  This report, which was published in 2006, made recommendations which suggested that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.</p>  <p>  My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report.  However, a total estimate of this amount has not been quantified.</p>  <p>  Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted.  The level of additional expenditure required would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who might currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise that the NCSE has a statutory function under the EPSEN Act to advise me in relation to matters concerning the education of children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers.</p>  <p>  These reports include the NCSE Report on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools (2013) and the Report of the NCSE Working Group: Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs (2014).</p>  <p>  The reports made a number of recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p>  <p>  It is therefore planned to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.</p>  <p>  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, I have also committed to consulting with stakeholders to see how best to progress sections of the EPSEN Act that were introduced on a non-statutory basis.</p></reply>

In the region of 113,000 children, including some 10,000 children with special educational needs, are transported in approximately 4,000 vehicles each school day.  The overall costs of the scheme have reduced by some 7% since 2008 as a result of policy changes and other efficiencies.  One of the main objectives of the Scheme is to ensure that, as far as possible, eligible children have a reasonable level of service while at the same time, ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in an efficient and cost effective manner.  One of the impacts of the policy changes introduced in recent years is that there has been a reduction in the number of eligible pupils availing of school transport places and a growth in the number of pupils who avail of places on a concessionary basis.</p>  <p>  Routes are planned on the basis of the locations of children who are eligible for school transport only.</p>  <p>  In general, children are eligible for school transport if they meet the requisite distance criterion and are attending their nearest school having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may avail of school transport on a concessionary basis only; the demand for transport on a concessionary basis is mainly from families whose children who are not attending their nearest school.</p>  <p>  Transport on a concessionary basis is subject to a number of terms and conditions including that there are spare seats available on an existing school bus service and on payment of the annual charge.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to review the concessionary charges and rules element of the School Transport Scheme prior to Budget 2017.</p>  <p>  This review, which is being commenced, will be aimed at identifying issues in relation to current rules and charges relating to concessionary places under the School Transport Scheme with a view to maximising the effectiveness of available services for children.</p>  <p>  The results of the review will be considered in the context of Budget 2017.</p>  <p>  Pending this review, there will be no planned programme of downsizing school buses in the coming school year.  There will be route changes and variations in line with normal operational decisions that occur from year to year, and any impacts in terms of increases or decreases of available places will be marginal, in line with what occurs every year.</p></reply>

The Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting the work of schools in promoting positive mental health and to supporting those with a broad range of problems, behavioural, emotional and social.</p>  <p>  My Department issued a circular to all primary schools in February this year promoting and encouraging Healthy Lifestyles for their pupils.  Schools and the wider education sector have a vital role to play in contributing to the Government's 'Healthy Ireland' agenda that is being led by the Department of Health and is supported by my Department.  It is acknowledged that positive mental and psychological wellbeing are a key aspect of healthy lifestyles.  Schools are contributing to the overall physical, mental health and wellbeing of our young people but this must be done in collaboration with their families and their community.</p>  <p>  Creating a healthy lifestyle spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, pupil support, pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers.  It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.  Schools support these areas also through their implementation of their anti-bullying, substance misuse, attendance policies and through the delivery of the SPHE curriculum.</p>  <p>  It is also important that work in this area commences when pupils are at an early age.  To this end, Wellbeing Guidelines for Primary Schools were published by my Department in January 2015.  These guidelines were developed, along with guidelines for post-primary schools, following a process of wide consultation, by a working group with representation from the Teacher Education Section/Inspectorate, SPHE Support Service, National Psychological Service (NEPS),  Department of Health and the Health Service Executive/National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP).</p>  <p>  The guidelines provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote positive mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way.  They also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines are for all members of the school community, boards of management and in-school management teams who play a central leadership role in positive mental health promotion.  They are also useful for parents' associations, student councils, health and other personnel who are seeking an understanding of how to work in and with schools.</p>  <p>  Specific attention is drawn within the Guidelines to the identification of pupils with mental health difficulties, the support process and referral pathways available to schools to provide for their needs and where the difficulties result in absences from school support mechanisms are suggested to ease the pupils re-integration.</p>  <p>  My Department, in collaboration with the Department of Health and the HSE, provides support to schools to implement this agenda.  At Primary school level the HSE's Health Promotion Officers and my Department's NEPS service respectively support school staff delivery of programmes such as Zippy's Friends and the Friends for Life which promote children's resilience and coping skills which enable them better to manage anxiety.</p></reply>

It has increased by 10% in the past two years.</p>  <p>  The investment which is being made to support children with special educational needs is an area of spending which has been prioritised above most other areas by this Government.</p>  <p>  The policy of my Department is that children with special educational needs should be included where possible and appropriate in mainstream placements with additional supports provided.  In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.</p>  <p>  Children, therefore, have a number of placement options including mainstream placement with support, placement in a special class in a mainstream school or placement in a special class in a special school.</p>  <p>  We now have the highest level of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support, Resource Teaching allocations and Special Class provision that we have ever had, which will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p>  <p>  I recently announced that from September next 12,900 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) will be available for allocation to primary and secondary schools, which is 860 more posts, or a 7% increase, in the number of posts over which were available last year.  In total the number of SNA posts available has increased by almost 22% from 10575 posts available in 2011.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 11,800 learning support and Resource Teacher posts in mainstream primary and post primary schools providing additional teaching support to pupils with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  In May of this year the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocated 7,015 Resource Teaching posts to mainstream schools for September 2016, which is an increase of approximately 9% over the number allocated at September 2015.</p>  <p>  In total, 7,452 resource teacher posts will be available for allocation to schools for 2016/17, which represents an increase of 41% from 5265 posts available in 2011.</p>  <p>  In addition, approximately 150 new Special Classes will be opened for the 2016/17 school year, which means there will be over 1,150 special classes in place, compared to 548 special classes in 2011.</p>  <p>  The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) will continue to engage with schools in order to plan for, and to open, new special classes each year, in order to ensure there are sufficient special class placements available at primary and post primary school level to meet demand in a given area.</p>  <p>  125 special schools also provide specialist education for those pupils who need it.</p>  <p>  The provision which is being made ensures that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p>  <p>  As funding for the provision of special educational needs supports for future years will be considered annually, as part of the annual estimates process, I am not in a position to set out details of the anticipated provision for children with special educational needs for the future five year period.  However, I can confirm that this Government will continue to ensure that the supports required to ensure that all children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education will be provided.</p></reply>

In announcing the Programme, the Government recognised the importance of addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  However, as indicated in previous responses to parliamentary questions, the pace of the relocation programme in Ireland and across the European Union has been hampered by significant operational delays and technical issues due to the sheer numbers involved and other logistical difficulties that have arisen at the 'hotspot' locations in Italy and Greece.</p>  <p>  A team of officials from my Department, including the Director of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, travelled to Greece earlier this month to meet with Irish embassy officials and relevant Greek authorities both to signal Ireland's tangible willingness to assist and to identify ways of addressing the obstacles that have arisen.  The outcome of that visit has been very positive and the Greek authorities have now confirmed that, within the coming months, they will be able to increase significantly the overall numbers available to Ireland.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, I chaired a meeting of the high level Task Force established to oversee the implementation of the IRPP during which an approach to taking  unaccompanied minors (most likely from Greece) was discussed.  Further consideration of this will now be given by the relevant agencies and Departments, including Tusla, the Child and Family Agency under the auspices of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and officials from my own Department.</p>  <p>  I continue to work proactively with my colleagues in Europe to ensure that Ireland and the European Union responds comprehensively to all aspects of the ongoing migration and refugee crisis.

The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.  The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, in the context of prostitution, and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not commit an offence.</p>  <p>  These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012.  The new offences also implement the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.  The purpose of introducing these provisions is primarily to target the trafficking and sexual exploitation of persons through prostitution.</p>  <p>  In deciding to put forward these provisions I have considered all sides of the debate, including those with positions similar to Amnesty International.  I have considered the experience of those states which have introduced similar measures and those states which have addressed prostitution in a different way.  I have also considered the reports and findings of various international organisations.  Both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have recognised the effectiveness of the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services as a tool in the fight against human trafficking.</p>  <p>  Further research will inevitably be published during the progress of the legislation and it will continue to be examined and considered.  I would note that many of the findings of this latest report by Amnesty International relate to issues not directly connected with the law criminalising the purchase of sexual services, for example issues of homelessness and discrimination faced by sex workers.  I am acutely conscious of the myriad of difficulties faced daily by vulnerable men and women involved in sex work and I am under no illusion that these difficulties will be solved by this legislation alone.</p>  <p>  Therefore, in addition to criminalising the purchase of sexual services, there is a need to offer additional supports to men and women who wish to exit prostitution.  Ruhama provide support to those involved in prostitution including assistance with exiting prostitution.  My Department through the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit provide funding to Ruhama - &euro;225,000 in 2015 (an increase from &euro;172,000 in 2014).  The funding is provided both for work with victims of human trafficking and for their work with women affected by prostitution.</p>  <p>  I remain convinced that to target the exploitation associated with prostitution requires targeting those who demand those services.  The most direct way of combating this form of exploitation is to send the message to those who pay for these services, and who ignore the exploitation of the women and men involved, that their behaviour is unacceptable and that their behaviour supports the exploitation of other people.</p></reply>

It is an offence for a person, when requested by a Garda, to refuse to give his or her name, address and age, to give a name, address or age that is false or misleading, or to refuse to hand over the bottle or container.  </p>  <p>  Moreover, section 8A of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, (as inserted by section 19 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008), provides that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may, in certain circumstances, seize intoxicating liquor from any person regardless of age.  Garda&iacute; may also request the person to provide his or her name and address, to desist from certain behaviour and to leave the place concerned in a peaceable and orderly manner.  Garda&iacute; may use these powers to prevent nuisance or annoyance to others and to forestall damage to property or a breach of the peace.  Any failure by a person to cooperate with a request to hand over intoxicating liquor or to give his or her name and address is an offence.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I am advised by the Garda authorities that Garda&iacute; continue to utilise the wide-ranging legislative powers which are available to them in dealing with the matters referred to.  I might add that if the Garda Commissioner feels that there are other legislative measures that should be taken in this area I would of course give very careful consideration to any proposals which she might wish to make.</p></reply>

Harassment is deemed to occur where a person seriously interferes with the other's peace and privacy or causes alarm, distress or harm to the other.  Section 10(3) also provides for orders to be made by the court to prevent communication by any means with the victim or to approach within any distance specified by the court of the place of residence or employment of the victim.  Such an order can be made even in circumstances where the accused person is not convicted of the offence if the court is satisfied, having regard to the evidence, that it is in the interests of justice.</p>  <p>  While aspects of what is known loosely as "revenge pornography" are addressed by the harassment offence in Section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, there has been a growing awareness and concern in relation to issues such as cyber-harassment, revenge pornography, and related harmful internet content in recent years with the growth of cyber technology.  The Law Reform Commission (LRC) is currently carrying out a project on Cybercrime affecting personal safety, privacy and reputation, including cyberbullying.  In November 2014 the LRC published an Issues Paper and sought the views of interested parties on the key issues it had identified.  The issue of revenge pornography was specifically addressed in that paper.  In April 2015 it held a seminar to discuss these issues.  It is hoped that the LRC Report will be published in the coming months and its recommendations, including any proposals in relation to legislation, will then be considered.</p>  <p>  Separately and following the publication by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications of its Report on Addressing the growth of Social Media and tackling Cyberbullying in 2013, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources established the Internet Content Advisory Group to provide expert, independent advice on Internet Governance issues (in forming legislative, policy and regulatory recommendations to Government).  The Group&rsquo;s Report was published in June 2014 and included wide ranging recommendations which included changes to institutional, legislative and governance arrangements.  The recommendations are currently being progressed in consultations between the relevant Ministers.</p></reply>

The programme is the outcome of a comprehensive review of foundation training for entrants to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and exemplifies best practice. </p><p>The programme is divided into three phases as outlined below, all of which must be fully completed before progressing to the next phase.  Participants are required to sit mandatory academic examinations and professional assessments and are required to pass all examinations and assessments in order to progress to the conclusion of the programme.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>I am advised  by the Garda Commissioner that<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>no group of trainee Garda&iacute; has been allowed to progress through a phase without fully completing the previous phase of the programme.</p><p>Phase 1, which lasts 32 weeks, is based in the Garda College and places a strong emphasis on problem-based learning where students learn in small groups through engagement with realistic policing scenarios.  This methodology emphasises the development of &lsquo;learning to learn&rsquo; skills, the development of reflective practice and supports the transition into learning in an operational policing environment.  At  the end of Phase 1 successful Garda trainees are attested (i.e. become members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with full police powers) and are dispersed to Garda stations throughout the country, where they are assigned to mainstream policing duties  .</p><p>Phase 2, which lasts for 65 weeks, is primarily based in Garda stations with appropriate training and development structures in place that include access to a trained tutor Garda and a permanently appointed supervisory sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.  During the course of their placement, trainees move through three development stages from assisting his or her Garda tutor to taking the lead role and being assisted by the tutor, to finally the autonomous stage where they are deployed in regular policing activity and work independently within the operational unit.  Over the course of the placement they also return to the Garda College for a number to weeks to further enhance their skills in specialist areas including sexual assault, intelligence&ndash;led policing, file preparation and court presentation and so on.</p><p>Phase 3 consists of seven weeks of preparation for final exams and assessments and I look forward to the first batch of new recruits graduating from the programme this year.  It is, of course, too early to conduct a formal evaluation of the new programme but I understand from those leading the programme that the feedback from managers and colleagues on the ground is positive.</p></reply>

This means that VAT does not apply to such donations.  In the case of charitable donations made by text, where the full amount of the donation is passed over directly to the charity concerned, the entire amount is deemed outside the scope of VAT.

In June 2014 the Central Bank of Ireland issued a Consumer Notice on Crowdfunding which alerts consumers to the fact that crowdfunding is not a regulated activity.  The notice can be found via the following link: <i>. </i>However, it should be noted that if a crowdfunding platform intends to offer ancillary services which are regulated (e.g. payment services), an authorization is needed only as far as these services are concerned, since these services may only be performed by banks or other authorized financial institutions.  There are currently several crowdfunding platforms active in the Irish market and the Government recognises that crowdfunding can be a valuable source of funding for SMEs either as a complement to, or as an alternative to traditional bank finance.  The European Commission recently published a detailed report which finds that several member states of the EU have developed, or are in the process of developing national regulatory regimes but currently there is no evidence of a firm proposal from the Commission to bring forward an EU regulatory initiative.</p></reply>

An adequately-reserved, cost-competitive insurance sector is a vital component of economic activity and financial stability.</p>  <p>  The current high cost of insurance is a concern for the Government.  While the provision and pricing of insurance policies is a commercial matter for insurance companies, this does not preclude the Government from introducing measures which may, in the longer term, lead to a better claims environment.  This is a complex matter to address and it involves a number of Government Departments, State Bodies and private sector organisations.  I have established a task force in my Department to undertake a Review of Policy in the Insurance Sector.</p>  <p>  The first phase of the work of the task force is a Review of the Framework for Motor Insurance Compensation.  This is being carried out jointly with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  My colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I expect to receive this first report shortly.</p>  <p>  Separately, the broader work of the task force includes an examination of the factors underlying the recent increases in the cost of motor insurance but also including other aspects of insurance policy such as the availability of insurance at reasonable cost to particular businesses and sectors of the community which are reported to be having problems in this regard.</p>  <p>  This work of the task force is being undertaken in consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland, other Government Departments, Agencies and interested bodies, including the insurance industry, as represented by Insurance Ireland.  The aim of the review is to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector in Ireland, identifying the issues that can be addressed on a more immediate basis and those that need more long-term policy implementation.  This work will be completed over the coming months.</p>  <p>  With regard to specific communications with the insurance industry regarding the cost of insurance, the Review of Policy in the Insurance Sector project is currently examining the Framework for Motor Insurance Compensation and there has been a number of meetings with the insurance industry, including the MIBI, focussed on that element of the project.  The next phase will involve in depth discussions with the industry on the drivers of insurance costs.</p></reply>

This ensures firms have the ability to pay all policyholders' claims without recourse to public or consumer funds.  It does not have a statutory role in relation to setting premium prices.</p><p>In the<i>Macro Finance Review for H1 2016</i>that was published on 14 June, the Central Bank highlighted a number of issues facing the non-life insurance sector, which included the impact of the low interest rate environment that has resulted in a fall in investment income which historically was used to offset underwriting losses.  The report stated that the Bank believes investment income will continue to decline as proceeds from maturing assets are reinvested in lower yielding assets.  The Report concluded that the domestic non-life insurance sector continues to face a difficult operating environment with all of the high-impact firms reporting underwriting losses in 2015 primarily due to current challenges in the Irish motor market.  As a risk-sensitive regulatory framework, Solvency II, which came into effect on 1 January 2016, should strengthen insurers' resilience.</p><p>I am informed by the Central Bank that the decline in returns on investments through low interest rates has been a key theme in its engagement with the insurance industry for a number of years and forms a key part of its supervisory engagement with individual firms.  The Opinion on Supervisory Response to a Prolonged Low Interest Rate Environment published by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) in February 2013 required all National Competent Authorities to intensify the monitoring and supervision of insurance and reinsurance undertakings with exposure to the risks posed by a low interest rate environment.</p><p>To examine the issues affecting the cost of insurance in more detail and to assess what the options are for the Government, I have established a task force in my Department to undertake a Review of Policy in the Insurance Sector.  The first phase of the work of the task force, which began in January 2016, is a review of the Framework for Motor Insurance Compensation.  This is being carried out jointly with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  This review also deals with broader issues around the Insurance Compensation Fund and its report will be submitted shortly to me and my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  </p><p>The broader work of the task force includes an examination of the issues debated during the D&aacute;il Private Member's Motion of the 8th and 9th of June.  The work is being undertaken in consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland, other Government Departments, Agencies and interested bodies.  The aim of the review is to identify the factors contributing to the increasing costs of insurance, and to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector in Ireland, identifying the issues that can be addressed on a more immediate basis and those that need more long-term policy implementation.</p><p>This work will be completed over the coming months.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Central Bank a borrower(s), if they have been advanced a housing loan previously, cannot revert to a first time buyer status after a period of time.</p><p>However, it should be noted that the regulations also provide a certain flexibility to lenders, based on their own commercial considerations and subject also to compliance with consumer protection rules, to provide a certain amount of mortgage lending in excess of these LTV thresholds.</p></reply>

The NCSE makes such allocations in accordance with my Departments criteria for the scheme.</p><p>Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website <i>www.education.ie</i>, sets out my Department's policy in relation to the Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme.  The Circular explains that SNA support is not provided to pre-school services which operate outside of the primary or special school provision, other than in early intervention classes in recognised primary schools, or special schools, where support is provided for as part of the schools total quantum of SNA support.</p><p>As the NCSE does not allocate Special Needs Assistants to pre school services and have never done so, there has been no change in relation to the allocation of SNAs.</p><p>However, supports for childcare, including pre-school education, are provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The principal vehicle for the delivery of pre-school education is the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which was introduced in January 2010 and provides for early learning in a formal setting to children in the year before they commence primary school.</p><p>Children with disabilities will now have better access to pre-school services under a new Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) programme of supports, which was recently announced, on 15th June 2016, by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, depending on the needs of the child and the pre-school.</p><p>The supports include: </p><p>A new Inclusion Charter for the Early Years sector, alongside updated and strengthened Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Guidelines for Early Childhood Care and Education.</p><p>In relation to the qualifications of early years practitioners, a new higher education programme for early years practitioners (LINC) which will commence from September 2016.</p><p>A new national specialist service which is based in the Better Start National Early Years Quality Development Service will provide expert advice, mentoring and support to pre-school providers from a team of 50 specialists in early years care and education for children with disabilities.</p><p>A new national scheme will provide specialised equipment, appliances and minor alterations which are necessary to support a child's participation in the ECCE programme.</p><p>A new national scheme will also provide additional capitation to pre-school providers where this is critical to fund extra support in the classroom and enable a child's participation in pre-school.  It is estimated that only 1 to 1.5% of children in pre-school will require, and therefore be eligible for, this scheme of additional capitation.</p><p>Details of the supports which will be available under AIM can be found at www.preschoolaccess.ie which contains comprehensive information on the access and inclusion model and on how to apply for the new schemes and supports.</p><p>Questions relating to provision of such services in pre school settings should be addressed my colleague, the Minister for Children &amp;amp; Youth Affairs.</p></reply>

These are Ardscoil na mBraithre Clonmel 65320J; St. Ailbe's School, Rosanna Road, Tipperary Town 72480W; Col&aacute;iste Dun Iascaigh, Cashel Road, Cahir 76063D and Cashel Community School, Dualla Road, Cashel 91497A.</p><p>The NCSE have also advised that they expect to open up to 150 new special classes for the coming school year.  Full details of all special classes are available at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p><p>The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parent of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  However, parents who may need advice or assistance in transitioning their child to post primary school, or are experiencing difficulties in securing a school placement should contact their local SENO.  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO.</p><p>Parents can choose which school to apply to and, where the school has places available, the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school.  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.</p><p>Application forms for taking a section 29 appeal are available on my Department's website at the following <i>link: , </i>or by contacting Section 29 Administration Unit, Friars Mill Road, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath, phone 0761 108588.  Appeals should be taken within 42 days from receipt of written notification from the school's Board of Management.</p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to publish new School Admissions legislation taking account of current draft proposals and addressing issues including publication of school enrolment policies, an end to waiting lists, introduction of annual enrolment structures, and transparency and fairness in admissions for pupils and their parents.</p><p>I have commenced a process of consultation with opposition parties to discuss my proposals to introduce a new Admissions Bill to make the process of enrolling children in school easier for parents.</p><p>Following these consultations, it is my intention to publish a new Admissions Bill during the current D&aacute;il session. The new Bill will oblige all schools to admit pupils where there are available places.</p></reply>

The purpose of this new Strategy is to provide a framework for skills development that will help drive Ireland's growth both economically and societally over the next decade.  Through the vision, objectives, actions and indicators, the Strategy will support the development of a well-educated, well-skilled and adaptable labour force, creating and sustaining a strong pool of talented people of all ages throughout Ireland.  </p><p>The Strategy underlines the importance of employer participation in the development and effective of use of skills.  This can happen through influencing the skills development of graduates, upskilling existing staff and by supporting knowledge transfer between educational institutions and enterprises.  The Strategy sets out new structures to drive better engagement between employers, education and training providers and other stakeholders.  I will be appointing a new National Skills Council, which will oversee Strategy implementation and consider and respond to labour market trends and sectoral needs.</p><p>A network of 9 Regional Skills Fora has also been established to foster greater engagement between the education and training system, employers and other enterprise stakeholders in building the skills of each region.  The fora provide a vehicle for close co-operation at regional level between education and training providers and enterprise, between the different education and training providers themselves and a local link with the implementation of other strategies such as the Regional Action Plans for Jobs and Pathways to Work.</p><p>The expansion of the apprenticeship system is one of my key priorities and I am encouraged by the increase in apprenticeship registrations in existing trades and the progress being made in introducing new apprenticeships, focusing initially on the 25 priority proposals identified by the Apprenticeship Council through their public call.  In the Programme for a Partnership Government we have committed to double the number of apprenticeships by 2020.  We will target 100 different apprenticeship schemes spread across sectors of the economy and in every region of Ireland.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.</p>  <p>  Following the 2015 demographic exercises, four new primary schools and nine new post-primary schools were announced to open in 2017 and 2018 to cater for increased demographic needs in these areas.  This includes a new post-primary school which will open in 2017 to serve the Carpenterstown and Castleknock school planning areas in Dublin 15, which will provide an additional 1,000 post-primary pupil places, supplementing provision in these areas.</p>  <p>  For school planning purposes, the areas of Ongar and Littlepace fall within the Blanchardstown West school planning area.</p>  <p>  A new post-primary school, Hansfield Educate Together Secondary School, opened in 2014 to supplement provision from the existing post-primary school, Phibblestown Community School.  My Department is satisfied that these two post-primary schools located within this school planning area can between them cater for the demand for post-primary places in the area.</p>  <p>  As with other school planning areas nationwide, the demographic data for the areas outlined by the Deputy are being kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated enrolment data and capacity increases in these, and adjoining, school planning areas.</p></reply>

Lower thresholds apply for DEIS Band 1 schools.</p>  <p>  At post-primary level the schedule will improve by .3 points, from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the 2016/17 school year.  The position of post-primary DEIS schools will be further enhanced for the 2016/17 school year by a change to an allocation on the basis of 17.95:1 down from 18.25:1.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government has a commitment to reduce class sizes at primary level.  In the next Budget I will consider the best approach to further meeting commitments in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-28a.358.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062800064#WRG03100"><p>As a consequence of the financial crisis, there was a need to enact a number of measures to reduce public expenditure so as to stabilise the country's public finances.  A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.</p><p>Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. </p><p>  In respect of teachers, the estimated cost of reversing the decision to withdraw qualification allowances from post-1 February 2012 entrant teachers is approximately &euro;16 million per annum. In addition, the estimated cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrant teachers (who have been recruited up to June 2016) to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements is approximately &euro;44 million per annum. </p><p>In respect of SNAs, the estimated cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrant SNAs to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements is approximately &euro;5 million per annum. </p><p>The cost figures set out are inclusive of teachers and SNAs on my Department's main payroll, substitute teachers and SNAs, Employers' PRSI and include an estimated cost in respect of teachers and SNAs in Education and Training Board schools.  They do not include the cost of removing the cap on qualification allowances because a precise calculation of this would depend on the qualifications held by those individual teachers.</p><p>The other main area where post-1 January 2011 entrants have been recruited is in third-level lecturing.  The estimated cost of restoring post-1 January 2011 entrant lecturers to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements is not available at this time but will be forwarded to the Deputy.</p><p>Information on the numbers of post-1 January 2011 entrants to other recruitment grades in the sector is not held by my Department.  However, given the low level of recruitment to such posts in recent years due to the moratorium, the cost of restoring such staff to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements is not likely to be significant.</p></reply>

In that context, it has established standards for post-qualification professional practice, as set out in, Droichead, the new model of induction for newly qualified primary and post-primary teachers.  The model ensures that the same standards and requirements apply to all teachers who have gained conditional registration with the Teaching Council.  The Droichead model was the subject of a three-year pilot which informed the Droichead Policy approved by the Teaching Council in March 2016. The new policy includes a number of significant changes to Droichead.  These changes were shaped by the teachers who have participated in the pilot phase of Droichead.  There will be a further review of the Droichead policy in 2019. In this way, teachers and schools who participate in Droichead over the next few years will have further opportunities to shape and influence the future of their profession's learning.</p>  <p>  Following approval of the Droichead process as its policy on induction and probation in March 2016, the Council requested the Inspectorate in my Department to continue to conduct inspection visits for the purpose of probation during the growth and development phase.  As part of this growth phase, the Council indicated that from September 2016, newly qualified teachers in mainstream settings may complete probation in the traditional manner, through external evaluation conducted by inspectors.  However, completion of the induction/probation process in special education settings can only be achieved through the Droichead process.  The growth and development phase of Droichead will commence in September 2016 and by 2018 the Droichead model will be available to all newly qualified teachers to enable them to gain full registration with the Teaching Council.</p>  <p>  I would encourage the INTO to engage with the Teaching Council as the statutory professional standards body for teaching to clarify the concerns that it has about Droichead in the first instance.  I also wish to inform the Deputy that my Department will continue to work with teacher unions on issues of mutual concern.</p></reply>

Curriculum choice and flexibility is important in motivating students to learn and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle.</p>  <p>  It is important that our pupils are taught about significant national and international events in history.  This underlies the emphasis on History in the primary schools curriculum, and on a broad and balanced understanding of the past.  There is also an important place in our schools for local historical studies, and for social and cultural history.  The primary curriculum stresses that studying History is important in assisting children to become confident, informed, critical and responsible adult members of society and in contributing to developing their literacy skills.</p>  <p>  Schools across all sectors offer History.  History teachers attract students to their subject through their own love and passion for History, and by engaging the natural curiosity of their students in, for example, the lives of people, the origins of the modern world and in objects and documents from the past.  History is the 5th most popular subject in the Junior Certificate examination.  The Decade of Centenaries is giving added interest to History, especially the 1916 - 2016 celebrations this year, and has seen high levels of engagement by many schools, including around Easter of this year.  Great credit is due to students, teachers, school leaders, parents and other education staff for making the education elements of the Ireland 2016 commemorative programme such a success.</p>  <p>  I have every confidence that through the implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle the place of history will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum.  Such an impetus should help to improve take up of History at senior cycle also. In fact, a new specification for Junior Cycle History will shortly be developed by the NCCA.  This will involve intensive consultation whereby all interested parties will be able to provide their views.  The new specification will be available for implementation in all schools from September 2018.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-28a.412.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062800065#WRH04100"><p>I propose to take questions 153 and 162 together.</p><p>  Up until September 2012, an ex-quota allocation was provided for guidance in addition to the standard teacher allocation to post primary schools.  This resource was allocated in accordance with pupil enrolment.  Some 42% of second-level schools at the time were allocated at least 22 hours per week in respect of guidance (22 hours being the equivalent of one teaching post) while the remainder of the schools were allocated between 8 and 17 hours of guidance per week.</p><p>Since September 2012 at post primary level guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation.  Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students.  This operates at local school level and therefore the information requested by the Deputy on the number of guidance counsellors in secondary schools is not available centrally within my Department.</p><p>The current budget provides an improved staffing allocation to second level schools for the purpose of enhancing guidance provision.  This improvement takes effect from next September.  It brings the basis of allocation from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the 2016 - 2017 school year.  This improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation is a restoration of 50% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota.</p><p>The delivery of the 50% restoration through a change in the staffing schedule will allow each school to determine how best to allocate the additional resources to meet the guidance needs of the school.  The circular issued earlier this year by my Department outlining the allocation of teaching resources clearly stated that this additional resource is to complement existing resources in order to best meet the guidance needs of the school in line with the school's guidance plan.</p><p>It is important to note that in previous changes to guidance counselling allocations in 2012, as a consequence of the Budget adjustment which had to be made at the time, all 195 DEIS schools were effectively sheltered from these changes as a result of the more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1.  This was a 0.75 point improvement compared to the current PTR of 19:1 that applies in non-fee-paying second-level schools.</p><p>That was a very important protection for the cohort of our schools in DEIS most in need of support. DEIS schools will also further benefit from the 0.3 improvement to the staffing schedule which will give them an enhanced allocation on the basis of 17.95:1 in respect of the 2016/17 school year.</p><p>In the next Budget I will consider the best approach to further meeting commitments in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

In circumstances where children with special educational needs require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.</p>  <p>  Children, therefore, have a number of placement options including mainstream placement with support, placement in a special class in a mainstream school or placement in a special class in a special school.</p>  <p>  We now have the highest level of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support, Resource Teaching allocations and Special Class provision that we have ever had, which will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p>  <p>  I recently announced that from September next 12,900 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs), at a total gross annual cost of &euro;425 million will be available for allocation to primary and secondary schools.  This is 860 more posts, or a 7% increase, in the number of posts over which were available last year.  In total the number of SNA posts available has increased by almost 22% from 10,575 posts available in 2011.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 11,800 Learning Support and Resource Teacher posts in mainstream primary and post primary schools providing additional teaching support to pupils with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  In May of this year the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocated 7,015 Resource Teaching posts to mainstream schools for September 2016, which is an increase of approximately 9% over the number allocated at September 2015.</p>  <p>  In total, 7,452 Resource Teacher posts will be available for allocation to schools for 2016 -2017, which represents an increase of 41% from 5,265 posts available in 2011.</p>  <p>  In addition, approximately 150 new Special Classes will be opened for the 2016/17 school year, which means there will be over 1,150 special classes in place, compared to 548 special classes in 2011.  Of these 1153 classes, there will be 237 post primary, 525 primary and 127 Early Intervention classes for children with autism, in mainstream schools.</p>  <p>  Each special class for autism at primary level has a 6:1 pupil teacher ratio and at post-primary level has a 6:1.5 pupil teacher ratio.  These classes also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE was requested to prepare updated policy advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.  In developing this policy advice, the NCSE consulted widely with parents, professionals and other stakeholders and interested parties while also conducting research.</p>  <p>  The advice is intended to identify the nature and extent of educational intervention/s, teaching practices and other supports which should be provided to enable children with autism to achieve educational outcomes appropriate to their needs and abilities.</p>  <p>  An implementation group has now been established to review the recommendations of this policy advice.  Any recommendations which relate to the issues raised by the Deputy will be fully considered by this group which will prepare an implementation plan for my consideration.</p></reply>

To sustain primary schools in these communities my Department has a more favourable staffing schedule for small schools that are more than 8km distant from the next nearest school of the same type of patronage and language of instruction.  This measure is designed to provide rural communities with security about the future of their small schools.  With regard to school ethos, the Government supports the concept of parental choice in our school system, whether that be a choice for denominational or multi-denominational education.  In regard to retaining small schools, a specific commitment is given in the Programme for a Partnership Government not to close any small school without the consent of parents.  I am mindful of the concerns of small schools and will take these into account in considering any planning for future provision.</p></reply>

The terms of reference and timescale for the Commission's work are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the importance of being able to attract quality new entrants to the Public Service, particularly so in important professional areas like education.</p>  <p>  The restrictions in entry pay levels were introduced in 2011 and 2012 across the public service at a time when the pressure in public finances was severe and the scope for new recruitment was very restricted.</p>  <p>  Under the Lansdowne Road Agreement the process of restoring public service pay is commencing.  An important feature of this is the flat rate increase which is being implemented.  This is proportionately more valuable to those early in their careers.  Restoration of the supervision and substitution payment is provided for subject to co-operation with the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement did not address the issue of pay of new entrants.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to seek to engage with teacher unions on issues of mutual concern and has recently reached agreement with INTO and TUI in respect of: discussions to improve the position of teachers on fixed-term and part-time teaching; a robust review of in-school management structures; and an increase in the quantum of the extra Croke Park hours which do not have to be worked on a "whole school" basis.</p>  <p>  The Government has also indicated that it will support the gradual negotiated unwinding of FEMPI measures having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p></reply>

My Department will be continuing to engage with Dublin City Council regarding the position of such initiatives from 2017 onwards.</p>  <p>  Other funding for the Ballymun area from my Department comes via the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP), where the allocation to the Ballymun, Whitehall and Tolka area this year is &euro;1.5 million. SICAP is an important community-focussed programme with the aims of reducing poverty and of promoting social inclusion and equality through local, regional and national engagement and collaboration.  It is a key priority of Government and its vision is to improve the life chances and opportunities of those who are marginalised in society, living in poverty or in unemployment through community development approaches, targeted supports and interagency collaboration, where the values of equality and inclusion are promoted and human rights are respected.</p></reply>

The reductions applied to all vehicles with an unladen weight in excess of 4,000kgs, with no change to rates for smaller commercial vehicles.</p>  <p>  To be taxed as a commercial vehicle, a vehicle must be constructed as a goods vehicle and must be used solely in the course of trade or business.  Under section 2 of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952, if a vehicle is being used in a manner that would attract a higher rate of tax, the tax becomes payable at that rate.  In other words, if a vehicle is also being used in a private capacity and the relevant private rate applying to the vehicle is higher than the goods rate, then the vehicle must be taxed at the private rate.</p>  <p>  Licensing authorities have an obligation under Article 3 of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 1992 to be satisfied that a vehicle is correctly taxed and it is thus open to a motor tax office to seek additional documentation supporting a claim for the commercial rate of motor tax.  Such documentation may include a certificate of commercial insurance, evidence of registration for VAT or, at the discretion of the licensing authority concerned, any other appropriate documentation that would indicate that the applicant is in trade or business (including confirmation from an employer that a vehicle is being used by an employee solely in the course of trade or business).  It is up to the individual concerned to provide whatever evidence is required by the local authority in order for it to be satisfied that the applicant is entitled to claim what is in effect a concessionary rate of tax.</p></reply>

With very limited exemptions, these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units as well as private rented residential accommodation. </p>  <p>  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). </p>  <p>  Since the establishment of the RTB, over &euro;30 million has been paid to local authorities to assist them in the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts, including the inspection of rented accommodation.

Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, local authorities have a strengthened legislative framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices where landlords are in breach of their obligations.  Fines for non-compliance with the regulations were also increased; the maximum fine increased from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 and the fine for each day of a continuing offence increased from &euro;250 to &euro;400.</p>  <p>  In the short term it is my intention to promote best practice in implementing the regulations across the local authorities.

However, since the waste industry began releasing its planned pricing plans in relation to the nationwide roll-out of pay-by-weight charging at the start of June, I raised some concerns with the industry regarding the reported increase of waste charges for some customers from July, particularly in relation to some proposed increases in service charges.</p>  <p>  In this regard, I engaged actively and intensively with representatives of the waste industry and have agreed a clear way forward that results in customers paying no more than their current rate for presenting the same amount of waste over the next 12 months - by means of a price freeze to end-June 2017.</p>  <p>  From 1 January 2017, customers will be able to see through a dual billing process, details in their bills about the amount of waste they are disposing of, their costs under the continuation of their current price plan and details of the comparative pay-by-weight charge.  During the transition period, to end June 2017, the Government, in partnership with the waste industry, will drive an intensive public awareness, information and promotion campaign to support customers in understanding the new system, how they can change their waste management behaviour and manage better their waste costs under a pay-by-weight system.</p>  <p>  The above approach provides increased transparency around what charges households would incur under pay-by-weight and also provides householders with information on the operation and benefits of pay by weight along with the option to switch to pay by weight charging from 1 January, 2017.</p>  <p>  After the transitional 12-month period, the operation of pay-by-weight and of the wider waste market will be reviewed to inform decisions in relation to arrangements beyond 1 July 2017.</p></reply>

However, there is currently a civil remedy available concerning branches or roots of neighbouring trees encroaching on a person&rsquo;s property.</p>  <p>  The previous Minister of State for Housing and Planning wrote to the Minister for Justice in June 2012 to explore the possibility of providing a broader civil law remedy for parties affected by high trees and hedges on adjoining properties.  In this regard, advice was sought on the possibility of legislative provision being made  whereby a person substantially deprived of the enjoyment of their property, such as the deprivation of light caused by high trees on a neighbouring property, could apply to the Courts for an order, and that the Courts could make an order as they see fit, e.g. to cut the trees back to an appropriate height.  Safety considerations relating to overhanging trees could also potentially be addressed in any such provisions. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice responded in July 2012, suggesting that disputes of this nature between neighbours could perhaps be more appropriately dealt with through mediation - which is being increasingly used internationally as a tool for the resolution of civil disputes - rather than through the Courts.  In this regard, I understand that the Department of Justice is currently progressing the drafting of a Mediation Bill, aimed at assisting in speeding up the resolution of civil disputes of this nature, thereby reducing legal costs associated with, and ameliorating the stress of, involvement in such contested court proceedings.</p></reply>

The first phase began in March 2015 with an information &amp;amp; awareness visits, followed by vehicle inspections (June 2015), customer account inspections (February 2016) and back office Inspections (April 2016).

These charges prompted the highest per household recycling levels (between 27% and 32%), highest diversion rates from landfill (between 28% and 35%) and the lowest total kerbside waste figures (between 800kg and 947kg per annum).  The study projected that, if the estimated 80% of those households across Ireland currently on pay per lift/tags and differential bin systems switched to &lsquo;per kg&rsquo; based PBU systems, it could lead to an annual diversion from landfill of approximately 446,000 tonnes of domestic waste <i>per annum.</i></p><p>The Study examined three separate forms of Pay-by-Weight system: </p><p>- A charge per kg of waste presented, in addition to an annual flat service charge; </p><p>- A &ldquo;banded&rdquo; weight-based system, using several weight ranges within which the annual weight of waste presented will fall within, with a different price applicable to each weight band; </p><p>and </p><p>An &ldquo;average&rdquo; weight-based system with 800 kg per annum being an average weight - if less than 800 kg is presented during the year, a credit is given for the following year&rsquo;s bill; if more than 800 kg is presented during the year, the customer is billed for the additional weight.</p><p>The data from the Study clearly indicates that a &lsquo;pay per weight (per kg)&rsquo; form of weight based-charging is the most effective pricing system in terms of influencing household behaviour under all indicators, as illustrated in Table 4.1.4 of the study, reproduced below. <table><tr><th>System </th><th>Percentage residual waste </th><th>Percentage recycling </th><th>Total waste per household (kg) </th></tr><tr><td>Per kilogramme weight based charge </td><td>65 </td><td>32 </td><td>800 </td></tr><tr><td>All weight based charges taken together (combination of 22 different types of weight based charges) </td><td>72 </td><td>27 </td><td>947 </td></tr><tr><td>Tag based (i.e. Tag or per Lift) </td><td>79 </td><td>20 </td><td>928 </td></tr><tr><td>Differential (i.e. bin size) </td><td>79 </td><td>21 </td><td>1,294 </td></tr></table></p><p>The Study highlights the desirability of &ldquo;providing a continuous pricing signal to householders&rdquo; through the charging system.  For example, when using a smaller bin (even at a lesser charge), the householder will not reduce waste costs if they do not fill their bin and thus have no on-going incentive to change their waste management behaviour to divert waste from landfill any further than is necessary to avoid exceeding the capacity of the smaller bin size.</p><p>The practice of charging a simple flat rate fee (annual or otherwise periodic) for waste collection services does not appear from the Study to incentivise the management of waste in line with the national waste policy, the waste hierarchy, the polluter pays principle and incentivising waste reduction and segregation by householders.  The argument which has been made is that , by offering the choice of a large and a small residual bin and applying a smaller annual charge for smaller sized bin, due regard is being had for waste prevention.  However, the Study identified that the practice of waste compaction undermined the rationale for the use of the smaller size bin.  Indeed, the EPA Study&rsquo;s overall finding on Differential Bin-sized Pay-by-use Charges was that &ldquo; this PBU system was found to be the least effective system in terms of impact upon the environment, resulting in a high waste to landfill rate (79%) and highest total waste of the three PBU systems (i.e. Pay-by-weight, Tag-a-bag and Differential-Bin-Sizes) studied (1,294kg per household per annum).&rdquo;</p><p>The pay-per- lift approach results imply that it is more effective than a flat fee charging system in terms of encouraging waste reduction and recycling.  However, in the case of organic bins, the pay per lift approach encourages consumers to wait until their bin is full and the waste within it is well compacted before having the material removed, which can mean that unnecessary odour nuisance has been created and much of the resource value of the material has diminished by the time it is collected.  Applying a per kilogramme pay-by- weight charging system for organic bins encourages a more frequent collection of such material and thus ensures a reduction in potential odour nuisance and a better quality product to the end processor.</p><p>Pay-by-weight per kilogramme is not a new charge, but a new way of charging to incentivise waste prevention and segregation.  However, it appears that some companies may have taken the opportunity to increase charges to customers under the guise of the introduction of pay-by-weight, especially to recover costs in instances where the service was being provided below cost.</p><p>The 87% figure of people doing better under pay-by-weight was based on a study of a pay-by-weight model which was in actual operation in the South West of the country, when compared to other pricing structures in that particular area. The figures were collated in response to a request to get an indication of how pay-by-weight compared in terms of price.  The area chosen had a mix of urban and rural customers and pay-by-weight was long established, so that the customers in that particular area had had the time and opportunity to adapt their behaviour to preventing and segregating waste.  The figures showed that households of 4 people or less in that area were better off under pay by weight and those figures were extrapolated, using CSO data on household size, to give an indication of the savings which were achievable.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  Security of tenure under the 2004 Act is based on rolling four-year tenancy cycles.  Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period.  This is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy. </p>  <p>  A landlord may not terminate a Part 4 tenancy except in very clearly defined circumstances such as a failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations in relation to the tenancy.  Where there is a dispute regarding the validity of a notice of termination, or where the tenant does not comply with the notice of termination, the dispute may be referred to the RTB for resolution.   </p>  <p>  Section 87 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 states that, if a dispute referred to the RTB relates to the termination of a tenancy for failure by the landlord or tenant to fulfil his or her obligations relating to the tenancy, any remedial action taken by the other party subsequent to the receipt of the notice of termination shall not be taken into consideration by the Board, a mediator, an adjudicator or the Tribunal in dealing with the dispute.   </p>  <p>  The national housing charity, Threshold, is an independent body which provides advice and advocacy services to those experiencing difficulties within a tenancy.

The working group, which comprises representatives of my Department and the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Finance; and the T&aacute;naiste's Office, submitted its second report to Government in July 2013. </p>  <p>  That Government considered the report and, given the complexity of the issues involved, including the fact that the vast majority of households had moved away from local authority collection, with the service now largely provided by private waste collectors, on whom it would be difficult to impose any obligation to provide a waiver system, mandated the working group to continue to explore the issue .   </p>  <p>  During the period in which local authorities were directly involved in the collection of household waste, a minority of individual Councils offered different levels of discount to selected households, based on different qualification criteria.  As local authorities exited the waste collection market, some required the private operators which took on the Councils&rsquo; customers to provide a level of discount for existing waiver customers only, and even then for a limited time. </p>  <p>  The vast majority of such contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired. In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price.  However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis. </p>  <p>  In addition, a very limited number of local authorities make financial contributions towards the cost of, or pay for, the collection of waste from certain households.  Again, the qualification criteria and level of support differ from area to area. </p>  <p>  With the exception of one or two municipal districts, local authorities no longer collect waste and the market is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged are a matter between service provider and customer and the services offered vary across the country.  In that regard, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a national waiver scheme could not be imposed in the context of an open market for waste collection.   </p></reply>

A comprehensive Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) from 2012 also considered options regarding the organisation of the household waste collection market and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following weblink: <i></i><font color="#1F497D">.</font>The RIA recognised that there were some advantages to the &lsquo;franchise bidding&rsquo; approach (also known as competition <i>for</i>the market) which scored marginally higher than strengthening the regulatory regime and keeping the existing 'side by side' competitive market structure (competition <i>in</i>the market).  However, given the critical nature of the waste collection service, the risks associated with moving to &lsquo;franchise bidding&rsquo; were judged to deem this option ultimately less desirable.  Noting that there was a possibility that a switch from &lsquo; side by side &rsquo; competition to &lsquo;franchise bidding&rsquo; could incur costs that actually made household waste collection less efficient, the RIA ultimately made the recommendation to strengthen the regulation of the market, especially in light of the risks associated with competition for the market.</p><p>The then Competition Authority were tasked, under <i>A Resource Opportunity &ndash; Waste Management Policy in Ireland</i>, with carrying out a formal review of the operation of the household waste collection market during 2016.  However, this review was deferred, pending the scheduled introduction of pay-by-weight charging, so as to provide sufficient time for the new charging system to take effect before undertaking such a review. </p><p>I have recently agreed with industry, as part of a &lsquo;price freeze&rsquo; transition period , that customers will from 1 January 2017 be able to see, through a dual billing process,<b></b>details in their bills about the amount of waste they are disposing of, their costs under the continuation of their current price plan and details of the comparative pay-by-weight charge with the option to move to pay by weight.</p><p>At the end of this 12-month transition period (in July 2017), the Government will review the operation of pay-by-weight and the wider market to inform decisions in relation to the arrangements beyond 1 July 2017 .</p></reply>

This means that Irish Water may acquire by agreement a waterworks or waste water works, subject generally to not fewer than two thirds of those entitled to dispose of it (typically the members of a group water scheme), giving their consent.

The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>contains a commitment for the introduction of a new model of affordable rental to provide more housing options for low income households and to relieve pressure on the social housing sector. &euro;10 million is being made available from the proceeds of the sale of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to fund a pilot scheme in 2016.  The details of the Scheme are currently being finalised in my Department for roll-out in the coming months.  The Scheme will involve an ongoing annual commitment to secure a long term increase in the supply of affordable properties to meet the needs of those households that would struggle to make rental payments under present market conditions.  The pilot Scheme is expected to work on the basis of tenants paying the majority of the rental cost from their own resources, with the State helping to meet the shortfall. It is intended that the scheme would be made available to employed households on low to moderate incomes, as well as being a possible support option for some households who qualify for social housing support.  A State policy intervention - such as a subsidy - would be applied to bridge the gap between what people can afford, and what the housing market charges. Such a scheme would also be expected to facilitate and incentivise private investment into this sector.</p><p>The inadequate level of housing supply is at the heart of the difficulties in the housing sector and, in that regard, measures have already been taken to boost new housing construction and enhance supply at more affordable prices.  The &ldquo;Stabilising Rents &ndash; Boosting Supply&rdquo; package announced by Government in November 2015 included:</p><p>- A targeted rebate of development contributions in Dublin and Cork for housing supplied under certain price levels to enhanced supply of more affordable starter homes in key locations;</p><p>- New National Apartment Planning Guidelines to reduce the cost of apartment building in Dublin City,</p><p>- Changes to aspects of the operation of Strategic Development Zones to enable swifter adjustments to meet market requirements; and,</p><p>- The Government&rsquo;s Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) to examine funding for housing infrastructure on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>The package also included a number of measures to support rent stability in the rented </p><p>sector, pending additional housing supply coming on stream in the coming years.</p><p>Further actions aimed at increasing the supply of housing at more affordable prices are being examined in the context of drafting the Government&rsquo;s new &lsquo;Action Plan for Housing,&rsquo; which is to be published in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This will ensure the long-term sustainability of the library service in Ireland.  It does not involve the closure of libraries nor will it require a reduction of the library services available in those areas, in fact, the model seeks to enhance the services that are available.  The proposed operating model was developed on foot of a risk assessment.  A cost-benefit analysis was not carried out as the reforms were identified as a means for achieving a greater and more equitable standard of library service rather than the requirement to drive greater cost efficiency.</p><p>Over the last number of months my Department has been engaging with the respective local authorities to explore the implementation of the revised operating model.

This legislation provides for global valuations of utility undertakings to be carried out by the Valuation Office every five years and entered on the central valuation list.  This can result in either increases or decreases to the relevant valuation.  In 2015, the Valuation Office carried out global valuations carried for Gas Networks Ireland, Iarnrod Eireann and telecommunications companies BT Ireland, Eircom, Vodafone, Three Ireland and Meteor.  In November 2015, the Valuation Office issued a copy of the Valuation Certificate and a schedule setting out the apportioned value for each rating authority to my Department.  The previous valuation for these utilities had taken place in 2010.  The Global Valuation Certificates showed a reduction in the combined valuations for these utilities of &euro;112m.  In addition, the reduction in the global valuation of the ESB, following an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, reduced the rates payable by the ESB from 2016.</p>  <p>  The timing of the global valuations in 2015 caused particular difficulties for local authorities as they were published at an advanced stage of the local authority budgetary process.  In this regard, my Department engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and it was agreed that there would be a once-off adjustment in support from the Local Government Fund in 2016 to local authorities affected by the global valuations.  The additional allocation provided was on an exceptional and once- off basis, solely for the 2016 budgetary period.</p>  <p>  The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which includes adopting the annual budget, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.  As such, it is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources.</p></reply>

They also impose obligations on producers who supply packaging.</p><p>Repak, as the approved Compliance Scheme for Packaging in Ireland, fulfil these obligations on behalf of its members who represent the majority of packaging producers in Ireland.  Repak employ an expert team of Packaging Technologists to assist companies in optimising their packaging systems and to prevent packaging waste, in line with their producer responsibility obligations.  They achieve this by working directly with Government, environmental agencies and industry to deliver programmes that reduce the amount of packaging placed onto the Irish market.  Repak technologists work directly with companies to identify areas where packaging waste can be prevented or minimised.  On-site surveys are carried out and 'Packaging Optimisation Reports' are compiled that guide member companies through the opportunities they have to improve their packaging systems and to reduce their packaging waste.  This saves material and money for the companies involved, and in turn helps to reduce the overall amount of packaging placed on the Irish market.</p><p>Repak also carry out work in relation to consumer awareness. Since 2002, Repak has run key educational campaigns, targeted at consumer awareness and encouraging recycling.  PR and media campaigns for consumer awareness take place regularly around key consumption and shopping periods (Easter and Christmas).  These campaigns are nation-wide and across media, advertising, digital and social media channels.  In addition, it promotes an Annual Repak Recycling Week in October, where the aim is to educate consumers on key issues on packaging recycling (from contamination, to better recycling habits at home and at work).  It also collaborates with members (e.g. Cadbury's, IKEA, etc.) to extend a broader recycling message on packaging and glass recycling nation-wide with marketing communication campaigns across advertising, public relations, digital and social media. </p><p>Thanks to such initiatives, Ireland has been compliant with all statutory packaging recovery targets set since 2001 and continues to exceed our EU targets.</p><p>The successful prevention of food waste and the optimal methodology for managing such waste when it arises is dependent on appropriate education and awareness measures being introduced to support households.  In this regard, my Department has worked with the Composting and Anaerobic Digestion Association of Ireland to develop a website, <i>www.brownbin.ie</i>, to provide the public with the information required to use the brown bin appropriately, including advice on food waste prevention and home composting.  I am confident that initiatives such as this can assist the public in the diversion of their food waste towards more beneficial uses and ensuring that full value can be derived from this resource.</p><p>Furthermore, my Department continues to support the Local Authority Prevention Network (LAPN) through the National Waste Prevention Programme.  The LAPN aims to build capacity in local authorities for promoting waste prevention at a local and grassroots level for the benefit of their regions and many of their programmes focus on food waste, including awareness raising campaigns, on-site work with businesses, information stands at festivals, events and public locations.  Their &quot;Stop Food Waste Challenge&quot; targets householders and small business through a mix of national promotion on food waste prevention (TV, radio, social media, newspaper articles).</p><p>The Local Agenda 21 Environmental Partnership Fund, which has operated since 1997, also promotes sustainable development by assisting small-scale environmental projects at local level.  These projects involve partnership arrangements between local authorities and various local groups, including community groups, schools and environmental NGOs and have been used to support small-scale community projects, including the development of community composting facilities.</p></reply>

Excessive pricing by individual companies will offer the opportunity for rival operators to provide their services at a cheaper price.</p>  <p>  In response to recent concerns regarding reported price increases for some customers, I have engaged actively with representatives of the waste industry to ensure that waste collection charges are fair and transparent.  I have agreed a clear way forward that results in customers paying no more than they are currently paying for waste over the next 12 months - by means of a price freeze to end-June 2017, to prepare better for the change-over to pay-by-weight charging.  An intensive public awareness, information and promotion campaign will be rolled out over the coming months to support customers in understanding the new system, how they can change their waste management behaviour and manage better their waste costs under a pay-by-weight system.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Government has set a minimum mandatory fee per kg for the different types of household waste: 11 cent for black bin (residual waste), 6 cent for brown bin (organic).  However, in order to encourage further improvement in recycling, I decided that a zero cent minimum fee per kg may be charged for green bins (recyclate).</p>  <p>  In light of the above, it is unlikely that the form of charging for the collection of recyclable waste will form part of the review which is scheduled to take place over the coming 12 months.</p></reply>

The levy shall be applied by planning authorities, commencing on 1 January 2019 in respect of sites which were vacant and on the vacant site register during the year 2018 and shall subsequently be applied on an annual basis thereafter, as long as a site remains on the vacant site register in the preceding year.</p><p>Planning authorities are empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of vacant sites exceeding 0.05 hectares in area - with reduced or zero rates of levy applying in specific circumstances - which, in the planning authority's opinion, were vacant or idle in the preceding year, in areas identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development.  The 3% rate of vacant site levy is consistent with the rate applied to derelict sites under the Derelict Sites Act 1991 and is considered reasonable, without being over-punitive, for the purposes of incentivising the activation of such sites for residential or regeneration purposes.  In this regard, it is also worth noting that all levies due on an individual site shall remain a charge on the land concerned until all outstanding levies due are paid so there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development purposes for each year a site remains vacant or idle.</p><p>The Act further provides that residential or regeneration land, regardless of ownership, either public or private, will be subject to the levy if it meets the criteria for a vacant site. </p><p>In addition, the Act provides that planning authorities shall determine - utilising a suitably qualified person for this purpose - the market value of a vacant site placed on the register on the basis of the price it would fetch if sold on the open market, with the market valuation being required to be reviewed at least every 3 years.  The owner of a vacant site may appeal the market value determination arrived at by a planning authority to the Valuation Tribunal.</p><p>My Department intends to issue guidelines to planning authorities in relation to the practical implementation of the vacant site levy provisions shortly.</p></reply>

These costs are based on an analysis of returned data from local authorities on social housing schemes.  Nevertheless, information on the average cost of current social housing developments of various sizes is preliminary at this stage and will be better informed when a greater number of projects have completed the tendering stage over the months ahead.  My Department has also input into work led by the Department of Finance in relation to construction costs which was undertaken under the <i>Construction 2020 </i>Strategy.</p><p>In general terms, the cost of delivering housing is largely dependent on the type, size and geographic location of the development concerned, the availability of services, access to infrastructure and on the contractual arrangements leading to its construction.  Against this background, construction costs can vary greatly across the country which gives rise to difficulties in developing more accurate costings for the various house types in the absence of site-specific and evidence based information.</p><p>In terms of the regulatory environment, since 2012, amendments have been made to Parts A (Structure), D (Materials and Workmanship), J (Heat Producing Appliances), K (Stairways, Ladders, Ramps and Guards) and E (Sound) of the <i>Building Regulations 1997.</i>Each of these amendments was accompanied by a Regulatory Impact Assessment which examined, among other things, the incremental impact on the costs on construction that would arise from the new regulatory requirements proposed therein.</p><p>Part A (Structure) of the Building Regulations was amended in 2012 to facilitate the implementation and use of Eurocodes for construction works and structural construction products.  The Regulatory Impact Assessment is available at <i>www.environ.ie/regulatory-impact-assessment-structural-safety-buildings-proposed-amendment-tgd-part-structure</i>.  Part D (Materials and Workmanship) of the Building Regulations was amended in 2013 to take account of the implementation of <i>Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products</i>.  The accompanying Regulatory Impact Assessment is available at <i>.</i></p><p>Part J (Heat Producing Appliances) of the Building Regulations was amended in 2014 to provide for, among other things, the detection and warning of carbon monoxide in dwellings.  The associated Regulatory Impact Assessment is available at<i>. </i>Part K (Stairways, Ladders, Ramps and Guards) of the Building Regulations was amended in 2014 to provide, among other things, additional guidance on prevention of falls from windows in new dwellings.</p><p>Part E (Sound) of the Building Regulations was also amended in 2014 to improve the sound performance of new attached dwellings.  The associated Regulatory Impact Assessment is available to view or download at<i>.</i></p><p>Separate to revisions to the Building Regulations, my Department has also made a number of revisions to the  <i>Building Control Regulations 1997.</i></p><p>The development of the<i>Building Control (Amendment) Regulations </i>2014, which strengthened requirements in relation to accountability for compliance with Building Regulations, was informed by the <i>Strengthening the Building Control System - A Document to inform public consultation on Draft Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2012.</i>The <i>Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014</i>, were reviewed following their first 12 months in operation to consider, among other things, the impact of the regulations on single dwellings and extensions to existing dwellings.  A suite of consultation documents, which include specific information on costs, are available at <i>.</i></p><p>In accordance with the<i>Programme for a Partnership Government,</i>my Department is preparing an <i>Action Plan for Housing</i>with a view to identifying any reasonable and appropriate measures that may be taken in the interests of reducing construction overheads in order to facilitate an increased level of housing output into the future and a broader review of the costs of construction may be considered in this regard.</p></reply>

Once all the necessary legal instruments are put in place to effect the transfer of the relevant functions, my colleague, Minister Naughten, will have full responsibility for climate matters.  Notwithstanding this transition process, Minister Naughten is already fully engaged in policy development and issues relating to the climate change agenda within the newly expanded remit of his Department.</p><p>The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the <i>National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development</i>, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the <i>Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015</i>which was enacted in December 2015.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the <i>Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015</i>.</p><p>In accordance with Section 4 of the Act, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government must submit a National Mitigation Plan to Government for approval by June 2017 at the latest.  As stated above, this function will pass to Minister Naughten once the necessary legal instruments are put in place.</p><p>Work is well underway on the development of the first statutory National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place a particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that.</p><p>The ultimate objective of successive National Mitigation Plans is to incrementally achieve this low carbon transition vision by 2050.  In that context, the National Mitigation Plan will have regard to Ireland's obligations under the current 2009 Effort Sharing Decision, the Paris Agreement and any likely future EU and international obligations that may arise, including new national targets to be agreed under the 2030 climate and energy package.</p><p>The Paris Agreement sets out a long-term goal to put the world on track to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.  In this regard, it is noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been tasked with evaluating what will be the specific policy implications of this goal with a special report to be published in 2018.  Notwithstanding this, the overall outcome of the Paris Conference means that the long-term objective that Ireland has already established in the National Policy Position, and that is now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, namely to pursue substantial decarbonisation of the energy, transport and built environment sectors as well as pursuing neutrality in the land sector, will now be undertaken within a broader international context.</p></reply>

When enacted, this legislation will allow new fathers, including fathers of adopted children, to start the combined package of paternity leave and paternity benefit at any time within the first six months following the birth of the child or, in the case of adoptions the day of placement.  The Bill also provides for same sex couples on an equal basis with other couples.  In relation to the operation of the Scheme, my Department will provide a minimum of paid paternity benefit of &euro;230 per week for the two weeks of paternity leave.</p><p>Every scheme must have a start date and a Government decision was made that the paternity leave and paternity benefit scheme would come into effect on 30<sup>th</sup>September 2016.  As a result, paternity benefit will only be payable for a child born or placed on or after the 30<sup>th</sup>September 2016.</p><p>It is very difficult to estimate the numbers that will take up paternity leave and paternity benefit.  My Department estimates that it could be 30,000 to 40,000 fathers who will receive paternity benefit in a full year, at a cost of &euro;20 million.  This year, 2016, the payment is expected to cost the exchequer &euro;5 million, which equates to one quarter of the expected full year cost. </p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s network of Intreo Offices does not have access to a grant or subsidy to pay for the provision of such equipment. </p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection contracts for the provision of a Local Employment Service (LES) with 23 organisations across the State in areas of particular disadvantage.  LES services include mediation support to clients living within a specified catchment to help place them into jobs.  The mediators have access to a limited Mediator Fund.  This fund is available where a mediator identifies that a client needs an additional support to facilitate their entry the labour market and that this need cannot be met by any state provider.

In the case of a couple, account is taken of the means of both members of the couple and this reflects the fact that married couples, civil partners and cohabitants are financially interdependent on each other. </p>  <p>  The jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme features a range of disregards and tapering arrangements where one or both members of the couple are working.  Where, for example, the spouse, civil partner or cohabitee is in employment, the employed person can earn up to &euro;31,410 per annum (gross) before entitlement is fully withdrawn from the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claimant (assuming no other means).  In the case of a couple with two children, the equivalent figure is &euro;36,815 per annum.  The introduction of a minimum level of level of entitlement where, ordinarily, there is no entitlement because of the level of means of one or both of the parties would represent a significant change to the provision of means-tested payments in Ireland and would target additional resources at households not currently entitled including some higher income households.</p>  <p>  Where a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claimant is aged under 25, the value of the benefit and privilege derived from living with a parent or step-parent is assessed for means test purposes.   In practice, benefit and privilege is taken to mean the value of board and lodging to applicants residing in the home of parents and the value of same is assessed by reference to a formula (with a wide range of income disregards). The purpose of the assessment is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants who have this benefit and those who have not, and between people living in relatively better-off households and those whose circumstances are less well off. </p>  <p>  Where the claimant&rsquo;s means (from the value of any benefit and privilege and any other means) are in excess of the statutory rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, no payment is made.  Where the claimant&rsquo;s means result in an entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance of a rate of &euro;1 per week or less than &euro;40 per week, a minimum payment of &euro;40 per week is paid.  Accordingly, the current arrangements guarantee a minimum rate of payment where there is an underlying entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance in the first instance and does not apply where this is not the case.  It should be noted, in this regard, that the assessment of the value of benefit and privilege does not imply that there is a direct financial transfer from a parent to the adult child and the current arrangements ensure that the jobseeker has access to some direct cash support.  Such arrangements are not available to jobseekers who do not have an underlying entitlement to a payment because they reside in higher income parental households.  </p>  <p>  Any changes to the means testing arrangements of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance would have to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.  </p></reply>

Each person is assigned to a personal adviser who assesses a person&rsquo;s skills, experience, challenges and work goals. The personal adviser and the participant draw up a personal progression plan that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job-focused targets which may include work experience via the JobBridge internship scheme provided that this internship is undertaken voluntarily by the jobseeker and does not substitute for provision of the JobPath advisory service. If a jobseeker receiving support under JobPath takes up a JobBridge opportunity they will continue to work with their JobPath advisor during the internship programme. If they are subsequently placed into a job they will continue to receive support for at least three months, and up to twelve months, while in employment.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

FIS is designed to prevent child and family poverty and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment as compared to social welfare payments.  Expenditure on FIS for 2016 is estimated to be of the order of &euro;410 million and it is currently paid to some 56,000 families in respect of almost 123,000 children. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2016 Family Income Supplement income thresholds were increased by &euro;5 for families with one child and &euro;10 for families with two or more children.  </p>  <p>  An integral part of FIS is that the payment continues at the same rate for a period of 52 weeks, assuming the eligibility requirements continue to be met, except in the following circumstances:</p>  <p>  - If a claimant starts to care for an additional child in the course of the 52 weeks.</p>  <p>  - If a claimant was getting a one-parent family payment and this payment was stopped because their youngest child reached the relevant age limit.</p>  <p>The rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in earnings.  The advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.  This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides an incentive to claimants to maximise their earnings from employment (e.g. more hours, higher wages).  For those who experience a reduction in earnings, the rate of payment will be reassessed at renewal of their FIS claim.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to introduce a graduated FIS scheme, which would continue to pay FIS above the current family thresholds.  The introduction of such a system could have significant financial implications for the Exchequer and would have to be considered carefully in an overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

The 2016 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme of &euro;2.45 billion.</p><p>Social welfare legislation states that a person is not entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance while attending a course of study.  This disqualification also extends to the holiday periods, including the summer holidays.  It also provides that a person shall be regarded as attending a course of study:</p><p>- for 3 months immediately following the completion or the leaving by that person of second level education or the completion by him or her of the leaving certificate examination of the Department of Education and Skills, whichever is the later;</p><p>- for the duration of an academic year, or</p><p>- for the period immediately following the completion of one academic year, other than the final academic year of a course of study, up to the beginning of the following year.</p><p>The disqualification for receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance does not apply in the case of mature students during the period between two academic years.  During this period a mature student can apply for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance, subject to satisfying the standard qualifying conditions, including that of being available for full-time work.</p><p>The disqualification for three months is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.

Such property includes all monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares and houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use.  However, it does not include property such as the family home or, for example, a premises used by the claimant in carrying out a business. </p><p>For assessment purposes, savings are assessed by reference to the following, as follows: </p><p><b>Capital - Assessment Formula</b><table><tr><th>AMOUNT OF CAPITAL</th><th>WEEKLY MEANS ASSESSED</th></tr><tr><td>Up to &euro;20,000</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;20,000 - &euro;30,000</td><td>&euro;1 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;30,000 - &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;2 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Over &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;4 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr></table></p><p>It should be noted that for the purposes of the State pension non-contributory, the amounts above are doubled in the case of a couple. </p><p>No account is taken of interest or dividend payments received in the means assessment.

As the Deputy outlines, the numbers have continued to drop from 71,533 in January 2015 to 61,247 at the end of 2015. </p>  <p>  There are many factors for the fall in rent supplement recipients including the improving economy and the fall in the Live Register.  There are some 20,100 rent supplement recipients on the Live Register, representing circa 6.7% of the total May 2016 Live Register.  The recent reduction in recipients can be mainly attributed to the significant change in rent supplement policy with the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Under HAP, responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to those with a long-term housing need transfers to local authorities, under the auspices of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government. HAP is currently operational in 19 of the 31 local authority areas with over 10,500 tenancies now in place.  The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), in operation since 2004, has also continued its operations in the transfer of rent supplement customers. </p>  <p>  Officials in the Department of Social Protection are working closely with those in the lead Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the relevant local authorities, in supporting the further implementation of HAP with further local authorities expected to come on stream this autumn.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The 2016 Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure of &euro;85 million on the farm assist scheme.</p>  <p>  Changes introduced in Budgets 2012 and 2013 brought farm assist into closer alignment with the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed people.  Farm families with the lowest income were least impacted by these changes as the headline rates of farm assist were maintained.</p>  <p>  To qualify for payment under the farm assist scheme, a person must satisfy a means test.

Financial information such as the most recently available accounts of the farm are, of course, relevant to an assessment of means.  However, while such accounts may be informative they are not an absolute requirement. As such the farm assist means test is designed to be flexible so as to allow for significant income fluctuations from one year to the next.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains the commitment to undertake a "Review of the Farm Assist Scheme, recognising the challenges facing farmers on low incomes".

The weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;40 for coupled households.  Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs. </p>  <p>  The rent supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase.  Income from employment and family income supplement (FIS) in excess of the standard SWA weekly rate of payment attract an additional income disregard and are assessed as follows; the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.</p>  <p>  The legislative basis for the assessment of FIS as assessable income for rent supplement purposes was provided by way of Regulation under Article 4(b) of Statutory Instrument 267 of 2007.</p>  <p>  Policy regarding the differential rents scheme operated by local authorities is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Two companies, Turas Nua and Seetec, have been contracted by the Department to deliver the JobPath service.</p><p>The table provides a breakdown of referrals by company and by county: <table><tr><th>Contractor Name</th><th>County</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Seetec</td><td>Cavan</td><td>1006</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Donegal</td><td>1652</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Dublin</td><td>5546</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Galway</td><td>2140</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kildare</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Leitrim</td><td>248</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Longford</td><td>1194</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Louth</td><td>1808</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Mayo</td><td>1074</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Meath</td><td>648</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Monaghan</td><td>344</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Offaly</td><td>254</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Roscommon</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sligo</td><td>448</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Westmeath</td><td>1116</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Seetec Total</td><td>17640</td></tr><tr><td>Turas Nua</td><td>Carlow</td><td>1021</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Clare</td><td>1087</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cork</td><td>3865</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Galway</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kerry</td><td>1467</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kildare</td><td>1916</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kilkenny</td><td>692</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Laois</td><td>380</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Limerick</td><td>2513</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Offaly</td><td>886</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Tipperary</td><td>1154</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Waterford</td><td>1960</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Wexford</td><td>1923</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Wicklow</td><td>1316</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Turas Nua Total</td><td>20231</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Grand Total</td><td>37871</td></tr></table></p><p>Note: both companies deliver JobPath services in different parts of Galway, Offaly &amp;amp; Kildare.</p><p>Clients receive support for 52 weeks but this period may continue for up to 130 weeks e.g. where a person engages in further education/training (for up to 26 weeks) and receives &ldquo;in work&rdquo; support (for up to 52 weeks).  The rollout of JobPath commenced in July 2015 on a &ldquo;soft-launch&rdquo; basis.  To date no one has completed their engagement with the JobPath service. Detailed analyses of JobPath data will be published later this year.  As indicated in &ldquo;Pathways to Work 2016 &ndash; 2020&rdquo; the Department intends to publish performance statistics of contracted providers including JobPath from Q3 2016.</p><p>JobPath is a payment by results model and all initial costs are borne by the companies.  JobPath is so structured that the companies will not be able to fully recover their costs until they place sufficient numbers of jobseekers into sustainable jobs.  It is not intended to publish the individual payments to the JobPath companies as these are commercially sensitive and to do so would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the contracts now in place and any future procurement that may be undertaken.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In addition to the telephone service, my Department provides a range of contact channels for customers including face to face, e-mail, SMS (text), and online through our website www.welfare.ie.</p><p>My Department endeavours to provide the most responsive telephone service possible to its customers.  To that effect, it has implemented a call management system across centralised scheme areas, which allows managers to monitor and manage call volumes.  The system provides a flexible means of managing sudden peaks in customer demand and allows for the active management of calls by way of assigning, where feasible, more staff to the telephone lines at peak periods.  The system&rsquo;s report for May 2016 shows the average call waiting times to be just over two minutes, ranging from the shortest at ten seconds to the longest at eighteen minutes. </p><p>In addition, my Department has recently upgraded its IVR (Interactive Voice Technology) to improve call treatment and reduce the average time it takes for customers to reach the correct call queue to 30 seconds across all offices.</p><p>Intreo Centres, in addition to providing a telephone service, have introduced a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining claim processing in recent years.  These initiatives, including a dedicated appointment service for jobseekers, aim to provide comprehensive information and advice at early claim stages, reducing the level of subsequent telephone queries.</p><p>My Department is focused on modernising its service delivery platform, making full use of new and emerging technologies to broaden the range of service delivery channels offered.  The Department's new online self-service facility www.mywelfare.ie<font color="#0000FF"> </font>is designed to enable customers access personalised Department of Social Protection services at a time and place that suits them.  A number of services have already been delivered on this new facility and more will be added on a phased basis.</p><p>In order to equip staff to deal effectively with customers, the Department provides training in customer service which includes communicating effectively with customers, effective telephone techniques, active listening and the importance of understanding and empathy.  Training courses also include raising of awareness of disability, mental health and diversity issues relevant to staff and customers.</p><p>The Department has a formal comments and complaints procedure in place to allow customers give feedback on the quality of services they receive.  If a customer is unhappy with the quality of service received, they can submit a complaint online at www.welfare.ie, by email to qcs@welfare.ie, by telephone to 1890 66 22 44, or in writing to Quality Customer Services, Social Welfare Services, College Road, Sligo.  All such complaints will be dealt with promptly, fairly and impartially.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The scheme currently provides work opportunities for around 2,600 participants and 130 supervisory staff.</p>  <p>  The funds allocated for the scheme in 2016 amount to &euro;44.3m.

Farm assist recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2016 Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure of &euro;85 million on the farm assist scheme.</p>  <p>  Changes introduced in Budgets 2012 and 2013 brought farm assist into closer alignment with the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed people.  Farm families with the lowest income were least impacted by these changes as the headline rates of farm assist were maintained.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains the commitment to undertake a "Review of the Farm Assist Scheme, recognising the challenges facing farmers on low incomes".

This is the same weekly rate which is payable to a single person with one child in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, disability allowance and farm assist.  The personal weekly rate is &euro;188 per week for all of these schemes.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that where two people are married, civil partners or cohabiting and are living together, there is no entitlement to a one parent family payment.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, illness benefit, injury benefit, farm assist and pre-retirement allowance either one or both members of the couple can claim a payment in their own right if they satisfy the relevant contingency.  While the maximum personal weekly rate of these payments is &euro;188 per week, the total amount a couple can receive is limited to the equivalent of one personal rate of payment (&euro;188 per week) and one increase for a qualified adult (&euro;124.80) or the rates which apply when.  Payment is then made to each member of the couple at half this total entitlement including an increase for qualified children, if any.  Alternatively, one member of the couple may claim an increase for a qualified adult.  Similar arrangements apply in the case of invalidity pension and State pensions (contributory and non-contributory) but the maximum rates payable are somewhat higher as the personal and qualified adult rates are higher.  Limitation does not apply where one of the couple is entitled to a carer&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance.</p>  <p>  There have been no changes to these arrangements since the report referenced by the Deputy was published.  The current arrangements apply to all affected couples regardless of whether one has been a lone parent at any stage and reflect the fact that two individuals maintaining one household will incur lower costs than two people maintaining separate households.</p>  <p>  Any changes to the proportional payment of social welfare payments for qualified adults or the limitation arrangements described above would involve significant costs and there and there are no such plans under consideration at present.</p></reply>

The 2016 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit of &euro;369 million.</p>  <p>  Since the extension of full social insurance cover to part-time workers from April 1991, a range of measures were introduced to the short-term illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit schemes in order to ensure that disincentives to employment were not created.  In the absence of these measures, a situation would exist whereby many workers on low incomes would have access to weekly social welfare payments greatly in excess of their income from employment.  For instance, while someone earning &euro;31.17 a week or more would have been liable for PRSI Class A contributions, the maximum personal rate of illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit from January 1993 was &euro;70.60 a week, i.e. the social welfare benefits available could have been more than twice the level of income from employment for some people.</p>  <p>  To overcome the potential disincentives involved, new arrangements were introduced from January 1993 to relate the rate of benefit payable to the level of the claimant&rsquo;s earnings.  These measures were regularly updated to keep pace with changes in benefit levels.  Adjustments in Budget 2009 sought to bring the income threshold and banding structure back into line with the level of benefits payable.</p>  <p>  Jobseeker's Benefit rates are graduated according to an applicant&rsquo;s earnings in the relevant tax year and reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit are payable where the average reckonable weekly earnings are less than the prescribed amount.  Under the current arrangements jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit recipients with earnings of less than &euro;300 per week in the relevant tax year - for claims in 2016, the relevant tax year is 2014 - get a personal rate ranging from &euro;84.50 to &euro;147.30, and reduced rates for qualified adults may also apply.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit recipients with average earnings over &euro;300 per week in the relevant tax year will receive a personal rate of &euro;188 per week.  Recipients of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit may also opt to transfer to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</p>  <p>  Any changes to the average weekly earnings thresholds under the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme would have to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

The Government has provided &euro;38.8 million for this scheme in 2016.</p><p>I recently announced that the 2016 BSCFA scheme is open for applications.  In 2016, similar to arrangements in previous years, a large proportion of BSCFA payments (approximately 109,000 families in respect of approximately 193,000 children) are being fully automated with no application form required.  Letters issued in early June informing families of their entitlement and notifying them that payment would issue during the week ending 15th July.  The rate of payment is &euro;100 in respect of children aged 4 to 11 and &euro;200 for children over 12 years in second level education.  The total amount to be paid to these customers will be circa &euro;29 million. </p><p>Customers who did not receive notification of an automated payment are required to make a written application for the payment.  Application forms are available in all Departmental offices, via SMS (text Form BTSCFA followed by name and address to 51909), from the website www.welfare.ie or by email to the Department at BSCFA@welfare.ie.</p><p>Using total the number of children, 281,000, covered by the scheme in 2015 as a basis, the additional cost to increase the BSCFA rates by the amounts listed per age group is set out in the attached tabular statement.

My Department will spend approximately &euro;228 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 419,000 customers.  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew.  In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013.  This was an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum. </p>  <p>  In 2010 the value of the telephone allowance was &euro;310.80 per annum.

My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance as part of the household benefits package to approximately 419,000 customers, at an estimated cost of &euro;228 million in 2016. </p><p>Any decision to extend the fuel allowance season would have to be considered in the overall budgetary negotiations. </p><p>The estimated cost of increasing the fuel allowance duration by one, two, three and four weeks at the current rate would be as follows -<table><tr><th>No. of weeks</th><th>Cost increase per annum*</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>&euro;9m</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>&euro;18m</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>&euro;26m</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>&euro;35m</td></tr></table></p><p>*Figures are rounded to the nearest million.</p><p>The best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling.  My Department works closely with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on these issues and in moving forward the actions agreed in the Energy Affordability Strategy.  In that regard, the Better Energy Homes scheme provides support towards the installation of attic and wall insulation, and heating system upgrades.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I am aware that since 2014, Bahrain has revoked the citizenship of over 250 people.  This is a worrying development, in particular in light of other recent moves in Bahrain to restrict freedom of expression, such as the dissolution of Al Wefaq, the largest opposition political grouping.  I call on Bahrain to fully respect its international human rights obligations.</p>  <p>  Actions like these increase sectarian divides, and only serve to stall Bahrain&rsquo;s path towards national reconciliation.  This decision has already triggered protests and demonstrations.  Preventing people from expressing their views does not quash people&rsquo;s grievances; it only reinforces them.  I call on the protesters and the Bahraini authorities alike to exercise restraint, for the protesters to express their views peacefully and for the authorities to permit them to do this.  </p>  <p>  This decision also risks increasing regional tensions.  I call on all leaders in the region, political and religious, to avoid actions and statements that would further increase these tensions.  I urge Bahrain to recommit to an inclusive, peaceful and open dialogue for national reconciliation that will serve the interests of all Bahrainis, regardless of religious beliefs or political preferences. </p>  <p>  I stand with our EU partners in continuing to support Bahrain, in promoting further reforms aimed at strengthening human rights and the rule of law in a context free of violence and where freedom of expression is respected.</p></reply>

I also met with the leader of the opposition in the Knesset, Mr. Isaac Herzog, and with the Chair of the Knesset&rsquo;s Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, Mr. Avi Dichter.</p>  <p>  In Ramallah, I met with the Palestinian Prime Minister, Mr. Rami Hamdallah, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Riad Malki.</p>  <p>  I also met with the Deputy Commissioner of the UN Relief and Works Agency, Ms. Sandra Mitchell, and with the local office of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance. </p>  <p>  My visit to the region was planned before the scheduling of the French-hosted conference on the Middle East Peace Process, which took place in Paris on 3 June and in which I participated, but it afforded a timely opportunity to follow up on that meeting.  </p>  <p>  In all of my political meetings, I made clear my support for the French initiative, which aims to inject new momentum into the stalled peace process through international support and engagement.  I said this based on my own assessment of the situation and based also on the experience of the peace process on this island in which international support, from the US and elsewhere, proved invaluable at different times.</p>  <p>  The Palestinian side has publicly welcomed this renewed international engagement and I discussed in some detail with Minister Malki his priorities for follow-up to the Paris conference.  The Israeli Government have said clearly that they do not see value in this approach and repeated their wish to move to direct negotiations with the Palestinians, without wider international involvement.</p>  <p>  In my meetings I made clear the interest of the members of this House and of the Irish public in the Middle East Peace Process. </p>  <p>  In my meetings, I also discussed a range of more specific issues, including the expansion of settlements and the threat they pose to the peace process, the serious humanitarian situation in Gaza and the progress that has been made in reconstruction there as well as the limited improvements that have been made in access for goods, and the prospects for Palestinian reconciliation in the talks that have been taking place between Fatah and Hamas.</p>  <p>  My visit came shortly after the 8 June terrorist attack in Tel Aviv and the security situation in Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territories was discussed.  </p>  <p>  The implications of developments in the wider region, in particular the ongoing conflict in Syria were discussed in some detail.  In this context, I also visited the Golan Heights and met with the Irish troops serving with the UN Disengagement Observation Force there.  My visit reinforced once again the very urgent need to bring a political resolution to the horrific conflict in Syria which has cruelly ended and shattered so many innocent lives.</p>  <p>  The Middle East Peace Process remains stalled.  In explicit recognition of the view that the status quo is not sustainable, the French Government have been working to mobilise international to help advance the prospects for peace.  This is not an easy task but it deserves and will receive our full support.</p></reply>

The same behaviours are not seen where the security forces are engaged in similar circumstances with Israeli citizens.</p>  <p>  We have expressed these concerns both directly to the Israeli authorities and in EU discussions on the situation.

The enhancement of economic relations with Africa is a central pillar of my Department&rsquo;s <i>Africa Strategy.</i>Two-way trade, in goods and services, between Ireland and Africa increased by about one third between 2010 and 2014, from &euro;3.4 billion to &euro;4.5 billion. I welcome the growth we are now seeing in Irish exports to Africa.  This responds to opportunities in the market and is very much in line with the Government&rsquo;s focus on boosting exports to new and emerging markets.</p><p>In focusing on just six African countries where Ireland has bilateral development programmes, the Value Added in Africa report presents a very limited aspect of Ireland&rsquo;s trade relations with Africa.  It is difficult to draw definitive conclusions from the data provided, given that the amounts involved are relatively low and, as the report states, a single sale can have a significant impact on trade figures.</p><p>Total imports by the six African countries referred to grew nearly tenfold over the period analysed.  This was largely due to increases in consumption and in external and domestic investment.  Imports specifically from Ireland have grown at about half this rate.  The growth in exports from the countries to Ireland has been lower, but this is not surprising given the structure of the Irish economy, which means that we are not a direct importer of many of the primary products that our partner countries in Africa produce.</p><p>The Irish Government does not bear primary responsibility for boosting African exports to Ireland, and nor should we.  However, through the Irish Aid programme, Ireland is contributing to the social and economic development of our partner countries in Africa.  This includes efforts to increase production of value-added goods for both domestic consumption and for export.  Indeed, Irish Aid provides grant support to <i>Value Added in Africa </i>specifically for this purpose.  We have also supported the Fairtrade movement in order to increase export opportunities, and to ensure that Irish companies and consumers choose products which deliver a fair return for African producers.</p><p>Trade with Ireland alone will never constitute a significant component of the export markets that countries in Africa need.  What is needed is the ability to access and export to global scale markets such as the EU, US and emerging markets, and to trade regionally.  For this reason, Irish Aid is supporting the efforts of Geneva-based multilateral organisations to build the capacity of developing countries to implement their own trade and investment policies.</p><p>We have also carefully monitored the negotiations of Economic Partnership Agreements between the EU and African countries to ensure that they serve the development interests of our African partners.  The implementation of these Agreements has the potential to further boost African exports.</p><p>In advance of the Africa-Ireland Economic Forum in Dublin earlier this month, my Department hosted a round table to facilitate experience sharing between Ireland&rsquo;s trade and investment promotion experts and their counterparts from African countries.  The Forum itself, with 450 participants, also provided a platform to identify and explore opportunities for trade and investment between Ireland and Africa, including in agri-business, energy/cleantech and aviation.</p></reply>

The scale and presence of the network is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  Any decision to adjust the State&rsquo;s external representation, including the opening of missions, will have regard to national priorities and available financial and staffing resources.  A range of factors are taken into account in considering our diplomatic representation overseas, including our national political, economic and trade priorities, as well as the availability of resources.  However, current resource constraints do not allow us to have resident representation in all the locations that might objectively justify it having regard to political, economic and trade factors.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relationship with Wales will continue to be fully sustained and promoted through Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy of in London, who have prioritised this objective.  Work on Ireland&rsquo;s relations with Wales and the Welsh Government will also be carried out in Dublin, including with the Welsh Government representative at the British Embassy.  As there are no immediate plans under consideration for the opening of a Consulate General in Cardiff, the cost of doing so does not arise.</p></reply>

To avoid the danger of fire or electric shock, the decision was made to close the Castle until remedial works could be carried out. </p>  <p>  The dangerous state of the electrical system is made considerably worse by a significant water ingress problem with severe damp problems in walls and roofs throughout large parts of the structure.  The electrical system cannot be replaced until the water ingress problem is first dealt with and this must therefore be the priority.  A major project to address this is therefore currently being undertaken.  This will involve scaffolding the building in sections, undertaking detailed inspections at a high level to assess fabric condition, re-pointing the walls as necessary, removing the scaffolding to a new section and recommencing the process.  This work will be carried out by skilled staff from the OPW National Monuments Service and the first phase of scaffolding the building is currently underway. </p>  <p>  Due to the complexity of the work, which can only be carried out on a seasonal basis, the shortage of skilled labour resources within the OPW and the need to at times divert these resources to other urgent/emergency works within the Heritage estate, it is difficult to predict with certainty how long this element of the project will take.  However, it is intended that works will continue over the next two years while, concurrently, a new electrical system is designed and procured, ready to be installed by a suitably qualified contractor.</p>  <p>  It is hoped that Barryscourt Castle will re-open to the public in about 2 years time.</p></reply>

Following the public consultation process the finalised Plans will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.</p></reply>

Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for the protection of architectural heritage and gives local planning authorities primary responsibility to identify and protect architectural heritage by including structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  The making of an addition to, or a deletion from, the Record of Protected Structures is a reserved function of the relevant planning authority.</p>  <p>  A number of State financial supports provide for the conservation and preservation of heritage structures in general.</p>  <p>  Financial support is being provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings.  My Department itself operates a Structures at Risk Fund to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, that are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  </p>  <p>  This fund, which has an allocation of over &euro;900,000 in 2016, is administered through the local authorities and seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  Applications for this scheme have now closed for 2016, and recommended projects have been recently announced.  </p>  <p>  I also launched a new &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme - for the repair and conservation of protected structures on 21 October 2015.  This scheme will operate in 2016, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  It is expected to support a significant number of projects across the country and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  The scheme for this year is now fully allocated.</p>  <p>  The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  For 2016, the Council is administering a community based heritage grants scheme available for projects that contributed to particular heritage themes, of which further details can be found at www.heritagecouncil.ie.</p></reply>

The funding is being made available as part of the Government&rsquo;s Capital Investment Framework 2016-2021.  It is my priority to target investment at existing facilities, to bring the current stock of arts centres up to standard.  My Department is finalising the guidelines and application forms in relation to the scheme which I intend to open for applications very shortly.</p><p>In addition there are a number of significant capital projects underway for the National Cultural Institutions, including:</p><p><b>- The National Gallery of Ireland:</b>A major renovation project is ongoing on the historic Dargan and Milltown wings of the gallery.  This work is nearing completion and it is hoped that they will reopen to the public in Q1 2017.  This is expected to cost in the order of &euro;33m.</p><p><b>- The National Archives: </b>Phase one of a building development plan for the Archives Bishop Street headquarters is due to go to tender shortly.  This first phase will cost approximately &euro;8m and will significantly increase the Archives storage capacity in the Bishop Street premises.</p><p><b>- The National Library of Ireland: </b>I announced last year a &euro;10m investment in the National Library's historic Kildare Street building.  The OPW are currently working with the NLI and my Department to develop a design for the building, which will enhance the storage facilities and public spaces in the building.</p><p>The capital needs of other national cultural institutions are also being considered, and will be prioritised as resources permit.</p></reply>

This function is currently being carried out by the HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) which was established in 2005 to oversee the implementation of the then national suicide prevention strategy and to coordinate suicide prevention initiatives around the country.</p>  <p>  In June last year, the Government launched &lsquo;Connecting for Life&rsquo;, our new strategy to reduce suicide and self harm rates over the period 2015-2020.  The new Strategy, which has an implementation focus on youth mental health, sets out a vision where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and well-being.  This includes a greater focus on the important area of support for families and communities in suicide prevention, and providing community-based organisations with guidelines, protocols and training on effective suicide prevention.  In addition to this, in line with the Programme for Government, a Youth Mental Health Taskforce is currently being formed.  This taskforce aims to assist our young people in developing resilience and coping skills to support their emotional well-being at an early stage, and build awareness of how to access high-quality effective services when they need them.  It marks a focused approach to youth mental well-being, creating a link between community supports and service supports to assist our young people in reaching their potential.</p>  <p>  Connecting for Life provides a detailed and clear plan to achieve each of the goals it proposes, with defined actions and a lead agency and key partners in place for each individual objective.  This plan will be supported by robust implementation and governance structures, as well as resourcing and communications frameworks.  The Strategy assigns specific responsibility to the NOSP as a statutory agency to fulfil a number of tasks, including the development and implementation of surveillance systems, the implementation and evaluation of the Strategy, the development and provision of suicide prevention training and education programmes, increasing national awareness about suicide prevention and setting out a national suicide research and prevention programme.  NOSP, together with the Department of Health, other Government Departments, NGO and community partners are proceeding with the implementation of Connecting for Life.</p></reply>

However, the Act provides that the Minister for Health may, by regulation, designate a health and social care profession not already designated if he or she considers that it is appropriate and in the public interest to do so and if specified criteria have been met.</p>  <p>  Regulation of a profession under the Act involves the registration of practitioners who hold qualifications approved by the relevant registration board established under the Act.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Act, the Health and Social Care Professionals Council has been consulted on the question of regulating counsellors and psychotherapists. Its detailed report on the matter is being examined carefully in the Department of Health with a view to deciding the next steps shortly.  These steps will, I envisage, include a wider round of consultation involving the various professional bodies and other interested parties.</p>  <p>  The regulation of a new profession under the Act involves a consultation process and the making of a number of statutory instruments by the Minister for Health and by the relevant registration board.  I envisage that, subject to the outcome of  consultations, the statutory phase to regulate counsellors and psychotherapists under the Act will begin later this year or early next year with the submission of draft designation regulations to the Houses of the Oireachtas for their approval.  </p>  <p>  While the profession or professions of counsellor and psychotherapist are not yet specifically designated under the 2005 Act, counsellors and psychotherapists are subject to legislation similar to other practitioners including consumer legislation, competition, contract and criminal law. There are also various regulatory controls on many counsellors and psychotherapists operating in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The profession of psychologist, for example, is a designated profession under the 2005 Act which means that those psychologists who are counsellors and/or psychotherapists will begin to be regulated when the Psychologists Registration Board, which is due to be established later this year, opens its register. </p>  <p>  Psychiatrists, some of whom practice psychotherapy, are regulated under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007. Also, counsellors/therapists working in the publicly funded health sector are required to have minimum qualifications set by the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.</p></reply>

It advocated:</p>  <p>  - A holistic view of mental illness and an integrated multidisciplinary approach to addressing the biological, psychological and social factors that contribute to mental health problems; </p>  <p>  - A move away from traditional institutional-based care to a patient-centred, flexible and community based mental health service; </p>  <p>  - A person-centred treatment approach which addresses each of these elements through an integrated care plan, reflecting best practice, evolved and agreed with both service users and their carers; </p>  <p>  - The aiming of interventions at maximising recovery from mental illness, building on the resources within service users and within their immediate social networks, to allow them to achieve meaningful integration and participation in community life; and </p>  <p>  - The organisation, nationally, of mental health services in catchment areas for populations of between 250,000 and 400,000, with specialist expertise provided by community mental health teams &ndash; expanded multidisciplinary teams of clinicians who work together to service the needs of service users across the life span.  </p>  <p>  During the implementation of Vision, there has been a move away from traditional psychiatric institutions, which have mostly been closed.  A range of community mental health teams have been developed for adults and children and adolescents.  Additional funding provided between 2012 and 2016 has also enabled development of specialised areas of the mental health services, including the area of Forensic Mental Health with work commencing on a new hospital in Portrane this year.</p>  <p>  'A Vision for Change' has guided national mental health policy for the past 10 years and its term comes to an end this year.  The Department is currently finalising a request for tender for a review and analysis of international evidence and best practice in the development of mental health services, including a review of current delivery of services in Ireland.  This review will provide evidence to determine the policy direction for a revision of 'A Vision for Change'.  The review will also have regard to both human rights and health and well-being objectives. </p></reply>

The NHQRS was established to provide a broad overall picture of the quality of our health services.  It is intended to demonstrate to individual hospitals and other health service providers the importance of examining their own data in order to improve the services they provide.. It must however, be understood that the performance and quality of a service cannot be measured by one indicator alone.  This is why the NHQRS presents an analysis of a range of indicators that reflect different parts of the services and allows progress and priorities in the health system to be identified.  The NHQRS will help to inform many improvements in service outcomes for patients. </p>  <p>  The information will inform my priorities as Minister for Health, it will provide intelligence and information for the 10 Year Plan for Health and I hope the Health Committee will avail of the opportunity to be briefed on this.  It will also inform my Department's Statement of Strategy. </p>  <p>  The Second annual NHQRS Report was published last Thursday 16th June.  It is very encouraging to see improvements in many areas, for example in the areas of immunisation, uptake of cancer screening and survival rates for patients with breast and colorectal cancer which are improving at a rate faster than most other European countries in the OECD.  One example of how this information will be used is to ensure that the cancer indicators feed into the new Cancer Strategy currently being drawn up by my Department.  Similarly, the figures for stroke patients, indicate over 80% are admitted to hospitals with a designated stroke unit which, again, is to the forefront of other OECD countries.</p>  <p>  I recognise that there are areas identified where further room for improvement exists. In particular, considerable variation can be seen between counties in rates of hospitalisation for common chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes and heart failure. Identifying this variation is a first step to addressing the reasons why this variation exists and to improving it.  For example, the information on COPD is already informing requirements in Primary Care and the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) COPD Guideline being developed by the HSE Clinical Programme for the management of this disease.</p></reply>

Along with the overall number of deaths reported, which are published in the Mental Health Commission annual reports, the number of sudden and unexplained deaths is also noted. A &lsquo;sudden and unexplained death&rsquo; refers to an unexpected death that may have been a suicide or that has occurred in suspicious circumstances as a result of violence or misadventure on the part of others or from any cause other than natural illness or disease. However, as death by suicide may only be determined by a Coroner&rsquo;s inquest, it is not possible for the Mental Health Commission to report on how many of the sudden and unexplained deaths reported were due to suicide.</p></reply>

A significant majority of young people are now being treated by a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Team.  A total of 29 Child and Adolescent service users have been admitted to adult mental health units up to the end of April this year.  There have been some difficulties in recruiting and retaining Specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services staff, particularly consultant psychiatrists.  Due to these operational staff recruitment and retention challenges at local level, a number of referrals in the 16-18 year age group are dealt with by local Adult Teams under appropriate CAMHS procedures.  The Executive is addressing this issue on an on-going basis.</p>  <p>  There are 67 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services Teams and extra services for special service needs have also been introduced in recent years.  The HSE is committed to addressing the service needs of the 16-18 age cohort by expanding the staffing and range of CAMHS team coverage, supported by prioritisation of funding from the additional mental health funding allocation in 2016, as outlined in the HSE Mental Health Operational Plan 2016.</p>  <p>  Progress  on this issue has been significant overall in recent years, demonstrated by the fact that the number of such admissions in 2008 was 247, reducing to 95 last year.  This is despite a background of increasing demands on the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services generally.  There are a number of reasons why such admissions are made.  These include distance from a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services facility, timing of admissions, potential medical issues, potential substance misuse, family concerns and the overall safety of the young person, their family and other service users.  The HSE monitors this situation closely with a view to limiting inappropriate admissions as much as possible. </p></reply>

This commenced in December 2015. </p>  <p>  The Maternity Patient Safety Statements provide individual institutions with a set of basic measures that can help inform assurances around the safety and quality of maternity services.  They are a welcome addition to our patient safety assurance systems and the Department commends the participation of the maternity services in this regard.  The Department expects that each individual maternity hospital will make arrangements to publish a full Maternity Patient Safety Statement on their websites and it is my understanding that full reports have been produced by all 19 maternity services for the month of March.

Satellite centres of the hospital, providing urgent and outpatient care, are to be built on the campuses of Connolly and Tallaght Hospitals.  The decision was clinically led, and was made in the best interests of children, with clinical considerations paramount in the decision.  As announced in June 2015, the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital will relocate to the campus in time, achieving tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services.  Tri-location has benefits for children, adolescents, newborns and mothers.  In all cases, the benefits of tri-location are maximised where the adult hospital provides the broadest possible range of clinical sub-specialties and expertise, which are readily accessible for paediatric and maternity patients on the shared campus.  St James&rsquo;s Hospital has the broadest range of national specialties of all acute hospitals, as well as strong and well established research and education infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to be the adult co-location partner.</p>  <p>  The primary concerns about the location raised in the article referred to by the Deputy are access by car and by helicopter.  I can reassure the Deputy that these issues have been carefully addressed in the design and plans for this hospital.  The design has recognised the need of most parents to access the hospital by car and ample parking has been provided for families based on current and projected future demand, with three times the current available parking at the existing three children&rsquo;s hospitals in Dublin.  The elevated helipad proposed for the new children's hospital will have direct and rapid access to the Critical Care, Theatre and Emergency Departments within the hospital and has been designed in close consultation with the Air Corps and Department of Defence which provides the Emergency Aeromedical Service.  </p>  <p>  Over the three and a half years since the Government decided on the location for this hospital, extensive work has been completed including preparation of a design brief, procurement of a design team, design development including consultation with patients, families and staff and submission of a planning application.  The decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la on April 28 last to grant planning permission for the hospital, satellite centres and related buildings is a huge and very welcome milestone for the project.  I am delighted that the first phase of construction can now commence.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  </p>  <p>  It is Government policy to encourage orderly succession arrangements for farms, and this is endorsed by the farming organisations.  In most cases early succession arrangements should ensure the transfer of farm assets well in excess of five years before nursing home care is required, meaning that a levy on the farm asset is avoided.   </p>  <p>  A person's Principal Private Residence (PPR) is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of the NHSS participants' time in care.  Importantly, the farm or relevant business can also qualify for this three year cap where unexpected health events prevent early succession arrangements.  This applies where:</p>  <p>  a) The applicant has suffered a sudden illness or disability which caused them to require care services and</p>  <p>  b) A substantial part of the working day of the applicant or their partner was regularly and consistently applied to the farming of the farm or carrying on of the relevant business until the onset of the sudden illness or disability, and</p>  <p>  c)  A family successor certifies in writing that he or she will on a consistent and regular basis apply a substantial part of his or her working day to the farming of the farm or the carrying on of the relevant business.</p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Review was published in July 2015.  A number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  In advance of the Review, submissions were sought from groups or bodies who wished to make a contribution, and the Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) made a submission in this context on which they expanded at a subsequent meeting with officials of the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners and, when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The Group will consider the submission already made by the IFA.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government has committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small business and family farms.  The IFA will be contacted by the Working Group in this regard in the near future.</p></reply>

From the outset, the resources available for 2016 matched those provided in 2015, so there was never any overall reduction in services.  However, the numbers of patients who had completed their acute treatment but required home-care in order to be discharged was very high in the early part of this year, and while the HSE did its best to meet this need it would have been necessary to adjust new service approvals if the original funding limit had applied.  To ensure that this does not happen, the Government has increased the resources available.  &euro;20m will be allocated to ensure that the 10.4 million home help hours, 15,450 home care packages, 130 intensive home care packages and 313 transitional care beds provided in 2015 are maintained; &euro;10m will ensure that the rate of service allocation can be maintained during the summer months; and &euro;10m has been ring fenced for home care as part of the forthcoming winter initiative.   </p></reply>

My Department, as the Competent Authority, has delegated control tasks to five Organic Control Bodies, who receive all such declarations and hold all relevant records.</p>  <p>  In addition, Regulation 710/2009 provides that treated stock are to be clearly identifiable.  In the case of fish, for example, this means that any batches of fish that have been treated can be identified at the point of production, to ensure amongst other things that the required withdrawal period for the treatment in question is being observed.  However, this is an issue of record keeping, not labelling of packaging.  Organic operators meet this requirement by maintaining information at their premises giving details of the purpose, date of application, method of application, type of product and relevant withdrawal period, as well as by the declaration of such use to the Control Body and by making all required information available to the Control Body.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that the withdrawal period between the last administration of any such veterinary treatment and the production of organic produced foodstuffs from such animals is twice the withdrawal period applicable for non-organic production for the medicine in question.  If the fish are treated in full compliance with the provisions laid down in the Regulation, then they fulfil all the requirements of organic production and may be labelled and sold as such.</p></reply>

In addition to the economic importance of the sector, there are a wide range of public goods associated with agriculture; including social benefits for rural communities, as well as significant environmental benefits in relation to landscape, biodiversity, water quality and carbon sequestration and mitigation.</p>  <p>  The agri-food sector is Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry, contributing &euro;26 billion in turnover and 7.6% of GDP.  In 2015, the sector accounted for around 8.4% of total employment, making a particularly significant contribution to employment in rural and coastal areas.</p>  <p>  2015 saw the publication of Food Wise 2025 which sets out a ten year strategy for the agri-food sector.  It underlines the sector&rsquo;s unique and special position within the Irish economy, and illustrates the potential for this sector to continue to grow.  The strategy sets out the key actions required to maximise the contribution of the sector to economic growth, job creation and environmental sustainability over the next decade.</p></reply>

The recent packages of support measures from the Commission are welcome, but we should continue to deploy any and all available options that might help to mitigate the effects of these difficulties.  Such options should include measures that will help to reduce production costs for farmers.</p>  <p>  According to Eurostat, fertiliser is the third most important expenditure item on EU farms, accounting for &euro;19.2bn in 2014.  Fertiliser prices have increased significantly in recent years, in part due to the protection provided by the imposition of duties on non-EU imports, while opportunities to manage price risk through hedging mechanisms are limited.</p>  <p>  The International Food and Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) published a report in February of this year (commissioned by the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association) on the effects of import duty elimination on competition in the EU fertiliser market.  The report concluded that the protection afforded to EU manufacturers by the application of anti-dumping duties and customs tariffs is costing farmers up to &euro;1 billion per annum.</p>  <p>  I believe that appropriate action in this area could be of significant benefit to farmers at this very difficult time.  In addition to the ten-point package that Ireland proposed in the lead-up to the March Council of Agriculture Ministers, we asked the Commission to consider a temporary suspension of import tariffs on fertilisers. </p>  <p>  Other Member States made similar calls, and at the March Council Commissioner Hogan indicated his readiness to raise the matter with Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, Pierre Moscovici, and Internal Market Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska.  At the April Council in Luxembourg, Commissioner Hogan said that he was following up with his colleagues in an effort to secure their agreement to possible changes.</p>  <p>  I am continuing to pursue the matter with the Commission and in consultation with my Member State counterparts, and I hope that progress can be made in the short-term.  I would hope that Commissioner Moscovici in particular would be in a position to look favourably on this proposal.</p></reply>

The Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination group was established to support the OPW in this role.  This group is currently preparing a final report for Government that will contain recommendations for appropriate actions to mitigate the risks posed by flooding.  The critical and varied role that forestry performs in combating flood risk in vulnerable areas will be reflected in the report.  My Department operates a Forestry Programme that provides funding for the creation and management of a wide range of forest and woodland types.  These schemes as listed by the Deputy, aim to realise a variety of environmental, economic and social benefits and services forest development brings. Included in these benefits is flood alleviation when these measures are used strategically as part of a wider response within a catchment to the threat of flooding.  There are no plans to introduce any further schemes to help address the issue of flooding. </p>  <p>  The existing schemes can help reduce the risk of flooding in the following ways;</p>  <p>-  As part of the Afforestation Scheme, native woodland establishment provides grant aid to cover the full cost of establishment and pays the highest annual premium of all planting categories to create new native woodland on greenfield sites.  This measure can be utilised to fund the development of new native woodland on natural floodplains increasing retention capacity in these areas .</p>  <p>  These forests also help in retaining floodwaters for a longer period upstream, such areas result in the alleviation of flooding further downstream (mainly in urban areas) and the reduction of damaging high flow rates during spate events.</p>  <p>  -  Native Woodland Conservation Scheme provides grant aid (along with a 7 year premium, for private woodland owners) to undertake the appropriate restoration of existing woodlands, and also, the conversion of conifer forest to native woodland.  One possible application of this scheme is the conversion of existing conifer forests into native woodland at strategic points within catchments, accompanied by drain-blocking and other site restoration measures to reinstate natural site hydrology and retention capacities.</p>  <p>-  Woodland Improvement: - Environmental Enhancement:  This scheme, which is due for launch in August 2016, provides financial support to forest holders to enhance the environmental qualities of existing forests, including the reinstatement or enhancement of water setbacks and other open areas and, appropriate blocking of existing forest drains.  These actions can contribute to flood alleviation by slowing down the flow of heavy rainfall into lower lying areas.  </p>  <p>  The schemes above were approved by Government in December 2014. </p></reply>

The illegal removal of trees may result in substantial fines and prosecution.  Furthermore, depending on the age of the plantation and whether or not it was grant aided, all premium payments and grants paid will be recovered in full by the Department for the area in which the trees were felled.  The financial consequences of removing trees illegally are very much dependent on the area cleared.  However, regardless of the area felled, I do not believe that qualification criteria for CAP schemes incentivises farmers to remove trees.   </p></reply>

One of my priorities is to support the provision of lower-cost, more flexible finance for the sector.</p>  <p>  Access to finance was discussed at the Dairy Forum on 21 June, with an exchange of views with the main banks now a part of the agenda at each meeting.  Before the meeting I formally launched the Dairy Forum&rsquo;s &rsquo;Financial Management Initiative&rsquo;, a programme of cash flow and financial management training and advice for dairy farmers.  I believe that equipping farmers with better financial planning skills is essential and I am encouraging all farmers to engage with this initiative.</p>  <p>  Access to finance was also discussed at the meeting of the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee earlier this month and we heard from representatives of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF).  Both are now active in the market and my Department, in cooperation with all the other State bodies, will continue to explore additional funding mechanisms for farmers, the agrifood sector and for SMEs generally.</p>  <p>  I also recently met with the CEOs of the main banks and stressed the need for them to be flexible in the context of increased income volatility.  The banks told me that they recognise and are responding to the challenges facing farmers in this regard.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is about to publish a request for tender to procure an ex-ante assessment to assess any current failures in the access to finance market in Ireland.  This is a first step towards the potential introduction of Financial Instruments under the Rural Development Programme.</p>  <p>  With specific reference to the more flexible State aid provisions announced by the EU Commission, I am working with all the financial institutions, particularly SBCI, to identify potential solutions to working capital finance for farmers experiencing liquidity gaps. I should point out that these flexibilities do not involve the provision of EU funding.   </p></reply>

The recent packages of support measures from the Commission are welcome, but we should continue to deploy any and all available options that might help to mitigate the effects of these difficulties.  Such options should include measures that will help to reduce production costs for farmers.</p>  <p>  According to Eurostat, fertiliser is the third most important expenditure item on EU farms, accounting for &euro;19.2bn in 2014.  Fertiliser prices have increased significantly in recent years, in part due to the protection provided by the imposition of duties on non-EU imports, while opportunities to manage price risk through hedging mechanisms are limited. </p>  <p>  I believe that appropriate action in this area could be of significant benefit to farmers at this very difficult time.  In addition to the ten-point package that Ireland proposed in the lead-up to the March Council of Agriculture Ministers, we asked the Commission to consider a temporary suspension of import tariffs on fertilisers. </p>  <p>  Other Member States made similar calls, and at the March Council Commissioner Hogan indicated his readiness to raise the matter with Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, Pierre Moscovici, and Internal Market Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska.  At the April Council in Luxembourg, Commissioner Hogan said that he was following up with his colleagues in an effort to secure their agreement to possible changes. </p>  <p>  I am continuing to pursue the matter with the Commission and in consultation with my Member State counterparts, and I hope that progress can be made in the short-term.  I would hope that Commissioner Moscovici in particular would be in a position to look favourably on this proposal.</p></reply>

Each river has an individual conservation limit which is essentially the number of salmon required to spawn to maintain a healthy population.  If the estimate of returning salmon is above this limit then salmon from that genetically unique river population may be harvested commercially or by rod and line. </p>  <p>  The primary index for evaluation of likely returning numbers is the recorded rod (harvest or catch and release) and commercial catch averaged over the previous 5 years.  In the case of the River Slaney, the fish counter data is used to estimate the salmon run.   As stated, fisheries are only considered in rivers where the estimated returns are above the conservation limit for the river.  I am advised by IFI that a risk analysis is undertaken on any estimate of returns expected to be above the conservation limit.  IFI has confirmed no salmon surplus was available using fish counter data for the Slaney averaged over the past five years.  The most recent stock assessment on the River Slaney was carried out in October 2015.  </p>  <p>  Assessments on all 143 Salmon rivers, including the Slaney, are carried out each year and the stocks will be again assessed later this year.  The period for assessments takes account of the fishing season and the timing of salmon runs so as to capture as much fresh data as possible in the current year and to ensure that the management legislation can be reviewed before 1 January the following year.  This data is added to the most recent 4 years of data to create a new 5 year average to ensure that a "good" or "bad" year does not have a disproportionate impact on the assessment to the detriment of the conservation imperative   </p>  <p>  The salmon assessment methodologies used in Ireland are considered internationally as best practice, with many other countries moving towards the development of similar scientific assessment models for salmon stock conservation.</p>  <p>  The Salmon Hardship Scheme was introduced following a Government decision in 2006 to cease, for conservation reasons, the commercial salmon mixed stock fishery.  Under the scheme, fishermen active in the commercial salmon fishery, could opt to voluntarily cease fishing and undertake not to seek a licence in the future.</p>  <p>  In excess of &euro;25m was allocated to the scheme to facilitate payments to fishermen, with a further &euro;5m provided for community development projects.  Payments to individuals were based on verifiable track record and recorded catches in the five years prior to its introduction. </p>  <p>  The scheme closed for applications on 31 December 2007 and ceased in 2008.  I understand that all funds were expended and there are currently no plans to revisit such a scheme.</p>  <p>  Public commercial fishing licences are issued annually on a prescribed application basis and, therefore, are not transferable or inheritable.  There is no property right attaching to them.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming. </p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area, which is the subject of procurement.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered. </p>  <p>  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention and includes the townlands of Pluckstown, Hurdlestown and Fordstown, County Meath.</p>  <p>  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Meath.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.   </p>  <p>  Over 750,000 premises are the focus for  the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ( 'PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum.  Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March 2016.  The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to qualifying bidders.  I expect that my Department will move to this stage over the coming weeks.  The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process.  Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s).  It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded by June 2017.</p>  <p>  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and / or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

The scheme was only operated on a pilot basis in 2012.  My officials, and SEAI, would be happy to consult further with the Deputy to confirm that this material provides sufficient information and identify how best to supply any further data required.</p></reply>

Firstly, environmental noise must be assessed through the preparation of strategic noise maps for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria.  This is undertaken by prescribed noise mapping bodies, which includes Dublin Airport Authority (daa) and local authorities. Secondly, based on the results of the mapping process, the Regulations require the preparation of noise action plans for each area concerned, which is undertaken by the relevant local authority, the prescribed noise action planning body.  The fundamental objective of action plans is the prevention and reduction of environmental noise.</p>  <p>  The most recent noise mapping exercise found that 200 people are exposed to undesirable night-time levels above 55 dB(A) from aircraft using Dublin Airport.  As compared to the previous mapping exercise in 2007, there has been an overall reduction in the number of people exposed to undesirable night-time noise levels.</p>  <p>  In 2008, Dublin Airport Stakeholders Forum set up an Environmental Working Group that works closely with Fingal County Council.  This group provides an effective forum for the discussion of all environment matters concerning the development and operation of the airport that have an impact on users, customers of the airport and on people living and working in the surrounding communities.</p>  <p>  The management of noise abatement of operational procedures at Dublin Airport is shared by the airport operator, the daa, and the airlines operating at the airport. Under the European Communities (Air Navigation and Transport Rules and Procedures for Noise Related Operating Restrictions at Airports) Regulations 2003, the Irish Aviation Authority has the responsibility of ensuring that the airport operator has in place a system of noise monitoring.</p>  <p>  In recognition of its responsibilities in this area, the daa has introduced, and continues to evaluate, a number of initiatives to monitor aircraft noise levels and to mitigate their impact.  A flight tracking system is now operated that allows aircraft movements to be analysed and to respond to any complaints relating to aircraft noise.  The primary objective of the Noise &amp;amp; Flight Track Department of the daa is to gather information on aircraft approach and departure routes and resultant noise levels at a number of key locations.</p>  <p>  The regulatory regime for airport noise at EU airports with more than 50,000 aircraft take-off or landing movements per year has recently been enhanced with the entry into force on 13 June 2016 of Regulation (EU) No 598/2014 which requires that Member States adhere to a specific process known as the ICAO Balanced Approach when considering the introduction of operating restrictions at airports.  My Department, along with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, is engaged in discussions regarding arrangements for the appropriate implementation of this Regulation in Ireland.</p></reply>

The funding that is being provided in the Capital Plan for public transport investment will see us reach <i>&quot;steady state&quot; </i>​funding levels by 2020.  In addition, funding is provided to commence critical transport projects such as New Metro North to meet growing demand.</p><p>​The National Transport Authority (NTA) and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) have commenced preparatory work on planning and design of New Metro North and a dedicated project Steering Group has been established.</p><p>In the event that additional funding becomes available in the next few years, this preparatory work that is now underway will position us to progress the project in line with available funding.</p></reply>

Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within 10 working days.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's query about insurance costs for the SPSV sector, he may recall that during a D&aacute;il debate on a private members motion on motor insurance earlier this month, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Eoghan Murphy T.D., advised the House that the cost of insurance to taxi and hackney drivers will be included in the issues to be addressed by the task force established by the Minister for Finance to review policy in the insurance sector. That task force will examine all issues relating to insurance policy, in consultation with bodies such as the Central Bank, Departments, and other stakeholders, and the cost of insurance will be a particular focus of the review.</p>  <p>  For my part, I am confident that the implementation of the actions set out in the Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020 will, over time, lead to a reduction in road traffic collisions, fatalities and injuries and should make an important contribution to reducing the cost of motor insurance.  My Department has been pursuing for some time the establishment of a properly functioning motor insurance database with the insurance industry here to show who is insured and who is not. Such a database would facilitate enforcement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and could make a significant contribution towards reducing the level of uninsured driving in Ireland, which costs the industry and insured drivers here &euro;50 to &euro;60 million approximately per annum.</p></reply>

I am very much aware that these redundancies follow a series of job losses in this company in recent years so this is a further blow, especially to the Cavan town operation.  </p>  <p>  This decision was made after a strategic internal review by the company. The priority for the Government now is to seek to retain the remaining jobs and work to create new jobs elsewhere in the region.  </p>  <p>  IDA is engaging with the company so that it can develop a skills profile of the affected workers and will aim to match them with other potential employers. In addition the IDA will continue to engage with the company to seek to influence corporate decisions and to broaden the scope of their operations here. One positive development is that the company&rsquo;s project announced in 2013 for the eventual creation of 150 jobs in an IT project at their Blanchardstown operation currently employs 70 staff and remains on track to reach that employment target. </p>  <p>  On the wider picture, I have asked both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to redouble their efforts to secure new projects and expand existing operations in Cavan, and to explore all opportunities to replace the jobs being lost there. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s job creation work in County Cavan has been particularly successful in recent years with 300 and 190 net new jobs added in 2014 and 2015 respectively.  In addition, the Local Enterprise Office in the County has been working to develop the micro-enterprise sector in Cavan and has helped to develop start up enterprises. That work will, of course, continue.  The Regional Action Plan for Jobs for the North East and North West is now in place and will be a key instrument in driving job creation in the region.  </p>  <p>  As regards services for the staff who will, unfortunately, lose their jobs, my officials have been in touch with both the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and with the local Education and Training Board (ETB). The priority of DSP is to ensure that employees who are made redundant receive their statutory entitlements and jobseeker payments in a timely manner, and it will also proactively help them to access the opportunities for employment in their region. </p>  <p>  Officials from that Department have already had preliminary discussions with representatives from the company and will provide information sessions to interested staff over the coming weeks.  These sessions will provide staff with advice on jobseekers payments and other income supports.  Information will also be provided on the employment supports which will be available to the employees to prepare them to return to work or explore appropriate education and training options.  The employees based in Cavan will be advised to make contact with the Cavan INTREO Centre as soon as they have their leaving dates.  They will then be provided with the earliest possible appointment to make their claim. </p>  <p>  In relation to the local ETB, that body has already contacted the company with a view to offering support, advice and required education and training. The ETB has engaged successfully with Liberty and former staff on previous occasions and is eager to continue this level of engagement.</p></reply>

From September 2016, children will be eligible to start the ECCE Programme when they turn age 3, and can continue in the ECCE Programme until they start primary school (once the child is not older than 5&frac12; years at the end of the relevant pre-school year i.e. end June).  This extension of the ECCE Programme will increase the number of children benefitting from about 67,000 to around 127,000 in a given programme year.  From September 2016 children will be able to enrol in the ECCE Programme at three different points in the year namely September, January and April.  This means that parents can enrol their child in the ECCE Programme as soon as possible after their child reaches age 3.</p>  <p>  Children born on 1 January 2012 and who are currently availing of the ECCE Programme may apply again from September for a further 38 weeks of the ECCE programme as they will meet the criteria of not being older than 5&frac12; years at the end of the relevant pre-school year i.e. end June.  However, some parents may decide to send their child to primary school in September as ECCE is not a mandatory programme.  Children born prior to January 2012 will not be eligible to avail of the ECCE programme in September 2016.</p>  <p>  Exceptions to these criteria can only currently be made in the event that a child has been diagnosed as having a special/additional need.  Any request for an exemption from ECCE eligibility criteria must be supported by a medical assessment report from the HSE/medical specialist, specifying the child's special need and diagnosis.  In such a case, an application should be made to the Early Years Policies and Programmes Unit of my Department, attaching a supporting medical report.</p></reply>

The Hotline is not an emergency number and, in such instances, the first point of contact is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at 112/999.</p><p>My Department has been informed by the ISPCC that posters and business cards were delivered to the Missing Persons Bureau in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Headquarters for distribution to all Garda stations nationwide.  The posters were utilised to advertise and promote the service.  The posters named the service, highlighted the contact number and noted the support of my Department.  In 2014, ISPCC personnel spent almost 460 hours on the distribution of posters in community venues around Ireland.  In addition, in any ISPCC outreach that took place in a school or community venue, the ISPCC staff member/volunteer also spoke about the Hotline service.  The ISPCC continues to raise awareness of the Missing Children Hotline in ongoing media work; e.g. press release and social media use to mark International Missing Children&rsquo;s Day on 25<sup>th</sup>May 2016.</p><p>In respect of the numbers of calls received by the Hotline in each of the years 2013 to 2015, the ISPCC have provided the following information:</p><p>-  523 calls in 2013 (this includes a high number of test calls made to check initial functionality)</p><p>-  218 calls in 2014 and</p><p>-  217 calls in 2015.</p><p>There was a total of 51 calls in the 1<sup>st</sup>Quarter of 2016.</p><p>The ISPCC has advised that it regularly keeps the media informed of the number of the Hotline and its purpose.  While the 116000 number is not provided to print media each time a child goes missing, information provided to the ISPCC by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is distributed appropriately within the ISPCC to relevant personnel, so that local support needs can be identified and provided where appropriate.<b></b>Information is also posted to the Missing Children Hotline website &ndash; www.missingchildrenshotline.ie - where appropriate and subsequently to the Facebook and Twitter pages.  Where the case is concluded, the post is removed from the site to protect the identity of the child.</p><p>Information on the Hotline is located on the ISPCC website at www.ispcc.ie/missingchildren.  This page clearly states that members of the public can call the 116000 helpline if they have a concern in respect of a missing child or information in respect of a missing child.  It clearly states that in an emergency situation, a report should be made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>The Hotline takes calls from the general public and if necessary, will redirect them to the relevant authorities.  In addition to the Missing Children Hotline, the ISPCC has a separate Support Line available to members of the public if they have any concerns about a child&rsquo;s welfare.  It can be contacted by phoning 01 6767960.</p><p>The ISPCC has advised that the amount of European Union and State funding the 116000 helpline received from 2013 is as follows:<table><tr><th>Funder / Year</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>EU Daphne Programme</td><td>&euro; 75,878.68</td><td>&euro; 75,878.68</td><td>&euro; 0*</td></tr><tr><td>DCYA</td><td>&euro; 87,631.75</td><td>&euro; 85,447.72</td><td>&euro; 86,969.25</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro; 163,510.43</td><td>&euro; 161,326.40</td><td>&euro; 86,969.25</td></tr></table></p><p>*No funding was available for Hotlines in 2015 from the European Daphne Programme, so the ISPCC did not apply for that year.  The ISPCC has advised that it made a successful application to the Programme for 2016.</p><p>With regard to staffing, the ISPCC employs staff to run the various helplines including the Hotline, Childline and the European Helpline as well as staff to answer calls and provide administrative support.</p><p>The number of staff employed, as set out below, includes all staff involved in the provision of the various phone helpline services provided by the ISPCC.  All helpline staff are trained to take calls from each helpline number and therefore all staff employed in the helpline services are available to take calls from the Hotline.  These staff are supported by trained volunteers of whom there was a total of 507 at the end of May 2016.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>Full time equivalent staff</td><td>29.3</td><td>29.9</td><td>26.5</td></tr></table></p><p>It should be noted that the Hotline has the following purposes:</p><p>-  Informs all callers to the Hotline that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the Agency responsible for investigating missing children and as such, should be the first port of call in respect of a missing child.</p><p>-  Provides emotional support to children who are missing, their family and others responsible for the missing child.</p><p>-  Offers guidance and advice to the callers regarding a missing child.</p><p>-  Reports cases where a child is at immediate risk as per Children First.</p><p>-  Re-directs calls outside the scope of the Hotline.</p><p>-  Provides a confidential text support via sending an automated generic SMS to the missing child when parental consent is received.</p></reply>

The Agency, established in 2014 pursuant to the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, assumed responsibility for a range of functions including those of the Family Support Agency.  Consequently, the Child and Family Agency provides core funding for the operation of Family Resource Centres throughout the country.  Also, the functions of the Child and Family Agency under the 2013 Act include supporting and encouraging the effective functioning of families and, in that context, providing preventative family support services aimed at promoting the welfare of children.</p><p>In April 2015, in line with a commitment in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures &ndash; The national policy framework for children &amp;amp; young people 2014-2020</i>, my Department published a &lsquo;High-Level Policy Statement on Supporting Parents and Families&rsquo;.  The Statement provides the policy context for the discharge by the Child and Family Agency of its family support function.  The Statement specifies that it is essential that parenting and family supports and services are designed to be fully inclusive and take full cognisance of evolving family forms.</p><p>The Child and Family Agency is currently involved in a major programme to develop and mainstream Prevention, Partnership and Family Support (PP&amp;amp;FS) over the period 2015-2018.  This Programme, launched in April 2015, is a key component of the Agency&rsquo;s National Service Delivery Framework.  Since the launch of the Programme, the Agency has been working to progress eight main work streams identified.  These comprise an area-based approach and the use of 'Meitheal': a National Practice Model for all agencies working with children, young people, and their families; participation; information; commissioning; public awareness; supporting parents; alternative care strategy and workforce learning and development.</p><p>More detailed information regarding the services provided by the Child and Family Agency in the areas of Family and Community Support can be found on their website (www.tusla.ie).</p></reply>

This measure, which will be introduced from September 2016, means that children will be eligible to start free pre-school when they reach the age of 3, and continue to avail of free pre-school until they start primary school (once the child is not older than 5 years and 6 months at the end of the pre-school year i.e. end June).  Following the introduction of the expanded programme there will be three opportunities each year - in September, January and April - for eligible children to enrol for the free pre-school provision.  This will ensure that children aged 3 or over have the opportunity to enrol as soon as possible after their third birthday.  The maximum number of free pre-school weeks to which a child is entitled will depend on their date of birth, and the age at which they start primary school.</p>  <p>  The expansion of the ECCE programme will see the number of children benefitting from the Programme rise from around 67,000 to around 127,000 in a given programme year.  For the 2016/17 programme year, it is estimated that 89,500 children will be eligible to enrol in the Programme from September 2016, an additional 22,000 from January 2017 and a further 15,500 from April 2017.  Accommodating this expansion requires a significant increase in capacity in the pre-school sector; providers need time to implement any needed infrastructural or services changes, or to hire additional staff.  The September 2016 implementation date was set to allow pre-school providers to put such measures in place.  Should an earlier start date have been chosen, the likelihood is that there would not have been sufficient capacity in the sector to accommodate all children.</p>  <p>  In addition, an upper age limit for participation in free pre-school was set by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment on the advice of the Department of Education and Skills.  Limiting the diversity in age ranges in primary school is considered to be generally in the best interest of children, in relation to peer interaction in junior infants, as well as other educational considerations.  This does mean that different children will spend different lengths of time in free pre-school, but our focus throughout in considering these issues was how to achieve the best outcomes for children.</p>  <p>  A child born 24 October 2012 is eligible to enrol in free pre-school, under the ECCE scheme in September 2016 as this is the earliest entry point after the child&rsquo;s third birthday.  They will not be eligible to enrol again in September 2017 as the child would be over the upper age limit of 5 years and 6 months at the end of the 2017/2018 pre-school year (i.e. June 2018).</p></reply>

The dispute between IMPACT members and Childminding Ireland is regrettable.  However, the restructuring and the current dispute is an operational matter for the employer and the Board of Childminding Ireland.  In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to interfere in such matters.</p>  <p>  I am aware that both IMPACT and Childminding Ireland have re-engaged with the Workplace Relations Commission.

During this inspection, it became apparent that the servicing and repair of the aircraft would have involved a significantly higher level of investment than was anticipated.  Given the number of flying hours achieved, the age of the aircraft and the expected repair costs involved it was decided that all work on the aircraft should cease, the servicing and repair of the aircraft would not be completed, the aircraft was to be withdrawn from operational service in the Air Corps and the aircraft would not be returned back to Ireland.</p>  <p>  With the assistance of Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, the Department of Defence concluded the sale of the aircraft on an &ldquo;as seen&rdquo; basis with a US based company, Journey Aviation, based in Florida, USA in December 2014.  The amount received by the Department of Defence for the sale of the Government Jet was US$500,000.  In addition, the sale of related spare parts for the aircraft to Journey Aviation also on an &ldquo;as seen&rdquo; basis took place in February 2015 for a sum of US $60,000.</p></reply>
