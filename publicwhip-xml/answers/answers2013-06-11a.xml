As shareholder, however, I have a strong concern in relation to the ongoing commercial position of the Company and I regularly liaise with the Company in this regard.</p><p>  An Post has many strengths and has the largest retail presence in the country.  I have impressed on the Company the need to further exploit its unique position in this regard and have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins.  I am also, however, conscious that An Post faces a difficult financial position.  The efforts by the Company to generate new income streams are most welcome.  Equally, An Post must ensure that it has a competitive costbase.  In this context, I recognise the efforts of the Company, in co-operation with its workforce to ensure constraint in operating costs, especially payroll which is such a major component of the Company&rsquo;s fixed costs.</p><p>  I recently addressed the annual conference of the Irish Postmasters&rsquo; Union and emphasised the intrinsic strengths of the network and the opportunities for new developments.  Having invested in the computerisation of all post offices, An Post is well positioned to become the front office provider of choice for Government and the financial services sector.</p><p>  I welcome the Joint Oireachtas Committee&rsquo;s &lsquo;Report on Promoting a Sustainable Future for the Post Office Network&rsquo;.  I have read and considered this report and found it both positive and ambitious.</p><p>  An Post has made much progress towards diversification with its enhanced arrangement with AIB and its agreement with Aviva for the transfer of Aviva Ireland&rsquo;s branch offices personal insurance business book to One Direct.  Recently the opportunity to pay the local property tax via An Post outlets was secured.</p><p>  In the context of the public sector transformation agenda I will continue to engage with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to consideration, as appropriate, of the post office network for transactional elements of the business of Government Departments and Agencies and have stressed to my Government colleagues that the network is ideally configured for over the counter transactions.  Overall, it is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company, in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focused network of post offices.</p></reply>

The financing of the project on a commercial basis is an operational matter for the company.  The project has not received any direct Exchequer support.  The development of the Mount Lucas project is a key component of Bord na M&oacute;na's diversification and growth strategy and represents a very substantial investment by Bord na M&oacute;na in the renewable sector.  The Mount Lucas project is also important in demonstrating the potential which the Midlands holds for the future generation of renewable power.</p><p>  The potential for job creation in renewable power generation is an important factor in Bord na M&oacute;na's transitioning away from dependence on the declining market for peat and towards a more sustainable future for the company.  The project, which is currently under construction, is supporting approximately 100 to 150 jobs.  The project will support a further 12 long term jobs when the wind farm is in full commercial operation, which is expected to be in June 2014. </p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na recently received approval for acceptance of the Mount Lucas project into the Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff, REFIT 2, which is the primary support mechanism for renewable electricity.  The REFIT scheme is designed to provide certainty to renewable electricity generators by providing them with a minimum floor price for each unit of electricity exported to the grid over a 15 year period.  The REFIT Scheme is open to all prospective generators, whether private sector or commercial State companies.</p></reply>

In particular I believe measures that provide guidance and training for online traders will assist them in providing the levels of service expected by online consumers &ndash; which will be beneficial to traders and consumers alike.</p><p>  In Ireland, Irish consumers spend almost &euro;4bn per annum online &ndash; with most of that spend going offshore.  Most small businesses in Ireland do not trade online.  The proportion of SMEs trading online is estimated to be as low as 23%.</p><p>  That means many small Irish businesses are being missed by consumers when they go online to source products and services.  Those not trading online are also missing out on the opportunity of markets and customers abroad.</p><p>  That is why we will be focusing in the forthcoming National Digital Strategy on encouraging and assisting more small businesses to do more online and ultimately to trade online.  To address this, a set of integrated actions have been identified in the National Digital Strategy and the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs.  The objective is to encourage more Irish-based small and medium businesses to become active on-line over the next two years.</p><p>  As a first step towards this objective we will pilot a voucher scheme that will provide upfront funding for small businesses to help them develop an online trading platform.  Beyond the pilot it will be our objective to roll out the scheme nationally aiming to get some 2,000 small businesses trading online over a 12 month period. To add impetus to NDS objectives I appointed David Puttnam as our first national Digital Champion.  Working with the Department, he will be engaging with the various sectors &ndash; including industry - over the coming months, with a view to driving the digital agenda and specifically pursuing some key goals that will be set out in the National Digital Strategy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-11a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061100071#WRA01400"><p>The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  </p><p>  The Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband to all parts of Ireland through two principal means: (a) by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and (b) by providing a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  There is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which they committed in the Plan with investments of up to &euro;1bn underway. ComReg has put in place a new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and for service bundles, both of which are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by service providers.  ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction, completed in 2012, is also enabling the rollout of advanced mobile broadband services.</p><p>  Some of the key developments in the short and medium term are as follows:</p><p>- eircom launched its next generation broadband services on 16th   May last, with speeds of up to 70Mbps, immediately available to over 300,000 premises.  By the end of this year, eircom aims to reach more than 600,000 homes and businesses. It has a target to pass 1.2m premises by June 2015;</p><p>  - UPC is continuing with its investment in the cable network, which should see 750,000 homes able to access services at data speeds of at least 150 Mbps by 2015;</p><p>  - Other fixed operators also continue to invest in Local Loop Unbundling (LLU). BT Ireland now supplies broadband access to both Vodafone and Sky Ireland, and along with other operators, is also investing in fixed infrastructure;</p><p>  - Mobile wireless operators are making plans for the rollout of 4G services later this year. The operators are obliged, under the terms of the licences, to cover 70% of the population;</p><p>  - ESB is currently considering the prospect of utilising its distribution network to rollout fibre broadband services.</p><p>  In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. A comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector is being undertaken to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband services over the coming years. The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment so as to deliver on the targets for high speed broadband contained in the National Broadband Plan.  </p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-11a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061100071#WRA01600"><p>The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set a binding target on all Member States to achieve at least 10% renewable energy in transport by 2020.  The increased deployment of Electric Vehicles will help in this regard but, it is clear that the primary means of meeting this target for all Member States will be by the increased use of biofuels.</p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 and works by obligating large road transport fuel suppliers to bring a certain amount of biofuels to the market.  From the start of this year, I have increased the obligation on fuel suppliers to include at least 6% by volume biofuels in their overall annual disposal of road transport fuels from the initial obligation rate of 4%.  The legislative basis for the obligation itself is provided for in the National Oil Reserves Agency Act, 2007 (as amended by the 2010 Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act).  I did not directly consult with Irish Aid in the issue of the increased obligation.</p><p>  Under Section 44D of the Act, before amending the rate of obligation, I was required to consult with the Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the National Oil Reserves Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Standards Authority of Ireland and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  I also consulted with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as well as Biofuel Obligation account holders and motoring organisations such as the Automobile Association (AA) and the Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI).  Before I made the order to increase the rate, a draft of the order was posted on my Department&rsquo;s website for 28 days with an invitation to interested parties to make representations on the proposed increase.</p><p>  I would stress that I do share the concerns that biofuel production, unless properly regulated, can have a negative impact on food production, and on food prices.  All biofuels counted as part of the scheme must comply with the sustainability criteria set out in the Renewable Energy Directive.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-11a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061100071#WRA01800"><p>The Joint Oireachtas Committee's report represents a valuable contribution to the debate on how Ireland should manage its indigenous oil and gas resources, to ensure the best result for the people of Ireland.</p><p>  I am aware that the former Joint Committee members invested considerable time in the gathering of evidence, consideration of such evidence, and preparation of the final report.  In that regard I would like to pay tribute to the members of the Committee for their efforts I have requested the Chief Whip to arrange for D&aacute;il time to be allocated to statement on this important report during this session.</p><p>  The 11 recommendations included in the report reflect the broad nature of the report and address a number of themes.</p><p>  The report recognises the importance of Ireland's legislative and strategic policy approach being fit for purpose.  It brings a focus to specific aspects of the non-fiscal regulatory regime.  It considers interactions involving the public in general, as well as those relating to the communities of areas where development activity is planned.  The theme, however, that has generated the greatest level of comment relates to the tax terms that should apply in the case of future commercial discoveries.</p><p>  In relation to the recommendation that the 1960 Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act should be reviewed, I would point out that in the period since it was enacted a broad body of legislation at national and European Union level that is of direct relevance to petroleum exploration and production activities has also come into being.  This includes planning, safety and environmental legislation.  Against that background, my Department is currently engaged in a review of the 1960 Act.</p><p>  With regard to the recommended need for a clear strategy governing Ireland's approach to petroleum exploration, our overall strategy in this area is to seek to maximise the benefits to the people of Ireland from our indigenous natural resources.</p><p>  In respect of the recommendations relating to the maximisation of production from a commercial field, the principle of unitisation and the issue of flaring of gas, I believe that these issues are already addressed to a considerable degree by the existing licensing terms, together with the Department's own industry-specific rules and procedures.</p><p>  As regards public consultation, the existing statutory obligations requiring public consultation in the case of petroleum-related projects are very detailed and extensive.  It is possible that the circumstances which gave rise to a focus on public consultation predate the enactment of the Strategic Infrastructure Act which provides for a more holistic, transparent and strengthened approach to the assessment of applications for development consent for major transport and energy projects.</p><p>  The &#8220;community gain&#8221; concept discussed in the report is indeed interesting. As a concept it is clearly not industry-specific. It is also complex, as communities are not homogenous and as a result what some may consider a gain, others may consider a loss. An Bord Plean&aacute;la, in granting planning consents under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act, has included specific &#8220;community gain&#8221; conditions in some cases.</p><p>  The Government is fully supportive of a community gain approach in the delivery of energy projects. This is explicitly referenced in the Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure published in July of 2012.  The Policy Statement stresses the need for energy project developers to examine appropriate means of building community gain considerations into their project budgeting and planning. </p><p>  The question of introducing a specific community gain provision on a statutory basis is a far broader question and would of course have implications well beyond the subject matter of the current report.</p><p>  As regards the recommendation for an almost doubling of the existing tax rate applying to petroleum production, I would strongly argue that this particular recommendation is not underpinned by the facts and analysis contained in the Committee's own report.</p><p>  I also struggle to understand how Ireland could be expected to have Norwegian style tax rates without also having Norwegian levels of commercial discoveries.  The fact remains that there have been only four commercial natural gas discoveries since exploration began offshore Ireland in the early 1970s, and no commercial discoveries of oil to date.</p><p>  In my view, Ireland's focus should be on how to encourage an increase in the level of exploration investment and exploration drilling in particular.  This is what is needed if we are to establish the true petroleum potential of the Irish offshore.</p><p>  The joint committee signalled clearly in its recommendations that it considered a review of the fiscal terms would be appropriate.  It was also very clear that any adjustment to the fiscal terms should not be retrospective.  I am completely in agreement with this latter point.  I am conscious that long-term investment decisions on exploration expenditure would benefit from the maximum degree of certainty on the stability of the fiscal regime.</p><p>  With that in mind, and having regard to the fact that the last review of the fiscal terms was in 2007, I intend to listen to the views of deputies through the course of the D&aacute;il debate that commenced last month and then, following conclusion of the debate, will seek some further independent expert advice on the &#8220;fitness-for-purpose&#8221; of Ireland's fiscal terms. Such expert advice would focus on what level of fiscal gain is achievable for the State and its citizens; and the mechanisms best suited to produce such a gain. Certainty as to fiscal terms is a pre-requisite to attracting oil and gas exploration investment to Ireland.  In that regard, and particularly in the context of planning for the next licensing round, it would be my intention to bring my consideration of this matter to a conclusion before the end of this year.  That would ensure that the next licensing round could be launched against a backdrop of regulatory certainty and encourage much needed new investment in exploration in our offshore.  <b></b></p></reply>

The company operates in accordance with the safety framework established by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which has statutory responsibility for gas safety.  In addition, in accordance with section 39A of the Gas Act 1976, as amended, the CER has responsibility for the assessment of applications to construct transmission pipelines.  I have no function in these operational matters. Enquiries by officials of my Department have confirmed that while local authorities have a role in regard to agreeing the route of a gas pipeline they have no role in deciding the depth at which the pipe will be laid. Pipelines are laid in accordance with the relevant standard. </p><p>  BGE owns and operates the national transmission and distribution gas network.  BGE and the CER have advised that all transmission pipelines, including those in residential areas, are designed, constructed, tested, operated and maintained in accordance with Irish Standard 328:2003, Code of Practice for Gas Transmission Pipelines and Pipeline Installations.</p><p>  I understand that pipelines in suburban and urban areas are constructed using high grade steel pipe and are laid with a minimum depth of cover of 1.2 metres throughout.  In some circumstances and over short sections, where existing major services are located and cannot be moved, it may not be possible to meet this depth of cover.  In these cases, additional pipeline protection measures, such as concrete impact protection, are put in place in accordance with Irish Standard 328:2003  Once commissioned, a scheduled routine maintenance and inspection programme is applied to all pipelines.</p><p>  Following completion of construction, the consent of the CER will be required before BGE may operate the pipeline.  This consent is subject to a review of all relevant data and test records by a CER commissioned independent consultant. Safety is BGE&rsquo;s first priority and the company is committed to ongoing development and maintenance of the gas networks and systems to ensure safety and to deliver continuous safety improvement and performance.  I have every confidence in BGE&rsquo;s priority commitment to safety. </p><p>  I understand the Deputy is referring to the Santry to East Wall gas pipeline.  In regard to that pipeline, the consent of the CER to BGE&rsquo;s undertaking of these works was informed by the advice of independent consultants engaged by the CER.  This advice dealt with matters such as the pipeline&rsquo;s technical compliance with design requirements, including minimum depth specifications, and compliance with the relevant Irish Standard 328:2003.</p><p>  I repeat my previous offer that if the Deputy wishes, I would be happy to request BGE to contact him directly in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

The scheme is delivered through a combination of SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage and via an area based approach.  Measures available include; draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation and are free of charge to the customer.</p><p>The following tables outline the number of homes completed and the value of the grants received for both schemes in 2012 and in 2013 up to 31 May.

It is the view of the SEAI that the downward trends in activity are primarily linked to the mildness of the weather across winters 2012 and 2013, which has created a reduction in the demand for energy efficiency related measures.  There is also evidence to suggest that the volume of householders with savings available to spend on energy efficiency upgrades is diminishing and impacting demand for the scheme.  Furthermore the bulk of early movers seeking to avail of energy efficiency measures under the scheme may now have been addressed.</p><p>Exchequer funding of &euro;18 million has been allocated to the Better Energy Homes scheme for 2013 while Exchequer funding of &euro;17 million has been allocated to Better Energy Warmer Homes.  The target for 2013 is to carry out energy efficiency upgrades for a total of 30,000<b> </b>  homes across both schemes.  Despite the current economic challenges this funding will have a lasting impact on homeowners who receive the energy measures.</p><p>With regard to the future operation of the schemes the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan and the Programme for Government include a commitment to roll out a Better Energy Financing energy retrofit scheme for domestic buildings after 2013.  The Better Energy Financing (BEF) model proposes that the current suite of Exchequer funded grants for energy efficiency measures, excluding the low-income housing retrofit programme, will be replaced by a new financing scheme open to households and commercial operators.  The key benefit to the homeowner of such a financing mechanism is that the scheme will allow them to secure upfront financing for energy efficiency upgrades to their homes, and in the process remove one of the key energy efficiency barriers.  It would also be an objective of the new model that savings arising from the energy efficiency measures will contribute to the repayment of the funding provided.</p></reply>

The Electricity Regulation Act 1999 provided for the establishment of the CER as an independent statutory regulator.  Since its establishment, there have been a number of changes to the regulatory framework, and CER&rsquo;s functions, in line with the continually evolving energy policy landscape and partly as a result of EU obligations.</p><p>  With a view to meeting policy objectives, the CER has played a pivotal role in the development of the Single Electricity Market (SEM) which has been operating in Ireland and Northern Ireland since November 2007.  It represents one of the first cross-jurisdictional markets of its kind in the world.</p><p>  The all-island Single Electricity Market (SEM) is the combination of two separate jurisdictional electricity markets in Ireland and Northern Ireland and is governed by the SEM Committee (SEMC).  The SEMC currently consists of a membership drawn from the CER in Ireland, the Utility Regulator (UR) in Northern Ireland and an independent member, who also has a deputy.</p><p>  Independent analysis has indicated that the market has worked well since its introduction in November 2007 and continues to deliver benefits to consumers through the use of efficient generation plant to meet demand across the whole island.  The SEM model of setting prices in a transparent and cost reflective manner is not only assisting to promote competition and attract new investment, it has also contributed to improvements in the availability of generation plants. The structure of the SEM has ensured that generators, including new players, have invested in the market, thus ensuring security of supply.</p><p>  This is evidenced by recent decisions to invest in the Irish electricity market by a variety of market players. Bord G&aacute;is opened the 440 Mega Watt (MW) Whitegate power station in 2010 and ESB commissioned the 435 MW Aghada power station in the same year. The East West Electricity Interconnector (EWIC) commenced operation in 2012 with a capacity of 500 MW. Scottish and Southern Electricity (SSE) is currently constructing a 460 MW gas-fired power station at Great Island, Co. Wexford, and expect the plant to be operating from 2014. The SEM has also facilitated the connection of over 2,400 MW of renewable energy to the grid.</p><p>  The SEM project was developed by both regulators. The allowed project costs incurred in its establishment were paid for by both regulators and were ultimately borne by electricity customers in the Irish and Northern Irish markets. </p><p>The SEM will continue to evolve in line with European electricity market developments, bearing in mind the primacy of the electricity customer when considering market evolution.  </p></reply>

The objectives of the internal energy market are the achievement of better outcomes for EU citizens through contributing to economic growth and jobs, by providing secure energy at an affordable and competitive price, and through sustainability in energy use.  On 4 February 2011 the European Council declared that the internal energy market should be completed by 2014.  This goal was reaffirmed at the European Council of 22 May 2013.  The creation of the internal energy market in wholesale and retail electricity and gas markets helps put downward pressure on energy prices not least by promoting generation competition.</p><p>  While considerable progress has been made, the European Commission considers that obstacles remain to the achievement of a fully functioning internal market in electricity and gas across the entire EU.  Accordingly, on 15 November 2012, the European Commission presented a Communication assessing progress towards achieving the internal energy market.  The Communication provides a timely stocktake on progress towards a single market in electricity and gas and aims to address the remaining obstacles on the road to full implementation as well as reflecting on how the Internal Energy Market can fulfil its considerable potential and deliver real benefits for all EU energy consumers, specifically households, business and industry. The Communication referred to the formation of the All-Island electricity market in Ireland as a positive contribution to the construction of the internal market.</p><p>  The Communication proposes a detailed set of actions, under the heading of an &ldquo;Action Plan for Europe&rdquo; to ensure the successful implementation of the internal energy market by 2014. The Action Plan identifies four main challenges and accompanying actions which, if implemented across the EU, would enable Member States to meet various sub-goals resulting in achievement of a well-functioning and effective internal energy market.  In this regard I am pleased to inform the House that last Friday, under our EU Presidency of the Energy Council, I secured the agreement of my energy Ministerial colleagues to the Energy Council&rsquo;s Conclusions on the Communication.  The Conclusions set out Ministerial views of the tasks and actions necessary to make the transition to the internal energy market.</p><p>  Foremost among the actions I mentioned earlier, necessary for the implementation of the internal market, I would highlight consumer empowerment.  The European Commission estimates that across the EU consumers could save up to &euro;13 billion annually by switching to the cheapest supplier.  This is a timely reminder that in a competitive market consumers can, and should, shop around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers and switch supplier, if necessary, bearing in mind that all suppliers can and do offer competitive prices and products.</p><p>In the Irish market there are a number of suppliers competing in the retail market in both electricity and gas and offering various prices and products to domestic and business consumers.  In addition, electricity prices are no longer regulated.  In this environment consumers can readily access prices offered by suppliers and easily switch if they wish to do so.  Switching is continuing in both the electricity and gas markets with switching rates of 16.97% for gas and 11.27% for electricity reported by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) for 2012.  </p></reply>

Internationally, the International Energy Agency estimates that governments will need to spend $180 billion in 2035 alone on sustainable energy measures to achieve climate change targets.  Ireland is ideally positioned to sell the skills of the domestic ICT sector, to test technologies and to develop export industries from our sustainable resources. </p><p>  The energy retrofitting of homes is an established industry in Ireland, primarily on foot a number of major government interventions in this sector.  The Better Energy Homes scheme administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) provides grant support to homeowners wishing to upgrade their home insulation and heating systems.  To date over 140,000 homes have been upgraded through this scheme with grant aid of &euro;240m and matched private investment of over &euro;270m.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme funds the direct provision of insulation upgrades to vulnerable energy poor homes, with almost 97,000 homes completed to date.  More recently the introduction of energy efficiency obligations on energy suppliers is stimulating additional energy retrofitting activity, further enhancing momentum in the sector.</p><p>  The installers operating under the aforementioned schemes are all subject to very demanding registration terms in respect of technical competence and professional practice.  They are also subject to the rigour of SEAI&rsquo;s quality assurance scheme.  This focus on quality is intended to transform the sector, give consumers confidence, prepare the sector for further growth and opportunities to export the expertise to countries where demand is stimulated.  The export opportunities for the sector are twofold, namely the insulation and heating products and the skills and expertise of the professional installers.</p><p>  SEAI are already engaging with a number of industry stakeholders and enterprise agencies to consider opportunities for packaging the skills and expertise within this sector specifically for export to other jurisdictions.  It is not without its challenges however, given that insulation is a worldwide industry with all players seeking international markets, where standards can vary by country and demand being tied somewhat to the building industry.</p><p>  The Department of Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation which has general policy responsibility  for sustainable  job creation has informed me that following rapid contraction of the Irish construction market witnessed in 2007, the Irish insulation market prioritised a twofold strategy of UK (and European) market development coupled with an investment programme of new product development.  Enterprise Ireland has worked in partnership with the sector on both strategies and through a series of market entry supports, R&amp;amp;D incentives, promotion of management development programmes, the sector has rebounded strongly and is now entering a new phase of growth.  Currently, the Irish insulation sector represents circa 14% of the UK insulation market with established defined routes to market and developed recognised international brands.  In parallel with the market entry of insulation manufactures to the market, a sub-sector of Irish insulation installers has developed a presence in the UK market.  The sector is ideally poised to supply innovative solutions to the recently launched UK Green Deal.</p><p>  The expansion of the sector has also extended to near European markets with market penetration witnessed in Benelux, France and Germany.</p><p>  More generally Ireland has a reputation as an early mover in advanced energy management, as illustrated by the development of the Irish energy management standard, IS 393, in 2006, which informed the development of the EU standard and in turn informed that of the global standard, ISO 50001.  The market for this global standard, and associated services, is expected to be considerable.  This creates the opportunity to export expertise and services in a fast-growing international market.</p><p>Finally, there is considerable interest in the ICT sector in the applications in energy relating to smart infrastructure, technology and control.  A transition to smarter infrastructure, with greater use of software, sensors and controls, has already started, and this plays to Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in this sector.  </p></reply>

There is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which they committed in   the Plan with investments of up to &euro;1bn underway.</p><p>  ComReg has put in place a new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and for service bundles, both of which are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by service providers.  ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction, completed in 2012, is also enabling the rollout of advanced mobile broadband services.</p><p>  In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing with the private sector to deliver high speed services to areas, which are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market alone.</p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  A comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector is being undertaken to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband services over the coming years.  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government intervention that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.  </p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  </p></reply>

REFIT 2 received EU State Aid approval in January 2012. Under this approval a total of 4,000 MW can be supported under REFIT 2.  The scheme is open to wind generation constructed between the start of 2010 and the end of 2017 and is based on a fixed feed in tariff mechanism. The current reference price per megawatt hour for onshore wind is as follows &ndash; &euro;69.23 for installations above 5 MW and &euro;71.66 for installations equal to, or below, 5MW.</p><p>  REFIT operates by offering minimum guaranteed prices for up to 15 years, thus providing certainty to project developers of a minimum price for electricity exported to the grid over that period.  The initial capital outlay for new renewable projects is significant and the certainty provided by REFIT assists developers in securing the necessary funding. </p><p>  To date, REFIT schemes have supported the building of over 1700 MW of wind generation capacity.  This has made wind energy the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target.  However, if we are to reach that target, the build rate of onshore wind farms must accelerate from an historic average of 180 MW per year to at least 250 MW per year. It was for this reason that I decided to amend the terms of REFIT 2 to extend the closing date for applications to 31 December 2015, with projects required to be built by the end of December 2017.  Support under REFIT 2 cannot exceed 15 years and will not extend beyond the end of December 2032. </p></reply>

It followed the publication of a &#8220;Preliminary Re-evaluation Report&#8221; in May 2011.</p><p>  The final report represents a comprehensive re-evaluation of the project, involving, among other things, a thorough re-examination of the previous application, including issues raised during the previous application process.</p><p>  It considered and responded to Stakeholder feedback from the previous planning application as well as Stakeholder feedback from the public consultation following publication of the Preliminary Re-evaluation Report and the publication of the &#8220;Meath Tyrone Report - Review by International Expert Commission&#8221; along with the subsequent Government policy statement.</p><p>  The &#8220;Final re-evaluation Report&#8221; found that there remains an urgent strategic need for the project.  It also concludes that the best technology solution for the project is a single circuit 400kV alternating current (AC) overhead line.  The indicative route for this overhead line is similar to the previously proposed line route, but incorporates localised modifications.</p><p>  EirGrid is fully committed to engaging extensively with landowners, members of the public and other interested parties on all aspects of the project and during April/May held nine open days in Meath, Cavan and Monaghan.</p><p>  Following the completion of this period of public engagement, EirGrid is considering all feedback received before finalising its preferred project solution.  The &#8220;Preferred Project Solution Report&#8221; will be published this summer and will be the subject of a further period of public consultation.</p><p>  The &#8220;Preferred Project Solution Report&#8221; is a key publication detailing the preferred line route and indicative tower locations. It is the final report prior to the submission of the new planning application.</p><p>  The public consultation on the preferred Project Solution Report will focus on the preferred line design, including the line route, preferred structure and tower locations, the methodology for siting and construction of towers and environmental issues to be addressed in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).</p><p>Submission of the planning application and associated Environmental Impact Statement to An Bord Plean&aacute;la will follow, at the end of this year or the beginning of 2014.  </p></reply>

I have no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.</p><p>  The CER, in 2006, approved a network connections policy which enabled reassessment of the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.</p><p>  This policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Uneconomic projects would increase costs for all energy consumers.</p><p>Under the CER's policy framework, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and latterly Gaslink, carried out a comprehensive review of towns not connected to the national gas network.  Gaslink published its New Towns Analysis Phase 3<i></i>  report in 2010.</p><p>  The study included a review of the feasibility of connecting 11 towns in the West and North West region which are the focus of the Western Development Commission paper, &#8220;Why Invest in Gas&#8221;.  However, the Gaslink review found that none of the towns qualified for connection on economic grounds.</p><p>Gaslink will continue to review the towns which did not qualify for connection under the 2010 Study as well as other towns.  The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually as a result of the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.  </p></reply>

The Irish Presidency has been active in initiating discussions in the Council of the European Union and on 6 June, I chaired an orientation debate in the Council in regard to this matter. While all Member States, including Ireland, recognise the growing importance of network and information security as we become ever more reliant on the Internet and on online services generally, there is a diversity of views and opinions on how to realise increased cyber security.  It is recognised by all that deliberations at EU level on this proposal are at an early stage. The European Parliament has only recently commenced deliberations on this proposal. Consequently it is premature to comment at this time on implementation at national level on what is merely an EU legislative proposal at the early stages of deliberation and which may be subjected to significant change.</p></reply>

In order to meet our overall 16% requirement, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport from renewable sources. </p><p>  Though these targets are challenging, I am confident that they can be met. My Department&rsquo;s Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012 to 2020 sets out the key strategic goals for the various renewable energy sectors in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s EU obligations. </p><p>  In addition, under the Directive, Ireland was required to set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) the trajectory towards meeting its legally binding targets.  The NREAP and the First Progress Report on the NREAP, which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, show the sectoral and technology breakdown that we anticipate in the achievement of our target.</p><p>  By the end of 2011, we had reached 6.4% of overall energy consumption from renewable sources and the trajectory set out in the NREAP assumes that we will achieve the 16% target incrementally at approximately 1% per annum.  </p><p>  There are a number of policy measures in place designed to support the development necessary to meet Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy obligations.  The Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes incentivise increasing amounts of renewable electricity to connect to the grid. The REFIT3 support for biomass Combined Heat and Power (CHP) technologies, is supporting progress on our renewable heat target.  Measures such as the Biofuel Obligation Scheme to increase the use of biofuels, and the Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme to incentivise the purchase of new Electric Vehicles are the mechanisms being used to achieve our target for renewable transport. Policy interventions through the ReHeat schemes, energy efficiency schemes, building regulations, REFIT3 for CHP and natural market migration to renewable heating technologies will deliver the majority of the 12% renewable heat target.  In addition, later this year I will be publishing a National Bioenergy Strategy which will further outline the role energy from biomass will play to contribute to the achievement of our national targets and, in particular, the target for the heat sector.  </p></reply>

The combination of private investment and State interventions such as the National Broadband Scheme means that Ireland has met the EU Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p><p>The Government, through the National Broadband Plan, which I published on 30<sup>th </sup>  August last year, has recognised that the key imperative now is to ensure high speed broadband availability to all.  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country by ensuring that high speed services of 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU's target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  Ireland is now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband in Ireland which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.  </p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  There is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which they committed in   the Plan.  </p><p>  Some of the key developments in the short and medium term are as follows:</p><p>    -  Eircom launched its next generation broadband services on 16<sup>th</sup>   May last, with speeds of up to 70Mbps, immediately available to over 300,000 premises.  By the end of this year, eircom aims to reach more than 600,000 homes and businesses.  It has a target to pass 1.2m premises by June 2015.</p><p>     -  UPC is continuing with its investment in the cable network, which should see 750,000 homes able to access services at data speeds of at least 150 Mbps by 2015.</p><p>     -  Other fixed operators also continue to invest in Local Loop Unbundling (LLU).  BT Ireland now supplies broadband access to both Vodafone and Sky Ireland, and along with other operators, is also investing in fixed infrastructure.</p><p>     -  Mobile wireless operators are making plans for the rollout of 4G services later this year.  The rollout of 4G will facilitate significantly increased mobile broadband speeds.</p><p>      -  ESB is currently considering the prospect of utilising its distribution network to rollout fibre broadband services.  </p><p>  In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  </p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department will shortly embark on a formal mapping exercise to identify the areas of the country to be targeted in the State-led investment under the Government's National Broadband Plan to ensure the provision of high speed broadband services where the commercial market will not deliver.  This exercise will inform an EU State Aids application in respect of the State-led intervention and is a necessary prerequisite for State Aids approval.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.  </p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p></reply>

Prices in the electricity retail market are fully deregulated.  Customers can therefore avail of competitive offerings from electricity and gas suppliers.  Prices are set by suppliers and are commercial and operational matters for them.  I have no statutory function in the setting of electricity prices.</p><p>  Electricity and gas costs in Ireland are influenced by various drivers, including global gas and oil prices, the costs of capital, exchange rate fluctuations, the small size of the Irish market, geographical location and low population density.</p><p>  The most important factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is the continuing upward trend in international gas prices.  Wholesale natural gas prices have been on an upward curve since the second half of 2009 driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan and the significant growth in demand from China and India.  This feeds directly through to retail electricity prices as most of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity is produced at gas-fired stations.  Ireland it at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices, which dictate the retail price of electricity.</p><p>  The trend of increasing gas prices in the European commodities market, and the underlying dependence on gas in the electricity mix underline the need to maintain the focus on continuing to address controllable cost factors, to increase the penetration of indigenous secure renewables in the Irish electricity system and to take action on energy efficiency in homes and businesses.</p><p>  At a national level, the competitive energy market in place helps put downward pressure on prices.  In addition, we must focus on all possible additional actions to mitigate costs for business and domestic customers, including rigorous regulatory scrutiny of the network costs component of retail prices.</p><p>  I am committed to working with enterprise and with the energy sector to ensure that the costs of energy are as competitive as possible.  In this context, promotion of energy efficiency measures is an area within our control where action can be taken to reduce energy costs.</p><p>  Energy efficiency represents a significant opportunity for both businesses and households to reduce their energy costs.  There are energy efficiency measures in place to assist SMEs.  The Energy Efficiency Fund, which I announced in February and which will commence funding specific measures in the near future, will assist energy efficiency projects in the public and commercial sectors.  Another support is the SME programme administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), under the Better Energy in Business programme.  It helps 2,000 businesses improve their energy efficiency and competitiveness.</p><p>  Promotion of indigenous sustainable sources of energy will help offset the impact of volatile fossil fuel prices.  The Government has a renewable electricity target of 40% by 2020.  Good progress has been made in meeting this target and its realisation will introduce more certainty in the energy fuel mix as well as boosting security of supply.</p><p>The latest Eurostat figures show that electricity prices in Ireland increased for small business customers by 1.4% and for medium business by 6% in the second half of 2012 giving a ranking of 4th most expensive in the EU in both categories.  In the case of the small business category, its ranking has dropped one place. In the case of medium businesses, the ranking is the same as in the previous six-month period.  The effects of the price drivers outlined earlier in this response tend to affect Irish electricity and gas prices negatively, and in the case of electricity tend to place Irish prices towards the more expensive position in the EU rankings.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-11a.117.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061100072#WRB03400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 526 together.</p><p>  The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive set a binding target on all Member States to achieve at least 10% renewable energy in transport by 2020.  The primary means, for most if not all Member States, of meeting this target will be by the increased use of biofuels.</p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 and works by obligating large road transport fuel suppliers to bring a certain amount of biofuels to the market. The aim of the scheme is to ensure that Irish consumers have access to appropriately priced, sustainable and reliable sources of biofuel.  The scheme is certificate based and the trading mechanism allows the scheme to provide a stable market, protecting consumers from structural rigidities in the fuel supply market, which could result in episodic periods of high fuel prices, while also ensuring delivery of targets.</p><p>  This has seen increased amounts of biofuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol being deployed in Ireland.  From the start of this year, I have increased the obligation on fuel suppliers to include at least 6% by volume biofuels in their overall annual disposal of road transport fuels from the previous obligation rate of 4%.  The recent increase in the obligation rate along with future increases will see the biofuel market grow which will continue to create further opportunities for the indigenous biofuel industry.</p><p>  Accurately assessing the effect the biofuel obligation has on prices paid by the motorist is complex as open market costs are only known by the market players themselves.  However, my Department estimates that the extra cost to the motorist of using biofuels in 2012 was in the region of &euro;28 million which when factored into the overall consumption of road transport fuels of 4.231 billion litres equates to less than 0.7 cent per litre.</p><p>  The issue of indirect land use change (ILUC) is a very complex one and assessing its impact is extremely difficult.  Late last year, the European Commission, following a number of analytical studies to better understand the potential indirect land-use changes and impacts associated with the production of biofuels, circulated a proposal to amend sections of the Renewable Energy Directive.  This proposal is being progressed during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the EU.  One of the amendments proposed is that no more than 5% of the energy in the transport sector should come from biofuels produced from certain feedstocks.  The proposal also aims to promote the production and uptake of advanced biofuels with low risk of ILUC and to improve the efficiency of biofuel production processes.  The European Commission proposal will continue to be discussed under the Lithuanian Presidency of the Council. In 2012, 128 million litres of biofuel was placed on the market.  Of this, more than half was biodiesel produced from wastes and residues and therefore had no indirect land use impacts.</p></reply>

Data on income of temporary employees are  included in the BOP Current Account under the heading Compensation of Employees.  These data cover income of non-resident workers in Ireland, i.e. workers residing in Ireland for less than one year.</p><p>Due to their nature, migrants&rsquo; remittances and income of temporary employees are a challenge to measure and as data sources become available, the estimation models are strengthened.  At present, migrants' remittances are estimated using P35 income information available, with some geographic detail of migrants, from Revenue.  Remittances are estimated as a percentage of income, with the percentage applied varying by geographic area.  Earnings of non-resident workers are based on data from BOP surveys (surveys of companies and embassies) and from estimates of numbers of temporary workers in Ireland (using Irish and Northern Irish census of population data).  All income of temporary workers are treated as repatriations.</p><p>As part of Ireland's reporting of BOP statistics to the IMF, the data above is supplied at total level (i.e. with no country geographic detail) to the IMF and is included in their BOP database.  The World Bank use the information from the IMF BOP database for their own analyses and as part of this work, the World Bank estimates a country breakdown of the Ireland total repatriations.  The estimates generated by the World Bank should not be taken as official estimates of repatriations from Ireland at country level.</p></reply>

It is being extensively discussed at EU level within the Foreign Affairs Council, including at the most recent Council which I attended in Brussels on 27 May. </p><p>  All member States are united in their support for diplomatic efforts to reach a political solution to this appalling conflict.  In particular, the EU is extending its full support to the initiative of the US and Russia aimed at bringing both sides in Syria to a further peace conference in Geneva, on the basis of the Geneva Communiqu&eacute; of June 2012, with a view to mapping out a genuine transition towards democracy in Syria. In its May 27 Conclusions, the Foreign Affairs Council urged both sides to respond positively to the US-Russia initiative and to engage openly in a genuine process of negotiation. It also reaffirmed that the EU will spare no effort in helping to create the appropriate conditions for a successful convening of the conference. </p><p>  The renewal of the EU&rsquo;s sanctions against Syria, including the arms embargo, was  extensively discussed by the Council at its May 27 meeting.   There are differing views among partners as to how the EU can best promote the search for a political solution, which remains the primary objective for us all.  I reiterated on behalf of the Government our firm view that lifting the arms embargo would be unlikely to assist efforts to achieve a political solution.  On the contrary, we believe that the provision of arms to the Syrian moderate opposition, even if well-intentioned, is likely to contribute to further militarisation of the conflict and to lead to greater levels of violence in Syria and in the wider region.  I further stated my view that lifting the arms embargo ran the clear risk of endangering the &ldquo;Geneva II&rdquo; initiative led by the US and Russia. </p><p>  It is obviously a matter of regret that the Foreign Affairs Council was unable to agree to renew the EU arms embargo against Syria, which, as a result, expired on 31 May. However, I welcome the fact that the Council did agree to renew the remainder of the existing sanctions directed against the Assad regime, which will remain in force for a further year. </p><p>  It is important to underline that all 27 member States of the EU remain fully united in their desire to promote the earliest possible end to violence and a political resolution leading to transition and the establishment of a functioning democracy in Syria. In the Council Declaration that accompanied the Council Decision on renewal of the sanctions package, it was noted that no member State intending to do so will proceed at this stage with the delivery of arms to Syria.  The Council also agreed to review its position before 1 August on the basis of a report from the High Representative on the developments related to the US-Russia initiative and on the engagement of the Syrian parties.</p><p>  In relation to calls which have been made for the establishment of a no-fly zone over Syria, this would obviously necessitate broad international agreement and could only be authorised through a UN Security Council Resolution specifically mandating such a step. Regrettably, the Security Council has not been able to agree any Resolution on Syria since the conflict erupted in March 2011 and it appears most unlikely that the political will exists within the Council at present to reach agreement on such a proposal.</p></reply>

I warmly welcome the agreement reached recently on the land reform element of these peace negotiations.  I wish the parties success in reaching agreement on the other important items remaining on their agenda so that a final comprehensive peace agreement can be secured.   When I met with Colombia&rsquo;s President Santos earlier this year, I assured him of Ireland&rsquo;s support for the peace process.  I added that we stand ready, within available means, to share our experiences if invited to do so by the parties to the process.  President Santos expressed his appreciation of our support, adding that he is very aware of our own peace process and that the Colombian process has incorporated some useful lessons from it.  </p><p>  At the recent Universal Periodic Review of Colombia at the Human Rights Council, Ireland expressed strong support for the Colombian peace process and encouraged all parties to ensure adequate space for civil society in the process, paying special attention to the participation of women and indigenous communities.  I know that some trade unionists and civil society activists, such as those from the Patriotic March who visited Dublin recently, have expressed concerns that their activism places them at risk of attack.  </p><p>  In my view, it is essential to any democratic society that all citizens, regardless of political affiliation, who engage peacefully in the political and social developments of their society, can do so without fear of threat or persecution, in particular in the form of risks to their personal security.  For this reason, I urge all parties in Colombia to address issues of insecurity so as to foster conditions that best support peace building.  I understand that a series of consultations with civil society facilitated by the UN Development Programme and the National University of Colombia are taking place.  From an Irish perspective, we see considerable value in a peace process being as inclusive as is possible, in particular as we recognise the positive contribution made by civil society in our own peace process.</p></reply>

The trade figures outlined below for China include total merchandise trade and total trade in services between Ireland and China, including Hong Kong and Macau, for the period January 2008 to December 2012. In 2008, total bilateral trade between Ireland and China was &euro;8,907 million (m). Total bilateral merchandise trade was valued at &euro;6,600m; with exports worth &euro;2,325m and imports worth &euro;4,275 m.

Of this figure &euro;2,330m were exports and &euro;2,879m were imports. Bilateral trade in services totalled &euro;1,935 m; exports at &euro;1,648m and imports at &euro;317m. </p><p>Total bilateral trade with China totalled &euro;7,603m in 2010.

Total exports increased by over 5% in 2011 in nominal terms and by over 5.5% in 2012.  Exports are almost evenly divided between goods and services, with almost all of our export growth in 2012 accounted for by services exports, which grew by 11%.  This overall trend is evident in trade with China where our merchandise exports decreased in 2012; in large part due to the 'patent cliff' in respect of pharmaceuticals while our exports of services increased by 52% over the period 2008-2011.</p></reply>

The Government was represented at the signing ceremony at UN headquarters in New York by the Minister of State with Special Responsibility for Trade and Development, Joe Costello T.D.  The Treaty is the first legally binding instrument to regulate the international trade in conventional weapons.  States which sign up to the Treaty are prohibited from exporting arms to countries if they know those weapons will be used to commit gross violations of human rights. Minister of State Costello signed the Treaty on the morning of 3 June at a special ceremony in the UN's Trusteeship Council Chamber. In the afternoon, he attended a high-level Ministerial segment, at which UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was present, and delivered Ireland's national statement. Highlighting its humanitarian provisions in particular, he described the Treaty as a &#8220;strong, robust and comprehensive instrument&#8221; that, when fully implemented, &#8220;will reduce human suffering and save lives.&#8221;  </p><p>Ireland's statement at the UN has been well received, including by international civil society organisations, which played such an important role in promoting the ATT process since its inception over six years ago.</p><p>In the evening, Minister of State Costello attended a reception to mark the opening for signature of the new Treaty, co-hosted by Australia, Japan, New Zealand and Norway. </p><p>In between his ATT-related engagements, the Minister of State attended a working lunch on the Post-2015 development agenda hosted by Ireland's Permanent Representative to the UN in New York, Ambassador Anne Anderson. A number of key stakeholders involved in the ongoing discussions on a new international development framework to succeed the UN Millennium Development Goalswere present at the working lunch.  Later in the afternoon, following his ATT statement at the UN, Minister of State Costello attended an Irish community event at the Emerald Isle Community Centrein the Bronx, organised by the Consulate-General.</p><p>It is encouraging that so many States were in a position to sign the Arms Trade Treaty with us on 3 June and that others, including the United States of America, have indicated their intention to sign. There have already been additional signatures and I am hopeful this will continue in the coming months.   The Treaty will come into force ninety days following ratification by the fiftieth State.  I believe that the signing ceremony marks a significant step along the way to the ATT's entry into force and becoming a reality on the ground - perhaps as soon as 2014. </p><p>Nationally, the Government will move to ratify the ATT in the second half of the year.  I have instructed officials in my Department to begin preparations to ensure that the requisite steps are taken in good time to allow for early ratification.</p><p>Encouraging other countries to sign and ratify the ATT will be of critical importance in the period ahead.  Together with our EU partners, Ireland will work towards the entry into force and ultimate universalisation of the Treaty.  Discussions are already underway within the EU on how we can best focus our collective efforts and resources to make that a reality.  Ireland is playing its full part in those discussions.</p></reply>

A number of aspects of Iran's choices and behaviour in relation to that programme, and related policy areas, are difficult to understand other than as efforts to achieve a military nuclear capability. Ireland shares those concerns.Many of these concerns relate specifically to activities which are or may be contrary to Iran's obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and these have been set out in detail in a long series of reports by the IAEA. The Agency continues to report that, despite nine years of talks with Iran to try to clarify these questions, the IAEA has been unable to confirm that Iran's programme is purely peaceful, essentially because Iran has refused to engage with the Agency in substance on these matters.Similarly, a lengthy series of political discussions with Iran by the E3+3 group, led in recent years by the EU High Representative, has also been unable to make any progress with Iran in rebuilding confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme.</p><p>Iran's assurances about the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme have unfortunately been belied by both its refusal to discuss the aspects of its programme which are giving rise to concern, and indeed its continuation and intensification of those activities throughout this period.</p><p>In relation to the import of medicines into Iran, I have received no substantive information on this issue which would alter the terms of my reply to Question No 229 (5954/13) from the Deputy on this topic on 5 February 2013.</p></reply>

I commend those who are working to promote reconciliation between Israelis, Palestinians and other Arabs, and between Jews, Muslims and Christians, in the Holy Land.   Irish Aid continues to support work on the ground designed to support this objective.  There are people on both sides who promote such work.  And there are others on both sides, regrettably, who actively exacerbate tensions between the communities. It is disappointing, but hardly surprising, that there may be some Palestinians who are not supportive of reconciliation efforts in a context in which no peace agreement has been concluded or is even in prospect, in which the Israeli occupation is continuing (seemingly indefinitely), illegal Israeli dispossession of Palestinian land continues unabated, and in which the impact of occupation on Palestinians is steadily worsening.  I consider that the continual injustices and dispossessions meted out to Palestinians by the occupation are the most active force working against reconciliation between the two peoples.   The specific incident alluded to does not appear to have received any widespread coverage in either Israeli or Palestinian media, and is itself reported in very vague terms. Neither our Representative Office in Ramallah nor our Embassy in Tel Aviv have been able to yield further information on, or to corroborate, this story.

This represents a reduction from 0.45% to 0.43% of EU Gross National Income (GNI). The Conclusions also note that, despite continued budgetary constraints across the Union, the EU remains the largest provider of development assistance globally, accounting for over half of total ODA provided to developing countries.</p><p>  The Council reaffirmed the commitment by the European Council in February this year to respect the EU&rsquo;s formal undertaking collectively to commit 0.7% of GNI in Official Development assistance by 2015.  The Union and its Member States also reaffirmed their individual and collective ODA commitments, taking into account the exceptional budgetary circumstances in Europe at present. </p><p>  I believe it is a very significant achievement in the most difficult circumstances that the Government has broadly stabilised the levels of Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance, following several years of budgetary reductions.  In 2011, Ireland provided a total of &euro;657 million in ODA, or 0.51% of GNI.  In 2012, we provided &euro;629 million, which amounted to 0.48% of GNI.  This amount is listed in the Council Conclusions, along with a forecast prepared by the European Commission of spending on ODA by Member States for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015.  The figures for Ireland for 2014 and 2015 are purely indicative, based on current ODA levels.</p><p>  The Government is strongly committed to Ireland&rsquo;s overseas aid programme. Last month we launched Ireland&rsquo;s new Policy on International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;. The policy clearly sets out our vision for a sustainable and just world, and our goals and areas of focus for the coming years. It reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to international development and its centrality to our foreign policy.</p><p>  The new policy restates the commitment in the Programme for Government to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP for Official Development Assistance (ODA). We will work to maintain our ODA levels broadly at current levels until economic circumstances permit us to make further progress towards achieving the 0.7% target.  Preparations for the Budget for 2014 are currently under way.  While I am firmly committed to working to maintain the aid programme at its current level, the final allocation for ODA is a matter for Government decision and will be announced in the Budget Statement.</p></reply>

Like the rule of law, pluralism of opinion and the right to peaceful protest are part of every democracy and the disproportionate use of force by the police, as acknowledged by the Turkish Deputy Prime Minister, was deeply regrettable. I understand the Interior Ministry has launched an investigation. </p><p>  Many of the protestors have raised concerns about current government policy in a number of areas. The government has now begun to meet with protestors and there has been some recognition of the need to reach out to those who feel isolated and marginalised by some government policies. I understand that a meeting is scheduled with the Turkish Prime Minister on Wednesday 12 June.</p><p>  However I am concerned by reports that riot police re-entered Taksim Square early on 11 June and fired tear gas canisters and rubber bullets at protestors. I am disappointed that the Turkish authorities appear not to have heeded calls by the EU and others for restraint. I would urge all sides to redouble their efforts to resolve the situation through a process of peaceful and inclusive dialogue. </p><p>  Turkey as a Candidate for membership of the EU is expected to uphold the democratic values of the EU. EU-inspired reforms have, in fact, facilitated the increasing space for peaceful protest and dissenting voices. It could be argued that the protests are evidence that democracy in Turkey is maturing and that civil society has been strengthened. </p><p>  As soon as the demonstrations started, my Department heightened the warning in its travel advisory, urging Irish citizens to avoid demonstrations and alerting them to the cities and areas affected.  Given the potential for further demonstrations and the possibility of violence, we are advising Irish citizens to exercise caution and to stay well away from the vicinity of all demonstrations, including apparently peaceful demonstrations.   </p><p>  The Department and the Embassy in Ankara are following the situation closely and have been providing advice to concerned Irish citizens. The phones of the Department and the Embassy are monitored out-of-hours for calls from citizens seeking advice or assistance. </p><p>  I am only aware of one Irish citizen who has been directly caught up in the demonstrations. He was unhurt and has been given consular assistance by the Embassy in Ankara. We will provide similar assistance in any other cases which may arise.</p></reply>

The issue was central to discussions at the Development segment of the Foreign Affairs Council which I attended in Brussels on 28 May.    The importance of the post-2015 development process is reflected in the intensity and range of discussions now taking place at all levels internationally, within the European Union, through the High Level Panel appointed by the UN Secretary General, which issued its report last week, and in the UN Open Working Group on the Sustainable Development Goals, on which Ireland is represented, in New York.  The UN has also this year organised eleven major thematic consultations and over fifty national and regional consultations internationally so far this year.   The first substantive discussions on a post-2015 development framework were held by EU Development Ministers during the informal Ministerial meeting which I chaired in Dublin on 11-12 February.  Since then, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the European External Action Service and the European Commission have been working in close cooperation, together with EU Member States, to agree Conclusions setting out the broad EU position on the post-2015 international development framework in advance of a major UN Special Event on the MDGs, which will be held in New York in later September.</p><p>  The EU position is outlined in draft Council Conclusions on the &ldquo;Over-arching Post-2015 Agenda&rdquo;, which were endorsed by EU Development Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council on 28 May. They will next be considered for endorsement by EU Environment Ministers at the Environment Council on 18 June, with a view to formal adoption by the General Affairs Council on 25 June. When adopted and published, I believe that the Conclusions will demonstrate that the Irish Presidency has played a major role in bringing together the different aspects of the fight to end extreme poverty and hunger and the challenge of achieving environmental sustainability in a single, integrated approach by the EU to the work internationally over the coming two years to establish a new global development framework.</p></reply>

The programme for the visit included formal discussions with the President of Croatia, Mr. Ivo Josipović, and Prime Minister Mr. Zoran Milanović. In addition, Minister of State Creighton met informally with First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Ms Vesna Pusić. The President&rsquo;s visit comes on the eve of Croatia&rsquo;s accession to the EU on 1 July 2013. It is fitting that the President&rsquo;s first State Visit to what will soon be the EU&rsquo;s newest Member State, comes during a Presidency that has focussed on EU enlargement as a priority.    Croatia will be the first of the Western Balkans countries to accede, and the second of the former Yugoslav republics (Slovenia being the first). Croatian accession will, it is hoped, be an inspiration for the other countries of the Western Balkans, and a demonstration that when prospective members are willing to undertake the onerous measures required, the EU in turn holds to its promises on enlargement.</p><p>  Ireland has been positively associated with Croatia&rsquo;s accession process from the beginning. It was during our Presidency of 2004 that Ireland sought and achieved a single clear decision on granting Croatia candidate status. Croatia will accede to the European Union on 1 July and I will represent the Irish Presidency in Zagreb at the accession celebrations on 30 June for what should be a fitting and happy finale to the Presidency. </p><p>Recognising the importance of engaging with a new member State at an early stage, we have stepped up our bilateral contacts with Croatian in recent months. In addition to meeting with First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pusić, in Brussels at the regular Council meetings, last month Ms. Pusić visited Dublin and held discussions with myself and Minister of State Creighton. I held talks in Dublin last September with Deputy Prime Minister Mr Neven Mimica, who has since been nominated as Croatia&rsquo;s first Commissioner. Prior to this, Minister of State Creighton attended   the Croatia Summit in July 2012 and also met with Foreign Minister Pusić. </p><p>  As Croatia joins the family of members of the European Union, I expect that our relations will continue to strengthen and deepen.</p></reply>

The UK claims sovereignty over Rockall and has sought to formally annex it under its 1972 Island of Rockall Act.While Ireland has not recognised British sovereignty over Rockall, it has never sought to claim sovereignty for itself.  The consistent position of successive Irish Governments has been that Rockall and similar rocks and skerries have no significance for establishing legal claims to mineral rights in the adjacent seabed or to fishing rights in the surrounding seas.     During the course of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which took place from 1973 to 1982, Ireland worked hard to achieve agreement on this principle. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was adopted at the conclusion of the Conference on 10 December 1982, provides at Article 121, paragraph 3 that:  &ldquo;Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.&rdquo;  Rockall falls into precisely this category.</p><p>  In 1988, Ireland and the UK reached agreement on the delimitation of areas of the continental shelf between the two countries, stretching out up to 500 nautical miles from their respective coastlines.  This included the division of the Hatton-Rockall area of continental shelf on which Rockall is situated, although under the terms of the Law of the Sea Convention the location of Rockall was irrelevant to the determination of the boundary.  According to that determination, Rockall is situated to the north of the boundary agreed with the UK in 1988 and lies outside the zone claimed by Ireland.</p><p>  As with any claim to continental shelf lying beyond 200 nautical miles from a state&rsquo;s coast, the UN Convention requires that Ireland and the UK submit their claims for examination to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.  However, the claims to the Hatton-Rockall shelf agreed between Ireland and the UK are not accepted by Iceland or Denmark (on behalf of the Faroe Islands), which make their own claims.</p><p>The four countries have met frequently since 2001 in an effort to resolve the overlapping claims issue,   but have been unable to reach agreement.  In the meantime Ireland, the UK and Denmark have made submissions to the UN Commission in respect of their claims.

This is the profile against which subsequent expenditure is measured. Variations from the planned expenditure pattern can arise.   &euro;497 million has been allocated to Vote 27 for 2013.

I share the Deputy&rsquo;s welcome of Croatia&rsquo;s imminent accession and hope that it will prove to be an inspiration for the other countries of the Western Balkans, including Bosnia and Herzegovina.    Along with international partners, it is the EU's aim to support a stable and viable Bosnia and Herzegovina co-operating peacefully with its neighbours and irreversibly on track towards EU membership. EU membership for Bosnia and Herzegovina is firmly tied to the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the country.</p><p>  The path to EU membership for Bosnia and Herzegovina is clear. The EU has set out its strategy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina in the European Council conclusions of March 2011 and the successive reinforcing conclusions. Since September 2011 the EU has installed a reinforced and comprehensive presence in the country combining the assets of the European Commission and the European External Action Service, through an EUSR office. The EU military force EUFOR ALTHEA remains present in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p><p>  In terms of EU accession, we were encouraged by the launch of a High Level Dialogue on Accession in June 2012 which saw agreement between the political leaders on a roadmap towards accession.</p><p>  However, campaigning in advance of the municipal elections in October last year saw this positive atmosphere eroded. There has been virtually no progress on reforms since then. And the political situation has become more complicated with an attempted reshuffle of the government in the Federation entity.</p><p>  The EU has made great efforts to encourage the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to move forward with reforms. There is obvious disappointment that the efforts that the EU has made in this regard have reached an impasse.  </p><p>  The EU will now need to examine what else can be done and I believe this can best be done in the context of a review of the EU Special Representative&rsquo;s mandate, which I hope to see taken forward by High Representative Ashton in July. </p><p>  However, I must emphasise that while we will do everything in our power to encourage movement on the path to EU integration, this is ultimately a matter for the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The EU cannot impose a solution. The most we can do is use our policies to encourage and facilitate progress.</p></reply>

This refers to people who require support to enable them to live in the community, such as sheltered accommodation for the elderly or the disabled.  The Revenue Commissioners have published guidelines to assist local authorities in identifying special needs accommodation.   Where an LPT liability arises, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, deems all voluntary housing body and local authority residential properties to be in the lowest valuation band for the initial valuation period (2013 to 2016), and also allows such bodies to defer their 2013 LPT liability until 2014.  This is to allow such bodies to put in place arrangements for the payment of the tax and for the valuation of their properties.</p><p>  I am advised by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that, in accordance with section 58 Housing Act 1966, housing authorities are responsible for determining the rents of their dwellings, subject to complying with broad principles laid down by that Department, notably that the rent payable should be related to income and that low-income households should pay a lower proportion of income in rent.  Within these parameters, it is a matter for housing authorities, as an integral part of their housing management functions, to ensure that their rental income reflects, as far as practicable, the cost of managing and maintaining their housing stock.</p><p>  I am further advised that the current arrangements for determining local authority rents will be substantially replaced on the coming into force of section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which predates, and does not refer to, the Local Property Tax legislation.  On enactment of the Housing (Amendment) Bill 2013 I am informed that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will be arranging to make regulations under section 31 re-affirming the principle that rents should be related to household income and composition, and reflecting the requirement that housing authorities should set rent levels that take account, as far as practicable, of the cost of providing works and services to, and managing and maintaining, their rented accommodation.  The Minister also intends to ask the Housing Agency to provide the relevant guidance to housing authorities to assist them in making their rent schemes to ensure that they comply with the these Regulations.</p></reply>

Their debt collection activities are generally covered by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, as amended and the execution of Revenue certificates is specifically provided for in Section 962 of the Taxes Consolidated Act 1997, as amended.    When acting in execution of tax certificates, sheriffs are governed by the general law, which applies to the collection of civil debts of all kinds, and not by the provisions of the Tax Acts. They are not accountable to Revenue as regards the methods and techniques of enforcement but are answerable before the courts for any breach of the civil debt collection law. </p><p>  However, notwithstanding the above, the Sheriffs do operate an agreed Code of Practice in order to provide a non-judicial complaints procedure for taxpayers. The Code is designed to provide an opportunity to resolve disputes without the necessity for the complainant to initiate Court proceedings. The Code also ensures that a taxpayer receives a written response from the relevant Sheriff to any complaint. </p><p>Details of the Code of Practice which are available from the Sheriffs and on Revenue&rsquo;s website www.revenue.ie are set out below.</p><p>  Sheriff&rsquo;s Code of Practice</p><p>1. The Sheriff will treat every taxpayer with courtesy; where practicable, notify the taxpayer in writing of the lodgment of a certificate in the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office; where requested, explain to the taxpayer the purpose of the visit of the Sheriff, Bailiff or other staff; when goods are seized, issue as soon as possible, a written inventory to the taxpayer; furnish the taxpayer with a receipt for monies paid; furnish the taxpayer with an account of the proceeds of the sale of any goods seized.</p><p>2. In return the Sheriff expects that the Taxpayer will pay liabilities to the Sheriff on demand; be prompt in his/her dealings with the Sheriff&rsquo;s office; treat the Sheriff and his staff with courtesy.</p><p>3. Complaints Procedure. If a taxpayer feels aggrieved at the way in which his/her case was handled, then he/she can complain in writing to the Sheriff&rsquo;s office; the Sheriff will investigate any such complaint and respond as promptly as is practicable depending on the specific circumstances of the case; should the taxpayer remain aggrieved after the Sheriff&rsquo;s response, he/she may refer the complaint in writing to the Revenue Commissioners at Enforcement Management Unit, Office of Collector General, Sarsfield House, Limerick. The Revenue Commissioners will examine any such complaint and may request that the Sheriff undertake a further review; should the taxpayer still remain aggrieved at the outcome of the Sheriff review, the complainant may at his/her request be referred to a Joint Standing Committee (JSC) of the Revenue Commissioners and the Sheriffs Association, which is chaired by a neutral Chairman. The JSC will review the issue(s) by means of an examination of all the relevant correspondence and documentation.</p><p>  Where a complaint involves an allegation of criminal behaviour against a sheriff, his agents, or staff, then the Joint Standing Committee shall decline to deal with the case and will inform the person in question in this regard.</p><p>  Finally, referral of any matter to the JSC should not in any way to be taken as a diminution or a substitution for a taxpayer&rsquo;s common law rights, which are not impacted on by availing of the process.</p></reply>

Their audit and tax compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from a possible upsurge in the shadow economy, particularly in times of recession.   Tackling shadow economy activity is an on-going corporate priority for Revenue and a number of national and regional projects are in progress. Measures undertaken by Revenue include: a prioritised focus on those sectors that traditionally have been susceptible to shadow activity specifically cash business, such as the hospitality sector, including bars, nightclubs, fast-food/restaurants and entertainment, and white collar cash, such as doctors, dentists, solicitors, accountants, engineers etc; a focus on other sectors including the construction and rental sectors, and streetscape activities including covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues often on a joint or multi-agency basis with the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and the National Employment Rights Agency (NERA); specifically, in relation Revenue compliance activity on the shadow economy in the sectors set out above, a total of 2,804 audits and 31,638 other interventions were completed in 2012 yielding in excess of &euro;104m.; close consultation and co-operation with the Department of Social Protection. The primary objective of these activities is to uncover either non-declaration<b></b>  or under declaration of income and/or fraudulent DSP claims. A High Level Steering Group with representatives from both Revenue and the Department of Social Protection meet regularly and oversee information exchanges and other areas of co-operation between the departments; multi-agency construction site visits (Revenue, DSP and NERA) are now a feature and the site information provided by the Department of Education and Skills at procurement stage, on their capital expenditure on new and extended school premises, facilitates multi-agency site visits throughout the projects to ensure full compliance with all appropriate legislation and regulation; Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group (HEMG) that provides a forum for the exchange of views on the effectiveness of measures introduced in combating the hidden economy. This group includes representatives from employer and business organisations, trade unions and other Government Departments and agencies. Regional hidden economy liaison groups have been established to facilitate greater local interaction and more immediate responses to insights and issues that may be highlighted.</p><p>  Aside from the HEMG, Revenue meets regularly with other representative bodies that have concerns over shadow economy activities in their particular sectors.  A comprehensive package of measures has been introduced in relation to Excise (Oils) including, requirement for separate licences for auto-fuel traders and marked fuel traders, requirement to have a separate licence for every premises or place at which the fuel concerned is dealt in, and a requirement that a licence must be clearly displayed at the premises or place.  A new return form was introduced for the oil industry providing detailed information on oil movements, thereby facilitating supply chain analysis.  Data from the initial monthly returns are currently being examined and plans to optimise the use of the data are in progress.  In 2012, there were 86 illicit mineral oil and 11 oil laundries seizures resulting in the recovery of a total of 1.1m litres of illicit oil.</p><p>  Revenue's tobacco strategy, &#8220;Strategy On Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011- 2013)&#8221; was published on the Revenue website in June 2011. This three-year strategy is underpinned by annual action plans. During 2012 Revenue's Customs Service seized a total of 95.6m cigarettes in 8,108 seizures and 5,277kg of tobacco in 1,395 seizures.  Revenue regularly proposes legislative measures aimed at curbing shadow activities.  Two recent examples are, firstly, the introduction of on-the spot fines for employers who breach the PAYE Regulations was introduced in 2011 and a comprehensive revamp of the Relevant Contracts Tax system was implemented in 2012.  On the tax collection side, as the Deputy will be aware, Revenue takes action to enforce debt recovery in appropriate cases, including through the use of Sheriff or solicitor enforcement and liquidation of companies.  These interventions have a very strong level playing field dimension.</p><p>  In relation to procurement issues, where the value of a State contract is greater than &euro;10,000, there are procedures in place under Department of Finance Circular 43/2006 that require the successful tenderer to produce a valid Tax Clearance Certificate.  All other payments in excess of &euro;1,000 made by State bodies must also be reported to Revenue annually.</p><p>  On the purchasing side, I presume that the Deputy is referring to consumer protection which is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  However, the Revenue Commissioners regularly advise consumers of the dangers involved in the purchase and consumption of illegal and counterfeit goods, and the use of laundered diesel for example.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners commit significant resources annually to tackling the shadow economy and take the matter very seriously.  I am also satisfied that the approach being taken by the Commissioners consisting of high-profile and multiple interventions in the riskiest sectors, in addition to regular dialogue with the legitimate trade and other Government agencies, has been effective in minimising the impact on the Exchequer.</p></reply>

While the EU VAT Directive and Irish VAT law provide for the possibility of applying a reduced rate of VAT to the supply of certain medical equipment this possibility does not extend to the supply of personal alarms.  Nor is there any provision in VAT law that would make it possible to apply an exemption or the zero rate to the supply of such products.  In the circumstances, the supply of personal alarms is liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%.  The supply of parts and accessories is also liable to VAT at the standard rate.   I would point out that Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order 1981 enables VAT paid on qualifying goods to be refunded where the goods are purchased for the exclusive use of disabled persons suffering a specified degree of disablement.  The Order applies to goods which are aids or appliances, including parts and accessories, which might reasonably be treated as constructed or adapted having regard to the particular disablement of the person.  A personal alarm for a disabled person may qualify for relief under the Order if it may be considered an aid or appliance constructed or adapted for use by a disabled person having regard to the particular disablement of that person.  A Claim Form VAT 61A is available on the Revenue website (www.revenue.ie).</p><p>  In addition, the Deputy may be aware of the Seniors Alert Scheme operated by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which provides grant support for the supply of equipment to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes. The scheme replaced the Scheme of Community Support for Older People in May 2010. The grant assistance is made available through community and voluntary groups registered with the Department.  Grant support is available towards the cost of purchasing and installing monitored personal alarms, as well as additional or replacement pendants. </p><p>  Persons wishing to apply for the grant support should contact the group registered to operate the scheme in their area.  A list of these groups is available from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-11a.253.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061100075#WRE02300"><p>Companies are chargeable to corporation tax on the profits generated from their economic activities after taking account of allowable deductions and reliefs under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA). Ireland has a transparent corporation tax regime that applies a competitive 12.5% rate on a broad base, with limited provision for reliefs or exemptions. There are certain reliefs available to companies, such as loss relief and double taxation relief, which are standard features of corporate tax systems in EU and OECD countries. There are also a small number of targeted reliefs that are aimed at promoting investment, innovation and employment in the economy, including a 25% tax credit for expenditure on research and development and a 3-year tax relief for start-up companies creating new jobs.     Regarding losses, Ireland follows the international norm whereby losses incurred in the course of a business are taken into account in arriving at the appropriate amount of tax that a company should bear.  The availability of relief for losses incurred in a business is in recognition of the fact that a business cycle runs over several years and that it would be unbalanced and unreasonable to tax profits in one year and not allow losses in another. The TCA provides that unrelieved trading losses of a company for an accounting period may be carried forward for offset against trading income of the same trade in future accounting periods. Trading losses carried forward by a company may only be offset against trading income of the same trade and not against any other trading income or profits of the company.  </p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the TCA contains a number of measures to counter the transfer of losses from one company to another for tax avoidance purposes, often referred to as &ldquo;loss buying&rdquo;.  For example, Section 400 of the TCA provides that, where a loss-making trade is transferred from one company to another company in a group situation, the transferred trade is treated as a separate trade distinct from any other trading activities carried on by the company acquiring the trade. Any unused losses forward of the transferred trade are only allowable against profits attributable to that separate trade. This ensures that trading losses of the transferred trade are ring-fenced to that trade and may not be offset against other trading income or profits of the acquiring company.</p><p>  In addition, Section 401 of the TCA provides that where, within a period of 3 years, there is both a change of ownership of a company and a major change in the nature or conduct of the trade carried on by the company (e.g. major change in products, services, customers or markets), trading losses incurred by the company before the change of ownership are not allowable against trading income of the company after the change of ownership. </p><p>  The effect of these provisions to counter &ldquo;loss buying&rdquo; is to restrict the scope for utilising losses for tax avoidance purposes by combining loss-making and profitable business activities. These provisions are kept under review and, if any loopholes or weaknesses that pose a tax risk are identified, I will not hesitate to introduce appropriate legislative amendments.</p></reply>

In the first instance, ex-gratia payments made by an employer to an employee or office holder at the date of cessation or retirement are not subject to Capital Gains Tax.</p><p>  Section 123 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 imposes (subject to a number of exemptions and reliefs provided under section 201 and Schedule 3 of that Act) a charge to income tax in respect of ex-gratia or gratuitous payments made by employers on the termination of an employment, where the payment would not otherwise be chargeable to income tax under general income tax law.  </p><p>  Statutory redundancy payments are exempt from income tax.  In addition, ex-gratia redundancy payments or retirement gratuities in excess of the statutory redundancy amount are exempt from income tax up to certain limits as set out  (i) a basic exemption of &euro;10,160 plus &euro;765 per complete year of actual service; (ii) a further exemption of up to &euro;10,000 where the individual is not a member of an occupational pension scheme or irrevocably gives up the right to receive a lump sum from that scheme.  If a lump sum is paid from such an  occupational pension scheme then the exemption of &euro;10,000 is reduced by the amount of that sum. This additional exemption  is only available where 10 years have elapsed since any previous claim for this exemption was made; or  (iii) Standard Capital Superannuation Benefit i.e. 1/15th of the person&rsquo;s annual income (average of the last three years) for each year of employment less any tax-free lump sum which is received or receivable under any approved or statutory pension scheme.</p><p>  It is open to the taxpayer to choose whichever tax treatment is most beneficial.  In addition to the exemptions at (i) and (ii), or (iii) above, where an individual is liable to tax on any part of his or her ex-gratia payment, Top Slicing Relief (TSR) may also be claimed.  This effectively applies the average effective rate of tax which applied for the previous 3 years of assessment in place of the marginal rate of tax on the taxable element of any ex-gratia payment. Finance Act 2013 abolished TSR from 1 January 2013 where the gross ex-gratia payment made is &euro;200,000 or more.</p><p>  A Commission on Taxation recommendation that a limit of &euro;200,000 be placed on the maximum tax-free element of an ex-gratia payment made in respect of termination or change in conditions of an employment or office was implemented in Finance Act 2011.  This limit is a lifetime cap and applies to all exemptions or reliefs claimed in respect of termination payments. This cap however, did not apply to ex-gratia payments made on death or disability which are provided for separately. As regards such payments a maximum lifetime tax-free limit of &euro;200,000 where the payment is made solely on account of disability of, or injury to an employee or director, was implemented in Finance Act 2013. </p><p>  The amount that can be paid as a tax-free ex-gratia payment is affected by a number of different factors including length of service, remuneration levels in the 36 months prior to the cessation date and the recipient&rsquo;s entitlements under the terms of their approved pension scheme. Since 2011, the overall maximum of tax-free entitlements is capped at &euro;200,000.</p><p>  As demonstrated, there have been a number of changes to the tax code in this area in recent years.  As with all tax reliefs and exemptions, they will continue to be subject to review as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.</p></reply>

The legislation specifies that where a person satisfies the Revenue Commissioners that s/he is a Disabled Driver who complies with all the conditions of the Disabled Drivers Scheme, that person shall be entitled to relief in respect of a vehicle with an engine capacity of up to but not greater than 2,000 c.c.

These exemptions and reliefs apply, for example, in relation to income tax and corporation tax on trading income and investment income and to capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax and stamp duty.  There are, in addition, a number of VAT exempt activities in which charitable organisations could engage, such as the provision of education or hospital care.   </p><p>  As these exemptions and reliefs apply to all qualifying charitable organisations rather than specifically to religious organisations Revenue does not generally maintain statistical data in respect of the entitlement of religious organisations to, or the use by them of, the various exemptions.  However, a body applying to the Revenue Commissioners for charitable tax exemption under section 207 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (relating to rental and investment income) is required, as part of the application process, to indicate under which of the following charitable purposes the application is being made:</p><p>  - Relief of Poverty;</p><p>  - Advancement of Education;</p><p>  - Advancement of Religion;</p><p>  - Other works of a charitable nature beneficial to the community</p><p>  Of the bodies which are currently listed as being exempt, a total of 1,160 cite religion as their main or principal object.  In that regard, however, some religious organisations would have been granted the exemption in respect of other main activities, for example, relief of poverty or advancement of education, and would be categorised under those headings rather than under religion.  Accordingly, this figure does not necessarily fully reflect the number of religious organisations which are exempt under section 207.  The Commissioners publish a list of all bodies which have been granted exemption under section 207 which can be accessed on the Revenue website at <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>. </p></reply>

In order to qualify for this relief a charitable trust must be for either: </p><p>- The relief of poverty;</p><p>- The advancement of religion;</p><p>- The advancement of education; or</p><p>- Other purposes beneficial to the community.</p><p>  In addition, the charity must have been authorised by the Revenue Commissioners as an eligible charity and hold charitable exempt status for at least two years.</p><p>  Religious organisations in the State hold charitable tax exemption under the category of &quot;advancement of religion&quot;.  Parishes within a diocese are covered by the tax exemption granted to that diocese and, therefore, are eligible to submit claims for a refund of tax under the scheme.  Relevant bodies of other religious organisations would also qualify for charitable tax exemption.</p><p>  Bodies granted charitable tax exemption are subject to periodic risk-focused review by the Revenue Commissioners towards ensuring that the terms of the exemption continue to be fulfilled.  Claims submitted by charitable bodies for a refund of tax are examined by the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that the applicants and the donations meet with the terms and conditions of the Donations Scheme.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, following a public consultation on proposed changes to the scheme of tax relief for donations to approved bodies, I announced changes to the scheme in the recent Budget.

I understand that the idea is that the Spanish State will guarantee the loan and will supervise loan disbursement and supervision through the banking system.  While this is a very interesting concept, any guarantee by the State in respect of borrowings by SMEs would need to be carefully considered.  However, Deputies can rest assured that my Department is closely monitoring developments.   </p><p>  The Irish Government is very conscious of the need to encourage a vibrant and well-resourced SME sector.  As part of the redeployment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) towards commercial investment in Ireland, the NPRF Commission announced on 9 January 2013 its commitment to a suite of three long-term funds to provide equity, credit and restructuring investment to SME and mid-sized corporates.  The NPRF has completed commitments of &euro;125 million to the SME Equity Fund, &euro;50 million to the SME Turnaround Fund and &euro;175 million - &euro;325 million (depending on the amount of third-party investment raised) to the SME Credit Fund.  As Deputies will be aware, the Government is preparing legislation to establish the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), through which resources from the NPRF will be channelled towards productive investment on commercial terms in the Irish economy.  The ISIF will seek to leverage and maximise its resources by attracting private sector co-investment.</p></reply>

I am further informed that this number is now in excess of 1.55 million.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Commissioners' focus is on processing the Returns, dealing with correspondence, telephone calls and payment processing.  It is therefore not possible at this time to provide the details requested by the Deputy until the Revenue Commissioners have had time to carry out the necessary analysis of the returns filed and payments. </p><p>  For completeness sake, the Deputy should note that in light of the arrangements provided for local authorities and social housing associations in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013, discussions are taking place on the most practical approach to securing LPT returns from those bodies.  Where local authorities and social housing associations are liable for LPT, payment is not due until on or before 1 January 2014.</p><p>  I can confirm that the proceeds of the LPT will go into the Central Fund.  Section 157 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 provides that, commencing in 2014, the Minister for Finance shall pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the LPT, including any interest paid thereon, paid into the Central Fund during that year.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has recently confirmed that the Government has accepted, in principle, a policy position that from next year 80% of all Local Property Tax (LPT) receipts should be retained within the local authority areas where the properties are based.  </p><p>  From 1 January 2015 local authorities will have discretion to vary the rate by 15% above or below the national central rate.  The national central rate of LPT is 0.18% for properties valued up to &euro;1 million with the liability calculated based on the mid-point of the appropriate band.  The national central rates for properties valued over &euro;1 million are 0.18% on the first &euro;1 million and 0.25% on the excess value over &euro;1 million with no banding applied.  The Government has committed not to amend the national central rates for the lifetime of this Government.</p></reply>

If a residential property is suitable for use as a dwelling but is unoccupied, it is still liable to LPT based on the valuation of the property.  However, if the property is not suitable for use as a dwelling, it is not liable for LPT.    LPT is a self-assessed tax.  If a property owner considers that her or his property is not suitable for use as a dwelling, s/he should notify the Revenue Commissioners without delay and arrange to provide relevant supporting documentation; for example, photographic evidence, a report from a suitably qualified person such as a surveyor or an engineer.  Based on the information provided by the property owner, Revenue will consider the claim and make a decision on the matter. </p><p>  Each case will be considered on its own merits and it is therefore not possible to provide a prescriptive list of criteria that would need to be met for a property to be deemed unsuitable for use as a dwelling.  However, a property owner should consider whether the property is habitable by reference to the structure of the building, including whether the property has a roof, windows and doors, sanitary facilities, and services (water or electricity supply turned off or temporarily disconnected would not necessarily mean that a residential property is uninhabitable). </p><p>  The deadline for filing LPT Returns has now passed and I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that later this month they will begin writing to customers who have not met their LPT obligations.  Where a customer has not filed his or her LPT Return, Revenue will pursue collection of the Revenue Estimate of LPT as notified in the letter that accompanied the LPT Return.  A range of collection options will be utilised by Revenue, including mandatory deduction at source from salary or occupational pension.  Therefore, it is most important that any property owner who has not yet filed their LPT return, on the basis that they consider that the property is not suitable for use as a dwelling, should contact Revenue immediately via the LPT Helpline at 1890 200 255, if they have not already done so.</p></reply>

However, by way of general information, the following may be of relevance.  Local Property Tax (LPT) is a self-assessed tax and is chargeable in respect of a building, or a part of a building, that is in use, or suitable for use, as a dwelling.  A single building may contain several separate residential properties within it, for example. a building containing apartments.  Where an individual residential property within a building is suitable for use as dwelling in its own right, i.e. a self- contained dwelling, it should be valued as a single residential property for LPT purposes.  In the example of a block of apartments each apartment would be treated as a separate residential property for the purposes of LPT and an LPT Return should be filed for each apartment.  Where a building contains units that are not suitable for use as dwellings in their own right, such as a bedsit, the building as a whole should be valued for LPT purposes and one LPT Return can be filed.    </p><p>  Whilst the strict legal position is that any self-contained dwelling, such as a granny flat, is treated as a separate residential property that will incur a separate LPT liability, Revenue recognises that certain types of dwelling that are an integral part of a larger building may be difficult to value and sell on the open market.  Therefore Revenue will give a liable person the option of valuing a granny flat as part of the overall building where the liable person in relation to both parts of the building is the same.  However, where there is a different liable person in relation to the granny flat and the rest of the building, the granny flat should be valued separately for LPT purposes.  This treatment also applies to other similar types of dwelling that are an integral part of the overall building such as converted garages and side extensions.	</p></reply>

It applies to a residential property which is not used as the owner&rsquo;s sole or main residence, with limited exemptions.  The Local Property Tax (LPT) is payable in respect of all residential properties, subject to certain exemptions.  It is administered by the Revenue Commissioners.  Liability for the LPT arises where a person owns a residential property on the liability date which is 1 May 2013 for the year 2013 and, for subsequent years, 1 November in the preceding year (that is, the liability date for 2014 is 1 November 2013).  The tax will be based on the chargeable value (market value) of a residential property on the valuation date.   </p><p>  The inter-Departmental Group chaired by Dr. Don Thornhill on the design of a property tax (the &ldquo;Thornhill Group&rdquo;) recommended that the NPPR should be absorbed into the LPT as a separate supplemental tax, in addition to the LPT at the standard level applying to non-principal private residences.  The Government did not accept this recommendation.  The NPPR Charge will be collected in 2013, when a half-year LPT applies, but will be discontinued thereafter.  The Government decided to extend the NPPR Charge into 2013 to ensure as smooth a transition as possible for local authorities pending the introduction of the full LPT.  As the Government had decided that the NPPR Charge would only apply for one further year, it made sense for the NPPR Charge and the LPT to be administered separately.</p><p>  As set out in the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, liability to pay the NPPR is determined on the basis of ownership of the property in question on the &quot;liability date&quot;, which is 31 March for 2013.  The LPT does not come into effect until 1 July 2013. </p><p>  The Household Charge and the NPPR charge co-existed in 2012 and certain properties would have been liable to both charges.	</p></reply>

I previously outlined in my response to Parliamentary Question No 74 of 30 May 2013 (26457/13) that the Revenue Commissioners had confirmed that, at the end of the extended LPT filing deadline on 29 May 2013, 1,539,822 LPT Returns had been filed.  I am further informed that this number is now in excess of 1.55million.</p><p>  I understand that the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners recently advised the Joint Oireachtas Commitee on Finance and Public Service Reform that over 400,000 LPT returns were filed in the final few days.  She also advised that over 150,000 work items relating to the LPT register need to be processed, including for example correspondence and emails.  Given these volumes, processing returns and work items will take some time to complete.  Even if it were practicable to do the detailed analysis required to answer the Deputies questions now, until a significant proportion of this work has been completed, the analysis would not be very sound.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they will make relevant data publicly available as soon as possible.  </p><p>  The Budget estimate prepared by my Department for Local Property Tax projected an overall yield of &euro;250 million in 2013 and &euro;500 million in 2014, and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are confident that these estimates will be achieved.  At the end of May over &euro;121m had already been transferred by Revenue to the Exchequer, which is a very significant sum given that payment of the tax is not due until 1 July 2013.  Further payments will be collected between July and December 2013 as the various phased, and other, payment options available to property owners are met.  The Deputies will be aware that the Finance Local Property Tax (Amendment) Act 2013 provided that payments for 2013 from local authorities and social housing associations will not be due until on or before 1 January 2014. </p></reply>

As a general rule, I indicated that, based on such case law, companies are resident in Ireland for tax purposes if they are managed and controlled here. Our tax legislation does not define what constitutes management and control of a company for the purposes of determining a company's residence.  It is determined based on fact and case law precedent.  The long-standing cases in which the principles covering management and control that have been developed by the courts include</p><p><i>De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd v Howe</i>   5TC198</p><p><i>American Thread Co v Joyce</i>   6TC163</p><p><i>Todd v Egyptian Delta Land &amp;amp; Investment Co Ltd</i>   14 TC 119</p><p><i>  De Beers Consolidated Mines v Howe</i>   5 TC 198 is a leading case on company residence.  The principle that emerged in that case was that a company's residence is where the central management and control actually abides.</p><p>  The Irish Courts, in the case of <i>WJ Tipping (Inspector of Taxes) v Louis Jeancard</i>   11ITR 68, cited and confirmed the principles established in the cases referred to above.</p><p>  Other cases in which the principles governing company residence were developed include </p><p><i>Bullock v Unit Construction Co Ltd</i>   38 TC 712</p><p><i>Union Corporation Ltd v IRC</i>   34 TC 269</p><p><i>Wood v Holden</i>   CA [2006]</p><p>  Based on the decided cases, factors to be taken into account in establishing where the company's  central management and control lie include, where the important questions of company policy are determined, where the majority of directors reside, where the negotiation of major contracts is undertaken and where the company's head office is located. </p><p>  In summary, case law provides us with guidance on the principles underlying company residence and where the central management and control of the company actually abides is particularly significant.  Where that central management and control is exercised is a question of fact.  All relevant factors, taken together, have to be taken into account in determining the residence of a company.</p></reply>

A list of the bodies that qualify for the scheme is available on Revenue's website: <i>www.revenue.ie</i> at the following link: <i>http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/authorised-charities-resident.html.</i></p><p>In relation to donations made prior to 1/1/2013 the precise arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations varied depending on whether the donor, was a PAYE taxpayer only, a chargeable person subject to self-assessment or a company. For a PAYE only donor, the relief was given on a &ldquo;grossed up&rdquo; basis to the eligible charity or approved body, as the case may be, rather than by way of a separate claim to tax relief by the donor. In the case of a self-assessed donor, that individual claimed the relief and there was no grossing up arrangement. In the case of a company, a deduction was claimed for a donation as if it were a trading expense. The Finance Act 2013 has introduced a number of amendments to the scheme, which are effective from 1 Jan 2013, including the alignment of treatment for PAYE and Self Assessed donors, the introduction of a 31% blended rate and the capping of eligible donations at &euro;1m.</p><p>In regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s request for details on the amount of money paid to each Charity under Section 848A and the percentage rejection rate for each Charity, Revenue has advised me that its obligation to observe confidentiality precludes it from disclosing such information.  However, Revenue has provided details in the table below of the total amounts refunded under the scheme to approved bodies during 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012. Accurate data for 2013 will not be available until the end of the year.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Amount refunded</th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>&euro;31.5m</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;30.2m</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;26.3m</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;25.0m</td></tr></table></p><p>In regard to the assessment of claims made by Charities, such claims are individually checked to ensure they fulfil the conditions of the scheme as listed below:</p><p>- That the donation is not less than &euro;250 for the specific year;</p><p>- That the donation is in the form of cash and/or designated securities and does not give any benefit to the donor;</p><p>- That the Charity is claiming the relief on contributions made by PAYE-only individuals;</p><p>- That the claim does not include donations from individuals who are either fully or partially on self-assessment;</p><p>- That if the donor is an employee or member of the Charity, tax relief on the contribution is restricted to 10% of the total income of the individual for the relevant year of assessment;</p><p>- That sufficient tax was paid by the donor to cover the tax relief allowed to the Charity.</p><p>Finally, officials from the Revenue Commissioners attend regular meetings with the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group to discuss a range of issues.

In addition, it is also assumed that the threshold for the proposed new income tax rates mentioned by the Deputy would not alter the existing standard rate band structure applying to single and widowed persons, to lone parents and married couples.  On that basis, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2013 incomes, of the introduction of the new income tax rates would be of the order of &euro;365 million, &euro;415 million and &euro;470 million respectively.</p><p>  The above yields have been calculated on the basis of three separate alternative proposals and are rounded to the nearest five million.

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that while there is no reliable estimate of the scale of the problem, they recognize that it represents a significant threat to the exchequer and to the legitimate trade.  Revenue collects some &euro;1.1 billion annually in excise duty from road diesel so the potential for loss of tax revenue from fuel laundering is very significant.   For these reasons, Revenue has made action against fuel laundering one of its priorities and is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem.  This strategy includes the following elements:</p><p>- The licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of the fuel criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market;</p><p>- A new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders in October 2012, which is designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering;</p><p>- New requirements in relation to fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were introduced to ensure data are available to assist in supply chain analysis;</p><p>- Following a significant investment in the required IT systems, new supply chain controls were introduced from January 2013.  These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.  Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution that will support follow-up enforcement action where necessary;</p><p>- An intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations; and</p><p>- Following discussions with HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs in the UK on regulatory measures to tackle the problem, the two administrations signed a Memorandum of Understanding in May 2012 on a joint approach to finding a more effective marker for use in both jurisdictions and an Invitation to Make Submissions was published in June 2012. By the deadline in November 2012, 12 submissions had been received and these are currently being evaluated.</p><p>  Revenue's enforcement strategy in the fuel sector has already yielded significant results. In the past two years 96 filling stations were closed for breaches of the licensing regulations. Since the beginning of 2010, 29 oil laundries were detected and closed and 13 oil tankers and 60 vehicles were seized.  In the same period over 2.5 million<font color="#0000FF"> </font>litres of fuel were seized.</p></reply>

A statutory objective set out in the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 requires the Bank to carry out '&amp;#8230;the proper and effective regulation of financial service providers and markets, while ensuring that the best interests of consumers of financial services are protected'.</p><p>  The Bank's Financial Regulation Directorates receive various services including premises, human resources administration, accounting, internal audit, statistical and information technology services from support services directorates in the Central Bank. The cost of these services in 2012 was &euro;38.2 million.</p><p>  At the end of 2012, 686 of the Central Bank's staff were assigned to financial regulation activities.  Total income for 2012 was &euro;120.029 million and total expenses for 2012 were &euro;110.641 million.  In the context of the Public Service Reform Plan a critical review was undertaken of the possible integration of the regulatory function of the Pensions Board with the Central Bank. The review recommended against absorbing the functions of the Pensions Board into the Central Bank.</p><p><b>Registry of Credit Unions</b></p><p>  The Registry of Credit Unions (RCU) is responsible for the registration, regulation and supervision of credit unions.  In recognition of the unique nature of credit unions, a statutory position of Registrar of Credit Unions was explicitly created within the Central Bank of Ireland to assume responsibility for the regulation of credit unions.  Under the Credit Union Act 1997 (as amended) the functions of the Registrar of Credit Unions are to regulate credit unions with a view to the:</p><p>- Protection by each credit union of the funds of its members; and the</p><p>- Maintenance of the financial stability and well-being of credit unions generally.</p><p>  The Registry of Credit Unions aim is to promote a financially stable credit union sector that operates in a transparent and fair manner and safeguards its members' funds. It uses a combination of off-site analysis and on-site inspections in carrying out the regulatory process.</p><p>  The number of staff engaged in the work of the Registry of Credit Unions in 2012 was 61.7.</p></reply>

A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits as well as profits from certain petroleum, mining or land trading activities, while capital gains are chargeable at a 33% rate.   In recent times, there has been a consistent Government policy that our competitive corporation tax rate should be applied to a wide tax base.  Therefore, all companies in Ireland are subject to the same rates on their profits which are generated in Ireland.</p><p>  The transparent and indiscriminate nature of our corporation tax regime is one of its biggest strengths, both domestically and internationally.  It is therefore important that this rate applies whatever size and whatever sector a company operates in.

However, the following general information may be useful.  An exemption from the charge to Local Property Tax (LPT) is available where a property that was previously occupied by a person as her or his sole or main residence has been vacated by the person for 12 months or more due to long term mental or physical infirmity.  An exemption may also be obtained where the period is less than 12 months, if a doctor is satisfied that the person is unlikely at any stage to return to the property.  In both cases, the exemption only applies where the property is not occupied by any other person.  The exemption would not apply if the vacated property was jointly owned with others, as the owners are jointly and severally liable for payment of the tax.</p><p>  If a property is exempt from LPT the property owner must still complete and submit an LPT Return indicating which category of exemption is satisfied.</p><p>  For LPT purposes a residential property is defined as any building or structure (or part of a building) which is used as, or is suitable for use as, a dwelling.  If a residential property is suitable for use as a dwelling but is unoccupied, it is still liable to LPT based on the valuation of the property.  However, if the property is not suitable for use as a dwelling, it is not liable for LPT.</p><p>  LPT is a self-assessed tax.  If a property owner considers that her or his property is not suitable for use as a dwelling, s/he should notify the Revenue Commissioners without delay and arrange to provide relevant supporting documentation &ndash; for example, photographic evidence, or a report from a suitably qualified person such as a surveyor or an engineer.  Based on the information provided by the property owner, Revenue will consider the claim and make a decision on the matter.</p><p>  Each case will be considered on its merits and it is therefore not possible to provide a prescriptive list of criteria that would need to be met for a property to be deemed unsuitable for use as a dwelling. However, a property owner should consider whether the property is habitable by reference to the structure of the building; including whether the property has a roof, windows and doors, sanitary facilities, and services (water or electricity supply turned off or temporarily disconnected would not necessarily mean that a residential property is uninhabitable).</p><p>  For a property that is in a poor state of repair, but still occupied or suitable for occupation, the property owner&rsquo;s honest valuation of his/her property on 1 May 2013 will hold for LPT purposes for 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and will not be affected by any repairs or improvements made to the property, or any changes in property prices generally, during this period.  The next LPT valuation date is 1 November 2016 and any improvements made by that date, or any other factors that may impact on value, should be reflected in the property owner&rsquo;s valuation of his/her property on that date and this new valuation will form the basis of LPT liability for the period from 2017 to 2020.  A property that was not liable to LPT on 1 May 2013 on the basis that it was unsuitable for use as a dwelling will not be liable to LPT for the years 2013 to 2016.  If such a property were to be refurbished to make it suitable for use as a dwelling by 1 November 2016 then it will be liable to LPT for 2017 and subsequent years.</p></reply>

At an international level, Ireland has been strongly supportive of the full implementation of debt relief and, where appropriate, debt cancellation.</p><p>  Ireland has contributed its full financial share of over &euro;116m to the two main multilateral initiatives to address debt relief in the developing world, the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.  The MDRI came into effect on 1 July 2006 and provides for cancellation of eligible debt from the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund for many of the world&rsquo;s poorer and most indebted countries. The HIPC initiative, which is implemented by the World Bank and the IMF, was launched in 1996 in order to reduce the debt burden of qualifying countries to sustainable levels but does not involve cancellation of debt. The aim of these initiatives is to relieve these countries from the burden of servicing debt and assist them in making progress on the UN Millennium Development Goals, with the overall objective of halving global poverty by 2015.    Ireland will remain actively engaged in ensuring that international commitments to dealing with the debt burden on developing countries are met.</p><p>  In relation to Zimbabwe, I understand that it has substantial debt arrears but that the relative political stability of recent years and the adoption of economic reforms has created a climate conducive to ongoing re-engagement and support on the part of the multilateral agencies and international financial institutions including in the areas of debt audit and loan evaluations. Although Zimbabwe is in arrears on its concessional borrowings from the IMF, the IMF recently restored Zimbabwe&rsquo;s eligibility for technical assistance.  The World Bank, the Board of which recently approved re-engagement with Zimbabwe, has also been working with Zimbabwe alongside other development partners such as the African Development Bank.  </p><p>  Ireland was represented at a meeting in London earlier this year of the informal international group known as the &ldquo;Friends of Zimbabwe&rdquo;.  The communiqu&eacute; of that meeting recognised the importance of Zimbabwe tackling its external debts and welcomed progress by the Government of National Unity and the IMF towards a Staff Monitored Program.     Any such program would of course include analysis of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s debt sustainability.</p></reply>

Its mission is to help implement the EU's policy objectives by financing sound business projects. To finance these projects, the Bank borrows on the capital markets, passing on the benefit of its low borrowing cost due to its high credit rating to Member States. The priority objectives for the EIB&rsquo;s lending activities set out in the Bank's operational plan are:   - Support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);</p><p>- Economic and Social Cohesion and Convergence (i.e. supporting the economically less developed regions of Europe);</p><p>- Protecting and improving the environment and promoting sustainable communities;</p><p>- Implementation of the knowledge economy;</p><p>- Development of Trans-European Networks (TENs); and</p><p>- Supporting the establishment of a sustainable, competitive and secure energy supply.</p><p>  The Board of Directors of the EIB has sole power to take decisions in respect of loans, guarantees and borrowings. As well as seeing that the Bank is properly run, it ensures that the Bank is managed in keeping with the provisions of the Treaty and the Statute and with the general directives laid down by the Governors. The Board of Directors approve loans, guarantees and borrowings etc. at their Board Meetings for projects which come to the Board once they have met certain criteria.</p><p>  In relation to capital investment projects, individual Ministers are responsible for projects and programmes in their areas, within an overall framework set out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Decisions on the funding arrangements for those projects are primarily the responsibility of individual Departments, in consultation with the National Development Finance Agency.</p><p>  I am aware that for many farmers, concerns regarding access to credit and flexibility around loan repayments have been a significant issue. I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been in regular contact with the banks, co-ops and feed merchants to urge flexibility and co-operation at this challenging time.  Both banks and co-ops have asked farmers to contact them to discuss the terms that are available and have indicated that they will show flexibility on the basis that the longer term outlook for farming is positive and prices are strong across most areas.</p></reply>

The question of introducing a rebate scheme for users of marked gas oil has been addressed in previous parliamentary debates.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners, who have responsibility for the collection of mineral oil product taxation and for tackling illicit trade in mineral oil products, that marked gas oil has a wide range of uses such as the propulsion of trains, the operation of agricultural, construction and industrial machinery, commercial sea-navigation (including fishing) and for commercial and home heating purposes.  Any change in the existing system would therefore impact across a wide range of users.   </p><p>  A change to a rebate system would involve the establishment of an expensive repayments system.  This would give rise to significant costs and place an administrative burden on oil traders, users and the Revenue Commissioners.  It would also pose significant cash-flow costs for those currently using marked gas oil.  In addition, repayment schemes are vulnerable to abuse and the introduction of a wide-ranging scheme such as that proposed would not necessarily offer greater security against fraud than the current arrangements.  For these reasons, I am not proposing the introduction of a rebate system of this nature.</p><p>  Revenue recognises that the laundering of the marker from marked gas oil represents a significant threat to the exchequer and to the legitimate trade.  For this reason, Revenue has made action against this illegal activity one of its priorities and is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem.  Revenue's strategy includes the following elements:</p><p>- The licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of the fuel criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market;</p><p>- A new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders in October 2012, which is designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering;</p><p>- New requirements in relation to fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were introduced to ensure data are available to assist in supply chain analysis;</p><p>- Following a significant investment in the required IT systems, new supply chain controls were introduced from January 2013. These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.  Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution that will support follow-up enforcement action where necessary;</p><p>- An intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations; and</p><p>- Following discussions with HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs in the UK on regulatory measures to tackle the problem, the two administrations signed a Memorandum of Understanding in May 2012 on a joint approach to finding a more effective marker for use in both jurisdictions and an Invitation to Make Submissions was published in June 2012. By the deadline in November 2012, 12 submissions had been received and these are currently being evaluated.</p><p>  Revenue's enforcement strategy in the fuel sector has already yielded significant results.  In the past two years 96 filling stations were closed for breaches of the licensing regulations.  Since the beginning of 2010, 29 oil laundries were detected and closed and 13 oil tankers and 60 vehicles were seized.  In the same period over 2.5 million<font color="#0000FF"> </font>litres of fuel were seized.</p></reply>

This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets. The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a 15% tax on the commission charged. In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers&rsquo; and remote betting intermediaries&rsquo; licences.    The Betting (Amendment) Bill, which will establish the regulatory framework for the licensing regime, was published in July last year.  Since that date work has been continuing by officials of my Department and Revenue on the drawing up of a number of amendments to the Bill to strengthen enforcement measures.  It is my intention, given the number of amendments, to go back to Government in the very near future for approval to republish the Bill.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that under the EU Technical Standards and Regulations Directive it will be necessary to show the published Bill to the EU Commission and other Member States, which will take a minimum of 3 months for clearance. However, I hope to use this time to progress the Bill through the D&aacute;il subject to scheduling agreement between the Whips.</p><p>  The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted.</p></reply>

Ireland assumed the Director position in May of 2012 and holds this position until May of 2015 &ndash; over that period, Denmark holds the post of Alternate Director.  After May of 2015, the positions reverse for a further three years.   The current Irish representative on the Board of Directors of the EBRD is Mr Eoin Ryan who was initially appointed to the position of Alternate Director on 12 February 2010 and he took over the Director post in May 2012. His appointment on the Board was due to end on 1 July 2013. However, Mr Ryan&rsquo;s tenure is being extended until 31 July 2013. Thereafter I have nominated Mr Sean Donlon to replace him.

Finance Act 2013 was passed into law on 27th March and section 17 of the Act, which makes provision for the pre-retirement access to AVCs announced in the Budget, has effect from that date. Section 17 introduces a new section 782A into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides members of occupational pension schemes with a three-year window of opportunity to draw down, on a once-off basis, up to 30% of the accumulated value of certain AVCs made by them, including additional voluntary PRSA contributions made to AVC PRSAs. Where AVCs are subject to a pension adjustment order, both parties to the order may exercise the option independently in respect of their respective &ldquo;share&rdquo; of the AVCs.</p><p>  The procedures set out in the legislation for exercising the AVC access option are straight forward and I have outlined these hereunder. However, in addition to these procedures, I am aware from discussions which my Department and the Revenue Commissioners have had with various pension industry representative bodies, that the administrators of AVC funds have been putting administrative procedures and systems in place to facilitate the access option at an operational level. </p><p>  The likelihood is, of course, that an individual contemplating availing of the option will firstly contact his pension fund administrator by phone or email to establish what he or she needs to do. In that regard, the legislation requires the individual to give an irrevocable written instruction to the administrator of the fund that he or she wishes to avail of the option. Provided the individual qualifies for the encashment option, the administrator acts on the instruction by determining the value of the AVC fund and paying an amount, not exceeding 30% of the value, to the individual subject to deduction of the appropriate amount of tax. The amount paid is treated as emoluments to which Schedule E applies and tax is collected at source under the PAYE system. The legislation requires the administrator to deduct tax at the higher rate of 41%, unless the administrator has received from Revenue a tax credit certificate in respect of the individual. The payments are specifically exempt from USC and PRSI.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in advance of any payment of AVCs being made, the individual exercising the option should contact his or her Revenue Office for a Certificate of Tax Credits and Standard Rate Cut-off point in respect of the AVC payment. It may be the case that the pension fund administrator will contact Revenue on behalf of the individual, but where the individual is applying directly to Revenue he or she would need to advise Revenue of the pension fund administrator's registered number (i.e. employer number) so that Revenue can forward the Certificate to the correct administrator. The Certificate will indicate the Standard Rate Cut-off Point and tax credits, if any, appropriate to the AVC access payment and facilitate the deduction of the correct amount of tax by the administrator.</p></reply>

Penalty determinations are not published where the amount of the penalty determined by a court does not exceed 15% of the tax due in respect of which the penalty is computed, where the aggregate of the tax due, the interest on that tax and the penalty determined by a court does not exceed &euro;30,000 or where the taxpayer has, in advance of any Revenue inquiry or investigation, voluntarily furnished complete information relating to and full particulars of the previously undisclosed tax liabilities and paid the additional liability due.</p><p>  Revenue carries out a range of tax and duty compliance programmes on an annual basis that are focused on the areas of greatest risk.  In 2012, Revenue continued to deploy resources to tackling tax evasion in high-risk sectors and carried out over 9,000 audits and more than 150,000 risk management interventions which between them yielded approx. &euro;470 million.  483 taxpayers were published in 2012, in respect of a yield of &euro;98.46m and details can be found on the Revenue website, www.revenue.ie.</p><p>Revenue programmes are focused on achieving maximum compliance with tax and duty legislation The Code of Practice for Revenue Audit (Chapter 2) outlines in detail the opportunities available to non-compliant taxpayers to regularise tax and duty defaults, including the position in relation to when publication arises. The Code of Practice for Revenue Audit is available online from the Revenue website <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>.</p><p>  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there has been no tax amnesty in recent years.  While there is no specific exemption from publication associated with tax amnesties, if a taxpayer voluntarily furnished complete information to Revenue in relation to tax defaults, publication would not arise.</p></reply>

The levy will operate for a period of 4 years only (2011 to 2014) and the legislative provisions giving effect to the levy (section 4 of Finance (No 2) Act 2011) were specifically drafted to reflect this.

This report, entitled &#8220;Measuring the impact of the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>: Was the VAT reduction passed on and were jobs created?&#8221; contains detailed information with regard to the impact of the 9% VAT rate on prices and employment numbers, and is available on my Department's website.  Using statistics from the Central Statistics Office, the report indicates that an additional 6,200 jobs had been created in the accommodation and food sectors from Q2 2011 to Q2 2012, an increase of 6%.  While there are other factors that will have impacted on employment rates in these sectors, I am in no doubt that the 9% VAT rate has contributed in no small part to these employment gains.  Furthermore, these figures may understate the positive impact of the 9% rate, as other comparable sectors experienced declines in employment number over the period concerned, which indicates that employment in the accommodation and food sectors may also have declined without the introduction of the 9% rate.  With regard to prices in the tourism sector, the response to the 9% VAT rate has been positive and the report indicates that the VAT reduction was for the most part passed on to consumers.  With regard to the impact of the 9% on tourism, while tourism numbers fluctuated over the period since the introduction of the 9% in July 2011, expenditure by overseas travellers to Ireland in 2012 increased by &euro;37 million from 2011; this excludes transport and air travel costs which are exempt from VAT.</p></reply>

Each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes and, therefore, cohabiting couples cannot file joint assessment tax returns or share their tax credits and tax bands in the same manner as married couples.  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v</i>. Attorney General (1980), which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  However, a cohabiting couple where both partners are working get, in total, the same tax credits as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership (i.e. &euro;3,300).  In addition, the same amount of income is subject to tax at the 20% rate (i.e. &euro;32,800 each).  This equates to the &euro;65,600 threshold in the case of a married couple or couple in a civil partnership.  If both cohabitants earn in excess of the standard rate band (i.e. &euro;32,800), then they both pay tax at 41% on any income in excess of &euro;32,800.  Married couples or couples in a civil partnership where both work get the same treatment.  The difference between the two groups is the ability of married couples or civil partners to transfer certain tax credits such as the personal/married credits and part of the tax bands, i.e. the tax band of &euro;65,600 available to married couples or couples in a civil partnership with two incomes in 2013 is transferable between spouses up to a maximum of &euro;41,800.  This is of benefit where one of the individuals earns less than the 20% tax threshold of &euro;32,800 or where one of the individuals has no income.  The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.  However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples.  This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland <i>v</i>. Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</p></reply>

Bus &Eacute;ireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department, has advised that the child referred to by the Deputy is not attending her nearest education centre and is therefore not eligible for school transport.  Children who are not eligible for school transport, under the terms of the scheme, may apply to Bus &Eacute;ireann for transport on a concessionary basis subject to a number of a conditions, including the availability of spare seats on an existing service and the payment of the annual charge.  The Deputy will be aware that changes in determining eligibility for school transport to post-primary schools were introduced from the commencement of the 2012-13 school year.  These changes are being applied equitably on a national basis and in some cases pupils in the same area, or family, may be eligible for transport to different schools during the transitional period of five years.  In certain areas, families who choose to send their children to schools other than their nearest school may diminish the chance of a service being established to their nearest school.</p></reply>

Section 42 of this Act, which sets out provisions relating to the charitable status of contributions by congregations, was commenced in March 2013.  Section 42 empowers the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland to authorise property transfers and sales related to the making of contributions by congregations to the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund or as contributions towards the cost of the response to residential abuse.  The recent commencement of section 42 will facilitate the transfers of properties to the Minister for Education and Skills such as in the case of the school referred to by the Deputy.  The Congregation that owns the property concerned has offered to transfer it to the State as part of its offer of a number of properties made in response to the publication of the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (the Ryan Report).  The Government has agreed to accept this and a number of other properties offered.  The Department of Education and Skills, through the Chief State Solicitor's Office, is working on finalising the transfer of the property in question.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-11a.500.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061100076#WRK03400"><p>Various contributions and consultations have informed my Department's policy on the education of children with autism, which is based on the advice of international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate, an analysis of research and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism.  My Department is not aware of Applied Behaviour Analysis International.  It has been and remains open to other bodies, including those to whom the Deputy has referred, to make representations or contributions to my Department or the NCSE.  My Department's policy is focused on ensuring all children, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including ABA, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  As each child with autism is unique, it is important that children have access to a range of interventions so their broader needs can be met.</p><p>  My Department's policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated.  Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.  Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports.  In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios.  Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.</p><p>  With regard to Applied Behaviour Analysis, the position is that there is no definitive or universally accepted research which supports the use of one intervention exclusively for all children with autism.  However, research does support the use of any of a range of autism-specific interventions depending on the individual needs of the child.  My Department is conscious of the need to adapt existing policies and to develop new policies as new research or learning becomes available.  The National Council for Special Education has a formal role under Section 20.1(j) of EPSEN to advise the Minister &quot;in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities&quot;.  I have requested the NCSE to prepare Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.  The NCSE has commissioned research which will not be finalised until mid to late 2014.  I expect that this research will inform much of the work in preparing the policy advice.  Accordingly, it is not expected that the report will be finalised until early 2015.</p></reply>

The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget. </p><p>  At post primary level and in order to promote fairness in funding second level schools, a two-point increase in the pupil teacher ratio in fee-charging second level schools will be introduced in September 2013. There are currently 55 schools out of 723 post-primary schools charging fees ranging from &euro;2,550 to &euro;10,065 for day pupils.</p><p>  At present, the State pays the salaries of one teacher for every 21 pupils in these schools compared with one teacher for every 19 pupils in schools in the free education scheme. A ratio of 18.25 pupils to one teacher, applies in DEIS schools. This will rise to 23:1 in fee-charging schools from September 2013.  However, these schools have the resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately, an option which is not available to schools in the free education scheme. A report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools carried out by the Department was recently published and shows that the schools in question have &euro;81m in discretionary income that schools in the free scheme do not have.</p><p>  It is important to note that the report does not contain any policy proposals at this stage. However, even after the Budget changes are implemented, the discretionary income available to these schools will still be quite considerable.  There are some concerns within the Church of Ireland community on the recent budget measure affecting fee-charging schools. This Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or Reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.</p><p>  How best to sustain education provision for widely dispersed and small local communities does present as a particular challenge, especially in any locality where enrolment is declining to single figures. The Government is intent in fostering pluralism in school provision. Supporting small communities including minorities in maintaining their schools is part of that policy. </p><p>  With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is provided by my Department to the Secondary Education Committee (SEC), an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools. The SEC then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to &euro;6.5 million annually. This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to supporting access of minority denomination communities to schools that are of their tradition or ethos. The provision made by Kilkenny College caters for the needs of children from the Protestant community spread across several counties. Accordingly, I was happy to have officials of my Department work with the college authorities to work through a basis on which such a transfer would be feasible if that was their ultimate judgement.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that over the course of those detailed discussions the College authorities shared information in confidence with the Department and while I wish to respect that position at the same time I do want to provide the Deputy with information on the arrangements made to assist and support the College through its transition. </p><p>  Kilkenny College will cease to charge fees with effect from the start of school year in September next and as a result my Department will in future pay the salaries of a teacher for every 19 students attending the College. This compares with one teacher for every 21 students in fee charging schools at present and which will rise to one teacher for every 23 students in September 2013. </p><p>  My Department will also provide capitation and related funding to the College on the same basis as every other voluntary secondary school within the Free Education Scheme. I approved specific transition arrangements in relation to the teaching staff employed by the College and also reviewed the level of exchequer funding approved by the Department for school building projects carried out by the College. </p><p>  The precise cost of additional exchequer expenditure in Kilkenny College will be a function later this year of the actual enrolment in the College as a school within the Free Scheme.  While the arrangements made in relation to Kilkenny College were specific to its circumstances and plans to enter the Free Scheme, I have made clear that my Department will engage constructively with any fee charging school that is considering how best to secure its future. On the basis of the analysis I published earlier this year on the income from fees available to fee charging schools I expect that a minority of the fee charging schools will wish to engage with my Department, as Kilkenny College did, in order to plan for the future.</p></reply>

This is borne out by the fact that in 2012, 85% of the capital expenditure in the school sector was in respect of large scale projects, additional accommodation and prefab replacement. The balance was expended on site acquisition, emergency works, furniture and equipment provision and commitments arising from earlier years. </p><p>  The capital allocation that is available for the school sector in 2013 is expected to have a similar spend pattern as was the case in 2012 and at this time there are no plans to reinstate the Minor Works Grant.</p></reply>

This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary. Accordingly it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home. The Departments website and information material is being amended to further clarify the position.</p><p>  The school grouping principle does not purport to replicate or mirror all aspects of school based provision.  The age or ability of siblings is reflected in their education level as determined by education and health professionals. In general where a child is receiving their education in a class setting with other children of mixed age and ability, this should carry through to their July Provision. </p><p>  Parents who are experiencing difficulties in sourcing a fully qualified teacher are advised to contact the officials dealing with their allocation as tutors with alternative qualifications and experience may be accepted in some instances.</p></reply>

These grants were withdrawn due to real concerns about the constitutionality of making grants available to fee-charging schools of one ethos and not to those of another.</p><p>  At second level there are 26 distinctively Protestant schools and one Jewish school. Of these schools, the Jewish school and 20 of the Protestant schools charge fees. Many of the schools have a boarding facility, reflecting the dispersed nature of the communities across the country. The six Protestant schools within the free education scheme receive the same funding as all other schools within the free education system.</p><p>  This Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. I remind the Deputy that the Constitution specifically states that the State shall not discriminate against one religion in favour of another.</p><p>  With regard to the Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is paid to the Secondary Education Committee, an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the schools. The Secondary Education Committee then disburses funds to the Protestant schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to &euro;6.5 million annually. There are no changes proposed in respect of the Protestant block grant. </p><p>  Teachers in all fee-charging schools are paid by the State. This arrangement predated the introduction of free education arrangements and has existed since the foundation of the State and predates the foundation of the State.  I am already on record as saying that this is not a simple matter as these arrangements, which are historic and of long standing, impact upon a substantial number of schools which cater for religious minorities.</p></reply>

The initiatives include direct information sharing between SUSI and Government bodies and agencies including the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection, the General Register Office (GRO) and the Central Applications Office (CAO). These links should reduce significantly the number of documents required from applicants themselves.</p><p>  In addition the staff resources recommended by the review have already been sanctioned. The resources include three additional management posts and some 23 (whole time equivalent) additional processing staff. This will help to ensure that qualifying students have their applications assessed as quickly as possible.  SUSI has also significantly developed its training programme to meet the training needs of new and existing staff.</p><p>  In addition, the closing date will be a month earlier to facilitate earlier application and decision on a grant application.

Where a NEPS psychologist is not assigned to a school, authorities therein may access psychological assessments through SCPA. Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. </p><p>  My Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) operates an early intervention continuum of assessment in schools for students with the broad range of special educational needs. The continuum of assessment allows for the identification of pupils with special educational needs, their nature and severity by harnessing the experience of class teachers and support teachers, in consultation with parents, and with the support of the psychologist. It also provides for the development of immediate responses and interventions designed to ameliorate the particular needs identified at the appropriate level, either in the classroom or with the assistance of the support teacher. This allows for a response to be put in place at the earliest possible juncture for students before their difficulties can become intractable. Assessment of needs at this stage of the continuum involves information gathering, testing and observation by the various school personnel involved and support from the NEPS psychologist, as required.</p><p>  Where the pupil does not make adequate progress following the interventions, or where the nature of the child's special educational needs are significant, severe and complex, the school may agree with the psychologist that a psycho-educational assessment be conducted to identify the specific nature of the needs and the appropriate response necessary. Students, so identified, are scheduled for assessment within that school year. There is therefore no quota applied to schools under the process. I must again inform the Deputy that while assessments were available to the school heretofore this year no assessment was raised in respect of the student named in the Deputy's question.</p><p>  It is the responsibility of the school Principal in the first instance to identify and prioritise pupils for assessment under the process described above. </p><p>  I wish to inform the Deputy that a Psychologist has been assigned to this School from September 2013 and they will be liaising with the Principal regarding the school's needs in general terms and specifically in relation to this student.  I would advise that the school Principal, in the first instance, should be contacted in relation to concerns for any pupil which require intervention from the NEPS service.</p></reply>

My Department's policy is focused on ensuring that all children including those with autism can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including ABA, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of interventions so their broader needs can be met.</p><p>  My Department's policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated. Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school. Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports. In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios. Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.</p><p>  With regard to Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), the position is that there is no definitive or universally accepted research which supports the use of one intervention exclusively for all children with autism. However, research does support the use of any of a range of autism-specific interventions depending on the individual needs of the child. </p><p>  My Department is conscious of the need to adapt existing policies and to develop new policies as new research or learning becomes available. The National Council for Special Education has a formal role under Section 20.1(j) of EPSEN to advise the Minister 'in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities'. I have now requested the NCSE to prepare Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.  The NCSE have commissioned research which will not be finalised until mid to late 2014 and I expect that this research will inform much of the work in preparing the policy advice. Accordingly it is not expected that the report will be finalised until early 2015.</p></reply>

Central to this is the Special Education Support Service (SESS).</p><p>  My Department has satisfied itself that research does not support the exclusive usage of any one approach as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism.  It is for this reason that the preferred policy is for a child centred approach based on the individual child's needs.  This approach is supported by ongoing monitoring of educational objectives to determine whether a child is benefiting from a particular intervention or range of interventions and to allow for appropriate adjustment to objectives and strategies.</p><p>  Reflective of the important role of CPD, my Department, through SESS, has put in place a training programme for teachers in a number of autism-specific interventions including Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS).</p><p>  The document referred to by the Deputy relates to information compiled in 2004 by SESS at a time when teachers and schools were seeking information and greater clarity around Autism.  The reference to supervised training was included in a section of the document which sought to explain Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) as one of two main approaches at that time. </p><p>  My Department is conscious of the need to adapt existing policies and to develop new policies as new research or learning becomes available.  The National Council for Special Education has a formal role under Section 20.1(j) of EPSEN to advise the Minister 'in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities'.  I have now requested the NCSE to prepare Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.  The NCSE have commissioned research which will not be finalised until mid to late 2014 and I expect that this research will inform much of the work in preparing the policy advice. Accordingly it is not expected that the report will be finalised until early 2015.</p></reply>

The initial allocations of teaching resources to schools under the GAM was based on the enrolments in the schools as at 30 September 2003.  Notwithstanding the changes in demographics, the GAM allocations for individual schools remained largely unchanged over the years until the process was reformed and streamlined for the 2012/13 school year.  The changes that were made were not designed as a savings measure but instead to facilitate the updating of the GAM allocations for individual schools which had not being done, in many cases, for nearly a decade and also to facilitate the operation of the teacher allocation and redeployment process.  Resource hours are allocated by the NCSE as support for pupils with low incidence special needs.  This is typically done in June of each year with allocations also being made later in the year.  In order to facilitate the operation of the teacher allocation and redeployment process a network of permanent resource posts were allocated to base primary schools.  In the 2012/13 school year, 85% of all NCSE approved resource teaching hours were allocated to schools that had resource base posts. </p><p>  Primary schools that were allocated resource hours and did not have a base post could enter sharing arrangements with local schools that had such a post or, if none available, apply to the Department for part-time posts.</p><p>  When the allocation and redeployment process has transacted, schools have flexibility to operate, where possible, their own temporary local arrangements in relation to the day to day work arrangements of teachers in full-time shared posts.  The detail on such matters is set out in the Department's Staffing Circular 0013/13. </p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the NCSE has recently published a policy advice paper that recommends some changes on how resources are allocated to schools to support pupils with special educational needs.  </p></reply>

Rather the application process in previous years may have in some instances failed to identify adequately multiple applications for siblings.</p><p>  My Department's Information Note for Home Based July Provision notes that allocations to siblings are reflective of the school grouping principle. This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary.  Accordingly it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home.

Funding amounts to &euro;6.5 million annually. This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.  There are no changes proposed in respect of the Protestant block grant. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that in the context of the Budget 2013, I made a further one point change to the staffing allocation of fee charging schools from September 2013. </p><p>  Given the extremely difficult economic circumstances that this country is facing and the fact that every Department has to find considerable cost-savings, all expenditure must be examined to see if cost-savings can be found. </p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot at this stage anticipate any specific decisions the Government may take in respect of the next budget.</p></reply>

This process is ongoing. </p><p>My Department's policy on the education of children with Autism resides within the overall policies on the education of children with special educational needs.  In the main these policies are non condition specific.  In this context, the Autism policy, whether expressed in a multiple of documents or in a single document, should not be viewed as a separate 'stand alone' policy.  The new policy statement will not be exclusive.  Policies are subject of necessity to change from time to time.  Also, the new statement will neither alter nor add to existing policy.  It will reflect the current policy in a coherent and articulate manner for the benefit of schools and parents.  My Department is conscious of the need to adapt existing policies and to develop new policies as new research or learning becomes available.  The National Council for Special Education has a formal role under Section 20.1(j) of EPSEN to advise the Minister 'in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities'.  I have now requested the NCSE to prepare Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.  The NCSE have commissioned research which will not be finalised until mid to late 2014 and I expect that this research will inform much of the work in preparing the policy advice. Accordingly it is not expected that the report will be finalised until early 2015.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Home Tuition Scheme provides funding to parents to provide for education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children with Special Educational Needs including autism awaiting a suitable educational placement.  The scheme is not operated in an inequitable manner.  Home Tuition is not an acceptable long term alternative to the placement of a child in school.  It is, in general, a short term measure available to parents who are unable to identify a placement in school for their child. </p><p>The case referred to in the correspondence supplied by the Deputy is one where the parents in question had been advised by the NCSE that a number of placements were available for the children.  On this basis, the Home tuition provision was no longer payable.  My officials extended the payment period to facilitate the transition of the children into their new school placements.  </p></reply>

Rather the application process in previous years may have in some instances failed to identify adequately multiple applications for siblings. My Department's Information Note for Home Based July Provision notes that allocations to siblings are reflective of the school grouping principle. This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary. Accordingly it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home. The Departments website and information material is being amended to further clarify the position.</p><p>  The school grouping principle does not purport to replicate or mirror all aspects of school based provision. There is no commitment under the July Provision scheme to provide 25 hours either to an individual child or to siblings. The age or ability of siblings is reflected in their education level as determined by education and health professionals. In general where a child is receiving their education in a class setting with other children of mixed age and ability, this should carry through to their July Provision. Parents who are experiencing difficulties in sourcing a fully qualified teacher are advised to contact the officials dealing with their allocation as tutors with alternative qualifications and experience may be accepted in some instances. Whilst the timeframe is short my officials will endeavour to process any  appeals or queries expeditiously.  </p></reply>

Rather the application process in previous years may have in some instances failed to identify adequately multiple applications for siblings. My Department's Information Note for Home Based July Provision notes that allocations to siblings are reflective of the school grouping principle. This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary. Accordingly it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home. The Departments website and information material is being amended to further clarify the position.</p><p>  The school grouping principle does not purport to replicate or mirror all aspects of school based provision.  The age or ability of siblings is reflected in their education level as determined by education and health professionals. In general where a child is receiving their education in a class setting with other children of mixed age and ability, this should carry through to their July Provision. </p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>  Equality legislation, which also outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. The legislation provides that any school that has this objective may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I announced at this year's Teacher Union Conferences that I will shortly bring to Government draft heads of a bill &ndash; the Education (Admission to School) Bill 2013. I will seek to publish the Bill in draft form to allow a full public discussion, including inputs from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection and the education partners. I also intend to publish draft regulations that I plan to make when the Bill is enacted. In bringing forward these proposals, my policy objective is to ensure that every child is treated fairly and that the way in which schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent. As the Bill and the Regulations will be published in draft form, they will also be subject to a lot of detailed scrutiny before becoming law. I will be reflecting carefully on the views expressed in the consultation process to ensure they strike the right balance between school autonomy and fairness in our education system.</p></reply>

My Department's over-riding objective in identifying school building projects to progress to tender and construction is to ensure that every child has access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers. To ensure that this is achieved, the delivery of major school projects to meet significant demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years. The Five Year school building programme that I announced in March 2012 is focused on meeting those demographic needs.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that last week, I also announced a &euro;50 million investment in new school building projects as part of the Government's &quot;Investing in Infrastructure &amp;amp; Jobs&quot; Package. The projects considered for inclusion in that package were all at a significantly more advanced stage of architectural planning than the school referred to by the Deputy. It is not possible to progress all projects within the Department's building programme to construction concurrently due to competing demands on the Department's capital budget. </p><p>  The Major Building Project at the school referred to by the Deputy is currently at an early stage of architectural planning. Once it has completed stage 2(a) the project will then progress to Stage 2(b) which is the final design stage in the architectural planning process and includes the application for Planning Permission, Fire Certification, Disability Access Certification (DAC) and the preparation of tender documents.</p><p>  School building projects, including the project referred to by the Deputy, which have not been included in the five year construction programme, but which were previously initiated will continue to be progressed to final planning stages in anticipation of the possibility of further funds being available to the Department in the future.</p></reply>

This process is ongoing. </p><p>  My Department's policy on the education of children with Autism resides within the overall policies on the education of children with special educational needs. In the main these policies are non condition specific. In this context, the Autism policy, whether expressed in a multiple of documents or in a single document, should not be viewed as a separate 'stand alone' policy. The new policy statement will not be exclusive. Policies are subject of necessity to change from time to time. Also, the new statement will neither alter nor add to existing policy. It will reflect the current policy in a coherent and articulate manner for the benefit of schools and parents. </p><p>  My Department is conscious of the need to adapt existing policies and to develop new policies as new research or learning becomes available. The National Council for Special Education has a formal role under Section 20.1(j) of EPSEN to advise the Minister 'in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities'. I have now requested the NCSE to prepare Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.  The NCSE have commissioned research which will not be finalised until mid to late 2014 and I expect that this research will inform much of the work in preparing the policy advice.  Accordingly it is not expected that the report will be finalised until early 2015.</p></reply>

Rather the application process in previous years may have in some instances failed to identify adequately multiple applications for siblings. My Department's Information Note for Home Based July Provision notes that allocations to siblings are reflective of the school grouping principle. This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary. Accordingly it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home. The Departments website and information material is being amended to further clarify the position.</p><p>  The school grouping principle does not purport to replicate or mirror all aspects of school based provision.   The age or ability of siblings is reflected in their education level as determined by education and health professionals. In general where a child is receiving their education in a class setting with other children of mixed age and ability, this should carry through to their July Provision.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will however be aware, my Department's over-riding objective is to ensure that every child has access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers. To ensure that this is achieved, the delivery of major school projects to meet significant demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years. The five year programme is focused on meeting those demographic needs. The area in which the school, in question, is located has not been identifed as an area of significant demographic growth. In that context, it has not been possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently. All school building projects, including the project for the school in question, will continue to be advanced incrementally over time within the context of the funding available. However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible at this time to give an indicative timeframe for the construction of a new school building for the school.</p></reply>

Consequently, a broad cross section of retail operators has been brought together to form a network which isrepresentative of the sector. The IBEC Retail Skillnet program offers FETAC certified on-the-job training for retail staff. This training has been developed by retailers for retailers. Through the delivery of its training the network aims to increase productivity levels, improve customer service and product knowledge, introduce modern merchandising techniques, improve staff morale, reduce turnover and absenteeism levels. IBEC Retail Skillnet currently offers ten Modules which are accredited by FETAC at Level 5. The network provides training materials to guide candidates through each of the modules.

In 2013 the Castle is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. from 30 May to 25 September from Wednesday to Sunday and on bank holidays. There is no admission charge to the site and visitor numbers for 2011 and 2012 were 9,444 and 13,852 respectively. Several other OPW managed sites, which have a guide service during the summer months, remain closed for the winter season This is primarily due to budgetary constraints. It is not possible in the current economic circumstances to extend the opening season at these locations. In order to address situations like this, I introduced the Communities Involvement Initiative in 2012, the aim of which was for local community-based groups, which had an interest in the development and promotion of heritage sites, to get involved on a non-commerical basis with OPW and, subject to certain criteria being met, to assist in the presentation of sites outside of the normal opening times. Last month, I again sought expressions of interest from local communities by way of the national press, this time under a new heading "Become a Friend of Irish Heritage". Proposals may still be submitted and I would encourage parties in the Maynooth area who wish to promote their local heritage to get in touch with the Office of Public Works.</p></reply>

National rules governing public procurement must comply with the relevant EU, WTO and national legal requirements and obligations. Of particular relevance are the rules on free movement of goods, freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services, as well as the principles deriving from these rules such as the principle of equal treatment; non-discrimination; mutual recognition; proportionality; and transparency. In this regard, all purchasing decisions by public bodies must conform to the EU Treaty principles, rules, and national guidelines. Businesses or individuals who feel that they have not been treated fairly during the course of a public procurement process may have recourse under the Remedies Directive (EU Directive 2007/66/EC) which provides for remedies in both the public sector and utilities sectors, for tenderers and others that have been harmed by breaches of the Public Contracts and Utilities Directives; this Directive has been transposed into Irish Law by regulations made under Statutory Instruments 130 of 2010 and 131 of 2010. Many of the practices provided for in that Directive are in place at national level through guidance documents issued by the National Public Procurement Policy Unit in my Department. These would include:<i> Public Procurement Guidelines - Competitive Process 2004</i> in respect of the procurement of general services and supplies - highlighting the need for a competitive process in respect of contracts below the EU threshold values; <i>Circular 10/10</i> - to require public bodies to promote participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts;<i> the Capital Works Management Framework</i> - provides a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts and generic template documents, which are available to download for all contracting authorities to provide a consistent approach to the management of public works and construction-related services projects; and<i> Standardisation and simplification of tender documentation (for supplies and services)</i>.  In order to reduce the costs involved in participating or conducting the procurement function, the National Procurement Service has published a suite of model tendering and contract documents which help businesses and buyers to reduce costs. All regulations, circulars, guidelines and standard forms (for general supplies and services) are available on the Government's eTenders website at: <i><font color="#0000FF">www.eTenders.gov.ie</font></i>. The Capital Works Management Framework documents are available on the Construction Procurement Reform website: <i><font color="#0000FF">www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie</font></i>.</p><p>  In terms of centralised procurement arrangements, the National Procurement Service (NPS) as a matter of course offers full debriefing to suppliers who have engaged in the procurement process. At these sessions contractors can raise any areas or issues of concern. The NPS is also fully compliant on the issue of contractors' rights under the Remedies Directive. Such rights ensure full disclosure of relevant details regarding the awarding of a tender and the relative merits and characteristics of that tender versus those who were unsuccessful. The NPS has recently established a collaborative working group which brings together Employer Representative Bodies (IBEC, SFA, ISME etc.) and procurement stakeholders in the public service to discuss issues and areas of concern. The NPS is confident that the working group will help to inform the continued delivery of best practice by public sector Buyers through the procurement process. Finally I would point out that the area of Public Procurement is undergoing an extensive reform. While this reform is primarily aimed at delivering public services at a competitive cost, it will also focus on improving public procurement practices. This will ensure openness, and equality of opportunity for businesses including the SME sector.</p></reply>

VAT). The Probation and Welfare Service was originally earmarked to be located in this property. However, a subsequent decision was made by the Probation and Welfare Service not to locate to the property. As no alternate State requirement could be identified for this property, at that time, the OPW decided that the property was surplus to requirements and as part of the rationalisation programme it was placed on the market. While there have been expressions of interest in the purchase and/or leasing of the property, it remains on the market. As the property is State owned there are no insurance costs. The average annual costs are approximately &euro;5,000 covering works to prevent any deterioration of the building, care and maintenance, general repairs and upkeep of the building. More recently the OPW engaged with the Department of Social Protection on the potential to provide a service but that Department has ruled out using this property.

Benefits realised are paid by the AVC provider, not by the public service employer, and are, therefore, not subject to the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR). In those cases where AVC funds are utilised to purchase service in public service pension schemes, no distinction is made, for PSPR purposes, in respect of that part of the pension which is derived from the AVC transfer. This is consistent with the practice applying generally i.e. since its introduction on 1 January 2011, the PSPR has applied and will continue to apply to affected public service pensions in an across-the-board fashion, with no distinction or exception being made in respect of any part of a pension which derives from a particular source, for example from purchased or transferred service.</p></reply>

Therefore, these subheads are now described as being part-funded by the National Lottery and the balance of the expenditure allocation for the subheads comes from normal Exchequer sources. Consequently, it is no longer feasible to compile a list of programmes or organisations that receive Lottery funding per se as it is now not possible to indicate the level of funding that they receive specifically from the Lottery. However, Appendix 1 of the REV sets out both the overall level of expenditure under these subheads and the level of funding which comes from the proceeds of the National Lottery. For example, in 2012, overall expenditure under these subheads was 333 million euro of which 220 million euro came from the proceeds of the National Lottery. Individual Government Departments with responsibility for expenditure that is part-funded by the National Lottery surplus publish details of such expenditure (including lists of recipient organisations and amounts involved) on their websites.</p></reply>

In this connection I would point out that as the statutory PRSI related State Pension is not paid by the employer it does not qualify as PAYE remuneration under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest  Acts. Any adjustment to existing PSPR  rates and bands beyond the existing &euro;12,000 exemption threshold, with a view to accommodating cases in which the public service pension is co-ordinated or integrated with  the State Pension, would be complex and could not be guaranteed to produce equitable outcomes in all cases. The majority of public servants with integrated pensions are in receipt of small occupational pensions and so are not impacted by the PSPR measure to any significant degree. In relation to the matter of the PSPR and commercial state bodies, I would point out that the PSPR does not apply to the pensions of persons retired from such bodies as these are not part of the public service and their staff do not enjoy membership of public service pension schemes. The bodies in question have a commercial remit and their pay and pensions are not funded by the Exchequer. I  understand the concerns outlined by various representatives about the impact of pension reductions on the lives of public service pensioners but given current economic circumstances the Government must take steps to ensure the economic survival of the State and this impacts across society. The Deputy may be aware I met recently with representatives of the Alliance of Retired Public Servants and  indicated that it is my intention, as a matter of priority, to move towards reducing the burden of the PSPR, (with the initial focus on people in receipt of low pensions) at the earliest date economic progress permits. I appreciate that this is a matter of great importance to pensioners and I would envisage that developments in this regard would be the subject of ongoing bilateral discussions between my Department and Alliance representatives.</p></reply>

However, the detailed technical and legal documentation regarding the process will be made available only to bidding parties. As I have previously advised the Deputy, my officials are available to brief her and other opposition spokespersons on the competitive process. The National Lottery Act 2013, which was enacted recently, provides for the publication of details of the National Lottery licence. This is a new development in that the practice to date has been not to publish the licence. Details of the licence will be published once the competitive process has concluded and the new licensee is in place. Under the next licence, annual contributions for good causes will be set at 65% of Gross Gaming Revenues (sales less prizes). This will offer the holder of the next licensee greater flexibility and scope for the growth and development of lottery games and distribution channels. It is envisaged that sales of National Lottery tickets will increase under the next licence, which will in turn lead to increased funding for Good Causes. An Post National Lottery Company recently published its Annual Report and Accounts for 2012. This Report contains detailed information including the sales achieved by the Company and the funds allocated to prizes in 2012. Using this published information, it is possible to calculate the level of funding which would have accrued to Good Causes had the formula which will apply under the next licence applied in 2012. The new basis on which the Good Causes formula will be calculated will only apply under the next licence. Given that the parameters under which the next licence will operate are changing, application of the formula to the 2012 data is not particularly informative.</p></reply>

The aim, in the first instance, is to protect the interests of taxpayers by ensuring tax compliance on the part of those persons or bodies in receipt of public funds. On the other hand, when public bodies dispose of assets (or grant access to property or infrastructure for commercial arrangements) with a view to raising funds, it is incumbent on them to seek to optimise the return achieved. By way of illustration, the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies issued by my Department provides that, for anticipated values at or above &euro;150,000, the method of disposal should be by auction or competitive tendering process, and that the method used should be both transparent and likely to achieve a fair-market related price. As the expenditure of public monies does not arise in such situations, it is not clear what role, if any, there may be for requiring tax clearance certification as a condition of sale.</p></reply>

I do not have a breakdown of the Pension Related Deduction (PRD) collected across income bands. For the Deputy's information, the PRD realises in the order of &euro;1 billion per annum (including contributions from Local Authority employees and other non-Departmental employees on whom the deduction is levied). The PRD is applied to gross pay. The PRD was introduced on 1 March 2009 by the then Government as one of a range of measures to help address the economic crisis, and in particular, the serious imbalance in the public finances. While the deduction can undoubtedly be a significant imposition on many public servants, it is this Government's view that it is a necessary and proportionate measure given the exceptionally serious position of the public finances. As the Deputy will be aware the impact of the PRD measure was lessened with effect from 1 May 2009 by way of adjustments to the bands and rates, including an increased rate, from 10% to 10.5%, on the earnings band above &euro;60,000. Those adjustments were particularly beneficial for lower paid public servants, in so far as they provided that the first &euro;15,000 of annual earnings be made fully exempt from the deduction. I should also state that, as provided for in section 11 of the recently enacted Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, an adjustment in PRD will take place on 1 January 2014, when the 5% deduction rate applied to the band of annual income between &euro;15,000 and &euro;20,000 will decrease from 5% to 2.5%. The Deputy may wish to note that under the financial emergency legislation, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform must review the PRD and other emergency measures annually and report to the Oireachtas on such review.</p></reply>

Complaints in relation to products being offered for sale where the price or unit price is not clearly visible should be brought to the attention of the National Consumer Agency who has responsibility for enforcing consumer law. Similarly in instances where a wrong indication of price is concerned, traders who provide false information in relation to the price of a product may be engaging in a misleading commercial practice and may, therefore, be committing an offence under consumer law. Again instances of such practices should be referred to the National Consumer Agency in order that they can be investigated.</p><p>  As regards the provision of information in relation to the terms and conditions that may apply to a particular product, consumer protection law also prohibits traders from engaging in misleading commercial practices, including practices which involve the concealment or omission of material information that the average consumer would need to make an informed transactional decision and which could cause the average consumer to make a transactional decision he would not otherwise make. Accordingly, persons who may be concerned that traders may be engaged in selling products by means of false representation through the omission or concealment of material information, such as relevant information concerning the terms and conditions relating to such products, may wish to bring their concerns to the attention of the National Consumer Agency so that they may be investigated.</p><p>  As regards enforcement activity, the National Consumer Agency maintains and publishes a Consumer Protection List of enforcement actions taken against traders who do not comply with the requirements of consumer protection law, including those requirements in relation to the above mentioned provisions of the law. I am advised that in so far as enforcement in relation to pricing is concerned, the Agency in the course of 2012 visited some 349 traders, across a range of sectors, and covering all counties. As a result of these visits, the Agency in 2012 issued 111 pricing enforcement actions to traders, comprising 71 Fixed Payment Notices (fines of &euro;300 in each case) for breaches of the requirement to display prices, and 40 Compliance Notices for charging higher prices than those displayed. Details of the Agency's enforcement actions are published in its Consumer Protection Lists and I understand that the next Consumer Protection List, covering the period May to December 2012, will be published shortly.</p><p>  I very much support the Agency's proactive approach, as evidenced by its enforcement activities, to ensure that consumers are provided with accurate information regarding products and services and are not exposed to unfair or misleading commercial practices. It is important that those who would seek to mislead consumers through the provision of false information are subject to the rigours of consumer protection law and I welcome the Agency's determination to ensure that the law is enforced in such situations.</p></reply>

These measures are contained at sections 42 to 51, inclusive, of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999 as amended. As a precondition of incorporation, every application for registration is required to demonstrate that the proposed company intends to carry on an activity in the State. Every company registered in the State was required to maintain an Irish resident director or a bond to the value of &euro;25,394.76. The Irish resident director requirement was subsequently changed under the Companies (Amendment) Act 2009 to a requirement for a director resident in the European Economic Area. The requirement for either a bond or an EEA resident director does not apply if the company obtains from the Registrar of Companies a certificate that the company has a real and continuous link with one or more economic activities in the State. The company concerned must provide proof of such a link. A statement from the Revenue Commissioners that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the company has such a link is deemed proof of a link under the Act. The number of directorships which could be held by one person was limited to 25 (subject to certain exemptions). The 1999 Act contained enhanced strike-off provisions and enhanced notification to the CRO where directors have resigned.</p><p>  With regard to residency requirements, all companies incorporated in the State are regarded as resident in the State for tax purposes, unless they fall under specific exemptions in tax law. Policy responsibility for tax issues rests with my colleague the Minister for Finance. I have no direct function for such matters. In relation to residency requirements for directors, specific residency rules are prescribed by section 44 of the Companies (Amendment) (No.2) Act, 1999 as amended. These residency rules largely mirror the residency provisions of section 819 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. A person is considered resident if he or she has been present for an aggregate of at least 183 days or more in any 12 month period. The Act also provides that he or she can be resident for an aggregate of 280 days over two 12 month periods, subject to certain qualifications.  The Companies Bill 2012 contains similar provisions to sections 42 to 51, inclusive, of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999 as amended.</p></reply>

The European Commission negotiates at the WTO<b></b>on behalf of the European Union and its Member States when<b></b>  authorised by the Council. </p><p>  In doing so, the Commission seeks to reconcile EU Member States' interests and priorities with WTO partners' requests by aiming to secure a consensus among the Member States. Ireland's position with regard to WTO matters is represented within this consensus. Ireland's informed position is formulated by drawing on its full participation in the WTO and its supporting structures.</p><p>  When the EU negotiates an agreement at the WTO, it does so on the basis of a formal authorisation of the Council.  The Commission actively consults with Member States in the Council throughout WTO negotiations and will take the Council's position into account to achieve an outcome beneficial to Member States.  The Commission also requires the formal agreement of Council in order to conclude any WTO related agreement.</p><p>  My understanding is that the rules for Membership of the WTO and the United Nations are different. The UN Charter provides the rules for membership of the United Nations.  The European Union is not a Member State under the terms of the UN Charter. The EU gained enhanced observer status in May 2011.  This allows the EU through the European External Action Service (EEAS) the right to speak among representatives of major groups.  European Union Member States coordinate closely to advance common EU positions at the United Nations.</p></reply>

In 2010 American Express created the Small Business Saturday movement to encourage people to shop at their local business on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. </p><p>  To reach as many people as possible, American Express made Facebook the hub of its marketing efforts for the initiative. Both multinationals have promoted this initiative through incentivised measures for participants such as free advertising on Facebook or free credit from American Express when dealing with participating merchants.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that a similar initiative, Fiver Friday, is already underway in Ireland. This campaign was established by an Irish entrepreneur, Mark Beggs, with the aim of promoting and supporting local Irish businesses. This campaign encourages consumers to spend just five euros locally in order to support local enterprises and jobs. The Fiver Friday has also utilised social media networks such as Facebook to garner support across Ireland. </p><p>  While the campaign in the United States has been established and promoted by two multinationals, the Irish campaign is the result of small scale private enterprise coming together to stimulate and protect small businesses in their local economy. It is clear that both campaigns have been very successful in their objective to stimulate and promote small business in their local economies. Such initiatives are of course very welcome and are valuable tools in continuing efforts to reinvigorate economies across the globe.</p></reply>

They are the first port of call in terms of advice, direction, training and grant support for anyone who wishes to start a business. Contact details for the CEBs are available on   . </p><p>  The Boards are required to give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector, which over time can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland portfolio. Public Houses are ineligible for financial support from the CEBs as it is considered that these generally give rise to concerns over displacement (where the projects simply displace business from other players in the market). </p><p>  However a project promoter might be able to avail of non-financial assistance in the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives etc. Training courses include such topics as start-your-own-business, taxation for beginners, internet marketing, ideas generation and negotiation skills. </p><p>  In addition, Microfinance Ireland provides support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 available to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal.

The disability allowance (DA) represents an important income support to people who are unfit for work. Also, domiciliary care allowance (DCA) represents a very important support to parents and guardians who live with, and care for, children with a disability.</p><p>  However, eligibility on medical conditions, for any illness-related benefit/allowance will depend on the severity and expected duration of the condition, and in the case of carers the care requirements.  All applications are assessed on a claim-by-claim basis.</p><p>  In regard to employment support, the Department&rsquo;s supported employment programme operated under the &ldquo;EmployAbility&rdquo; banner provides the services of a job-coach for those wishing to take up employment opportunities. Other relevant supports would include the wage subsidy scheme and the work equipment adaptation grant. I encourage private sector employers to avail of these supports to increase the participation rates of people with disabilities in the labour market </p></reply>

These rates of payments were fully protected in the last two Budgets. </p><p>  The Deputy should note the Student Grant payable by the Department of Education and Skills represents the primary support for persons pursuing education. Students who qualify for the BTEA, may be considered for support for the student contribution under the student grant scheme provided they satisfy the conditions of the relevant Student Grant scheme and Student Support regulations including those relating to approved course, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. Students should apply to Student Universal Support Ireland to have their eligibility for a grant towards the student contribution assessed.</p><p>  Other supports available to students include the Student Assistance Fund which will continue to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need.  Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. The Access Officers themselves will also continue to provide support and advice to students to enable them to continue with their studies. Also the Fund for Students with Disabilities provides funding to both further and higher education institutions for the provision of services and supports for full-time students with disabilities.</p><p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

The Exchequer is the residual financier of the Fund and such subventions were the norm for over 40 years.  For example, in 1967, the State contribution was 38% of SIF expenditure and almost 29% in 1985.</p><p>  From 1997 to 2007 inclusive, social insurance income exceeded Fund expenditure.  In 2008, the current operating balance of the SIF moved into deficit with expenditure exceeding income by &euro;255m.  This deficit accelerated in 2009 when it reached &euro;2.49 billion and further rose to &euro;2.75 billion in 2010.  In addition, the surplus carried forward from previous years was eliminated during 2010, giving rise to the need for Exchequer subvention for the first time since 1996.  The Provisional Outturn for 2013 provides for a deficit of nearly &euro;1.5 billion.  </p><p>  I have already indicated my concern about the deficit in the SIF.  One of my key goals is to reform the system of social protection and to put it on a sounder financial footing for the future.  Measures taken in recent Budgets have started the process of addressing the SIF deficit through reductions in expenditure on social insurance benefits or through implementation of measures to increase income to the Fund. </p><p>In Budget 2013, the Minister for Finance indicated that the income base on which PRSI is charged will be broadened.  The exemption from PRSI on earned and unearned self-employed income of modified rate employees who pay PRSI at Classes B, C and D (a minority of the civil and public sector), is being abolished this year.  The exemption from PRSI applying to self-employed unearned income of employees (all Classes) and those with occupational pensions under 66 years, which is available where they have <i>unearned</i>   income only, will be abolished in 2014. </p><p>  The payment of PRSI at 4% as a result of the abolition of these exemptions will not provide entitlement to social insurance benefits.

The Department is also engaged in a project to produce a Free Travel variant of the PSC compatible with the Department of Transport's Integrated Ticketing System as well as a variant suitable for issue to juveniles.  The projected cost of these programmes was some &euro;24M (VAT excl.) There is no reason to believe that these estimates will be exceeded.</p><p>  With regard to the third programme - DSP deployment: In Spring 2012, following a pilot deployment of registration, sanction was received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for 150 additional temporary staff to support customer registration and card roll-out. From that time, sourcing of these additional staff began and volume production of standard PSCs commenced in July 2012.  The estimated cost associated with these staff in terms of salaries and training over the lifetime of the project is &euro;10.9M. </p><p>  Since then, the accelerated roll-out of SAFE Registration functionality across the country has continued.  The Department has deployed two methods for SAFE registration - a 'reduced process' utilising data from other State agencies (e.g. data provided in the context of a Passport application) and a 'face to face' process involving personal attendance at a DSP Office.  </p><p>To date, almost 240,000 PSCs have been issued.  These cards have been issued, in the main, to people in receipt of Jobseekers payments and One Parent Family Payments from the Department and to applicants for Personal Public Service numbers. The projected number of cards to issue in 2013 is 600,000. The number of PSCs to be produced from 2013 onwards will be significantly increased. SAFE registration will be expanded to encompass all Departmental scheme customers as well as customers of other public sector organisations and across the general population of Ireland.  In that context the Department is engaged with a number of other Public Service bodies about the use of the SAFE/PSC infrastructure in the delivery of services. The initial Public Services Card Roll Out project has a completion date of 31<sup>st</sup>   December 2016.</p></reply>

Currently, there are approximately 86,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013. Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant. Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.   For rent supplement the approach to tenancies where the landlord has entered receivership is similar to that adopted where a change of landlord takes place.  A new tenancy has been created with the receiver now as landlord, a new rent supplement claim is opened and the receiver&rsquo;s landlord Tax Reference Number or Personal Public Service Number (PPSN) are required in order to meet the Department&rsquo;s legal requirements. </p><p>  Section 888 of the Taxes Acts places an obligation on the Department to provide the Revenue Commissioners with payment details relating to rent supplement on an annual basis. Section 123 of the Finance Act 2007 Act places a further obligation on the Department to request a PPSN or Tax Reference Number from a landlord before payment of the supplement is made and obliges the landlord to comply with the request.  Section 7 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010 provides that rent supplement is not payable unless these details are provided. </p><p>  The timescale for determining applications for rent supplement is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information in relation to the receiver.  The provision of a prompt service is a major objective for the Department&rsquo;s staff dealing with rent supplement applications and every effort is made to ensure that claims are processed in an efficient manner. If the Deputy has concerns in relation to a specific case he can provide the details to the Department for follow up.</p></reply>

This will begin in 2014 with the abolition of the state pension (transition) thereby standardising state pension age for all at 66 years.  The state pension age will be further increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.  These changes apply to all fully insured employees.  The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker's benefit.  It is a fundamental condition of this scheme that a recipient must be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work. Persons who qualify for a jobseeker's benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).<b></b>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age.  Increasing longevity and significant improvements in health status mean that people can work longer to support themselves in retirement.  Raising State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition) is a necessary step in ensuring the sustainability of pensions into the future.  The recently published OECD report on the Review of the Irish Pension System confirms that reforms are necessary if we are to continue to put pension provision on a sustainable footing given the changes in demographics, the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund, and the difficult fiscal situation.</p></reply>

Primarily, this is to protect interns, who should not undertake internships in circumstances where a high quality, real workplace environment will not be available for a prolonged period such as during academic holidays.

However, evidence of identity is always necessary and in this context, a passport is often furnished by customers as proof of identity.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is a contribution based payment made to workers who have involuntarily become unemployed.  Jobseeker's allowance is a means-tested payment made to people who are unemployed and do not qualify for jobseeker's benefit.  In order to qualify for jobseeker's allowance a number of conditions must be satisfied by an applicant, including that s/he be available for and genuinely seeking work, and that s/he fulfils the habitual residence condition.  An Irish citizen born in the six counties who is habitually resident in this State is entitled to the same social welfare payments as an Irish citizen born in the 26 counties, providing the conditions for such payments are met.</p></reply>

To take account of the services provided, a direct provision allowance of &euro;19.10 per adult per week and &euro;9.60 per child per week is payable in respect of any personal requisites required. The payment of the weekly direct provision allowance is made on an administrative basis by this Department on behalf of the Department of Justice and Equality.

One of the recommendations relates to the independence of the SWAO. The appeals process <font color="#2F2F2F">has a statutory basis in both primary and secondary legislation and Appeals Officers are quasi-judicial officers and are required to be free and unrestricted in discharging their functions. As far back as 1958, the Supreme Court found that Appeals Officers are required to free and unrestricted in the performance of their duties. The high level of appeals allowed </font>(54% in 2012<font color="#2F2F2F">) is evidence of the indep</font>endence of the process.  There are no plans to take legislative steps to change the method by which Appeals Officers are appointed.</p><p>  The report also criticises the delays being experienced by appellants. There was a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals from 2009 to date which has placed extraordinary pressure on the SWAO. Significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, improving business processes and implementing a new operating model.  As a result of these measures, there has been significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from an average of 13,500 to 32,558 in 2012 and processing times have been reduced by 10.3 weeks overall in 2012 with time for an oral hearing time down by 13 weeks and the time for summary decision up by 2.7 weeks.</p><p>  Further improvement is needed.  In that regard:</p><p>  - The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012;</p><p>  - There is a major programme of process redesign and modernisation currently underway in relation to many scheme areas which will reduce backlogs and will also reduce the time taken for the Department to respond to requests from the SWAO for submissions in relation to appeals;</p><p>  - It is planned to recruit additional Medical Assessors in 2013 which will assist in reducing the time taken for appeals where a medical assessment is required.</p><p>  All these measures together will reduce the waiting time for appellants.</p><p>  Concern was expressed in the report that the higher number of summary decisions in 2011 indicated a move away from oral hearings. I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that the increases in the number of summary decisions in 2010 and 2011 was a result of having eight very experienced retired appeals officers working exclusively on summary decisions which had the effect of front loading summary decisions. The percentage of summary decisions was 69% in 2010 and 65% in 2011, the two years for which the retired officers were retained, and has since dropped to 60% in 2012.</p><p>  In relation to consistency and transparency in decision making, this is addressed in a number of ways by the Department through training and communication and in relation specifically to the SWAO it is the statutory responsibility of the Chief Appeals Officer to convene meetings of Appeals Officers for the purpose of ensuring consistency.  The Department provides funding to a number of agencies involved in providing advocacy and information services to persons regarding their social welfare rights and how to process its systems.</p></reply>

These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also underpins the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.</p><p>  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office. Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, reviewing and  improving business processes and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is currently underway in the Department in relation to many scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken for the Department to respond to requests from the SWAO for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012. The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  It is also worth noting that, despite the increase in the volume of appeals being received, the number of appeals on hand have reduced from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 16,687 at 4 June 2013.  </p><p>  Processing times for all appeal types reduced by 10.3 weeks overall in 2012  when compared to 2011, with the time taken to finalise an appeal requiring an oral hearing down by 13 weeks and the time for an appeal decided by way of a summary decision up by 2.7 weeks.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p></reply>

The pilot YGS will look to develop an activation approach tailored to the needs of young people in a deprived urban area and then test it within a specific geographical location (Ballymun).  It is proposed that the Pilot YGS in Ballymun will apply to an intake of c 90 young people per month over a 12 month period, or 1,080 persons in all. </p><p>  We are currently waiting to hear from the European Commission as to whether or not our application has been successful. We have been informed that a final decision on our application will be made by the end of June. In the event of the grant being awarded by the Commission, it is anticipated that the pilot scheme will start within four months of the signature of the grant agreement.</p><p>  Subject to approval from the Commission, the proposed Ballymun YGS pilot will look to develop an activation approach tailored to the needs of young people.  It is intended that the Ballymun pilot YGS will, in respect of the target group of young people,  guarantee access to career guidance/assistance leading to identification of an individual career plan for the young unemployed person with follow-through to training, education, work experience or full-time employment.  Depending on the needs of the young individual the steps in the career plan might include personal assessment, job search assistance, skills training, work experience internships, but the objective in all cases will be to lead the young person to employment placement or further education or training. A particular focus of the pilot YGS will be to involve, and build links with, employers in the locality and the immediate hinterland in order to ensure that the guidance and training elements of the YGS are tailored to the needs of the local labour market and also to generate work placement/experience opportunities for the YGS participants.</p><p>  All young people who are coming on to the Live Register during the period of the pilot and who are registering at the Ballymun office as well as those young people who have already been unemployed for some time, including those who are not in receipt of a payment, will be targeted for inclusion in this pilot scheme.</p><p>  With regard to the government&rsquo;s plan to develop a comprehensive nation-wide youth guarantee, the government will review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances. It is intended to produce a concrete plan for the implementation of the guarantee before the end of 2013.</p><p>  The scale and nature of the measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed in Q1 2013 was, at 54,000, down 10,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will almost certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education, training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.</p><p>  In this regard the State already provides a significant number of places which are available to young people and the Department of Social Protection took steps in Budget 2013 to increase funding and places for schemes such as JobBridge, Community Employment, T&Uacute;S and a new state employment scheme in the local Government sector.  In total an additional 10,000 places will be provided.  The Department of Education also made provision for the new MOMENTUM programme which is providing 6,500 new training places many of which will be taken up by young people.  A new recruitment incentive &ndash; JobsPlus &ndash; has also been developed by my Department and was approved by the Government as part of the Action Plan for Jobs.  This incentive will be launched for availability in July 2013.</p></reply>

Habitual residency criteria must also be met.  </p><p>  The EU Commission has recently opened infringement proceedings against my Department concerning the status of carers allowance under EU Regulations.  The Commission claims that, for the purposes of the EU regulations on the co-ordination of social security systems, the carer&rsquo;s allowance is a sickness benefit which should be exported and paid in other EU States.  This represents a change of position by the Commission, which previously supported the view that carers allowance is a social assistance payment, which means it is not covered by the EU regulations and not paid to people outside the State.  This matter is being raised with the Commission.</p><p>  As regards the particular case raised by the Deputy, the person in question requested to withdraw from the carer's allowance scheme on 14 of June 2012.

The main elements being: </p><p>(i) the integration of the various welfare decision making processes to speed up decision making and minimise recourse to supplementary welfare payments; </p><p>(ii) the implementation of a systematic activation process based on profiling of clients; and </p><p>(iii) the delivery of a 'one-stop-shop' service from an integrated office location.</p><p>  The first ten Intreo offices, with all elements in place, went live in 2012.  These first ten offices were Sligo, Arklow, Tallaght, Kings Inns, Ballymun, Buncrana, Coolock, Dundalk, Finglas and Killarney.</p><p>  A further two Intreo offices have now opened in Newcastlewest and Blanchardstown. It is intended to have the full service available from a total of approximately 40 offices this year and to complete the full roll-out of all service elements to all 63 offices of the Department in 2014.  As part of this process it is intended to complete the roll-out of elements (i) and (ii) above to all offices during 2013. Element (iii) requires infrastructural works in many office locations and therefore has a longer timeline.</p><p>  Currently activation clinics are held twice a week in Bantry, twice a month in Bandon, Clonakilty, Kinsale, Dunmanway and Skibbereen and once a month in Castletownbere.  Group engagement sessions for unemployed customers in west Cork are provided once a month in Bantry with subsequent one to one guidance interviews at which unemployed clients identify and agree individual progression plans with a DSP Activation Case Officer.  Group engagement will be further rolled out in west Cork in the autumn.</p><p>  Group talks are also held, when required, normally twice monthly, with unemployed customers who are interested in self-employment, to advise them of the supports available.  Again there are follow up one to one meetings with these customers.</p><p>  The delivery of activation services in west Cork are  kept under review to determine the options available with existing resources to deliver the optimum service to the Department's customers in that area. </p></reply>

It is delivering on the Programme for Government commitment to set up a National Employment and Entitlements Service and involves a multiannual programme of complex legislative, organisation, process, people, and work change running to the end of 2014.</p><p>  There are five strands to the Pathways approach relating to </p><p>1. Engagement with people who are unemployed.</p><p>2. The provision of  activation places and opportunities</p><p>3. Incentivising the take-up of opportunities</p><p>4. Working with employers </p><p>5. Reforming institutions </p><p>  We have made good progress on all strands. The Deputy will be aware of the institutional changes arising from the merger of the Community Welfare Service and F&Aacute;S employment services with my Department - both of which were transferred on time and within budget at the start of last year.  Progress has been made on working with employers through the establishment of an Employer Engagement Unit within my Department.  With regard to activation places and opportunities 2012 saw the very successful roll-out of JobBridge and T&Uacute;S while Budget 2013 provided for an additional 13,000 places on various employment schemes representing a 30% increase on existing provision.  Jobseekers have a stronger incentive to take up these and other employment opportunities by virtue of changes to referral processes, payment arrangements in respect of casual work and the introduction of penalty rates of payment  for non-engagement with activation initiatives.</p><p>  The impact of the Pathways approach is most evident in the more frequent and more intensive manner of our engagement with jobseekers.  For example 68,600 clients participated in a group engagement process last year, while over 40,000 clients have benefitted from such engagements already this year.  Similarly the Department conducted 158,000 initial one-to-one guidance interviews with jobseekers last year.  The target is to complete 185,000 initial interviews in 2013.  Significantly under the Intreo model being rolled out across the country, the process of engagement starts immediately when a client registers for a Jobseekers payment and is informed by a personal profile captured in respect of each individual.  In the past no such profiles were captured and clients had to wait at least three months before being invited to a Group Engagement.  In addition decision times in respect of jobseeker claims are significantly reduced from an average of four weeks under the old method of operation to under a week, and in most cases to no more than 2/3 days, in Intreo offices.</p><p>  The first twelve Intreo offices are now live and it is intended to convert circa 30 additional offices to full Intreo working by the end of this year and to complete the full roll-out to all 63 offices of the Department in 2014.  It is to be noted that key elements of the Intreo model are being rolled-out in advance of the physical modification of offices. Personal profiling is already in place in all offices while individual progression planning and the accelerated integrated decision process will be operational in all offices by the end of this year. </p><p>With respect to plans for 2013 I have published a comprehensive set of performance targets, set out on a on a quarter by quarter basis, on the Department's website  and will publish performance against these targets starting in July of this year.</p></reply>

Therefore, QCI payments do not of themselves constitute a specific social welfare scheme and entitlement to the appropriate primary adult payment must be established in the first instance.  The estimated expenditure on QCI payments in 2013 is &euro;694 million. </p><p>  To qualify for payment of a QCI, the child in respect of whom the increase is claimed must be considered to be normally resident with the person who is claiming the primary payment.  Where the child is resident part of the time with each parent the child is generally considered to be normally resident with the parent with whom the child resides most of the time. </p><p>  Accordingly, the main principle underlying payment arrangements in the social protection system is that of the normal residence of the child rather than custody arrangements.  Decisions around the well-being of the children is the priority consideration in the operation of the current payment arrangements and this is reflected in the fact that payment is given to a person with whom the child is normally resident rather than on the basis of formal custody arrangements.  Payment arrangements including in joint custody cases do not normally provide for the splitting of the payment between parties but rather depend on residence arrangements.</p><p>  If the Deputy wishes to have a particular case considered in further detail, he can arrange to have the details brought to the attention of my Department for consideration.</p></reply>

It is essential that our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these challenges.  To this end, and in line with commitments contained in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to examine a number of specific issues.  These include making cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes. </p><p>  The Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the terms of reference.  Within its terms of reference the Advisory Group works on its own initiative and within its own timetable.  The Group is currently examining the issue of working age income supports and the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems.  While a deadline for this module has not been set, the Group is progressing this work with a view to concluding this module as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s report relating to the issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons so as to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable was submitted to me in May 2013.  The implications of this report are currently being considered by me and my Department and the report will assist the Government in considering the appropriate direction of policy on this issue.  While the report is not yet in the public domain, I intend to have this report published in due course and at the appropriate time. </p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s Fraud Initiative 2011 &ndash; 2013 further articulates this overarching policy objective.  A key priority is to ensure that fraudulent activity within the social welfare system is vigorously prevented and combatted.  The approach is one which is aimed at highlighting the rights but, importantly, also the responsibilities of social welfare recipients.  The Initiative recognises the value of the Department working closely and collaboratively with other agencies to ensure that social welfare abuse is deterred and detected.  The approach taken by the Department is frequently reviewed and is regularly adjusted to concentrate on the areas of greatest risk, based on its operational experience and credible information received from industry and business sectors.  The Department&rsquo;s control work is measured in terms of control savings.  Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities.  They are an estimate of the value of the various control activities across the schemes in payment and refer to future expenditure that would have been incurred but for this control work.  Without this control work, social welfare expenditure would over time increase by this amount.  Control savings do not include any cases of departmental or clerical error or any cases where the customer voluntarily told the Department of their altered means or circumstances, which resulted in a change to their rate of payment.  </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s control savings target for 2013 is &euro;710 million which is an increase of &euro;40m on the savings achieved in 2012.  A total of just over &euro;180m was recorded in respect of control savings from January to end of April 2013.</p></reply>

This provides cover for self-employed people for long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widows/widowers pension (contributory).  In addition to the qualifying conditions above, a person must have paid self-employment contributions in respect of at least one contribution year and all self-employment contributions payable must be paid in full. With effect from 1 January 2010, a pension can only be awarded with effect from the date that the claimant has fully discharged all their Class S contribution liabilities,<b></b>even where this date may be after their 66th birthday.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are the primary collection agents of the Department in relation to income tax and outstanding PRSI.  These are aggregated sums and cannot be separated for pension eligibility purposes. These provisions are consistent with the contributory and solidarity principles which underpin the social insurance system. There are no plans to change these provisions.</p><p>  It is worth noting that the recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund found that the self-employed achieve very good value for money from the fund compared with the employed. For those who are unable to meet the qualifying conditions for State pension, the means-tested State pension (non-contributory) may be available to people on low incomes who do not meet the qualifying criteria for State pension. </p></reply>

If a person does not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit they may qualify for means tested jobseeker's allowance.  In 2012 my Department spent some &euro;737m on the scheme and at the end of 2012 there were some 85,000 persons in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment.</p><p>  The provisions governing the payment of PRSI contributions were changed from April 1991 by extending social insurance to cover part time workers.  This change necessitated changes in the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme.  Under the then conditions a part time worker working 3 days per week would have become eligible for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for the days of the week they are not working, even though no loss of employment had occurred.  This would have resulted in their income from social welfare greatly exceeding income from employment &ndash; with a consequent diminution in the incentive to work. </p><p>  In order to avoid this situation, the Social Welfare Act 1992 provided that it would not possible to work part-time and claim jobseeker's benefit unless there has been a reduction in the number of days normally worked each week.  A person is regarded as having sustained a substantial loss of employment if s/he has lost at least one day of insurable employment in any period of 7 days, provided his/her reckonable earnings or reckonable income are also reduced as a consequence of the loss of employment.  It may be noted that these provisions do not apply to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme.</p><p>  There are no plans to change this qualifying condition of the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme as this would have an adverse effect on the incentive to work and would have significant cost implications. </p></reply>

Currently, there are approximately 86,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013. In the case of private rented accommodation, tenancy arrangements involve a contract between the landlord and tenant and tenant behaviour is a matter for the landlord in the first instance. There are a number of avenues open to landlords in such cases, including the mediation service for landlords and tenants operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board and/or recourse to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and/or the Courts in relation to the enforcement of the law in dealing with anti-social or criminal behaviour. If necessary, the landlord may seek termination of the tenancy which, if affected, would result in the termination of rent supplement.   The Programme for Government contains a commitment to review the operation of the rent supplement scheme with a view to introducing a code of conduct for rent supplement eligibility similar to that which operates for local authority tenants.</p><p>  The purpose of this review is to ensure that tenants who are receiving long term support from the State under the rent supplement scheme are subject to the same type of anti-social behaviour regime as local authority tenants. The most appropriate way for this to happen is for local authorities to take over responsibility for meeting the accommodation needs of these individuals. The Department is currently working closely with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government with a view to transferring responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from this Department to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).</p><p>  In addition social welfare legislation already provides the Department with the authority to refuse, suspend or terminate payment of a rent supplement in the case of a person who has been required to deliver up possession of a dwelling provided by a housing authority or an approved body where the reasons for that requirement include anti-social behaviour or the interests of good estate management.</p></reply>

It was introduced in 1999 to replace 'Smallholders Unemployment Assistance' for low income farmers, without the requirement to be available for and genuinely seeking work.  Farm assist recipients retain all the advantages of the jobseeker's allowance scheme such as retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.</p><p>  In Budget 2013 two measures were announced, which were implemented in April 2013, which bring the farm assist scheme into closer alignment with the jobseeker's allowance scheme's treatment of self-employed persons by:</p><p>  a.Increasing the amount of means from self-employment, which is assessed against the claimant from 85% to 100%; and</p><p>  b.Discontinuing the means testing disregards for child dependents of claimants.</p><p>  Farm assist is a flexible payment and any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cash-flow issues, due for example to bad weather, can ask his/her local social welfare / Intreo office to review the level of means applying to his/her claim.</p><p>  The rural social scheme provides income support for farmers and those engaged in fishing who have an entitlement to specified social welfare payments.  Participants are engaged for 19&frac12; hours per week to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.  The scheme currently provides work opportunities for around 2,600 participants and 130 supervisory staff.   </p><p>  The Department of Social Protection has recently published a review of employment support schemes which, together with the outcome of the focused policy assessment of the rural social scheme which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has indicated it intends to conduct this year, will inform future policy developments of the scheme.</p><p>  Any changes to these schemes would be a matter for Government to consider in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

Hence, those seeking seasonal work can avail of the same range of activation measures that are currently available to persons seeking longer-term work.  To this end, in the first four months of this year, there were some 38,100 referrals of unemployed persons (including those seeking seasonal work) to group engagement sessions with DSP&rsquo;s Employment Services.  As part of this process, all job-seekers are advised of the JobsIreland website and Freephone service where employers advertise their vacancies.  These vacancies include seasonal positions.</p><p>  Employers and other commentators have stated that people are wary of taking up short term employment due to the perception that there would be delays getting back into payment when that employment ends. In order to address these concerns and to benefit the many people who wish to avail of temporary work, the Department decided to extend the period for which claims can be temporarily suspended in November 2012.</p><p>  Where a person states that they have found work, it is normal practice for a jobseeker claim to be closed.  However, in cases where the customer is taking up a short period of temporary work or training, arrangements are now in place to simplify the process of signing off and back on at the end of this period. In these cases, instead of closing the claim, the local office temporarily suspends payment for the duration of the work or training.  The period of suspension for temporary work has been increased from four weeks to eight weeks. This harmonises the period with those on temporary training courses.</p><p>  When the person signs on again after the period of work or training, the claim can be reactivated very quickly and payment restored within a few days. It is important for the customer to make clear to the local office in advance that the work or training is expected to last for up to 8 weeks only. Where a period of employment is expected to exceed 8 weeks, the jobseeker&rsquo;s claim is closed in the normal manner.</p><p>  To ensure consistency and uniformity, the treatment of Rent and Mortgage Interest Supplement claims where someone takes up temporary work (up to 8 weeks) is being aligned to Jobseekers schemes.  Customers are advised to contact the office administering the Rent or Mortgage Interest Supplement claim as soon as the employment ends so that their original entitlement can be re-instated without delay. </p></reply>

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including them on the Record of Protected Structures. Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future. </p><p>  Recognising this duty of care placed on owners of protected structures, a number of State financial supports provide for the conservation and restoration of heritage structures in both private and public ownership.

The Structures at Risk Fund is set up to assist with urgent works to safeguard such structures, in private and civic ownership, and in certain cases works to structures within Architectural Conservation Areas.</p><p>  This scheme which is administered by the local authorities has been in operation since 2011 and has encouraged regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helped to secure the preservation of protected structures which may otherwise have been lost.

In this regard, my Department is concentrating its resources on protecting the nesting sites of rare and threatened bird species, including red-throated diver, corncrake, grey partridge, waders and terns, from a range of predators, including mink.   My Department undertook predator control programmes on land it owns or manages in recent years.  &euro;92,000 was spent in 2011 with a further &euro;135,000 spent in 2012.  Expenditure in 2013 is likely to be in the region of the 2012 figure.  However, this covers many predatory species as well as the mink, including also grey crow, magpie and fox.</p><p>  I also provided &euro;20,000 to the National Association of Regional Game Councils (NARGC) to stimulate increased control of mink by game shooting clubs. I consider that this offers a useful addition to the measures already being taken by my Department.  While feral mink are found in most parts of the country, I requested that, as far as possible, special attention should be given to the counties of Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Kerry, where my Department has also concentrated its efforts.  The scheme is operated by the NARGC, with a verification process agreed with my Department.</p><p>  In relation to Kerry in particular, my Department is aware that local gun clubs and landowners are working to address the wild mink situation in the areas identified by the Deputy.  My Department has also provided mink traps to local groups to Kerry to assist them in their work and it will continue to target trapping in priority areas within the resources available to it. </p></reply>

The Strategy promotes a holistic, integrated approach to the Irish language which is consistent with international best practice.  The Strategy sets out nine areas for action, including education, the Gaeltacht, the family, public services, the media, the economy, legislation and various cross-cutting initiatives.  The Strategy recognises that the implementation of the various measures contained therein requires a phased approach.  While my Department has the overarching responsibility for the Strategy, it is working in co-operation with other key stakeholders to implement the Strategy on an incremental basis within available resources.  </p><p>  Since the Strategy was published in December 2010, priority was given during 2011 to implementing the Strategy's establishment phase.  This involved providing information about the Strategy and establishing the structures required for its implementation. Priority was given during 2012 to legislative matters.  The enactment of the Gaeltacht Act 2012 was a significant achievement as it provides for a statutory language planning process, both within and outside the existing Gaeltacht, and for a statutory role in this regard for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge, as appropriate.  It is intended to publish a progress report shortly on the implementation of the Strategy to date, in addition to implementation plans by the key stakeholders. </p><p>  Under the Revised Estimates for 2013, my Department has been allocated almost &euro;57m for the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and the islands.  This includes funding for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the Office of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga and the North South Language Body.  The Language Body consists of Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency and its budget is subject to the approval of the North South Ministerial Council.  </p><p>  Further information with regard to the promotion of the Irish language is available on the following websites: , ,  and   . </p></reply>

The Wildlife Acts provide protection to NHAs through a requirement for certain, potentially damaging activities to obtain Ministerial consent before being undertaken. Turf-cutting, drainage works and afforestation are typically listed as activities that require such consent. </p><p>  As with the case of Special Areas of Conservation, a 10 year derogation was applied to allow domestic turf cutting to continue on NHAs. In May 2010, the previous Government decided that turf-cutting should come to an end on all raised bog NHAs at the end of 2013. </p><p>  However, as set out in the Programme for Government, the current Government undertook to review the situation with regard to raised bog NHAs.  This review is currently underway and the future of turf-cutting on such sites is being considered as part of that review. To assist in this task, my Department has engaged a team of scientific specialists to underpin this review. I hope that the review will be completed in the autumn. </p><p>  NHAs are not subject to the same legal regime under the Habitats Directive that applies to raised bog Special Areas of Conservation (SACs). However, the approach to peat extraction on NHA raised bogs has been raised by the European Commission in the same Reasoned Opinion that was addressed to Ireland in relation to turf-cutting on raised bog SACs. The issue relating to NHAs concerns adherence to the requirements of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive. </p><p>  In this regard it should be noted that the NHA raised bogs were formally designated as part of a resolution to a case where Ireland was found against in the European Court of Justice in relation to inadequate application of the EIA Directive regarding peat extraction. This judgment was made against Ireland in 1999.</p><p>  Therefore, while the Government has more options in regard to the approach that can be taken to the management of NHA raised bogs we will need to work closely with the European Commission to ensure that the approach taken meets our legal obligations. </p><p>  It is my intention that the review of NHAs will provide clarity for turf-cutters and landowners, in advance of the 2014 turf cutting season and my Department will be contacting individual landowners and turf-cutters on these sites once the outcome has been finalised.</p><p>  Issues in relation to NHA raised bogs have been discussed with stakeholders represented at the Peatlands Council</p></reply>

The directive also requires all Member States to achieve a minimum target of 10% renewable energy in the transport sector by 2020.  In order to meet our overall 16% requirement, we aim to achieve 40% in the renewable electricity sector, 12% renewables in the heating sector and the required 10% in transport.</p><p>  Under the Directive, Ireland was required to set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) the trajectory towards meeting its legally binding targets.  The NREAP and the First Progress Report on the NREAP, which are available on my Department's website, show the sectoral and technology breakdown that we anticipate in the achievement of our target.  By the end of 2011, we had reached 6.4% of overall energy consumption from renewable sources and the trajectory set out in the NREAP assumes that we will achieve the 16% target incrementally at approximately 1% per annum.  My Department's Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012 to 2020 sets out the key strategic goals for the various renewable energy sectors.  </p><p>  There are a number of policy measures in place which will help us achieve these goals.  The Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes will see increasing amounts of renewable electricity connected to the grid and, through REFIT3 support for biomass Combined Heat and Power (CHP) technologies, will also help towards our renewable heat target.  Measures such as the Biofuel Obligation Scheme to increase the use of biofuels, and the Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme to incentivise the purchase of new Electric Vehicles are the mechanisms being used to achieve our target for renewable transport.  </p><p>  Policy interventions including ReHeat schemes, energy efficiency schemes and policies, building regulations, REFIT3 for CHP and natural market migration to renewable heating technologies will deliver the majority of the 12% renewable heat target.  In addition, later this year I will be publishing a National Bioenergy Strategy which will outline the role energy from biomass will play to contribute to the achievement of our national targets and, in particular, the target for the heat sector.</p></reply>

The licensing options awarded were preliminary authorisations and were designed to allow the companies assess the shale gas potential of the acreage largely based on desktop studies of existing data. </p><p>  Exploration drilling, including drilling that would involve hydraulic fracturing was not allowed under these Licensing Options.  Two of the three companies, which had been granted onshore licensing options in February 2011, have submitted applications for a follow-on exploration licence.  My Department will initially evaluate these applications, focussing on the technical rationale underpinning the applications, along with the corporate information provided.  Where the outcome of this evaluation is positive, further consideration of the applications will then be put on hold until after the findings of EPA Research Programme have been published.  The key questions to be addressed by this research are, whether this technology can be used while fully protecting the environment and human health, and what the best environmental practice in using this technology might be.</p><p>  The EPA is currently in the process of finalising Terms of Reference to engage the appropriate expertise to consider the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracking.  These draft Terms of Reference have been the subject of a public consultation process and I understand that over a 1,000 submissions were received under this process and these are currently being examined.  It is anticipated that following the engagement of the relevant experts, the study will take considerable time to complete, leading to a potential publication date in 2015.</p><p>  I would like to confirm that any application for an exploration licence submitted to me that proposed the use of hydraulic fracturing as part of an unconventional gas exploration programme would be subject to a full environmental impact assessment.  An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) entails consideration of the potential impacts of a project on population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, including the architectural and archaeological heritage, landscape and the inter-relationship between the above factors.  Under the EIA Directive, it is not possible to permit a project unless it can be determined following assessment that it would not have an unacceptable environmental or social impact.</p><p>  I would also like to confirm that it is not proposed to consider applications for exploration authorisations in respect of other onshore areas until the EPA Research Programme has concluded.</p></reply>

As I have previously outlined to the Deputy, a Value for Money Policy Review has been recently completed by an independently chaired Review Group which considered a range of issues in relation to the proposal, including the efficiency and effectiveness of the current licensing system.  The Report of the Review Group has been submitted to me and I am giving due consideration to the Report and its recommendations in the context of the next steps to be taken in regard to the introduction of the charge.  It is important to note that the proposed charge in not an additional public charge but rather one that is to replace the existing funding system based on the collection of television licence fees with one based on the imposition of device-independent charge on eligible households and businesses. </p><p>  This is a complex process and the logistics involved require thorough attention.  Issues such as identifying those liable for the charge, together with the most appropriate collection method, exemptions and enforcement mechanics require detailed consideration and have a bearing on the timeframe for implementation.  In this context, I should like to confirm at this stage, however, my expectation that the current exemptions in relation to pensioners and those entitled to the Household Benefits Package will continue to apply.</p><p>  When due consideration has been given to all of the issues involved and policy decisions have been made, legislative measures will follow as appropriate.  That said, I expect to be in a position, subject to Government approval, to initiate work in the Autumn on the legislative and other work necessary to implement the household based Public Broadcasting Charge.</p></reply>

This is equivalent to 31,925 Gigawatt hours (GWh) or a reduction in annual CO<sub>2 </sub> emissions of around 7.7 Mega tonnes (Mt).  Recognising that Government must lead by example, we are committed to achieving a 33% reduction in public sector energy use by 2020.</p><p>  Action number 20 of the second Action Plan states that: <i>We will work with public bodies to fulfil their exemplar role with respect to building energy efficiency</i> .  As part of delivering that goal we have committed, inter alia, to developing an inventory of public sector buildings by end 2013; requiring that Display Energy Certificates are prominently displayed in all buildings that are occupied by public bodies over certain defined thresholds; and requiring that all new buildings occupied and owned by public bodies from December 2018 be nearly zero-energy buildings.  The NEEAP requirement therefore is to develop an inventory of public sector buildings and not a national inventory as the Deputy implies. </p><p>  I should also point out that under the Energy Efficiency Directive (2012/27/EU) there is a requirement to publish an inventory of central government buildings over certain size thresholds and outlining their energy performance by 31 December 2013.  Member States have 18 months to transpose the Directive, with a transposition deadline of 5 June 2014.  However, there are a number of policy decisions and reporting requirements to be notified to the Commission in advance of the transposition deadline.  A series of subgroups have been set up with relevant stakeholders in order to progress the transposition of the Directive, with a formal consultation on the transposition and implementation of the Directive expected in Q3.</p><p>  The Office of Public Works (OPW) manages the central government stock of buildings and they already have a register of the buildings they own and lease, which includes detailed energy usage information on about 250 of the larger buildings.  This register includes central government buildings, some agencies and Garda stations.  I understand they are considering adding buildings over 500 square metres over the next year, along with a detailed survey of their large owned office accommodation, about 120 buildings in all.  More generally discussions are ongoing with OPW in relation to our NEEAP targets and related obligations under the Directive.  The staffing and financial costs in relation to the inventory of OPW buildings are a matter for that office.  My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure allocated &euro;9m over three years to the OPW in Budget 2013 to expand their successful <i>Optimising Power at Work</i> campaign to targeted buildings in the wider public sector. </p><p>  As part of our Action Plan for Jobs commitments, we will issue in June this year a mandate to public sector organisations with an annual energy spend of &euro;500,000 or more, to go to the market to identify solutions for the delivery of energy reduction services.  In 2010-2011 the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and my Department developed and launched a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system to record each individual public body's progress towards the 33% target.  A database of over 30,000 meters has been established to enable the accurate gathering of public sector data.  This database is being developed with linkages to the National Procurement service and will lead to better procurement of energy supplies for the public sector.  A report on public sector energy consumption will be published later this year.  </p><p>  Should all measures detailed in the NEEAP reach their full potential by 2020 it is estimated that a potential reduction in energy spend across all sectors of approximately &euro;2.36 billion (at 2011 prices) will be realised.  A very significant element of this will be Exchequer savings in the public sector.</p></reply>

Firstly, jobs are supported directly through initiatives to install energy efficiency technologies and systems (including the manufacture and supply of energy efficiency technologies).  Secondly, energy efficiency gains lead to additional spending power which supports additional induced jobs.  Experience from recent grant schemes suggests that, based on induced labour spend, it can be estimated that almost 450 jobs are directly supported for a year for every &euro;10 million of Exchequer expenditure, rising to 675 when indirect jobs are included.  This is before competitiveness impacts due to reduced energy costs are taken into account.  It is also clear that such investment bolsters the government position in relation to increased take from VAT and employment levies in relation to this activity.</p><p>  In relation to the matter of securing investment at EU level for modern energy infrastructure, the European Commission estimates that the European energy system requires &euro;1 trillion in investment by the year 2020.  At the European Council of 22nd May last, it was noted that significant investments in new and intelligent energy infrastructure are needed to secure the uninterrupted supply of energy at affordable prices and that the financing for such investments should primarily come from the market.  All stakeholders in the European energy system, including Governments, regulators, energy industry and energy consumers, as well as the Europe Union's institutions such as the Commission, have parts to play in ensuring the required investment is achieved.</p><p>  In this context, the implementation of EU Regulation 347/2013 on Guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure, known as the Energy Infrastructure Package, should assist in securing that investment.  The Regulation provides for measures to ensure the timely implementation of major European-scale energy projects, such as the streamlining and acceleration of permitting processes.  It also sets out the conditions for eligibility of these projects for European Union financial assistance under the associated forthcoming EU financial instrument, the Connecting Europe Facility.</p><p>  Regarding the challenge of high electricity and gas prices, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas retail market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Prices in retail markets are fully deregulated.  Prices are set by suppliers and are commercial and operational matters for them.  I have no statutory function in the setting of electricity prices.  Customers can, and should, avail of competitive offerings from electricity and gas suppliers and thereby mitigate the impact of high prices.</p><p>  Electricity and gas prices in Ireland are influenced by various drivers, including global gas and oil prices, the costs of capital, exchange rate fluctuations, the small size of the Irish market, geographical location and low population density.  The most important factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is the continuing upward trend in international gas prices.  This feeds directly through to retail electricity prices, as most of our electricity is produced at gas-fired stations.  International fossil fuel prices are the major influences on Irish retail electricity and gas prices.</p><p>  The competitive energy market in place helps put downward pressure on retail prices.  In addition, we must focus on all possible additional actions to mitigate controllable costs for business and domestic customers, including rigorous regulatory scrutiny of the network costs component of retail prices.  Action in these areas reduces Ireland's exposure to uncontrollable, and on occasion high, prices of imported fuels.</p><p>  As well as its positive job creation potential, energy efficiency is an area within our control where action can be taken to reduce energy costs.  There are energy efficiency schemes in place to assist business and domestic electricity and gas consumers, including the forthcoming Energy Efficiency Fund and programmes administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  Additionally, the promotion of indigenous sustainable sources of energy can help offset the impact of volatile fossil fuel prices.  The Government has a renewable electricity target of 40% by 2020.  Good progress has been made in meeting this target and its realisation will introduce more certainty in the energy fuel mix as well as security of supply.</p></reply>

Under EU State Aid rules, the State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme are examples of two such interventions.  Under the NBS, basic broadband services are available in 1,028 Electoral Divisions throughout the country.  With more specific reference to  the areas of County Kerry mentioned above, NBS services are available in 4 of the 6 relevant Electoral Divisions, namely St. Finan's, Ballinskelligs, Teeranearagh and Emlagh.</p><p>  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services as outlined in the Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last.  It aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU's target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department will shortly embark on a formal mapping exercise to identify those areas where State intervention will be required to enable the delivery of high speed broadband services over the coming years in line with the commitments set out in the Plan.  This exercise will inform an EU State Aids application in respect of the State-led intervention and is a necessary prerequisite for State Aids approval. </p><p>  In devising any State intervention to deliver high speed services to areas of the country where such services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market, my Department will be adopting a technology neutral approach, as required under EU law.  In doing so, it is of key importance that the solution is future proofed, scalable and capable of taking advantage of technological advances so as to meet the ever-increasing bandwidth requirements of citizens and businesses.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses, wherever they are located, have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business in the digital environment.</p></reply>

To date, these media have not been subject to a formal regulatory regime akin to that used to "regulate" traditional radio and television broadcast media, either in Ireland or in other jurisdictions.  There is a range of reasons for this, not least the rapidly evolving nature of the technologies involved, the sensitivities around regulating media and the multi-jurisdictional nature of the Internet.  </p><p>  It is important to acknowledge the economic and social benefits that the widespread use of social media have brought to people, communities and to business.  However, some of the issues that have arisen as a consequence of this bear consideration.  These challenges include dealing with harassment and bullying online, as well as issues around defamation, data protection and copyright.  There has been a very considerable amount of discussion on these matters in the recent past at EU and Council of Europe level, in which my Department has been involved.  This matter is also the subject of a fundamental debate at EU and national level, a fact reflected by the recent decision of the Joint Oireachtas Committee to examine the issue.  I await the Committee's report in this respect. </p><p>  As Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I have policy responsibility for providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment to facilitate the development of high quality communications infrastructure and services.  However, I should highlight that I do not have sole responsibility for addressing as to how that infrastructure is used.  Responsibility, in the context of abuse over the Internet in particular, also sits with the Minister for Justice and Equality, and the executive agency of his Department, the Office for Internet Safety.  It is clear that there are no simple answers to the challenges posed by the development and abuse of social media, not least because of the international basis of the services and because any possible policy responses fall across a range of Government Departments.  In recognition of this complexity my Department maintains open and regular contact with all Departments and State Agencies with responsibilities in this area.</p><p>  The sheer volume of material posted on social media daily is such that formal policing is not feasible, an issue complicated by the international and multi-jurisdictional nature of the internet.  Also, the operators of these networks have only limited liability for such material &ndash; they are generally required to remove offensive material once they have been notified but this does not prevent it from being seen in the interim.  This has obvious implications in terms of material that breaches copyright, or is offensive or harmful in some way.

The average price at the pumps at the start of November 2012 for diesel was &euro;1.57 per litre, while the average price for unleaded petrol was &euro;1.64 per litre.  By the end of April 2013, the average price for diesel at the pumps was &euro;1.51 per litre, while for unleaded petrol it was &euro;1.59 per litre and, more recently, has fallen somewhat further.</p><p>  A study into motor fuel prices at the pumps was carried out by the National Consumer Agency in 2008 in their <i>Investigation into Petrol and Diesel Price Movements.  </i>Among the main findings were that:</p><p>- There is little evidence to suggest unwarranted delays in the passing on of wholesale price changes to the consumer at the pump.</p><p>- Direct comparison between fluctuations in crude oil prices and petrol and diesel pump prices is inappropriate and does not reflect the reality of the petrol and diesel supply chain.  To more accurately assess flow through of price changes in refined oil products (such as petrol and diesel) to the consumer, it is necessary to compare fluctuations in Platts prices, these being the prices for refined oil products such as petrol and diesel paid by wholesalers, and prices at the forecourt pump (Platts is a provider of energy information including crude oil and refined prices.)</p><p>- Platts prices and wholesale prices should differ by a margin comprising the impact of exchange rates, taxes, transportation and associated costs.  The subsequent difference between wholesale and pump prices is typically dictated by the purchasing power of the end retailer (discounts accrue based on volumes purchased, membership of a &quot;branded&quot; chain etc.) and an allowance for the retailer's margin.</p><p>- Analyses of these fluctuations over the time period of this study suggest a strong correlation between Platts prices and wholesale price fluctuations and the price of diesel and petrol at the pump, allowing for changes in the euro/dollar exchange rates. </p><p>- A large proportion of the pump price of fuel in this country comprises taxes and duties.  The manner of their calculation can depress overall pump cost savings to consumers, notwithstanding drops in the underlying cost of the refined fuel product.   </p><p>- Overall, Ireland's service station/retail petrol and diesel supply market would appear to be competitive by international standards.</p></reply>

The intention is to reach Ireland's overall target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heating, which together amount to 16% of all energy consumption.</p><p>  Under the Renewables Directive, Ireland was required to set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) the trajectory towards meeting its legally binding target.  The NREAP and the First Progress Report on the NREAP, which are available on my Department's website, show the sectoral and technology breakdown that we anticipate in the achievement of our target.  Wind generated electricity is expected to play a major role. </p><p>  Wind energy is the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target.  However, if we are to reach that target, the build rate of onshore wind farms must accelerate from an historic average of 180 MW per year to at least 250 MW per year.

Following an extensive mapping exercise and a competitive tendering process, my Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS.  The Scheme offers a basic and affordable broadband service to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated rural areas.</p><p>  In accordance with the EU State Aid clearance for the Scheme, the NBS is for a limited duration.  The contract is due to terminate in August 2014.  Following the expiry of the Scheme, operational decisions such as those relating to pricing, data allowance and infrastructure will be a matter for &ldquo;3&rdquo;.  Any regulatory issues surrounding these matters that may arise will be a matter for ComReg which is independent in the exercise of its functions.  My officials are currently in talks with &ldquo;3&rdquo; regarding the services that will be available after August 2014.</p><p>  More generally, considerable progress has been made in recent years in both the coverage and speeds of national broadband infrastructure, with a multiplicity of commercial operators providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms and offering increased choice to consumers throughout the country.  The Government, through the National Broadband Plan, which I published on 30th   August last year, has recognised that the key imperative now is to ensure high speed broadband availability to all.  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country by ensuring that high speed services of 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  Ireland is now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband in Ireland which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  There is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which they committed in the Plan.</p><p>  The Government is committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In tandem with commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.</p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department will shortly embark on a formal mapping exercise to identify the areas of the country to be targeted in the State-led investment under the Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan to ensure the provision of high speed broadband services where the commercial market will not deliver.  This exercise will inform an EU State Aids application in respect of the State-led intervention and is a necessary prerequisite for State Aids approval.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p></reply>

The benefit of addressing such recognised data gaps was identified by my Department officials when providing evidence to the former Joint Committee in the context of the preparation of the Committee&rsquo;s report.</p><p>  The survey, which commenced earlier this month, will be undertaken by ENI Ireland BV in conjunction with my Department, with data acquisition carried out by seismic contractor BGP, using the vessel the BGP Explorer.  The estimated cost of the survey is in the region of &euro;20 million which includes the cost of data acquisition, data processing, along with planning and management costs. My Department will pay 25% of the data acquisition costs, with Eni paying the balance.  My Department&rsquo;s contribution will be paid from a research fund into which exploration licence holders are obliged to make prescribed annual contributions. Eni will carry out the data processing.</p><p>  Applications for petroleum exploration authorisations over areas of Ireland&rsquo;s Atlantic margin are invited from time to time through open competitive licensing rounds.  Award of licences is on the basis of published evaluation criteria and this practice will continue.

I was happy to be able to report two early successes: we secured early agreement on the re-use of Public Sector Information which will improve the availability of publicly-held information by removing barriers to its access which will facilitate the development of new services and innovative products.</p><p>  I also reported on the agreement of a new mandate for the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA).  As a result of our leadership on this issue we now have the basis for a more robust, reinforced agency, better able to meet the technological challenges and demands facing the EU now and in the future.</p><p>  I presented my Council colleagues with progress reports on the files relating to proposals on Trans-European Networks for telecommunications (as part of the Connecting Europe Facility), on reducing the costs associated with broadband roll-out and on the issue of web-accessibility, particularly in relation to public sector websites.  I also reported on substantial progress on the complex but very important area of the draft Regulation on electronic identification and trust services, one of the most important building blocks in any properly-functioning digital single market.</p><p>  The Council also held two debates.  One was an orientation debate on the recently-published Directive on National Information Security. The purpose of this debate was for the Council to give to both the Commission and to the incoming Lithuanian Presidency some clear guidance in terms of how the important issue of cyber security should be dealt with within the EU and what policy priorities should be pursued.</p><p>  The main debate at Council was a policy debate on the proposed Single Telecoms Market (STM).  This debate afforded the Council an opportunity to reflect on progress to-date in relation to achieving a Digital Single Market and give direction to the Commission in advance of its anticipated draft Regulation on STM due to be published in July.  In addition, it also allowed the Council to set out its priorities ahead of next October&rsquo;s European Council, which will specifically focus on digital and innovation.  In my role as President of the Telecoms&rsquo; Council, I will be writing to President Van Rompuy setting out the main policy priorities as expressed by my Council colleagues.  </p></reply>

The proposal is intended, among other measures, to limit the production of conventional biofuels due to the impact of indirect land-use change (ILUC) on greenhouse gas emissions resulting from biofuels, and incentivising the production of advanced biofuels that have no ILUC effects.  The report sets out the progress made under the Irish Presidency in trying to establish a Council position in advance of negotiations with the European Parliament to reach an agreement under the co-decision process.</p><p>  Council Conclusions on the Commission&rsquo;s Communication, &ldquo;Making the Internal Energy Market Work&rdquo;, were adopted by Ministers. During discussions on this point, Ministers took stock of the conclusions adopted by Heads of State and Government at the European Council on 22 May, which highlighted completion of the internal energy market (including development of interconnections to end isolation of Member States from energy networks), investments in energy infrastructure, the diversification of energy sources, and enhanced energy efficiency as the main issues to be addressed in order to foster competitiveness and respond to the challenges of high energy prices.  The detailed Council Conclusions adopted by Energy Ministers build on the European Council Conclusions of 22 May and provide guidance on the tasks ahead, e.g. completion of the internal market, elimination of energy isolation, improved rights and roles of consumers, and the transition to the energy market of the future.</p><p>  Concerning the Commission&rsquo;s Communication on Energy Technologies and Innovation, the Energy Council held an extensive debate on the need for increased focus on innovation policy to address research and development, the deployment of new technologies, and the putting in place of support mechanisms for accelerated roll-out and implementation of sustainable energy technologies.  There was also discussion on how to improve and reinforce the existing institutional frameworks in order to support a more integrated approach to innovation and technology development, including strengthening the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan.</p><p>  Ministers were also briefed on international relations in the field of energy. I briefed Ministers on developments in the International Energy Agency, and on the Clean Energy Ministerial meeting, which took place in India in April.  The Commission briefed Ministers on issues such as developments in relation to the Southern Gas Corridor, on relations with Ukraine and on relations with Russia.</p><p>  Finally, the Council was informed of the energy policy priorities of the Lithuanian Presidency under the heading of &lsquo;Growing Europe&rsquo;. </p><p>  In noting a successful conclusion to Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency in the field of energy at the Energy Council last week, I took the opportunity to wish every success to the incoming Lithuanian Presidency and stated that responsible development of our energy resources, and innovation in the ways in which we consume them, are vital to maintaining European competitiveness and keeping prices down for both households and business.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware this has been attributed, among anglers and other stakeholders, to sea lice from marine salmon farms.  The collapse of the sea trout stocks was seen in terms of adult breeding fish as well as the annual summer small &lsquo;finnock&rsquo;. </p><p>  I am advised by IFI that in certain recent years there has been a slight recovery in sea trout numbers but this has primarily been in summer finnock returning to the fisheries. Unfortunately these do not contribute in any significant way to the egg deposition in the fishery and larger more mature fish are required to contribute in any meaningful way to the spawning stock of the fishery. </p><p>  IFI further advise that there is an indication of improved sea trout runs in western fisheries in 2012.  The overall reported sea trout rod catch in the Connemara and Ballinakill Districts rose to 3,573 sea trout, the highest reported catch since 2008.  Higher catches were made over the 1998-2001 period and catch levels have shown a fluctuating pattern since the collapse in the late 1980&rsquo;s. </p><p>  While there is some indication of improved catches in 2012, catch levels, and most likely overall population structure, have not returned to anything close to pre-collapse levels. The latest scientific advice is that the recovery in the crucial adult breeding population and the key fish driving the stocks has not occurred.  These key fish would have gone to the sea over several different years or remained in the sea over winter and have grown to a size capable of producing a significant number of eggs to contribute towards the future of the stocks. </p><p>  The adult stocks of sea trout have not recovered and consequently the conservation imperative overrides any desire to recommence angling involving the killing of fish.  In this regard the longer term trends in stock health and numbers is taken to determine conservation strategies.  The ban on the killing of sea trout remains in place as a strategic reality based on the need to recover the stock. </p><p>  I would advise the Deputy that the Lough Inagh Fishery to which he refers produced 2,000 sea trout retained by rod and line prior to the collapse.  Similar catches were taken downstream at Ballynahinch Castle.  This was indicative of in the region of 20,000 sea trout returning to the system each year.  The stocks have not recovered to anywhere near this level and the adult breeding fish stocks remain very low. </p><p>  It will only be after a sustained recovery in the larger year classes of fish that any changes in the regulations could be responsibly contemplated.  The continued ban on killing sea trout in these districts will contribute significantly to the recovery of stocks.</p></reply>

It applies to a residential property which is not used as the owner&rsquo;s sole or main residence, with limited exemptions.The Local Property Tax (LPT) is payable in respect of all residential properties, subject to certain exemptions.  It is administered by the Revenue Commissioners. Liability for the LPT arises where a person owns a residential property on the liability date which is 1 May 2013 for the year 2013 and, for subsequent years, 1 November in the preceding year (that is, the liability date for 2014 is 1 November 2013).  The tax will be based on the chargeable value (market value) of a residential property on the valuation date.   The inter-Departmental Group chaired by Dr Don Thornhill on the design of a property tax (the &ldquo;Thornhill Group&rdquo;) recommended that the NPPR should be absorbed into the LPT as a separate supplemental tax, in addition to the LPT at the standard level applying to non-principal private residences.  The Government did not accept this recommendation.  The NPPR Charge will be collected in 2013, when a half-year LPT applies, but will be discontinued thereafter.  The Government decided to extend the NPPR Charge into 2013 to ensure as smooth a transition as possible for local authorities pending the introduction of the full LPT.  As the Government had decided that the NPPR Charge would only apply for one further year, it made sense for the NPPR Charge and the LPT to be administered separately.</p><p>  As set out in the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, liability to pay the NPPR is determined on the basis of ownership of the property in question on the &quot;liability date&quot;, which is 31 March for 2013.  The LPT does not come into effect until 1 July 2013. </p><p>  The Household Charge and the NPPR charge co-existed in 2012 and certain properties would have been liable to both charges.</p></reply>

The Local Authority Members (Gratuity) (Amendment) Regulations, 2006 allows the gratuity to be paid before age 50 where retirement is due to permanent infirmity or where the member dies in office. </p><p>  The amount of the gratuity is calculated on the basis of <sup>4</sup>/<sub>20</sub><sup>ths</sup>   of a Councillor's Representational Payment for each year of service from 4 May 2000, subject to a maximum twenty years' service (i.e. four times the amount of the Representational Payment at the time of retirement).</p><p>  An additional ex-gratia payment may be made to Councillors serving on or after the date of the making of the 2006 Regulations in respect of service before 4 May 2000. The rates to be applied are dependent on the number of years' service and the category of local authority in which the Councillor served. Circular Letter S.3/2007 of 22 January 2007, issued by my Department, set the rate of payment of the ex-gratia payment at &euro;714.23 for each year of service up to 20 years' service with a County Council or what was at the time a County Borough Corporation, at &frac12; this rate for service with what was at the time a Borough Corporation or an Urban District Council, and at &frac14; this rate for service as a Town Commissioner. For service in excess of 20 years prior to 4 May 2000, the foregoing rates are reduced by <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub><sup>rd</sup> for each additional year of service up to 20 years.</p><p>  There is an overall limit of 40 years' service for the gratuity and ex-gratia payment combined, with the service reckoned for the purposes of a gratuity calculated first and the residual number of years being used to calculate any ex-gratia payment.</p></reply>

During 2010 and 2011 it became evident that a significant number of Local Development Companies (LDCs) who were contracted to deliver the Programme were not committing funds at the level required to ensure that all the funding would be allocated by the December 2013 deadline in line with EU Regulations. Similarly it became clear that a number of LDCs were more than capable of allocating additional funding if it was made available. </p><p>  In this regard, in January 2012 my Department notified all LDCs that the original LDC allocations awarded in 2009 were no longer valid and that the Programme was being opened up on a &lsquo;first-come first served&rsquo; basis to all LDCs in order to ensure that all the available funding would be allocated to eligible projects within the timeframe allowed. All LDCs were encouraged to maximise the opportunity this created for them. Some companies availed of this more than others. </p><p>  During 2011, the European Commission approved a change in the maximum co-funding rate from 55% to 85% for the LEADER elements of Ireland&rsquo;s RDP but only for expenditure incurred in 2012 and 2013. This had the effect of reducing the available funding under the Programme from &euro;427 million to an estimated &euro;370 million which is a 13% reduction. </p><p>In addition in late 2012 and early 2013 after repeated requests from many LDCs I agreed to allow significant additional programme funds to be assigned to the Basic Services Measure, over &euro;19 million in total.   </p><p>In January 2013 in light of all the changes to the Programme outlined above it became necessary to carry out a comprehensive review of the level of commitments and expenditure across the various measures of the Programme in order to apportion the remaining funds among the LDCs taking into account the level of commitments already entered into.   </p><p>  As a first step I released &euro;42 million worth of projects which had been approved by the Boards of the LDCs asking them to progress projects that were in a position to proceed. Unfortunately only &euro;25.5 million in that category had all the necessary approvals in place to proceed to contract. </p><p>Using an estimated final programme allocation of &euro;370 million, the total spend to date and outstanding commitments (commitments that were under contractual arrangements) under the Programme were established and deducted from the &euro;370m. &euro;6 million was provided for the former MFG legacy files, new Gaeltacht projects and associated administration costs. Funding was also provided for projects that were greater than &euro;150,000 in value that had been submitted to my Department for assessment. The original percentage of the Programme which was awarded to each LDC in 2009 was then applied to apportion the remaining funding among all LDCs. Where an LDC would receive less than 80% of its original allocation (bearing in mind that the overall Programme complement has been reduced by approximately 13%) an adjustment was made to maintain the revised allocation at 80% of the original.   </p><p>  If my Department had not adjusted the allocations to ensure that all LDCs received at least 80% of their original allocation a number of companies would have experienced higher reductions and in that context the allocations were calculated in the fairest possible manner. </p><p>  The Company referred to in the questions was notified of its allocation on 20 May 2013. It received 82.47% of its original Programme allocation (bearing in mind that the overall Programme allocation has been reduced by approximately 13%). Of the 35 LDCs 12 received a lower percentage of their original Programme allocation that the Company in question. </p></reply>

The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for such developments. This mapping of suitable locations is carried out through the development plan process which makes extensive statutory provision for public consultation. Planning legislation provides for extensive public notification of proposed development at the development management stage. For example, article 17 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 - 2010 requires an applicant to erect a site notice in order to lodge a valid application for planning permission. Article 19 of the Regulations requires that this notice must be placed in a conspicuous position on or near the main entrance from a public road to the land or structure concerned, so as to be easily visible and legible by persons using the public road. Alternatively, if the land or structure does not adjoin a public road, the site notice should be placed so as to be easily visible and legible by persons outside the land or structure. </p><p>The site notice must contain the date on which the site notice is erected and state that the planning application may be inspected or purchased at the offices of the planning authority and that a submission or observation in relation to the application may be made to the authority in writing, on payment of the prescribed fee, within the 5 weeks beginning on the date of receipt by the planning authority of the application. The applicant must erect the site notice no sooner than<b></b>  2 weeks before making the application for permission in order to facilitate third party inspection of the application. Where it appears to a planning authority that any notice does not comply with these requirements they may require the applicant to give further notice and evidence in relation to compliance with such a requirement.</p><p>Article 18 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2006 also provides that a notice be published in a newspaper approved for this purpose. Each planning authority must decide which newspapers should be included on their approved list of newspapers in order to ensure that the newspapers used for the purpose of such notices have a sufficiently large circulation in its functional area.</p><p>In addition the planning authority must, under section 34(3) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, have regard to any observations or submissions received concerning the proposed development in accordance with the relevant regulations. </p><p>Furthermore, any person who makes a submission to the planning authority may appeal the decision of the planning authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The Board in some instances, at its own discretion, holds oral hearings in relation to cases being considered by it, further adding to the opportunities to participate in the decision-making process. </p><p>  The EIA Directive, Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment as amended by Council Directive 97/11/EC of 3 March 1997, Directive 2003/35/EC of 26 May 2003 and Directive 2009/31/EC of 23 April 2009, now codified in Directive 2011/92/EU of 13 December 2011, is designed to ensure that projects likely to have significant effects on the environment are subject to a comprehensive assessment of environmental effects prior to development consent being given. EIA provisions in relation to planning consents, including for wind energy developments that come within the scope of the Directive, are currently contained in the Planning and Development Act, 2000, as amended, (Part X), and in Part 10 of the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001, as amended. </p><p>An EIA must identify, describe and assess the effects of a proposed development on various factors, including, inter alia:   </p><p>  -  human beings, fauna and flora;</p><p>  -  soil, water, air, climate and the landscape; and,</p><p>  -  material assets and the cultural heritage. </p><p>The Directive further requires that EIA be carried out in an open and transparent manner with the public and bodies with specific environmental responsibility being given an opportunity to comment and participate in the process of assessment. The public concerned and persons with sufficient interest must also be given an opportunity to challenge the substantive and procedural legality of the final decision.   </p><p>I am - in conjunction with the nister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders - undertaking a targeted review of certain aspects of the Wind Energy Guidelines 2006 in order to ensure that Ireland continues to meet its renewable energy targets and, at the same time, that wind energy does not have negative impacts on local communities. </p><p>This focused review is examining the manner in which the Guidelines address key issues of community concern such as noise, proximity and visual amenity and any other potential impacts, as considered appropriate, as well as ways of building community support for wind energy development. </p><p>All statutory planning guidelines issue first in draft form for a public consultation over a period of a couple of months. Once the consultation period is closed the submissions received on the draft guidelines are considered and taken into account in the final form of the guidelines. The draft guidelines will - like all other new or revised guidelines - go out for extensive public consultation for a period of 6 weeks to 2 months. The indicative timetable for the publication of the draft guidelines is Quarter 4 2013.   </p></reply>

As part of the review a public consultation process has been initiated and will close on 12 June 2013. All submissions received on foot of this consultation will be given full consideration by myself and my colleague the nister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It is intended that the review process, including legislative amendments if any, will be completed before the end of this year. It would be inappropriate to anticipate any outcomes of the review process in advance of its conclusion.   </p><p>However, it should be noted that s et closed periods for the spreading of fertilisers, including slurry, are a mandatory requirement of the Nitrates Directive. The purpose of closed periods is to protect ground and surface water bodies, including drinking water sources, by prohibiting the application of fertilisers when such application poses an unacceptable risk to water courses. Good agricultural practice involves the application of fertilisers as early as practicable in the growing season in order to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and to minimise pollution to water.</p></reply>

The licences were valid from 2 April 2001 for 4 years and allowed the company to carry out investigations into seabed sediment, as well as measuring wave, tide, current and silt load. The application for the licences had been the subject of consultation with statutory bodies and the public in early 2000 prior to the decision to grant the licences. </p><p>  In order to construct a windfarm on the foreshore, a lease under the Foreshore Act is required, as well as consents from the Commission for Energy Regulation (a Licence to Generate Electricity and an Authorisation to Construct a Generating Station). Planning permission in respect of any land-based infrastructure associated with the development is also necessary. An application for a foreshore lease for the construction of a windfarm with more than 5 turbines or having a total output greater than 5 MW must be accompanied by an Environmental Impact Statement and where required a Natura Impact Statement. </p><p>The Kish Consortium, now operating as the Kish Offshore Wind Ltd. and Bray Offshore Wind Ltd., both part- owned by Saorgus Energy Ltd.,   lodged an application for a foreshore lease to develop a windfarm on the Kish and Bray Banks with my Department in 2009. These banks are approximately 10km from the Dublin and Wicklow coasts. The company recently published an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in respect of the proposal. A public consultation process is currently on-going. However, this application will not be assessed by my Department or the Marine Licence Vetting Committee until the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) has been published. </p><p>The assessment that will be carried out by my Department will have regard to the information contained in the application, the EIS, the OREDP and the associated Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment.   </p><p>  In carrying out an assessment of an application of this nature, my Department is also required to consider submissions or observations made by the public and the bodies prescribed following a consultation period of 8 weeks duration. </p><p>  If granted, the terms of a Foreshore lease for an offshore wind project will address such matters as environmental standards, construction methodology, good management of the facility, fees payable as well as standard legal clauses regarding issues such as warranties, insurance and indemnities. </p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate legislative and funding arrangements in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation.</p><p>My Department provides 100% capital funding to housing authorities for Traveller-specific accommodation. This funding stream is designed to meet the specific distinct accommodation needs of the Traveller community, such as halting sites and group housing schemes. In recent years, a portion of the overall capital allocation was held in reserve by my Department for the purposes of recouping to housing authorities the purchase cost of houses which were required to meet the accommodation needs of Traveller families with specific categories of need.</p><p>In accordance with the Housing Needs Assessments carried out by local authorities, the accommodation needs of Travellers can be provided for by way of standard social housing, Traveller-specific group housing or residential caravan parks and halting sites. The majority of Traveller families are accommodated in standard housing provided by local authorities or in private rented accommodation with Rent Supplement support. In submitting proposals under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Investment Programme (SHIP) for the construction and acquisition of social housing , it is a matter for each local authority to determine the particular housing need to be met in each case. Given that the standard housing needs of all categories of persons, including Travellers, are already catered for under SHIP, I do not propose to expand the Traveller Accommodation Programmes to include standard housing provision.</p><p>In keeping with the conditions which apply to capital budgets in general, unspent allocations in respect of Traveller accommodation may not be rolled over into the next financial year. The capital allocations in respect of Traveller-specific accommodation over the period 2009-2012 and the amounts recouped are set out in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th>County

The Charges operate on a self-assessment basis . The 2009 and 2011 Acts place the Charges under the care and management of the local authorities, and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority. Interpretation of the legislation may be a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately may be a matter for the Courts.</p><p>  The definitions of &lsquo;residential property&rsquo; used in the 2009 and 2011 Acts are very similar . Under the 2009 and 2011 Acts &ldquo;residential property&rdquo; is defined as a &ldquo;...building that is situated in the State and that is occupied, or suitable for occupation, as a separate dwelling , whether or not the occupier shares, or would be entitled to share... any accommodation, amenity or facility with any other person   ...&rdquo;  The definitions provided by the 2009 and 2011 Acts make specific reference to the status of a residential property as a &lsquo;separate dwelling &rsquo; , which suggests that individual liable properties must have their own independent access and facilities . The definition s also make it clear that the sharing of a common area or areas does not necessarily exclude a property from liability for either Charge.   Certain types of dwelling may share common areas , such as apartments and flats, but remain liable. </p><p>  There are a number of indicators as to what makes a property suitable for occupation for the purposes of determining liability to either Charge. The indicators include the structure of the property, whether or not it has a roof, whether or not it is so affected by dampness as to render it unsuitable for habitation, and whether or not it has sanitary facilities, including a water closet and water supply. A property that is not suitable for occupation should not be regarded as a residential property within the meaning of either   the 2009 or the 2011 Act s and would not therefore be liable for the Non Principal Private Residence C harge or the Household Charge.  The Household Charge has been replaced by the Local Property Tax in 2013. 2013 is also the final year of the operation of the Non Principal Private Residence Charge.   </p></reply>

The making and amendment of such an allocation scheme is a reserved function of the elected members of each housing authority.  The social housing allocation regulations 2011, which came into effect on 1 May 2011, set out the conditions that housing authorities must take into account when making their allocation schemes including the manner of allocation and order of priority for their authority.  This provides Dublin City Council with the relevant legislative basis to underpin their move to the new system.  Housing authorities may pursue the &ldquo;time on the list&rdquo; approach under the current regulations.</p><p>  The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.  In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing.  I am monitoring expenditure under my Department&rsquo;s housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the rental accommodation scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to identify suitable housing units for social purposes and this process is on-going.</p></reply>

Each housing authority also has a statutory duty to adopt and review an anti-social behaviour strategy for the prevention and reduction of anti-social behaviour in its housing stock, which must provide for co-operation with other relevant bodies, notably the Garda&iacute;, who have a range of measures in place to deal with allegations of such behaviour generally.</p><p>  Proposals for a Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill currently being developed in my Department include a new procedure that will enable housing authorities to recover possession of their dwellings from households in serious breach of their tenancy agreements, including engagement in anti-social behaviour.

Since then the Commission has been working towards the publication of a report that will inform policies and strategies to support the economic development of rural Ireland into the future.  The Commission, led by its chair, Mr. Pat Spillane, has been engaging in an extensive schedule of meetings with stakeholder groups and the public over recent months looking at the many issues that affect life in rural Ireland at present.</p><p>The Commission is also conducting a parallel research process and has invited interested parties to make submissions directly to it via its website at  There is also an option to complete an online questionnaire.

This is intended to ensure that Ireland continues to manage its fire risk effectively and that our success in reducing fire fatalities, at their lowest level for four decades in 2012, continues.  KCS includes, <i>inter alia</i>, the re-alignment of structures to deliver effective fire services.  This provides for fire services to remain as a local authority function, but service delivery is to be reshaped from the current 30 fire services to 21, with 14 single fire authorities and seven shared services.  Longford/Westmeath, including Athlone Fire Authority, is included among the shared services.</p><p>  There is significant experience among fire authorities of delivering aspects of their services on a shared service basis.  This experience, coupled with the work already underway to integrate fire services in Tipperary, Limerick and Waterford, will provide a solid basis for developing an appropriate model of shared services for fire authorities, based on populations in the range of 120,000 to 200,000.</p><p>  KCS is based on a risk management approach, which addresses the critical elements of fire prevention, protection and response.  Each fire service is currently undertaking an initial risk categorisation process for its functional area in line with the provisions of KCS.  In order to maintain local political accountability for fire services to the community, section 26 of the Fire Services Acts provides that it is a reserved function of local authorities, which maintain a fire brigade, to adopt fire and emergency operations plans indicating the provision made in respect of organisation, appliances, equipment, fire stations, training, operational procedure and any such matters as may be relevant.  The risk categorisation process and the emerging best practice models mentioned above will help inform future local decision-making in this regard.</p><p>  On the issue of calls for assistance in cases involving cardiac arrest, arrangements for the receipt of, and response to, emergency calls when medical assistance is required are matters in the first instance for the HSE/Department of Health.  It is not policy currently to have fire service personnel mobilised and deployed to undertake the statutory functions of other agencies, other than in the Dublin area where, by a specific agreement, Dublin Fire Brigade provides an emergency medical service for a large part of the City and surrounding counties.</p><p>  In relation to 999/112 telephone calls for fire service assistance, callers are questioned by trained operators in the three Regional Communications Centres to determine the nature of the incident, location, whether people are at risk etc.  The response to emergency calls is then based on the particular incident type at the location given. The Pre-Determined Attendance, PDA, is an initial turnout dispatched by the Regional Control Centre, but this can be varied by the officer-in-charge in light of available information.  The PDAs are set down by the Chief Fire Officer for each fire authority.  However, in light of the desire for consistent service provision, there is now detailed, at Appendix A of the KCS policy document, a set of national PDAs for different categories of incident types.  It is expected that each fire service will undertake a review in the context of the national PDAs and make any necessary adjustments.</p></reply>

The self-assessed charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  Section 4(6) of the 2009 Act provides an exemption in circumstances in which a residential property is occupied free of rent as the sole or main residence by a person who is a relative of the property&rsquo;s owner, and in which the owner resides elsewhere.

In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.

It may not be legally or constitutionally feasible to provide a power to the Office of the Planning Regulator to re-open historical planning decisions.</p><p>  The Final Report of the Mahon Planning Tribunal revealed a number of instances in which the planning system failed to uphold the principles of proper planning and sustainable development.  The Government has made clear its commitment to responding comprehensively to the Tribunal&rsquo;s recommendations, including, most notably, by establishing an independent planning regulator.  While the work of the Tribunal is now at an end the Government is committed to continuing to reform our planning system in order to restore and maintain public confidence and ensure that the principles of proper planning and sustainable development are fully respected.  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to money trails I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s notice to the most recent published report of the Revenue Commissioners which, in dealing with Special Investigations, records that to date &euro;43 million has been secured in relation to the Moriarty/Mahon Tribunals.</p></reply>

Since the commencement of the Act any person not being so registered who uses the title architect (either alone or in combination with any other words or letters, or name, title or description) may be guilty of an offence which, on summary conviction, may result in a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or both.</p><p>  With effect from 1 March 2014 the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2013 will require, among other things, that design drawings demonstrating compliance with the requirements of the second schedule to the building regulations be lodged with the local building control authority prior to commencement of works and that a registered professional be assigned to inspect the implementation of the design during construction so that he/she is in a position to certify the completed building for compliance with the requirements of the second schedule to the building regulations.  The statutory certificates of completion underpinning the procedures outlined must be signed by a registered professional i.e. a person who is included on the statutory registers of architects or building surveyors maintained in accordance with parts 3 and 5 respectively of the Building Control Act 2007 or on the register of chartered engineers established under the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland (Charter Amendment) Act 1969.</p><p>  Architects, building surveyors and chartered engineers are the construction professions typically involved in the design of construction works in Ireland and reference to these professions in regulation is entirely appropriate.  It is open to persons, including members of the Architect&rsquo;s Alliance of Ireland, the Group of Independent Architects of Ireland and the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists, who possess the requisite experience and competence in the design of buildings , to seek inclusion on either of the statutory registers of architects or building surveyors as established under Part 3 and Part 5 respectively of the Building Control Act 2007.  Inclusion on either register will enable a person to sign statutory certificates of compliance as provided for under the new regulations when they come into effect on and from 1 March 2014.</p><p>  I have recently asked Mr. Garrett Fennell, solicitor, who is currently serving as the chairperson of the admissions board relevant to the register of architects, to carry out an independent review of the experience to date in relation to the operation of the register with a view to identifying any further improvements that can be made at this point.  The terms of reference for the review specifically address the matter of how the registration of practically trained architects can be further encouraged and I look forward to any recommendations and views the review report may offer in this regard in the coming months.</p></reply>

The Government has also decided that Irish Water, a new State-owned water company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group, will be responsible for the metering programme.  In common with meters for other utility services, the meters will be the property of Irish Water which will also be responsible for repair and maintenance of the meters.</p><p>  The installation of water meters in households connected to public water supplies will commence later this year.  The nature of the work will involve minor excavation and reinstatement works and will provide much needed employment in the construction sector. In keeping with international practice regarding water metering, the meters will be installed at the boundary of the property, most typically in the footpath or verge at the front of a house. It is not envisaged that meters will be installed on the carriage-way of roads.  Households will not be charged an upfront free for the installation of the meters.</p><p>  The Government has also decided to assign responsibility for the economic regulation of the water sector, including the setting of charges, to the Commission for Energy Regulation. The primary role of the regulator will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to them.  An appropriate approach to charging customers will be put in place and a public consultation will take place as part of the regulatory process.</p><p>  Affordability issues will be addressed by my Department and the Department of Social Protection, in consultation with the Regulator, Irish Water and other stakeholders, in the context of developing a water pricing framework.  The agreed approach to affordability issues will then be reflected in the charging structure established by the Regulator.  No decision ha s yet been taken on the level of or the approach to the free allowance.</p></reply>

The Water Services Act 2013 assigns the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme.

Water suppliers are required to comply with the chemical and microbiological paramaters set out in the Regulations.  Hard water is not included as a parameter in the quality standards specified in the Regulations, as it does not pose as a threat to human health, nor indeed are the substances associated with hard water, such as lime, calcium and magnesium.</p></reply>

The requirements of the Building Regulations are set out in 12 parts (classified as parts A to M) addressing the legally enforceable minimum performance standards which a completed building must achieve.  My Department publishes a Technical Guidance Document (TGD) to accompany each part of the regulations outlining how the legal requirement may be achieved in practice.  Part B/TGD B addresses the requirements in relation to Fire Safety. Primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings.  Implementation of enforcement measures is a matter for the local building control authority.  Local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement as Building Control Authorities under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2007, and as Fire Authorities, Planning Authorities and Housing Authorities under other Acts relevant to the built environment.  I am aware that local authorities have used such powers on a number of occasions where circumstances have given rise to concern and I expect local authorities to continue to use all of the powers currently available to them to address serious building defects.</p><p>  Neither I nor my Department have any function in relation to assessing, checking or testing compliance, or otherwise, of specific works or developments under the Building Control Acts or the Fire Safety Acts.</p><p>  My Department is currently engaged in a review of Part B /TGD B.

Any proposals for change will be subject to a comprehensive public consultation process and a rigorous Regulatory Impact Assessment in due course prior to their being signed into law.</p></reply>

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. </p><p>  My Department does not hold information on the numbers of households on local authorities' waiting lists.  These figures continuously fluctuate as households are allocated housing and new households apply for housing support.  The allocation of dwellings to qualified households is a matter for the relevant local authority having regard to its allocation scheme.</p><p>  The Department directed all housing authorities to carry out a summary of social housing assessments as at 7 May, 2013 in their areas, including detail relating to the number of households who are on the housing waiting list.  A report on the results will published in the autumn.</p><p>  The financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes.  The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.  In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing.  I am monitoring expenditure under my Department's housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).  My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure delivery of housing units for social purposes.</p></reply>

The provisions of the Convention and the legislative and administrative arrangements that would be necessary to allow signature and ratification of the Convention by Ireland are being examined in conjunction with the government commitment to introduce consolidated and reformed domestic violence legislation to address all aspects of domestic violence, threatened violence and intimidation, in a way that provides protection to victims.</p><p>  However, a particular difficulty to be addressed in Ireland&rsquo;s consideration of the Convention relates to reconciling property rights under the Irish constitution with the requirement under Article 52 of the Convention - the availability of emergency barring orders.  The development of the consolidated and reformed legislation, including consideration of the Convention provisions, will be progressed as soon as possible having regard to the need for consultations and other legislative priorities in my Department.  </p><p>  I should also inform you that, to date, 30 Council of Europe member states have signed the Convention of which four have ratified it.  Of these just one EU member state, Portugal, has as yet ratified the convention.  The convention  has not yet entered into force as this requires at least ten ratifications, including 8 Council of Europe member states.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-11a.1688.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061100076#WRLL02300"><p>The Supreme Court in its judgment in Fleming v Ireland and Others (delivered on 29 April last) upheld the constitutionality of section 2(2) of the Criminal Law (Suicide) Act 1993. Section 2(2) provides for the offence of assisted suicide.</p><p>  While acknowledging the very distressing situation of the appellant, the Court held that there is no constitutional right to commit suicide or to arrange for the ending of one&rsquo;s life at a time of one&rsquo;s choosing.  The Court further held that it is not possible to identify a constitutional right for a limited class of persons which in this case would refer to disabled persons suffering severe pain arising from a terminal and degenerative illness, who have the capacity to consent and wish to have the assistance of a third party to end their lives.  Submissions to the effect that the prohibition on assisted suicide was discriminatory and contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights were also rejected.</p><p>  As a consequence of the judgment, the offence of assisting another to take his or her life under section 2(2) remains in place.  The DPP's consent is required before a prosecution for this offence may be initiated.  On conviction a person is liable to a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years.  The actual sentence imposed, for example in terms of its length and whether it is required to be served in prison or is suspended, is a matter for the sentencing judge having regard to the circumstances of the offence and the offender.</p><p>  While it is the case that the Court clarified that its judgment should not be interpreted as necessarily implying that it is not open to the Oireachtas to legislate for assisted suicide (assuming appropriate safeguards could be implemented), there are undoubtedly differing views both within and outside the House on whether amending legislation on this matter and, indeed, on euthanasia, would be desirable.</p><p>  I mention euthanasia as any consideration of decriminalising assisted suicide for the limited class of persons at issue in the proceedings would most likely have to include consideration of how terminally ill persons who are physically unable to take the final step themselves would be facilitated to die at a time of their choosing.</p><p>  These complex policy questions require an assessment of the competing interests of the individual and the public interest in safeguarding persons who are nearing the end of their lives and who might be vulnerable and at risk of abuse.  While no-one could but be moved by the plight of the appellant and persons similarly situated, I am obliged to have regard to the wider public interest, and I am satisfied that section 2(2) as it stands is justified by the need to safeguard persons who are vulnerable and weak.  Accordingly, I have no plans to bring forward legislative proposals.</p></reply>

The Bill incorporates many of the recommendations made by the Coroners Review Group in 2000 and the Coroners Rules Committee in 2003.  It will permit the State to better provide for the fulfilment of its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and, in particular, in regard to the Article 2 requirement to ensure an effective investigation of deaths of persons where the circumstances of the death may involve the State.</p><p>  The key elements of the Bill include</p><p>-  enhancing inquiry and inquest processes,</p><p>-  establishing the office of Chief Coroner to provide leadership and direction in all coronial matters;</p><p>-  providing the necessary legal framework for the establishment of a new Coroner Service;</p><p>-  moving to a smaller number of full-time coroners;</p><p>-  statutory requirement to ensure that family members are notified at significant steps of the coronial process;</p><p>-  clarifying a specific regime for coroner post-mortem examinations, including provision for retention and release of body parts and bodily samples, and</p><p>-  promoting cooperation between coroners and other agencies also involved in investigations of deaths.</p><p>I would hope to be in a position to progress the Coroners Bill this year.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b> As an early measure, I have indicated that the Courts Bill 2013 will include an amendment to the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 to provide for the provision of legal advice and legal aid in respect of certain inquests. </p><p>  The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 also provided for some early reforms in coronial matters, including an amalgamation of the Dublin County and City coronial districts.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

His report was published in January 2009.  He concluded that the original Tribunal finding of arson was a hypothetical one only and that no-one present on the night can be held responsible.  He further concluded that in the absence of any identified evidence as to the cause of the fire, the most another inquiry could achieve would be another set of hypothetical findings, which would not be in the public interest.  The then Government accepted Mr. Coffey&rsquo;s findings and motions were passed in both Houses of the Oireachtas endorsing his conclusions and expressing sympathy with the families.  No grounds have been put forward to alter that situation.</p><p>  Insofar as the receipt of the report is concerned, the position is that Mr. Coffey&rsquo;s final report was submitted on 7 January 2009.  An earlier draft of the report had been submitted on 10 December, dated 8 December on the basis that Mr. Coffey had asked to be permitted to make amendments for the purposes of correction, accuracy and clarification prior to its publication.  For the avoidance of any doubt, I should make it clear that no attempt was made to influence Mr. Coffey&rsquo;s drafting or to suggest any amendments.  It is the report of 7 January which represents Mr. Coffey&rsquo;s final and entirely independent advice to the Government on this matter.</p></reply>

Such a person is liable to be prosecuted and punished as if he or she were convicted of the substantive offence.  It is also worth recalling that alongside these legislative provisions we also have in place the legislative framework contained in the Children Act 2001, which operates with a focus on diversion from the criminal justice system, rehabilitation and preventing criminal behaviour.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Annual Report of the Committee appointed to Monitor the Effectiveness of the Garda Diversion Programme provides statistics for crimes committed by those under 18 years of age.  Statistics from the latest (2011) Report show that a total of 196 referrals were made to the Diversion Programme for offences relating to possession of drugs for sale or supply.</p><p>  I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to the actions contained in the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016.  In accordance with action 7 of the Strategy, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is developing a targeted strategic response to adults involved in the drugs trade who are using young people to engage in illegal activities associated with the trade.</p></reply>

Each case is examined on its merits and, where the person is visa required, this is done as part of the visa process. For example, one of the issues to be considered is the potential for the individual or family members to be, or to become, a burden on the State and the family income supplement provides some guidance on this.  However other factors also have to be considered.</p><p>  People who currently hold stamp 4 permission may have attained this status through a variety of routes and not all cases would have the same claim on family reunification.  At one end of the scale are refugees whose spouse and children are entitled to family reunification in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996.  At the other end there may be cases where the grant of Stamp 4 permission to an individual was expressly on the basis that it conferred no entitlement or legitimate expectation of family reunification.  There are also cases involving workers with employment permits who now hold stamp 4 permission.  Family reunification was generally available to employment permit holders either immediately or after one year.</p><p>  My Department is currently working on a comprehensive policy document that will include guidelines on all of the main issues including eligibility, dependency, the financial resources necessary to support a dependant and any requirements the person seeking entry must meet. It should also be noted that our existing policies in respect of certain classes of migration compare very favourably with many other jurisdictions. Moreover, in devising guidelines in this complex area, regard must be had to the existence of the Common Travel Area and its provisions in relation to the ease of movement between Ireland and the UK.</p></reply>

While the general principle is that justice be administered in public, the underlying concern is that family law proceedings relate to matters which are sensitive and private to the parties and there is no public interest in requiring that their identities be published.</p><p>  The application of the <i>in camera </i>  rule in relation to court hearing of family law and child care proceedings has given rise to a public perception that undue secrecy is attached to the administration of these areas of the law and that there is a lack of uniformity and consistency in the manner in which they are administered.</p><p>  The proposal in the Bill is to retain the privacy provisions in respect of such court proceedings while allowing the attendance of <i>bona fide </i>  representatives of the press.  The courts will, however, retain the power to exclude representatives of the Press or restrict or prohibit the publication of evidence given in the proceedings in certain circumstances.  In addition, a strict prohibition will apply on reporting of material likely to identify the parties to the proceedings or any children to whom the proceedings relate.  The Bill aims to provide for a careful balancing of the need for privacy for persons involved in family law and child care proceedings with the need to ensure access to important information on the operation of family and child care law in our courts.</p><p>  The Bill is currently before the Seanad and I hope to progress the Bill before the Oireachtas with a view to its enactment before the Summer recess.</p></reply>

Its concluding observations covered a wide range of areas which impact on the remit of several Government Departments.</p><p>  In relation to the Magdalen Laundries, the Committee recommended that, &quot;the State should institute prompt, independent, and thorough investigations into all allegations of torture, and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that were allegedly committed in the Magdalen Laundries and, in appropriate cases, prosecute and punish the perpetrators with penalties commensurate with the gravity of the offences committed, and ensure that all victims obtain redress and have an enforceable right to compensation including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible&quot;.</p><p>  The Inter-Departmental Committee to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen Laundries which was independently chaired by the then Senator McAleese was not intended to be a criminal investigation but was a necessary preliminary step in establishing general facts about non-State closed institutions.  Some of these institutions had ceased operations nearly 50 years previously and there was no reliable account available of their operations.</p><p>  The Irish Government is satisfied that the McAleese report is an independent, comprehensive, factual account of these institutions.  It brought into the public arena a considerable amount of information not previously known.  It also showed that many of preconceptions about these institutions were not supported by the facts.</p><p>  With regard to prosecutions, the only mechanism to  prosecute and punish perpetrators for offences committed in this jurisdiction requires a criminal investigation, a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute and then a criminal trial.   Irish law does not provide for any other type of inquiry to lead to criminal prosecutions.  Any complaints of criminal behaviour made by individuals to the Garda&iacute; regarding Magdalen laundries are investigated.</p><p>  Mr Justice Quirke has not been asked to carry out an investigation.  He has been asked to advise on a Scheme of Supports for the women in question.  I expect that the Government will shortly be able to make an announcement in relation to Justice Quirke's report.</p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that my Department has recently received a letter from the Rapporteur for the Follow-up on Concluding Observations of UNCAT. The Rapporteur has sought clarification and further information in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s response of 31 July, 2012. This letter is currently being considered and my Department will issue a response through Ireland's Ambassador at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in due course.</p></reply>

The sentences of prisoners transferring into Ireland under the Convention are administered by 'continued enforcement' procedure in accordance with Article 10 of the Convention. Article 6.2b of the Convention provides that the sentencing state shall furnish, to the administering state, a statement indicating how much of the sentence has already been served, including information on any pretrial detention, remission, and any other factor relevant to the enforcement of the sentence.</p><p>  My Department will take the relevant information provided by the sentencing state (including remission already earned) into account when determining the sentence which will be applicable in this jurisdiction if a transfer proceeds. I should add that prisoners are fully informed, in writing, of the consequences on the enforcement of their sentence when their formal consent to the transfer is being sought. Article 9.3 of the Convention provides that the enforcement of the sentence  upon transfer, shall by governed by the law of the administering state (i.e the receiving state). There is  no obligation on the Minister to consult with the sentencing state regarding the administration of the sentence. Article 15 of the Convention does provide that the administering state shall furnish information concerning the enforcement of the sentence to the sentencing state in certain circumstances, including when it considers the enforcement of the sentence to have been completed or if the sentencing state requests a special report.</p><p>  It should also be noted that when a prisoner is approved a transfer from this jurisdiction  to another,  they will gain the remission rate applicable to the receiving state. For instance, where a prisoner transfers to the UK, their remission rate is increased to 50%, which reduces their sentence length considerably.</p></reply>

Youth justice projects are specifically targeted at young offenders and those at serious risk of offending, as opposed to the youth population at large, and are delivered through the Garda Youth Diversion Projects and the Young Persons Probation projects wing of the Probation Service.</p><p>  There are 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) nationwide. They are community-based, multi-agency, crime prevention initiatives which are designed to engage with and seek to divert young people from becoming involved in or further involved in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour. They operate in tandem with the Garda Diversion Programme. They aim to bring about the conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order can develop and mature through positive interventions and interaction with the project. The projects are particularly targeted at 12-17 year old &quot;at risk&quot; youths in communities where a specific need has been identified and where there is a risk of them remaining within the justice system. Each project committee, which is chaired by the local Garda District Officer, receives an annual allocation and decides on young people to be targeted and interventions to be used. The approach is supported by a risk assessment of participants designed to identify their needs and to enable a project to use interventions that provide the best possible outcome for the participant.  It is a matter for the local project to decide on any intervention and I am aware that the 'Big Brother, Big Sister' programme is available as an intervention tool in this regard.</p><p>  Young Persons Probation projects for their part provide a variety of interventions, some of which are court ordered, to young people who have come through the court system. This also includes a mentoring support provided under the Mentor Order of the Children Act, 2001 as amended. That particular programme is provided by Le Ch&eacute;ile, a Young Persons Probation project, on a national basis to meet the needs of probation clients.</p><p>  Having regard to the many demands on the funding available for the youth justice programmes, there are no plans to provide funding along the lines proposed by the Deputy, over and above the existing level of support for youth justice mentoring activity.</p></reply>

Further information is available on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) Website - www.inis.gov.ie - and this information will be updated as developments occur.</p><p>  The High Court in the MM case was arrived at following a referral to the European Court of Justice. The legal advice to me was that this Judgment, which relates to an applicant's right to be heard in the context of an application for subsidiary protection, should be appealed to the Supreme Court and I have taken that advice on board. In the mean-time, and pending the determination of this appeal, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General, is working on the development of a framework, legislative and administrative, under which existing and future applications for subsidiary protection will be determined. This framework will lay some of the foundations for what is proposed in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I hope to re-publish later this year, under which it is envisaged that applications for asylum, subsidiary protection and 'leave to remain' will be dealt with as a single procedure. As a result, Deputies can be satisfied that there is no conflict between the appeal lodged and the plans to revise the existing subsidiary protection procedures.</p><p>  The legislative provisions referred to above are being given priority attention. Once the new arrangements are in place, steps will be taken to have all outstanding applications for subsidiary protection processed in a timely manner.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-11a.1781.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061100076#WRNN01900"><p>I have received a letter from Clare County Council dated 21 May, 2013 informing me of a resolution passed by its members at its May meeting requesting me to undertake a review of accommodation arrangements for refugees and asylum seekers.</p><p>  I should firstly say that the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the operation of the system of direct provision. RIA has no function in relation to the accommodation of recognised refugees who have the same work and accommodation entitlements as Irish citizens.  RIA's function is to accommodate asylum seekers. There are currently 34 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA, providing accommodation and ancillary services to 4,650 persons.  One of these centres is in Knockalisheen, Co. Clare.</p><p>  The Direct Provision system remains a key pillar of the State's asylum and immigration system and I have no plans to end it at this time.  Rather, my intention is that the factors which lead to delays in the processing of cases are dealt with so that asylum seekers spend as little time as is necessary in that accommodation system.</p><p>  The direct provision system is not ideal but it is a system which facilitates the State providing a roof over the head of those seeking asylum or seeking other grounds to be allowed, on humanitarian grounds, to stay in the State. It allows the State to do it in a manner that facilitates resources being used economically in circumstances where the State is in financial difficulty. There are no cheaper alternatives to the Direct Provision system. A key finding in the 2010 Value for Money Report on the Direct Provision system was that if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' it would likely create, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system.</p><p>  I do accept that the length of time spent in direct provision and the complexity of the asylum process itself is an issue which needs to be addressed.  The accommodation system is inextricably linked to the surrounding asylum process. The revised Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I intend to re-publish, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion.</p><p>  Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing, I am proposing to introduce new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications in light of recent judgments in the Superior Courts.  My Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office, is developing a new legislative and administrative framework for the processing of current and future subsidiary protection applications. This work is being given high priority and applicants will be advised of the new arrangements as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The application is being processed and will be returned to the registered organisation once completed.</p><p>  The current average processing time for applications is approximately 14 weeks from date of receipt.   However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.</p><p>  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process. In order to observe equity and fairness in respect of all applicants for Garda Vetting, standard processing procedures are such that applications are processed in chronological order, from the date of receipt at the Central Vetting Unit.</p><p>  I remain in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best the service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the process. Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the GCVU and this must remain the case.</p><p>  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that there are currently 1 Superintendent, 2 Sergeants and approximately 113 civilian personnel assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit.  This civilian complement includes 23 staff recently transferred from the Department of Agriculture who are undergoing the required training course.  A further 9 personnel were allocated to the GCVU on 13 May 2013 and an additional 6 took up positions on the 31 May 2013.</p><p>  When these staff have been fully trained on the vetting process I expect there will be a positive effect on vetting times.  My Department is also examining the scope for the redeployment of additional personnel from within the public service to the Unit.</p></reply>

Garda members dealing with the public treat all persons with dignity and respect regardless of gender, race, religious beliefs, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, age, nationality, disability, economic circumstances, marital or family status or membership of the Traveller community. The Garda Victims Charter states that if a victim has any form of disability their special needs or requirements will be taken into account.  This includes persons with autism or autistic spectrum disorders. <br /><br /><b><i>Courts Service</i></b><br /><br />The Courts Service is acutely aware of the right of equal access and access with dignity to the courts for all users. Everyone who attends the courts presents with a different set of circumstances, a varying degree of understanding and a personalised set of needs and every effort is made to meet those needs. The Courts Service has a Disability Liaison Officer whose function includes arranging for and co-ordinating the provision of assistance and guidance to persons with disabilities in accessing court services. The Service continues to work to improve facilities across a wide variety of areas including court buildings, technology and the provision of information to court users.  Disabled access and facilities are included in all court building and refurbishment projects.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b><br /><br /><b><i>Irish Youth Justice Service</i></b><br /><br />As the Deputy may be are aware the Health Service Executive is developing a forensic Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (forensic CAMHS) to comply with the Ryan Implementation Plan.  A community forensic CAMHS was also recommended in the national mental health strategy - A Vision for Change - and once established will provide services for children within the criminal justice system.  I also wish to advise the Deputy that community led youth justice services may refer young people coming to their attention to the appropriate services.  <br /><br /><b><i>Irish Prison Service</i></b><br /><br />  While the Irish Prison Service (IPS) does not provide any specific services for persons with autism, the provision of health care is a statutory obligation and all prisoners are medically assessed on committal.  The Irish Prison Service provides general health care services for the assessment, treatment and care of prisoners comparable to that available to those entitled to General Medical Services in the community and which are appropriate in a prison setting.  Where a doctor or other health care professional operating in the prison environment determines that a prisoner requires treatment in an external setting following a clinical assessment, a referral can be made to the public health system.  In addition, professional in reach health care services are provided as required for a range of health care needs.<br /><br /><b><i>Probation Service</i></b><br /><br />  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that while the Probation Service does not provide specific services to those with autism and or autism spectrum disorders it liaises with relevant services that offenders might already be engaged with in the community.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></p></reply>

They oblige the developer to transfer ownership of the relevant parts of the common areas to the relevant OMC within 6 months of the coming into operation of the section, i.e. before 1 October 2011. Subsection (2) defines &ldquo;substantially completed&rdquo; as developments in which sales of not less than 80% of the residential units have been closed.</p><p>  Section 24 deals with the resolution of disputes and it provides that a person may apply to court for an order to enforce any rights conferred or obligation imposed by the Act.  The court, if satisfied that a right has been infringed or an obligation (such as the non-transfer of the common areas) has not been discharged, may make such remedial order as it deems appropriate in the circumstances with a view to ensuring the effective enforcement of the right or the effective discharge of the obligation in respect of the development concerned.</p><p>  As regards property management agents, the general position is that an OMC enters into a contract with such an agent to provide services in respect of their development.  The specific tasks of the agent are therefore dependent on the nature and extent of that contract.</p><p>    Provisions relating to the licensing of property management agents are set out in the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 and are overseen by the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  As part of the licensing system, the Authority specifies and implements standards relating to:</p><p>  - education, training and experience levels of licensees;  </p><p>  - levels of professional indemnity insurance,</p><p>  - quality of financial accounting systems, and</p><p>  - ethical standards to be observed in the provision of property services.</p><p>  The Act also empowers the Authority to investigate complaints against property management agents and to impose sanctions, including the revocation or suspension of licences, in cases of improper conduct on the part of licensees.</p></reply>

There are currently 34 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA, providing accommodation and ancillary services to 4,650 persons.  Of these 34 centres, 7 are State owned. That is to say, while the centres are managed by private companies under contract to RIA, the land and buildings are owned by the State.  The remaining centres are commercially owned and operated and, for the purposes of this reply, these are called commercial contracts.</p><p>  The purpose of the 2006 Regulations cited in the question is to give effect to EU Directive 2004/18/EC dated 31 March 2004, (as amended by Directive 2005/51/EC dated 7 September 2005 and Directive 2005/75/EC dated 16 November 2005) concerning public procurement. A distinction needs to be drawn in relation to the procurement process as between management contracts for RIA's State-owned accommodation centres and the commercial contracts, the former being already subject to 'open' tenders under the above EU Procurement Directive.</p><p>  In relation to commercial contracts, up to 2010 RIA placed adverts in national newspapers seeking expressions of interest in providing accommodation for asylum seekers. This was in accord with 'the negotiated procedure' described in the Guide to Community Rules on Public Procurement of Services (Directive 92/50/EC).  The Value for Money (VFM) Review of spending by RIA on asylum seeker accommodation, referred to in the question, was initiated in January, 2009 and the report was published in May 2010.  The full VFM report is available at RIA's website .</p><p>  The Review acknowledged the unique challenges in this particular area of procurement, e.g. the unpredictability of demand, the requirement to disperse asylum seekers around the country, local opposition to the opening of new centres, children settled in schools and so on.  Among the recommendations of the VFM report was the introduction of a mix of 'contracts for capacity' and 'contracts for availability and occupancy' as well as a 'more open' tendering system in respect of the commercially owned and operated centres in the RIA portfolio.   How this 'more open' tendering process is to be achieved has been the subject of consideration, including legal discussions, since.  Pending the determination of the commercial contract tender process described here,  existing contracts, as far as practicable, have introduced a number of elements recommended in the VFM report. For example, some contracts now involve a mix of 'contracts for capacity' and 'contracts for availability and occupancy' which have the dual purpose of maximising the occupancy of the centre while minimising RIA's expenditure.  None of these contracts is for any more than one year and all have 'get out' clauses.</p><p>  Following the VFM Report, the priority was the tender for the management of the 7 State owned centres. Drafting of the Request for Tender (RFT) began in early 2011, the RFT was published on 2 September 2011, the evaluation period began at the end of October 2011 and a report of the evaluation committee was signed off on 5 April 2012.  Notification letters issued 10 April 2012 and new contracts started in mid-June 2012.   During the course of that tender consideration process, intensive legal correspondence and meetings in relation to the possible invocation of the EU Remedies Directive (transposed into Irish law in March, 2010) took place with some disappointed tenderers. This necessitated the seeking of further legal advice before the contracts were finally awarded.</p><p>  Assuming that the negotiated procedure for commercial contracts, which has been the basis of RIA tendering since it began in 2000, is no longer applicable, specific legal advice is essential as to under which section of the above mentioned EU Procurement Directive the tender falls, as well as the extent to which the existing geographical dispersal of asylum seekers can be taken into account in the assessment criteria. The latter does not arise in the case of the tender for the management of the State owned centres, as the centres are in already fixed locations.</p><p>  The experience of the State-owned tender competition has been invaluable in informing RIA of specific issues, including the implications of the Remedies Directive, to be addressed in the commercial contract draft tender process. It needs to have regard to the fact that the asylum accommodation system, while undoubtedly a service provision to the State by private contractors, fundamentally concerns human beings who see their current accommodation as their home with links to local schools and medical and social services.  The Deputy will be particularly aware of the disruption caused by the closure of the Lisbrook asylum accommodation centre in Galway last year and will note that further such disruption may be a necessary outcome of a more open tendering procedure.  The RIA is in the process of drafting the commercial contract tender which will then be considered by the Procurement Policy Unit of my Department and then by the State's legal advisers.  The target date for the publication of a commercial contract tender document is October, 2013.</p><p>  While this tender preparation takes place,  the direct provision is being managed closely by RIA, taking account of the decline in the number of persons seeking accommodation.  During the four year period ending on 31 December, 2012, RIA had closed 25 centres and was accommodating 2,161 fewer persons. Over this period, RIA spending had declined from &euro;91.5 million to &euro;62.3 million i.e.32%.</p></reply>

Of these 34 centres, 7 are State owned i.e. the land and buildings are owned by the State.  Whilst all centres are managed by private companies under contract to RIA, the rates paid by RIA takes into account the differing costs undertaken directly by these companies, depending on whether it is a State owned or privately owned centre.</p><p>As I have stated in answers to previous D&aacute;il Questions, it is not possible to provide values for current contracts entered into by RIA.  Negotiations take place with a number of commercial entities on an ongoing basis and RIA endeavours to achieve the best value for money in respect of each contract.  It is not in the interests of the taxpayer that details of current individual contracts are known to the public or to other parties who are, or may be in the future, engaged in negotiations with RIA. Therefore, details of <i>current</i>   contract rates are not provided. The policy is that the updating of the table of contracts will take place only at the end of January each year in respect of all financial information up to the end of December two years previously, e.g. at the end of January, 2013 the records are updated to end of December 2010.  This policy has been upheld by the Office of the Information Commissioner.</p><p>Nonetheless, it is possible to give a general indication of the rates currently paid. These rates are on a per person per day (PPPD) basis. Currently, the average PPPD rate for direct provision centres is &euro;29.49 while the same contract rate for State-owned centres averages at &euro;15.50.</p><p>The two PPPD rates cited above are not directly comparable.  The direct provision rate is a single all-inclusive figure,  which includes energy, maintenance, transport and VAT costs. By contrast, the State-owned rate does not include any of these costs, which are borne directly by the State and not by the contracted management company.</p><p>To illustrate the costs incurred by RIA overall, hereunder is a breakdown of the total expenditure of &euro;62.329 million incurred by RIA in 2012. Note that this includes the costs of some centres which were closed during 2012.</p><p><table><tr><th>Type</th><th>Explanation</th><th>Spend</th></tr><tr><td>Commercial</td><td>31 Centres commercially owned</td><td>&euro;52.071m</td></tr><tr><td>State Owned</td><td>7 centres owned by the State</td><td>&euro;6.987m</td></tr><tr><td>Self Catering</td><td>2 non direct provision commercially owned centres</td><td>&euro;.913m</td></tr><tr><td>Pre School</td><td>Payments for wages, consumables etc. in two pre schools</td><td>&euro;0.114m</td></tr><tr><td>Additional costs (including Gas, Electricity, Oil, Phone, Water, Waste, Sewerage, OPW,  etc.)</td><td>Direct spending by RIA on additional costs in State owned centres</td><td>&euro;2.109m</td></tr><tr><td>Transport</td><td>Direct spending by RIA on transport of asylum seekers on dispersals around country.</td><td>&euro;0.071m</td></tr><tr><td>Miscellaneous</td><td>Payments for nappies and miscellaneous costs</td><td>&euro;0.064m</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Total</td><td>&euro;62.329m</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Specifically, under Section 9 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, it is an offence to possess any knife or any other article which has a blade or which is sharply pointed in any public place, without having good reason or lawful authority.</p><p>  Regarding knife crime, I can advise that a comprehensive and robust legal framework is now in place in this area including heavy penalties for breaches of the laws concerned.  The Garda Commissioner, in 2008, made recommendations in relation to knives and sharply pointed or bladed weapons, and subsequently the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 was enacted, further strengthening the law and responding to Garda concerns about knife crime.  The maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority has been increased from one to five years, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were given an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.  In tandem with the new legislation, samurai swords were generally banned from importation and sale.</p><p>  At an operational level,  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pro-actively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife related crime.  Areas identified as public order hot-spots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols.  Incidents of public disorder and anti-social behaviour reported to the Garda authorities are the subject of investigation and are dealt with appropriately in accordance with the law.  However, statistics show that nearly one third of knife crimes occur in domestic settings and often with a degree of spontaneity, which increases the challenges for policing and enforcement.</p><p>  There are at present no plans to hold a knife amnesty.</p></reply>

It is a multi agency organisation with staff seconded to it from the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and the Irish Prison Service. Currently, there are 4,650 persons accommodated throughout the State in 34 centres under contract to RIA.</p><p>  RIA is a creation of - and derives its mandate from - Government.  It was created as a result of the huge challenges posed by increasing numbers of asylum seekers coming into the country in the late 1990's.  To illustrate, in 1992, 39 applications for asylum were received in Ireland: this increased to 7,724 a year by 1999 and a further 10,938 in the following year. Most presented themselves in Dublin.  The homeless service of the then Eastern Health Board could not cope and there was a serious prospect of widespread homelessness among asylum seekers.</p><p>  A series of Government meetings was held to deal with the matter, involving input from several Government Departments faced with this challenge. The Directorate for Asylum Support Services (DASS), was established by Government decision in November, 1999 under the aegis of my Department to coordinate the scheme of dispersal and direct provision for asylum seekers.  DASS was subsequently replaced, also by Government decision, by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) which continues to accommodate asylum seekers under the system of dispersal and direct provision.</p><p>  RIA, as a unit of my Department, negotiates contracts with private sector companies to provide full board accommodation to asylum seekers in accordance with its Government mandate. RIA is subject to the same Civil Service obligations of fairness of implementation of policy as would any area of Government implementing a scheme. Using private contractors to accommodate asylum seekers is a sensible thing to do. It allows RIA to adapt quickly when the number seeking accommodation waxes or wanes.  At the start of 2009, RIA had 60 centres: today it has 34.  RIA has instituted tough cost saving measures in recent years &ndash; cutting capacities and per diem rates &ndash; without affecting the services provided to residents. Indeed, it is in the commercial interests of providers that as good a service as possible is provided to residents.</p></reply>

The judgment mortgage is a process of execution and it is not a matter for the Authority to become involved in such process. It is a matter for the judgment creditor to ensure the validity of the application for registration. In the event that the judgment debtor believes the judgment to be invalid, it is open to him or her to apply for cancellation of the judgment mortgage under Rule 113 of the Land Registration Rules 2012 (S.I.

However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.</p><p>  I remain in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best the service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the process. Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the Garda Central Vetting Unit and this must remain the case.</p><p>  The possibility of introducing an e-vetting system has been assessed and the Garda authorities are now in the process of developing a system which will enable vetting applications to be submitted electronically through a secure web service.  In addition, the system will facilitate the checking and monitoring of applications.  The relevant work is being pursued on a priority basis and it will be completed as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that there are currently 1 Superintendent, 2 Sergeants and approximately 113 civilian personnel assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit.  This civilian complement includes 23 staff recently transferred from the Department of Agriculture who are undergoing the required training course.  A further 9 personnel were allocated to the GCVU on 13th May 2013 and an additional 6 took up positions on the 31st May 2013.</p><p>  When these staff have been fully trained on the vetting process I expect there will be a positive effect on vetting times.

The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.</p><p>  The current average processing time for applications is approximately 12 weeks from date of receipt.  However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.</p><p>  I remain in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best the service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the process. Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the Garda Central Vetting Unit and this must remain the case.</p><p>  While an e-vetting system is being developed and will be completed as quickly as possible, the Garda Commissioner has informed me that there are currently 1 Superintendent, 2 Sergeants and approximately 113 civilian personnel assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit.  This civilian complement includes 23 staff recently transferred from Department of Agriculture who are undergoing the required training course.  A further 15 personnel were allocated to the GCVU in May. When these staff have been fully trained on the vetting process I expect there will be a positive effect on vetting times.  My Department is also examining the scope for the redeployment of additional personnel from within the public service to the Unit.</p></reply>

Every effort is made by prison staff and management to limit the scope of acts of violence.  However, no regime can completely eliminate the possibility of violent incidents happening in a prison setting where a large number of dangerous and violent offenders are being held.  As the Deputy can see from the figures there were 822 incidents of violence recorded in prisons during 2012 and this includes very minor incidents.  This amounts to an average of 2.2 incidents per day among a population of approximately 4,300.</p><p>The Irish Prison Service has successfully introduced a number of measures across the prison estate such as, hand-held metal detectors, netting over prison yards, Boss chairs and security screening machines to detect and prevent weapons from entering the prison to limit the scope of acts of violence.</p><p>In addition, new prisoner programmes have been introduced such as the Incentivised Regimes policy which provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour.  The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment.  As a result, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the figure for 2012 represents a 35% decrease on the 2011 total of 1,256 (1,115 prisoner on prisoner and 141 prisoner on staff).</p></reply>

The information has been collated and is set out in the tables below.  Unfortunately, the issue of slopping out cannot be resolved overnight.  However, I can assure you that the Government is committed to the elimination of slopping out in all prisons and places of detention.</p><p>I am pleased to note that the number of prisoners currently slopping out has decreased by over 32% in the past 12 months from 836 to 565 and  will reduce further to 360 in September this year when the D Division in Mountjoy closes for refurbishment.  This  refurbishment project, which forms part of a 40-month Capital Plan, published in April 2012 as part of the Prison service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012-2015, includes the installation of in-cell sanitation to all cells in Mountjoy Prison.  You will be aware that  the C and B wings were completed in 2012 and work on the A wing is due for completion in September this year.  As I have said, slopping out will finally end in Mountjoy Prison, later this year, when work on the final wing, the D wing, commences.</p><p>In addition, construction of a new prison in Cork, on the site of the current car park and adjacent green-field site will also commence this year.  This new prison will have a capacity of 275 and will replace the existing outdated prison with modern cellular accommodation containing in-cell sanitation and showering facilities supported by a full range of ancillary services.  The construction of a new wing at Limerick Prison, to replace the outdated A and B Wings, also forms part of the 40-month capital plan and the tender process for this project is expected to commence in June.</p><p>You will be aware that a new accommodation block for in the Midlands Prison was opened in December 2012.  The opening of this new accommodation block has allowed the Prison Service to reduce the capacities of both Cork and Limerick Prison resulting in the closure of antiquated B wing of Limerick Prison.</p><p>Number in custody on 5th June 2013.</p><p><table><tr><th>Prison</th><th>No. in Custody</th></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy Male</td><td>537</td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy Female</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>Training Unit</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>St Patrick's Institution</td><td>146</td></tr><tr><td>Cloverhill Prison</td><td>406</td></tr><tr><td>Wheatfield Prison</td><td>708</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands Prison</td><td>738</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise Prison</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Prison</td><td>226</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick (M)</td><td>229</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick (F)</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Castlerea</td><td>354</td></tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill</td><td>140</td></tr><tr><td>Loughan House</td><td>122</td></tr><tr><td>Shelton Abbey</td><td>112</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>4,251</td></tr></table></p><p>In May 2013, approximately 86% or 3,668 of the prisoners in custody across the prison system had access to in-cell sanitation or had access to normal toilet facilities at all times.

I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person concerned entered the State on 30 September, 2008 and claimed asylum.  His application for asylum was unsuccessful at first instance and this decision was upheld on appeal to the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) on 07 February, 2011.  Arising from the refusal of his asylum application and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), he was notified by letter dated 28 February, 2011 that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</p><p>  I am informed by INIS that the person concerned subsequently made an application for permission to remain in the State on the basis of his marriage to an Irish national which took place in October 2010.  This application was refused in October 2011 as examination of his documents appeared to show that that the biographical data page was not part of the original passport as issued and was likely the result of an unauthorised substitution.  In February, 2013, the person concerned made a further application for permission to remain in the State on the basis of his marriage to an Irish national.  He has submitted a new Passport with his application.  Such applications are dealt with in chronological order and INIS are currently processing applications received in November 2012.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The proposal concerns two existing EU agencies, Europol and CEPOL.  Europol's role is to support national law enforcement bodies in their fight against serious crime and terrorism.  Europol does this by exchanging information between national services and providing analysis of data to assist national services.  The European Police College, CEPOL, facilitates cooperation between national police services by organising and conducting training with a specific European and international dimension.</p><p>  Given that Ireland currently holds the Presidency of the EU, I think that it would be inappropriate for me to comment in detail on a proposal consideration of which we will be chairing.  I am aware that some Member States are not convinced by the arguments put forward by the Commission in relation to the proposed merger and I am sure that this will be considered further in the course of the negotiations on the proposal.</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to you in the matter I have had enquiries made with the Tribunal on your behalf.</p><p>  I understand that the Tribunal has made an award in favour of the person concerned who was notified of this decision on 3 April, 2013.  I am informed that the Tribunal has not received a signed form of acceptance to date and, in this regard, the Tribunal is not in a position to process the application further.  The Deputy may also wish to note that during 2012 in particular, a small number of high awards made by the Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of the Scheme and the extent of the injuries suffered by the applicants concerned has caused the level of compensation awarded to exceed the budgetary provision for the payment of compensation.  It has been necessary for the Tribunal to carry forward a significant amount of those awards for payment during 2013.  This led to the 2013 budget becoming fully committed.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the budget available to the Tribunal, in common with all Government Departments, is limited and in circumstances where there is no upper limit to the amount that may be awarded by the Tribunal in an individual case a small number of high awards can very quickly exhaust the funding available.</p></reply>

Deportation Orders are made under the provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, following a comprehensive consideration of an individual's case under Section 3 (6) of that Act and under Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 on the prohibition of refoulement.  A Deportation Order does not in itself prevent a person who is the subject of such an Order from entering any other EEA country.  However, other EU immigration authorities may, depending on their respective immigration rules and procedures, consider the existence of an Irish issued Deportation Order as sufficient grounds to refuse entry to their national territory.  It can be expected that this will be especially the case in respect of entry into the United Kingdom in view of the joint commitment of both Ireland and the UK to protect the integrity of the Common Travel Area arrangement.</p></reply>

The time limit was necessary to curb the misuse of the student immigration channel by economic migrants.  Tackling abuses of the system was part of a whole of Government strategy that refocussed efforts on growing the international education industry.</p><p>  The new policy applies to all students who have arrived in the State after 1 January 2011 as well as to those students who were already resident in Ireland on that date.  Special provisions were made to facilitate those students who exceeded the seven year time-frame (i.e. those who arrived before 1 January 2004) on the date of introduction.  These special provisions were extended on several occasions to allow for &quot;timed-out&quot; students to complete their studies, avail of post-student pathways or arrange for their departure from the State.</p><p>  As a final measure in assisting the transition to the new regime, the Student Probationary Extension was made available to those students who had been continuously resident in the State since before 1 January 2005.  This cut-off point provides for those students who were &quot;timed-out&quot; at the introduction of the new regime as well as those who first registered in the State in the twelve months following 1 January 2004.  The eligible group consists of those most immediately impacted by the change.  They had the longest continuous residence in the State and more limited time to adjust to the provisions of the new regime before reaching the seven year cut-off point.  Overall the seven year limit is a generous one and provides ample opportunity to motivated students to achieve all of their academic goals.</p></reply>

It will be recalled that the background to this decision was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p><p>  With regard to providing assistance to businesses in relation to this matter, absent legislative intervention, NAMA is playing a role in dealing with problems caused by upward only rent reviews applying to NAMA properties.  I have been advised that, by end-April 2013, the Agency had granted 222 applications for rent abatement with an aggregate annual value of about &euro;14 million which represents the annual value of rent due to NAMA that it has agreed to forego in order to help businesses survive.  A further 52 applications were under review at that date.  Of the 284 eligible applications received only 10 have been refused representing a 96% approval rate by NAMA.  The practice of NAMA in this area is one which I would commend to landlords in the commercial property market and in the retail sector in particular.</p><p>  More generally, the importance of supporting the retail sector is widely recognised across a range of Government Departments.  Continuing action is being taken to reduce the cost of doing business for all businesses, and is intended to have a positive impact on areas such as energy, local authority rates, and the administrative burden involved in companies complying with Government regulations and tax systems.  I would also draw the attention of the Deputy to the Action Plan for Jobs which lies within the remit of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>  The Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a Commercial Leases Database by the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  This Database will assist in providing readily accessible, accurate information in order to determine the market rent payable in respect of comparable commercial properties.  Work is underway to ensure that the Database will be operational shortly.  Attention is drawn to the existence of a rent review arbitration code which was drawn up by a group of experts whose membership was drawn from all stakeholders in the commercial property arena.  The code, which can be found on www.justice.ie, provides a mechanism, applied on a voluntary basis, to deal with the resolution of rent review disputes in the commercial property sector.  The effectiveness of the Code and the extent to which it is utilised by stakeholders is currently under review.</p></reply>

Detailed analysis of short stay visa applications for 2012 shows that almost 50% of such applications worldwide were processed within four days of having been received in an embassy or visa office.  This compares very favourably with processing times in other EU Member States.  Moreover, in total almost 90,000 entry visa applications were processed in 2012 with an approval rate of 91%.  Visa applicants are advised to apply eight weeks before the intended date of travel, however, this advice is mainly precautionary.  Although the processing time for dealing with visit applications can vary depending on the particular circumstances of each individual case and the level of investigation required, it would be quite rare for a straightforward short stay visa application to take eight weeks to process.</p><p>  There is already, under the Irish visa system, a category &quot;Visit Visa&quot; which includes short-term visas for those who wish to visit family/friends as well as those who wish to visit as independent holiday makers.  This feature, whereby the visa applicant describes the exact purpose of their intended journey, is common to many visa regimes, for example, the Schengen visa regime covering most of our EU partner countries.  No change in this area is envisaged.  It is important to note that the great majority of visitors to Ireland  - over 98% - come from countries whose citizens are not visa-required, for example, the UK, the US, EU member states as well as a wide range of other countries spread throughout the world.  Therefore, reforms of the visa regime can have only a limited effect on tourism and other visits.  Nevertheless my Department is constantly seeking ways in which the visa system can be used to facilitate increased tourist and business visits.</p><p>  The Deputy will no doubt be aware of the Short-stay Irish Visa Waiver Programme, launched by this Government on 1 July 2011, which allows persons from seventeen designated countries to travel to Ireland on the basis of a UK visa.  This Programme has proved very effective in attracting increased numbers of visitors from emerging tourist markets.  In the twelve months following the introduction of the programme, visits from the countries covered by it increased by 21% over the preceding twelve months.  The Government has also taken other steps to make the visa process easier including making greater use of multi-entry visas for regular tourist and business visitors from targeted markets including China, the UAE and Russia.  My Department has established six overseas offices in strategic hub locations to provide a better and more convenient service to visa applicants from the busiest locations.  It is also in discussion with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on steps to make the issuing of visas through Irish missions overseas, under delegated sanction from my Department, more efficient.</p></reply>

These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.</p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the new Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning, including Integrated Sentence Management, and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.  The Irish Prison Service places a strong emphasis on improving prisoners' employability prospects through Work Training activities and accredited vocational training courses.  Over 100 workshops and service activities operate across the prison estate and the number of accredited courses and activities has increased in recent years.  There are now over 100 qualifications available across 20 skill sets. 1,459 prisoners participated in accredited vocational training courses in 2012 - up from 314 in 2007 - and 1,030 prisoners received certificates in the last year.</p><p>  A wide range of training workshops and service activities are operating in the Midlands Prison.  These include carpentry, metalwork, computers, laundry, waste management, horticulture, industrial cleaning and catering.  Prisoners housed in the new accommodation block in the Midlands have access to the existing Work Training activities, other constructive activities - such as gyms, paint parties, cleaning, and reception - as well as to Education.  In addition to a recently opened 'Bag and Tag' Tuckshop facility the new block will also have workshop activities in printing/computers, catering training and light industry/craftwork.  Soft skills programmes will also be facilitated in the block.  It is envisaged that these additional activities will come on stream in the near future once vacancies in the Work Training Officer (WTO) grade are filled through a competition which will be held in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

In relation to security, primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence (2000) is to provide ATCP which, in practice, means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.

During this stage, training in the Reserve was limited to unarmed training while preparations were made to provide the regulatory provisions for the new organisational structures and to allow personnel to apply for positions within these new structures.  A revised Regulation, CS 4, was signed on 11 March 2013 and a new Administrative Instruction dealing with both the PDF and the RDF was signed by the Chief of Staff, also on 11 March.  The new organisational structure came into effect on 31 March 2013.</p><p>  Phase 2, which is the Implementation Phase, is currently being progressed and will extend to 30 September 2013.</p><p>  The Military Authorities have advised that it is not possible, within the time available, to compile the necessary data in order to fully answer the questions in relation to the reassignment process for the Reserve Defence Force, the number of applications that were initially received by the two boards, the number of these who opted to be discharged and the number of officers who opted to resign. </p><p>  In this regard I will revert with a complete answer at the earliest possible opportunity.</p><p>  In order to ensure that any member of the Reserve who wished to appeal their assignment was afforded that opportunity, the last date for submitting an appeal was extended to 24 May 2013.  As some members, following the outcome of the appeals process, may still choose to resign, definitive details of the total number opting to resign or to be discharged are still evolving.  In addition, it will not be possible to determine until later in the process the total number of individuals who fall into the category of non-effective members of the Reserve, as it will only be with time that it will become apparent the total number of Reservists who will remain active, or not, in their re-assigned appointments.  </p><p>  Every effort was made to contact the maximum number of members of the Reserve in order to offer them the opportunity to indicate their preferred appointment within the new organisational structure.  Many members who had not been effective for considerable periods of time may not have received this correspondence as they had not provided the organisation with current contact details.  Confirmation of the numbers who did not respond will be included when providing the information mentioned above.</p></reply>

On leaving, he was granted a short-service gratuity under the Defence Forces Pensions Schemes in respect of his military service.  He applied for and was subsequently granted a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts in respect of various injuries he sustained in a road traffic accident while on United Nations duty in Lebanon in June 1984.  His disability pension, which is exempt from income tax, was granted by the Department on the basis that those injuries were found on investigation by the Army Pensions Board (the relevant independent statutory body in such cases) to be attributable to his overseas service with the United Nations.  An award by the Army Pensions Board is the only means, other than litigation, by which retired personnel of the Defence Forces are provided with compensation for any injury sustained in service in the Defence Forces.  Such Disability Pensions are paid by the Department of Defence and not by the United Nations.  I should mention that the person in question also received compensation in 1987 in settlement of a civil action against my Department in respect of his injuries sustained while serving overseas. </p></reply>

In preparation for the hand-over of the Presidency in July 2013 and continued Irish support to the Lithuanian Presidency, key discussions were held with the Minister of National Defence of the Republic of Lithuania, Mr Juozas Olekas, the Irish Ambassador to Lithuania, Ms Philomena Murnaghan, Chief of Defence of the Republic of Lithuania, Lieutenant General Arvydas Pocius, Commander of the Land Forces, Major General Almantas Leika, Commander in Chief of Lithuanian Navy, Rear Admiral Macijauskas, and Commander of the Lithuanian Air Force Major General, Edvardas Ma&zcaron;eikis.  The Chief of Staff was accompanied on the visit by Colonel Michael Meehan, Director of Strategic Planning and his Personal Staff Officer, Lt. Colonel Tom O&rsquo;Callaghan.  The theme of Common Security and Defence Policy was high on the agenda as July will mark the first time Lithuania will hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  Ireland&rsquo;s experience in hosting the Presidency was discussed in order to facilitate preparations for the Lithuanian hand-over.  The Chief of Staff was briefed on defence issues which I prioritised for our Presidency and the progress made in these areas.  The outcome of the meetings and seminars held during the Irish Presidency, which were utilised as an opportunity to progress the development of the Common Security and Defence Policy agenda, were also discussed. </p><p>  During the visit, joint areas of interest were discussed with Lithuania, seeking to learn from Ireland&rsquo;s long standing commitment to United Nations Peace Support Operations.  The Chief of Staff also discussed Ireland&rsquo;s overseas engagements in missions led by the EU, UN and NATO.  Lithuania also expressed an interest in hearing about Ireland&rsquo;s expertise in Counter Improvised Explosive Devices.</p><p>  Discussions also focused on Maritime issues, in particular Ireland and Lithuania&rsquo;s involvement in the European Defence Agencies Maritime Surveillance project, which involves the pooling and sharing of defence maritime information by 16 participating Member States.</p><p>  During the official visit, tours and briefs of the headquarters of the Lithuanian Land Force, Air Force and Navy, Search and Rescue units and various other elements of the Lithuanian Armed Forces were undertaken. </p></reply>

The Plan launched by the Government in July 2012, provides a fresh momentum for growth in the marine area and seeks to ensure Government departments work together more efficiently and effectively on the diverse issues related to the marine, enabling significant input and contributions from relevant stakeholder interests from both the public and private sectors.</p><p>  Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth set out the Government's Vision, High-Level Goals, and Key 'Enabling' Actions the Government will take to put in place the appropriate policy, governance and business climate to enable our marine potential to be realised.  The Plan sets out 39 actions and an implementation model which includes a number of integrated Government delivery mechanisms aimed at supporting an integrated system of policy and programme planning for our marine affairs. The Plan also sets out a series of early actions that form the basis of a 2012-2014 Roadmap. </p><p>  The inter-departmental Marine Coordination Group meets on a monthly basis to oversee the implementation of the plan, bringing together representatives of departments with an involvement in maritime/marine issues. The Group is chaired by myself as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and convened/hosted by the Department of the Taoiseach. </p><p>  The following Departments are represented;</p><p>-  Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine</p><p>-  Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport </p><p>-  Department of Communications, Energy &amp;amp; Natural Resources </p><p>-  Department of Environment, Community and Local Government </p><p>-  Department of Defence  </p><p>-  Department of Arts, Heritage &amp;amp; the Gaeltacht </p><p>-  Department of Jobs, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation</p><p>-  Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform </p><p>-  Department of the Taoiseach </p><p>  The Attorney General's Office and the CEO of the Marine Institute also participate. The group is augmented by a dedicated Maritime Affairs Attach&eacute; based in Brussels. </p><p>  Since the launch in July 2012 substantial progress has been made on implementing the 'early actions' of Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth with key activities to date including:</p><p>-  setting up of a dedicated Bureau in my Department (DAFM) to coordinate and support the implementation of the Plan;</p><p>-  Quarterly reporting of short-term/ongoing actions across all relevant departments and associated agencies. </p><p>-  Setting up of two targeted Task Forces: </p><p><b>-  Enabler's Task Force on Maritime Spatial Planning</b>. A number of meetings held to-date, recommendations on a framework for MSP to be submitted to the Minister and the Marine Coordination Group Oct 2013; and</p><p>- <b> Development Task Force</b>. Department/agency and industry nominees are currently being finalised and will be announced shortly.</p><p>In order to accurately reflect the diverse and significant progress in terms of implementing the integrated marine plan, I am arranging for the publication in the near future of a Status Report on Implementing HOOW Early Ongoing Actions. It is anticipated currently that the status report will be published on the official ocean wealth website .</p></reply>

The State&rsquo;s progress in this area has been the subject of adverse findings in the European Court of Justice and these designations must be addressed as a first priority. Once the designation process for these European sites is complete, attention will be given to the formal designation of proposed Natural Heritage Areas.</p><p>  While the responsibility for designating proposed Natural Heritage Areas and conservation areas as part of the Natura 2000 network rests with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, my Department and its agencies continue to support and develop environmentally sustainable fisheries management measures both to protect the environment and the stocks concerned.  Measures have already been adopted to manage dredge fisheries in Castlemaine Harbour, Kerry and Dundalk Bay and more are in development for a number of marine conservation sites.     </p><p>  The designation of marine protected areas under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive is led by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  My Department proactively participates in the development of the implementation framework for this Directive with the scientific services of the Marine Institute. </p><p>  I have been a strong advocate of sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to deliver sustainable fisheries for future generations.  I am happy to have recently secured the support of the European institutions for a reformed Common Fisheries Policy which will deliver added protection to existing conservation areas, while supporting the establishment of further biologically sensitive protected areas, to contribute to the conservation of living aquatic resources and marine eco-systems.  </p></reply>

The purpose of the Scheme was to contribute to the transport costs of importing fodder into the country and to provide assistance to farmers unable to feed their animals. In light of the continued difficult circumstances and poor weather during much of the month of May, the deadline for the Scheme was extended twice and funding doubled to &euro;2 million. By the end of May, 2,778 loads of imported fodder, amounting to over 40,000 tonnes, have been delivered to farmers through co-ops and marts. </p><p>  The Animal Welfare helpline has received over 1,100 calls through the Early Warning System.</p><p>  The vast majority of calls were adequately supported through fodder being made available under the transport subsidy scheme but 475 farmers, in need of more substantial support were aided with targeted emergency assistance directly by the Department.  To assist farmers under financial pressure, farm payments have been processed as quickly as possible. To date over 29,300 of the remaining 30,200 REPS4 participants have been paid a total of &euro;167 million in respect of the 2012 application period. Almost &euro;36 million of this issued this year. In recent weeks, approximately &euro;3.5 million worth of AEOS payments have also issued.</p><p>  In addition, in co-operation with my colleague Mr. Phil Hogan TD, Minister for the Environment, a temporary and targeted adjustment of the Nitrates Regulations were made to support additional fodder production on farms and maximise grass growth for later into the growing season. </p></reply>

The ICC has a system of regulation in place to underpin standards in coursing.</p><p>  Under the terms of the Wildlife Acts, a licence is needed by the ICC, covering their affiliated coursing clubs, if they wish to capture or tag live hares. The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under section 24 of the Wildlife Act 1976, has responsibility for the issue of an annual licence to the ICC and its affiliated clubs to capture live hares.  These licences currently have a total of 26 conditions attached to them.  Conditions of the licences cover a range of items, including provision of data on hare captures and releases, not coursing hares more than once per day, not coursing sick or injured hares, etc.</p><p>  The ICC ensures that a veterinary surgeon and a control steward are present at all coursing meetings.  In addition to this, veterinary staff from my Department and rangers from the National Parks and Wildlife Service (part of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht) carry out random monitoring inspections during the coursing season to verify compliance with the licences and the rules governing animal welfare.  </p><p>  As a further control, a Monitoring Committee on Coursing was established during the 1993/94 coursing season and is comprised of officials from my Department and representatives from both the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the ICC to monitor developments in coursing and in that regard the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interest of animal both for hares and greyhounds alike.</p><p>  A very high proportion (98.09%) of the hares captured for hare coursing were returned to the wild at the end of the 2012/2013 season. </p><p>  The matters that you have brought to my attention will be considered at the next meeting of the  Monitoring Committee on Coursing.</p></reply>

Accordingly, it was necessary to adjust the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme. However, rather than simply apply an across the board cut to the rates payable or reduce the maximum payable area, I decided that real efforts should be made to focus the Scheme on those farmers who are most actively contributing to achieving the aims of the Scheme, namely:</p><p>-  ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of viable rural communities;</p><p>-  maintaining the countryside; and </p><p>-  maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which take account of environmental protection measures.</p><p>  At the same time, I was also determined that those adversely affected by the 2012 changes should be afforded the opportunity to appeal, where they could show legitimate reasons for their inability to meet the new requirements. In total, my Department wrote to in excess of 10,000 beneficiaries under the 2011 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme whose holdings had not achieved the minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare, as required under the Terms and Conditions of the 2012 Scheme. These appeals have largely been processed, with the residue of cases expected to be finalised in the coming weeks.  </p><p>  It will be seen, therefore, that those adversely affected by the changes to the 2012 Scheme Terms and Conditions were afforded reasonable access to an appeal process; where initial derogation appeals were unsuccessful, the farmers concerned were advised of the right of appeal to the independently-chaired DAS Appeals Committee, with recourse ultimately to the Office of the Ombudsman.</p></reply>

As most aquaculture activity takes place in 'Natura 2000' areas it is necessary to undertake an 'Appropriate Assessment' of the effects of aquaculture activity on these areas before any new licences can be issued or any existing licences can be renewed.</p><p>  In the negotiations to address the ECJ judgement a process was agreed with the European Commission.  This process includes the following steps:</p><p>- Data Collection in 91 Bays/Estuaries</p><p>-  Detailed analysis of the raw data collected</p><p>-  Setting of Conservation Objectives by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in respect of each site</p><p>-  Carrying out Appropriate Assessments (AA) - by the Marine Institute -  of aquaculture/fishery activities against the detailed Conservation Objectives set, and</p><p>-  Determination of Licences/Fisheries on the basis of the Appropriate Assessment and other relevant factors</p><p>  Conservation Objectives have now been set for a significant number of bays.  The appropriate assessments are being carried out by the Marine Institute on behalf of the Department and to date four bays have been assessed - Castlemaine, Dundalk, Roaringwater and Lough Swilly.  Licence determinations have been made in the case of Castlemaine. </p><p>  My Department continues to make every effort to expedite the determination of aquaculture licence applications having regard to the legal, scientific and technical complexities involved.</p></reply>

These inspections are mandatory and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually. In addition, my Department undertakes Nitrates inspections under the Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) regulations on behalf of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government on an inter-Agency agreement.</p><p>  Insofar as notice of farm inspections under the Single Payment and Disadvantaged Areas Schemes is concerned, in general, all inspections should be unannounced. However, the regulations allow my Department to give up to 14 days notice for land eligibility and cross-compliance inspections involving Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) other than those related to animal identification and registration, food, feed, and animal welfare. For checks involving cattle/sheep identification and registration, the maximum advance notice is 48 hours. For SMRs dealing with feed, food and animal welfare, no advance notice may be given and these inspections must take place on an un-announced basis. Where it is considered that the purpose of any type of inspection may be jeopardized by giving notice, the inspection will take place on an un-announced basis.   <i></i></p><p>  As a general rule and following requests from the farming organisations, my Department tries to integrate inspections, including all of the cross-compliance inspection elements, with a view to minimising the number of farm visits and avoiding more than one visit to the farm. However, this obviously has implications for the ability to give notice; however, in a given case, a farmer who is subject to an unannounced, combined inspection, can request that the part for which advance notice is possible be postponed (in the case of animal identification for up to 48 hours and up to 14 days in the case of land eligibility) - of necessity, however, this will require the inspector to go on to the farm again.      </p><p>  The following table provides a breakdown, by county and by month, of the number of unannounced inspections under the Single Payment and Disadvantaged Areas Schemes and the Nitrates (GAP) inspections in the period January to May 2013. These 39 inspections equate to 0.95% of the overall total of 4,104 inspections undertaken in this period. </p></reply>

With reference to your query on dairy quotas you will be aware; the volume of milk production is currently constrained by EU quotas.  Significant volume increase will not take place until the EU milk quotas are abolished in 2015.  In the meantime, steps are being taken at primary and commercial level, through initiatives such as the dairy efficiency programme, capital investment in processing equipment, marketing and trade promotions, to ensure that the industry can capitalise on this valuable opportunity. </p></reply>

Each Member State has its own individual relationship with FAO and with other Member Countries of that organization.  Ireland provides bilateral aid to the FAO, as it does to the World Food Programme (WFP), another Rome-based organization of the UN. </p><p>  Since the accession of the EU to the FAO in 1991, Member States have cooperated with EU officials at various FAO fora.  There is a coordination group for EU Member States within the European Council structures.  This allows the Member States to hear the Commission perspective and to incorporate it into their dealings with the FAO.  The EU also prepares statements on behalf of all Member States in areas where the EU has specific competency (for example on agricultural or fisheries trade matters).  However, just as in Brussels, Member States still have autonomy as sovereign states and the EU Council still prepares a common position through discussion at Member State level.</p><p>  As in all other matters, therefore, Ireland co-operates with its fellow EU Member States and with the EU Commission to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are properly represented both within the EU and at UN level.  Currently, Ireland holds the rotating Presidency of the EU Council.  This means that Ireland prepares the common position of all Member States and presents this position in Rome.  Ireland has been very active in seeking consensus on several issues, including giving greater visibility to the need for adequate nutrition and the need for a greater strategic focus for the work of the FAO.  This involves a great deal of negotiating, not just within the EU but at a global level.  Ireland also has its own interests to defend in terms of how Irish contributions are spent.  We also participate in a range of technical meetings in relation to animal health, plant health and food security.  </p><p>  The FAO is the largest specialised agency of the UN and plays a crucial role in global agricultural policy, international standardization and in the fight against climate change.  Ireland has a proud record in this organization and continues to contribute to global policy via this forum.  Other UN organizations have their own mechanisms and are the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  </p></reply>

They also maintain biodiversity in the wild by pollinating wild plants which then provide shelter and food for a wide range of insects and animals. There are over 100 native species of bees in Ireland and the Department of the Environment has valued their pollination services as being worth an estimated &euro;85m per annum to the Irish economy.</p><p>Bee health is an exceedingly complicated issue affected by many factors. Such factors include climate, hive management, disease, bee pests, environment (biodiversity, CO<sub>2</sub>  , pollution etc.), weather events, genetics and pesticides. Regarding the importance, or not, of pesticides in relation to bee health, it is important to note that significant bee health issues are also being experienced in areas where there is little or no pesticide use. There are also instances where well managed apiaries, in areas of intensive agricultural production, experience little change in the general health of their hives.  </p><p>  The widespread presence of the <i>Varroa</i>   mite, together with the associated viruses it spreads, and difficult weather conditions for beekeeping over recent summers are seen by many as the main causes of colony mortality among Irish bees in recent years.   </p><p>  Notwithstanding this, my Department is very aware of the potential risks which can result from the use of pesticides and so risk mitigation measures are often introduced when approving pesticides for use under Irish conditions. To that end, part of the farm inspection programme is devoted to checking proper pesticide use. Furthermore, my Department is currently introducing registration and training requirements for sprayer operators and a programme of testing of all pesticide application equipment. Additionally, it will be a legal requirement from 1<sup>st</sup>   January 2014 for farmers in Ireland to apply the principles of Integrated Pest Management.  </p></reply>

However, as a result of concerns raised following a full herd retest carried out on the herd on 2 July 2009, staff in the Department instigated an investigation into the circumstances surrounding a TB herd test conducted in July 2009. Following an investigation by the Special Investigation Unit of the Department, the herdowner was charged with several offences under the Bovine TB and Animal Remedies regulations. He pleaded guilty to a total of 15 offences at the Kilkenny District Court on 1 July 2011 and was convicted and fined.</p><p>  Under the TB compensation  scheme,  entitlement to compensation is conditional on owners/keepers complying with the provisions of the Disease of Animals Act 1966, any Orders made under this Act and other national or EU legislative requirements laid down under the disease eradication schemes. In view of the findings of the SIU investigation, which found that the person concerned had committed what constituted &ldquo;flagrant breaches&rdquo; as set out in the terms and conditions of the scheme, the Department decided that he was not entitled to any compensation in respect of the removal of cattle as reactors from his herd.  The herdowner was advised of that decision on 21 September 2010 and of the option to  appeal the decision to the Regional Assistant Principal Officer within 21 days, with further option of appeal to the Agricultural Appeals Office if the initial appeal was unsuccessful. However, he has not availed of these procedures.</p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s decision not to pay compensation in this case was supported by his guilty plea in the District Court, although the decision was not conditional on the outcome of the court case. In view of the above, there are no outstanding payments due under the TB schemes for the period concerned.  </p><p>With regard to payments under the Single Payment scheme, as required under the EU Regulations governing the Direct Payments Scheme, the outcome of the court case was subsequently cross reported to the Cross Compliance Unit of the Single Payment Scheme in July 2011. The offences were deemed intentional breaches of Statutory Management Requirement 11 which concerns Food Hygiene and a 60% penalty was imposed on his 2009 entitlement. A letter notifying the herdowner of this decision issued on the 25th   of October 2011. He was also advised of his right to seek a review of the decision and of his right to appeal the outcome of any such review to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office. To date, no such application has been received. In view of the foregoing, all payments due under the Single Payment scheme have been paid to the herdowner in question. </p></reply>

The package of measures is expected to provide a modernised and simplified, more risked-based approach to the protection of health and application of controls in the plant and animal sectors</p><p>  As it stands, the current body of EU legislation covering the food chain consists of almost 70 separate pieces of legislation. The package of reforms announced by the EU Commission proposes to reduce this down to 5 pieces of legislation. These are: Plant Health, Animal Health, Plant Reproductive Material, Official Controls and Financing Regulations. It is anticipated that the new streamlined legislation proposals would reduce the red-tape on processes and procedures for farmers, breeders and food business operators to make it easier for them to carry on business.</p><p>  The regulation proposed for the commercial plant and seed sector differs very little from those rules already in operation, apart from the introduction of a more streamlined certification process. Importantly though, the regulation proposes to reduce the administrative burden on micro-enterprises, such as small seed processors. Private gardeners and amateur growers would not be affected by these proposed regulations and would be able to continue to exchange seed as before.</p><p>  It is anticipated that the new regime will not be in place before 2016. In the intervening period, all stakeholders will have ample opportunity to raise any legitimate concerns. The European Commission intends to engage proactively with stakeholders through information seminars in each member state to provide concrete and accurate information on both the content and scope as well as the basis for the legislation. During the negotiation phase of both the overarching regulations and subsequent implementing rules, there will be further engagement with all stakeholders to ensure a balanced outcome.</p></reply>

The latter objective is aimed at removing ambivalence, reluctance or refusal by people and organisations in positions of trust and authority to report child abuse and cooperate with the relevant authorities. The Bill will create a range of responsibilities and duties on organisations and individuals and these will be detailed in the legislation. The precise requirements on varying sectors, organisations and individual professions, including inter alia, child care providers, is currently under consideration and part of an ongoing process.</p><p>  A further reason for reviewing the policy is to ensure that the related and relevant   legislation will be compatible with and will complement the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act and the Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Crimes Against Children and Intellectually Disabled Persons) Act. </p><p>  It is my intention to submit further proposals to Government as soon as possible with a view to the drafting of the Children First Bill as a priority.</p></reply>

This is an inspection rate of over 61% in a single year.  This compares very favourably with comparable jurisdictions such as England, where Ofsted operates a policy of inspecting childcare providers on a 3 &ndash; 4 year cycle.</p><p>  An issue that has been raised is the need to ensure national consistency in the approach to inspections.  The HSE recently introduced Standard Operating Procedures to facilitate this and I welcome that step.  I have also arranged for pre-school inspection reports to be published on-line from July of this year.</p><p>  It is important to realise that inspections alone are not the answer to improving quality. What is required is a multi-faceted approach, and since this Government came to office we have been working to ensure issues relating to child protection and welfare are put front and centre. The establishment of a Department of Children and Youth Affairs was recognition of the huge body of work which needs to be done in this area.</p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, driving the early childhood care and education quality agenda is one of my key objectives.  I believe we can achieve this objective by taking a number of steps in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, including the adaptation of the existing pre-school inspection system to provide a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for pre-schools, moving to a greater focus on outcomes for children.</p><p>  In support of this, a Joint Pilot Inspection of Early Years Services was carried out by Inspectors from the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills between September 2011 and May 2012.  This pilot will inform the proactive approach being taken.</p></reply>

It is my intention to progress to ratification in due course, once I am satisfied that the State will be able to meet all its obligations therein. I discussed the issue of ratification of this Protocol in a meeting with the UN Special Representative on Violence against Children, which took place on 11th June 2012, during the Special Representative's official visit to Ireland. We agreed that the matter would be prioritised in due course following completion of my Department's work on the Children's Referendum, submission of the State's next report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the setting up of the new Child and Family Agency.</p><p>  The criminal law elements of the Optional Protocol have largely been implemented by the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008. Legislative proposals to further protect children against sexual exploitation are at an advanced stage of preparation. These measures will facilitate full compliance with the criminal law provisions of a number of international legal instruments, including the Optional Protocol and an EU directive adopted in December 2011. The Minister for Justice and Equality expects to bring these legislative proposals to Government in the coming months. It is also proposed to put in place the necessary administrative procedures and arrangements to allow for accession and, subject to the advice of the Attorney General's Office, it is proposed to ratify the Optional Protocol as soon as is practicable.</p></reply>

Funding of some &euro;53.498m is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>In 2013, my Department's Youth Affairs Unit will provide total funding to For&oacute;ige of &euro;5.93 million.</p><p><table><tr><th>Programme</th><th>Amount in 2013</th></tr><tr><td>Youth Service Grant Scheme </td><td>&euro;2,651,154 </td></tr><tr><td>Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund  (1 &amp;amp; 2)</td><td>&euro;1,195,283</td></tr><tr><td>Special Project for Youth</td><td>&euro;2,083,572</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;5,930,009</td></tr></table></p><p>This total does not include local youth clubs grants, funded by my Department, but allocated to local clubs by; and at the discretion of local VEC's.</p><p>This total does not include funding provided to For&oacute;ige with respect to Garda youth diversion projects or funding from other state agencies such as the HSE.</p><p>The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in respect of 2013 amounted to &euro;5.393m which equated to almost a 10% reduction on 2012 funding available for the provision of youth services. The savings required in 2014 in the youth budget under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure amount to &euro;2.976m. Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department has tried to be as equitable as possible in achieving these savings. In considering how best to manage within the reduced budgets available, organisations are being asked to consider the scope for reducing administration costs and overheads, if this is at all possible, in order to maintain the front line youth services for young people. I have met, and continue to meet with, many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to minimise the impact of these necessary savings in order to ensure that the provision of quality youth services to young people is sustained in these challenging times.</p><p>In 2011, For&oacute;ige, following an internal review of the organisation&rsquo;s wide range of provision for young people, reprioritised its areas of youth provision and programmes.  This reprioritisation, which was proposed to my Department, enabled For&oacute;ige to strengthen their Big Brother Big Sister (BBBS) Programme nationally.  For&oacute;ige decided, with the permission of my Department, to reallocate the funding provided by my Department from their Youth Information services to the Big Brother Big Sister Programme.  Additional funding was also provided by my Department to For&oacute;ige for the Big Brother Big Sister Programme in 2012 and 2013.  While I fully appreciate the value of the Big Brother Big Sister Programme and the challenges facing it in the current fiscal climate, given the savings required within my Department's budget under the CRE, I do not envisage any further scope for the provision of any further increase on the funding already provided to For&oacute;ige.</p><p>A comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding has been commenced in my Department and it is anticipated that the findings of this report will inform the future development of youth programmes and services.</p><p>My Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year. The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.</p></reply>

At present pre-school services are subject to the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.</p><p>  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three pre-school children from different families in the childminder&rsquo;s home.  </p><p>  In 2002, the Health Service Executive (HSE) agreed to fund a Childminding Advisory Officer post or provide a staff member in each county, who would work with the 33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) funded under the Childcare Programme, implemented by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The role included notifying childminders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the voluntary notification system which was being developed by the CCCs.</p><p>  While Childminding Advisory Officers were established in most county areas, this was not always the case and they were not always located with the local CCC.  Despite their presence and the additional supports including training, a small capital grant scheme and the introduction of a tax relief for childminding in 2006, the increase in the number of voluntarily-notified childminders since 2004, when the number was 500, has been relatively small and levelled off at 1,250.</p><p>  In recent years, the HSE made a decision to gradually reduce the level of funding and support for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts.  I would point to the fact that the CCCs are now well-established and effective bodies at local level, and that supporting the childminding sector is an integral part of their work.  As a result, childminders continue to have access to support, training and advice.</p><p>  Work on the development of Ireland&rsquo;s first Early Years Strategy for children aged from birth to 6 years, is already underway in my Department.  The approach I am taking in developing  the Strategy has received Government approval.  My intention is to create an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s early years sector and a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to 6 years.  </p><p>  A broad range of issues relating to regulations, standards, quality assurance, and inspection are currently being considered by the Expert Advisory Group which is advising my Department on the Strategy. As Minister I am committed to ensuring high standards in early years service provision, both in terms of care and curriculum. The role of quality provision is critical in contributing to childhood development and I am determined that this key objective will be reflected fully in the Early Years Strategy.</p></reply>

The Policy Framework is expected to be published in mid 2013 and will build on Our Children - Their Lives, Ireland's first Children's Strategy which was published in 2000. This is relevant to the Early Years Strategy as the Strategy is one of three, more detailed strategies which will be developed under the Framework.</p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which will be Ireland's first ever national strategy for early years, is under development. It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as child health and well-being, parenting and family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education. The Strategy will further recognise the economic imperative and benefits accruing from targeted investment in early years interventions.</p><p>  Key issues to be addressed in the Strategy include: the further development of early childhood care and education programmes; the need to enhance quality provision, curricular support; and workforce capacity in early years services; support and regulation of the childminding sector; and the future development of early intervention, therapeutic and family support services to support young children and their parents.</p><p>  The Strategy will bring together and consider a significant amount of international and domestic research on the importance of early years for child development, including findings from the &quot;Growing Up in Ireland&quot; study. It will also be informed by the evaluations from the Prevention and Early Intervention Projects which have been funded jointly by my Department and philanthropic organisations, as well as an analysis of existing service provision and associated resources. The major programme of institutional change which is currently underway, including the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency, will also be taken into account.</p><p>  The results of a public consultation, undertaken as part of the development of the Children and Young People Policy Framework, is currently being analysed and will inform both the Framework and the Early Years Strategy. </p><p>  I have appointed an Expert Advisory Group, chaired by Dr. Eilis Hennessy, Head of School of Psychology at UCD, to advise on the preparation of the Strategy. The Group comprises external experts from a range of specialties, including paediatrics, early childhood care and education, child protection and public health nursing and is continuing to meet on a regular basis.  I have met the Expert Advisory Group on a number of occasions,  and I am very satisfied with the progress being made in developing Ireland's first Early Years Strategy.  I expect the Strategy to be published during the summer months.</p></reply>

Up to the last decade, Ireland's pre-school sector was almost non-existent.  During the late nineties we still had one of the lowest female participation rates in the developed world, and one of the highest unemployment rates.  The years of the Celtic tiger saw a scramble to put services in place in respect to demand, but a wholly inadequate approach to quality and sustainability.</p><p>  We have seen what happens when you don't invest in building an effective system and culture of qualify-focussed, child-centred service provision, and when you don't invest in robust oversight and inspection.</p><p>  This Government has been working to address this legacy. </p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to maintain the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) in order to promote the best outcomes for children and families, and we have secured the additional monies required to do that.</p><p>  But the Programme for Government also includes a commitment to improve the quality of the free Pre-School Year and, by extension, the quality of all early childhood care and education, through the implementation of standards and by reviewing training options for the workforce. </p><p>  These commitments have always been a key priority for me.</p><p>This is why my Department and I have been progressing work on Ireland's first-ever Early Years Strategy and this why we have been working on a comprehensive<b></b>  Pre-School Quality Agenda. </p><p>  We have identified 8 key areas of action which I believe need to be considered and addressed as a matter of urgency; iIncreasing the qualification requirements for all staff in pre-school services to a minimum standard at FETAC Level 5; improving the quality and curricular supports for pre-school services when implementing the Siolta Framework and Aistear Curriculum; implementing the new National Pre-School Standards; introducing a registration system for all pre-school services; taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust; publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible; ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance; and increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance. </p><p>  Increasing the required qualification standards of childcare staff</p><p>  We are working to increase the required qualification standards of childcare staff. The majority of staff working in the sector now have qualifications to FETAC Level 5 and I believe that this should be made a requirement for all staff working in the sector by September 2015, and for new services by the earlier date of September 2014.  I am also proposing that the minimum qualification requirement for Pre-School Leaders within the Pre-School Year should be increased from FETAC Level 5 to FETAC Level 6 from those dates also.  </p><p>  Supports for Aistear and Siolta.</p><p>  We are working to improve support and mentoring for individual pre-school services in implementing S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  This is essential if we are to ensure that all services understand and implement a child-centred approach to the care and education of young children. </p><p>  Implementing the new National Pre-School Standards.</p><p>  We are developing new National Pre-School Standards, designed to support providers in delivering a high quality service and parents in choosing the childcare best suited to their needs.  New day-care standards have been completed but have not yet been implemented.  Later this year it is intended to launch these standards alongside further standards on sessional care and childminding which are currently being finalised. These standards will replace all current guidelines and will be implemented and inspected in line with the new registration system and improved inspection systems</p><p>  Registration of all childcare providers.</p><p>  Work is already underway in the Child and Family Services area of the Health Service Executive (HSE) to introduce a registration system for pre-school services.  I understand this system will be in place for new services from the end of this year and will be phased in for existing services thereafter.  This is an important development because it will move services from the current position, where they are required to notify the Pre-School Inspectorate of their intention to open, to a requirement to be inspected and found satisfactory, before being permitted to open.  All pre-school services are currently required to pay an annual fee to the HSE of between &euro;40 and &euro;80.  I am looking at increasing this fee.  The additional funds raised will assist in improving inspection and supports for quality improvement. </p><p>  Publication of Inspection Reports.</p><p>Parents will rightly demand and expect the highest standards and this will be a key factor in driving change in the sector.  Publishing inspection reports is an essential step in ensuring high standards and accountability. All <i>new</i> inspection reports will be made available on-line from the HSE as a matter of urgency.  All <i>current</i>   inspection reports will be made available on-line in 2014.  </p><p>  Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust.</p><p>  We are working on developing a more robust, consistent and regular inspection system  There has been a significant programme of work underway in the HSE over the past year to develop a single, consistent national inspection service (as opposed to 37 different local systems).  </p><p>  We propose moving to a position where there is consistent and assured national target rate for the frequency of inspection of pre-school services, while ensuring capacity for prioritisation based on risk assessment.   The HSE is currently reviewing the regional spread of inspectors with a view to identifying whether either additional resources or redeployment of existing inspectors is required to achieve this. </p><p>  Building on this work, officials of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills have been examining options to incrementally develop a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for pre-schools; moving away from a narrow focus on compliance, and leading to a greater focus on children's outcomes, including educational development and child wellbeing.  This work is being informed by the findings of a recent Joint Pilot Inspection carried out in a small number of settings by Inspectors from the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>  Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance.</p><p>  We are working to ensure consistent action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance. There must be a follow-through on inspections.  Clearly, services which are found to be in serious breach of the Regulations will face closure and prosecution.   It is proposed to develop a protocol with the Pre-School Inspectorate which will take a calibrated approach and which will enable more decisive action to be taken in response to non-compliance.</p><p>  Increased Sanctions for non-compliance.</p><p>  My Department will also be undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.  </p><p>  The recent broadcast highlighted practices on the part of individual staff members which were of very serious concern.  The responsibility of management must also be the subject of questioning.  Management is responsible for the selection and training of staff, the development of operational policies and practices and the management of day to day service delivery.  Most of all management is responsible for the culture and ethos of the pre-school - they set the tone through their example, their interaction with children and parents and their guidance of staff.  </p><p>  This pre-school quality agenda represents an essential building block towards the future extension of universal pre-school provision; including the objective which I have previously spoken of in relation to introducing a second free-pre-school year. </p><p>  There is a wealth of international (and emerging Irish) research which highlights the economic benefits of investing in the early years and which demonstrates how quality pre-school provision can greatly contribute to improved educational and developmental outcomes for children, including school-readiness. A second free-pre-school year would also represent an equivalent saving of approximately &euro;2,500 - &euro;3,000 in childcare costs for parents.</p><p>  However in discussing the possible extension of the free pre-school year, I have also always been clear that ensuring quality provision is critical. </p><p>  I see my pre-school quality agenda; and measures to be considered in the context of Budget 2014, as a first step in a multi-annual approach which could eventually lead to the introduction of a second year.</p><p>  I believe it is critical to the quality agenda for early childhood care and education that my Department continues to work in close co-operation with the Department of Education and Skills, given the overlap of interest between the Departments in regard to education for children under 6 years of age, as reflected in S&iacute;olta, Aistear and the Workforce Development Plan, and the professional training role of the State funded training bodies.  The two Departments are already working together on these issues and on the development of a joint approach to pre-school inspection.  </p></reply>

I am advised that all possible means are employed in the children detention setting of the Oberstown campus, Lusk, Co Dublin to create and maintain stable relationships based on the child care model of detention. </p><p>  The Programme for Government has a strong commitment to end the practice of sending children to St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and this is the central principle of current policy in the area of juvenile detention facilities.  On 2 April 2012, I announced an investment package of approximately &euro;50 million over three years in capital funding to undertake the National Children Detention Facility (NCDF) project at the Oberstown children detention campus in Lusk, Co Dublin. This will include six new detention units and associated education and training facilities.  My aim is that by mid 2014, the new facilities to be built in Oberstown will enable the assignment of responsibility for all children up to the age of 18 years remanded in custody by the courts or sentenced to a period of detention  to the Oberstown campus.  </p><p>  As a first step and an interim measure in advance of the development of the new facilities under the NCDF project, I also introduced with effect from 1 May 2012 a legal provision for the detention of newly remanded or sentenced 16 year old boys to the Children Detention Schools in Oberstown.  This involved an increase in the maximum age threshold on admission for boys to the Oberstown campus from all boys less than 16 years of age to all boys less than 17 years of age. The maximum age threshold for girls detained on the Oberstown campus has been set at less than 18 years of age since 2007. </p><p>  I acknowledge that the implementation of the change in age categories for boys admitted to the Oberstown campus presented a new dimension to be taken into account by staff working in this challenging area.  However, it was done based on the vision and objective for a child care model of detention for all children under the age of 18 years as set out in the Children Act, 2001.  I very much welcome the ongoing cooperation and expert commitment of the care staff in Oberstown with the implementation of this change. </p><p>  Since August 2010, a &quot;Notifiable Incidents Policy&quot; has been in place by agreement between the Oberstown Board of Management and the Irish Youth Justice Service, which is based in my Department.  Under this policy, all types of incidents involving children in detention, including assaults, are recorded under a prescribed system of reporting and review between staff, line management in each children detention school, the Oberstown Board of Management and the Irish Youth Justice Service. </p><p>  I emphasise my view that all forms of assaults by children in detention are unacceptable.  However, I am also advised that age is one of a number of criteria that have to be taken into account in assessing the level of management risk with each child in detention - there are a range of other factors based on the individual profile of each child such as medical and mental health background,  availability of family supports, levels of educational attainment and history of criminal offending.  All of these factors are recorded on admission of each child to the Oberstown campus and are factored into an individualised management plan in each case. </p><p>  Safety for staff is a key objective in the management of the children detention schools. All issues relating to the management of each facility, including any that may affect staff safety, are kept under review on an ongoing basis by the Oberstown Board of Management and the Irish Youth Justice Service.  In addition, I am advised that the maximum number of children that may be detained in each physical unit of each children detention school is kept at a level that reflects the physical structure of each building and ensures safe and secure custody for all children, as well as the highest possible level of staff safety.</p><p>  A range of supports are in place to assist staff in discharging their important role in the care of children in a detention setting.  There is an ongoing programme of staff training in a specialised and externally accredited child custody management system for dealing with unruly behaviour.  Where any assault incidents take place, there are ongoing supports available for staff in the form of management guidance, assistance with medical expenses, an assault and injury leave scheme, counselling services and structured follow up with staff to assist their return to employment.  </p></reply>

The Plan acknowledged national and international research evidence which establishes a strong correlation between the availability of an appropriately trained workforce to staff early years services and the ability to deliver high quality pre-school provision. The implementation of the Workforce Development Plan is being overseen by the Early Years Education Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills, which is co-located with my Department.</p><p>  The Plan sets out the key areas that emerged from an extensive programme of research and consultation:  These key areas are: the necessity for clearly articulated professional pathways into and across professional domains of practice related to the care and education of children. These include occupational role descriptors with associated qualification levels; the establishment of an agreed set of national standards for all awards in early childhood care and education (incorporating core knowledge, skills, competencies and work experience) across all relevant levels of the National Framework of Qualifications in Ireland; access to flexible, affordable and nationally accredited learning opportunities at all levels of  qualification for pre-service and in-service professional development; and the necessity to ensure consistent quality of ECCE courses nationally across a range of variables including content, delivery and work placement.</p><p>  The publication by FETAC of Common Award Standards at Levels 4, 5 and 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications ensures that there is consistent quality of ECCE courses across the country and delivers on one of the key areas set out in the Workforce Development Plan.  I view this as an essential building block for developing and upskilling the workforce.  </p><p>  The Workforce Development Plan identified different distinct groups including new entrants to the workforce who wish to become appropriately qualified for specific occupational roles and responsibilities, and unqualified practitioners in the current workforce who want to achieve the Level 5 award. For new entrants to the workforce the publication of Common Award Standards at Levels 4, 5 and 6 is a welcome development.  Programmes of learning developed to meet these new award standards will incorporate national practice frameworks and will reflect national policy objectives, thereby ensuring that graduates are fully prepared to enter the workforce.  Training providers have begun to meet the new award standards in respect of the FETAC Level 5 Major Award in Early Childhood Care and Education. The first programme has been developed and is being provided through the VECs.</p><p>  My Department and I have been working on a comprehensive Pre-School quality agenda that will, inter alia, work towards increasing the qualification requirements for all childcare staff.</p><p>  Future developments relating to early years and education, including workforce development, are being considered in the context of the National Early Years Strategy for children aged from birth to six years, which is being developed by my Department and expected to be completed later this year.</p></reply>

These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.

The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children published their report in July 2012.</p><p>As part of the Joint Committees consultation process a number of submissions were received. Overall there was a welcome that the legislation would increase the focus on child protection.  The contributions in the main came from organisations already implementing Children First. </p><p>Submissions were not all in agreement and many points emerging needed to be considered and reconciled.  This involves consideration of policy and operational issues, including those pertaining to childminders, as well as the best legal approach to achieving Children First objectives. In this regard, officials within my Department have consulted with a number of organisations and individuals and I recently met with a number of key stakeholders to discuss the complex issues that have arisen. I have also taken the opportunity to consult with a number of experts in relation to the development of the policy in this area. These discussions will inform the preparation of enhanced policy proposals that is currently underway.  </p><p>The framework is now focussed on the safety and protection of children generally; the provision of safe services for children; cooperation amongst professionals and organisations where children are at risk of neglect and abuse and finally mandating key individuals to report child abuse known to them. The latter objective is aimed at removing ambivalence, reluctance or refusal by people and organisations in positions of trust and authority to report child abuse and cooperate with the relevant authorities. The Bill will create a range of responsibilities and duties on organisations and individuals and these will be detailed in the legislation. The precise requirements on varying sectors, organisations and individual professions, is currently under consideration and part of an ongoing process.</p><p>A further reason for reviewing the policy is to ensure that the related and relevant   legislation will be compatible with and will complement the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act and the Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Crimes Against Children and Intellectually Disabled Persons) Act. </p><p>It is my intention to submit further proposals to Government as soon as possible with a view to the drafting of the Children First Bill as a priority</p></reply>

Significant investment totalling in excess of &euro;260 million is being provided this year by my Department to assist parents with the cost of childcare.</p><p>My Department provides two targeted childcare support programmes - the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme - and also the universal Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  </p><p>The CCS programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or on low or relatively modest incomes. For the purpose of the CCS programme, disadvantage and qualifying income are determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.   Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, parents with middle incomes may also benefit from subvention.  </p><p>The CETS<b></b>programme provides &euro;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services in both the community and commercial sectors for qualifying trainees and students.  Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro rata basis.</p><p>The ECCE programme provides one free  pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.   Children aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 7 months at 1 September in the relevant year qualify for a maximum of 15 hours per week free pre-school provision over a 38 week period.  This is a universal programme to which all children have access.</p><p>You may also be aware that, as part of Budget 2013, I announced with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, a joint school age childcare initiative. This After-school Childcare Programme, which represents a full year investment of &euro;14 million, will provide important support to parents in low income families wishing to take up employment, by ensuring that some 6,000 quality after-school care places are provided to support children's development.  </p><p>Eligibility for this programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Officials from the Department of Social Protection and my Department are continuing in close collaboration on the operation of the programme.   The first pilot phase has commenced with up to 500 childcare places available, with  Department of Social Protection local offices in Tralee, Mullingar, Dundalk, Cork City, Finglas, Kings Inn and Limerick City participating.  The second phase of the pilot will be rolled out in July, with the full roll-out of the programme in September 2013, to coincide with the new school year.   </p><p>These programmes have been maintained and expanded despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure and they represent a significant investment in supporting parents with the cost of childcare.    </p></reply>

Participating childcare services provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  It is a fundamental principle of the programme that the pre-school year is provided free of charge to a parent whose child qualifies under the programme. </p><p>The challenge for this Department and all other Departments is to make effective use of the limited resources which are now available.  While I am pleased that the ECCE programme is being maintained on a universal and free basis and that additional funding of almost &euro;10m was provided in 2012 to meet the costs of demographic changes, it was necessary to make some changes to the capitation payments in the 2012/2013 academic year, to meet the need to reduce overall expenditure. </p><p>The weekly capitation rates paid to providers were reduced by &euro;2 (approximately 3%) from September 2012.  However, to give some flexibility to childcare services to manage this modest reduction, the staff to child ratios and the space ratios - for the pre-school element of childcare services only - were increased in September 2012.   The staff to child ratio was increased from a ratio of 1:10 to a ratio of 1:11 and, to facilitate the implementation of these new ratios, a new space/area requirement of 1.818 square metres per child was applied. </p><p>While the ratio of staff to children is important, it was considered that an increase of 1 child per adult, from 10 to 11, would not have an unduly significant impact on the quality of the pre-school experience.  </p><p>The increase in the ratio from 1:10 to 1:11 applies only to those children participating in the free pre-school year.  These children are all over the age of 3 years 2 months.  There was no amendment to the adult:child ratios applying to younger children.</p></reply>

Community childcare services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  Parents qualify for support under the CCS programme on the basis of their social welfare entitlement.  The JobBridge scheme, which is implemented by the Department of Social Protection, is a National Internship Scheme which provides work experience placement for unemployed people.  Participants in the JobBridge scheme receive a weekly allowance of &euro;50 in addition to any social welfare entitlement they may have.</p><p>  Participants in the JobBridge scheme do not, on the basis of participation in the scheme, automatically qualify for subvention under the CCS programme but qualify on the basis of their underlying social welfare entitlement.  For example, a parent who was in receipt of Job Seekers benefit and who holds a medical card qualifies for a subvention payment of &euro;50 per week towards the cost of full-time childcare.  If that parent enters the JobBridge scheme they will continue to be subvented at the rate of &euro;50 per week for the duration of their participation in the scheme.  A parent entering the JobBridge scheme and having been in receipt of a social welfare payment that qualified them for the higher rate of subvention of &euro;95 per week under the CCS programme would maintain that level of subvention support for the duration of their participation in the JobBridge scheme.</p></reply>

The HSE completed a review of the autism services provided by the health sector for both children and adults with autism in 2012.  Its <i>National Review of Autism Services: Past, Present and Way Forward Report,</i> reviews and identifies appropriate pathways of care for individuals with autism, given the existing diverse system of delivering services and varied approaches across the health sector.  It recommends a move to a more consistent model of service delivery in line with the Government's mainstreaming policy of equal access for people with a disability to the appropriate service for their individual needs.  It also recommends a reconfiguration of existing service provision, with access at the appropriate level, depending on need, through the primary care system, school age teams, and specialist intervention services as appropriate.  It endorses the reorganisation of services for children and young people under the Progressing Disabilities Services for Children and Young People(0-18s) Programme.  This Programme, established since 2010, aims to achieve a national unified approach to delivering disability health services, so that there is a clear pathway for all children to the services they need regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability or developmental delay.  The Programme is rolling out at national, regional and local level and involves representatives from the health and education sectors, statutory and non-statutory service providers and parents working together to see how current services can best be re-organised.  Implementation of the Programme will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children, including those with autism, who require access to health related supports.</p><p>  The National Review of Autism Services Report will be implemented, within existing resources and taking account of the need for greater efficiency and effectiveness in the current climate, and within the context of parallel initiatives including the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services published in July 2012 and the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18) Programme.  The Children, Adolescents and Young People with Complex Disabilities Unit, led by a Principal Officer, was established in the Department of Health in April 2012.  This important development aims to foster greater collaboration between the Departments of Health, Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs on children's disability issues including autism and to build on the cross-sectoral working arrangements that are already in place.</p></reply>

However, when economic circumstances allow and the public finances are restored to a sustainable position, the pay measures that have applied to public servants will be reviewed, and in that regard, priority will be given to public servants with pay rates at &euro;35,000 or less.  I recognise that the savings sought from the health service pay and pensions bill are extremely difficult and challenging for health staff, as indeed they are for all public servants.  They are however a necessary further contribution to the fiscal consolidation process required to restore the country's economic sovereignty and bring current expenditure deficit under control.  If the proposals are accepted, it will be possible to achieve the required savings and major increases in public service productivity to secure the necessary reduction in the public service pay and pension bill.  In addition, the essential elements and protections of the Public Service Agreement will remain in place, which will secure industrial peace in the public service at a critical time on our path to economic sovereignty.</p></reply>

Emergency first responders include voluntary service providers such as St John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland, Irish Red Cross and the Order of Malta Ireland, and community first responders who are certified at emergency first responder level.  A new policy in relation to first responders was approved on 27 March 2012.  It will ensure that the integration of cardiac first responder schemes into priority 999 call responses has a robust governance framework in place.</p><p>  There are two types of priority emergency call-out in Ireland for the NAS.  ECHO calls are for situations involving life-threatening cardiac or respiratory arrest and DELTA calls involve life-threatening situations other than cardiac or respiratory arrest.  The national standard for addressing ECHO and DELTA calls is the EMS Priority Dispatch Standard, which is issued by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC).  Under this standard, ECHO calls may be responded to by cardiac first responders, but DELTA calls require a minimum response of a trained emergency first responder.</p><p>  The HSE NAS, through its national control centre reconfiguration project, is continuing to rationalise the number of ambulance control rooms across the country, with a target of one national system.  This project is focused on improving call taking and dispatch functions and on delivering improved technology.  This will assist in improving response times and will allow the NAS to deploy emergency resources in a much more effective and efficient manner, on a regional and national basis rather than within small geographic areas, ensuring the most appropriate response to an incident.</p><p>  The control centre reconfiguration project is consistent with international best practice and is endorsed by HIQA as the most appropriate approach to improve the quality of services to patients and facilitate investment in technologically enabled service delivery.  The project is also a key element of Future Health:  A Strategic Framework for Health Reform in Ireland 2012-2015.  The NAS will continue to use the same structured process to answer 999/112 calls and to prioritise responses, callers will continue to be asked for direction to incidents, and special mapping tools will be in the Emergency Operations Centre which can plot the location of the incidents on the map.  Responding crews can then be guided to the location in the normal way.

Collaborating with individual hospitals, the SDU together with the NTPF and the HSE have developed the OP waiting list minimum dataset that allows for data to be submitted to the NTPF from hospitals on a weekly basis and, for the first time, outpatient data is available on www.ntpf.ie.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first time consultant led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE service plan.  The SDU/NTPF will work closely with hospitals towards achievement of the maximum waiting time.  Should a patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved. In relation to the specific hospital appointment query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

Patients who access these services privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.  In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the Health Service Executive.  Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and authorised by the High Tech Liaison Officers.  The cost of the medicines is reflected in the PCRS Statistical Analysis of Claims and Payments under High Tech Drugs.  Patients may then use their valid established eligibility for GMS or Drug Payment Scheme, as appropriate, to access the medicines.  I am conscious of the financial burden that fertility services can place on the couples concerned; however, this matter has to be considered in the context of the difficult economic situation that prevails and the other compelling funding demands across a full range of health issues.</p></reply>

The application is being considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed last year by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines.  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of pirfenidone and concluded that, at the submitted price, pirfenidone is not cost-effective for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The report is available on the NCPE's website ().  The NCPE report is an important input to assist decision making and informs further discussions between the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug.</p><p>  The HSE has had negotiations with Intermune (the manufacturer of pirfenidone) in relation to the pricing of pirfenidone and is examining an offer made by Intermune.  The offer will be assessed in the context of the procedures for the assessment of new medicines as per the 2012 agreement between IPHA, the HSE and the Department of Health.  The HSE is carefully considering all the issues which arise in relation to the proposed benefits and costs of this medicine and expects to reach a decision in the near future.</p></reply>

Guidelines are being developed for the following priority programmes relevant to primary care:  Stroke; Heart Failure; Asthma; Diabetes; and COPD.  </p><p>  The National Integrated Care Diabetes Programme is being rolled out on a phased basis including:</p><p>  - National Retinopathy Screening;</p><p>  - A foot care screening and treatment service to prevent diabetic foot ulceration and lower limb amputation;</p><p>  - An Integrated Care Programme for all patients with diabetes;</p><p>  - A National Diabetes Register; and</p><p>  - The introduction of a National Model of Care for children and young adults with Type 1 diabetes and the implementation of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy for children under 5 years with type 1 diabetes.</p><p>  It is expected to take approximately three years to fully roll out the National Integrated Care Diabetes Programme.</p><p>  The Government has approved funding for the appointment of 17 Integrated Care Diabetes Nurse Specialists (one per HSE Integrated Service Area) to support the phased roll out of the programme.  These Diabetes Nurse Specialists will work 1 day per week in a hospital setting and 4 days per week in primary care.  They will play a key role in the development of clinically sound collaborative links between primary care and secondary care providers and will also be an essential resource in empowering patients to achieve optimum diabetes control.  It is anticipated that all 17 positions will be filled soon.</p><p>  Funding has also been secured to appoint 16 podiatrists and a number of these posts have been filled.  Recruitment for the remaining posts is underway and the aim is to have them filled as soon as possible in 2013.</p><p>  The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new General Medical Services (GMS) General Practitioner (GP) contract with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams.</p><p>  Officials in my Department are in consultation with the HSE with a view to drawing up a new contract.  The appropriate arrangements in relation to the management of chronic conditions, including diabetes, will be considered as part of the new GMS contract.</p></reply>

During the course of his inquiry a limited amount of personal information was received by the Department in relation to participants in two of these trials, one at the Mother and Baby Unit in Cork in 1960/61 and a second in 1973 at the Bird&rsquo;s Nest and the Cottage Home, both in Dun Laoghaire. </p><p>  This information was subsequently made available by my Department to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (originally known as the Laffoy Commission and later as the Ryan Commission).

Persons who were resident in the above named homes and who wish to ascertain if the Department holds clinical trials vaccination records in respect of them, may do so by contacting my Department. I would emphasise, however, that my Department holds few records relating to persons involved in such trials. </p><p>  As there is no evidence that any of the persons vaccinated in accordance with the arrangements referred to in the Question were adversely affected, the issue of compensation does not arise.</p></reply>

This funding will be allocated to each HSE Region based on its percentage of population.  Both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of the funding in a creative and flexible manner so as to secure as many places as possible for this cohort.  </p><p>  The HSE expects that approximately 700 young people who have finished their education or life-skills training will require services in 2013.  Providing the level of services required for everyone, within the additional funding, will continue to be a challenge. Work in this area will be progressed largely in line with the HSE guidance document developed in 2012, which led to the successful placement of 99% of RT graduates and 96% of school leavers last year.</p><p>  The National Disability Unit in the HSE is liaising with the Regional Leads for Disability Services on a cohesive and collaborative approach, in conjunction with the non-statutory service providers, to meeting the needs of school leavers and RT graduates within the resources available. As part of the planning process work is underway to establish the number of school leavers and RT graduates who require a placement, identify their needs and determine how those needs may be met.</p><p>  It is envisaged that plans will be completed for each region shortly and submitted to Area Managers, Regional Specialists and Regional Director of Operations for agreement.  Arising from completed and approved plans, a communication process will be agreed with service providers to inform families of the services that will be available from September 2013. </p><p>  With regard to the specific information requested by the Deputy on the final number of school-leavers and RT graduates in each HSE Region and PCCC area who will require a place, the number of new places which will be required and the cost of providing these places, I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy as soon as the planning process is completed and the information has been collated.</p></reply>

It is described as a spectrum disorder that can have a varied presentation of characteristics ranging from mild to severe. The first signs of autism may appear as developmental delay before the age of 3.  Many individuals with autism, due to the complexity of their presentation, may have a primary diagnosis of intellectual disability or mental health co-morbidity.</p><p>  Significant resources have been invested in recent years in services for children with autism. This has been driven principally by the increase in the number of children presenting with autism.  In addition, there is now an increased awareness of the importance of early intervention for children with developmental delay and autism. </p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 entitles people with a disability, including those with autism, to an independent assessment of need and a statement of proposed services to be provided.  It was commenced on 1 June 2007 in respect of children under the age of five. There has been a very significant rise in overall activity around the assessment process in recent years. However, the assessment process under the Disability Act does not have to take place in advance of intervention, but can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary. </p><p>  The manner in which assessments of need are carried out and the use of appropriate diagnostic tools are service matters for the Health Service Executive. Accordingly, I have arranged for the Deputy&rsquo;s question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme. There has been no change to the Government&rsquo;s over-arching commitment to this goal. This Government is the first in the history of this State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. </p><p>  Having examined the progress made in the universal GP care plan, it became clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic for a short-term arrangement. Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness. The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public. This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions. As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition. While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. </p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the delay in the initial step of the roll-out of the universal GP service. In doing so, it has considered the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay. </p><p>  No decision has been taken by the Cabinet Committee or by Government on changing the first step of the plan to extend GP care without fees to persons with chronic illnesses. Instead, it has been agreed that we should prepare and set out a number of alternative options with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  Minister Reilly and I expect to report back to the Cabinet Committee in the near future. As part of this work, consideration will be given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation of this universal health service.  </p><p>  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources in the two most recent Budgets. The HSE Vote now contains funding of &euro;30 million for this year for an initial phase of the provision of GP services as part of this Programme for Government commitment.</p><p>  To conclude, far from abandoning its commitment to universal GP care, this Government is determined to expedite the implementation of a national GP service for the entire population, something to which no previous Government has ever aspired. </p></reply>

However, at the appointment stage this data may not be current and cannot be validated.  Accordingly, it is not possible to indicate the number of the successful candidates who were already employed by the HSE.  </p><p>  It is currently the responsibility of the HSE Regional Directors of Operations (RDO) to decide within the context of their current resources, whether to fill vacancies that may arise as a result of the appointment of an individual to the mental health development posts from 2012.  Each RDO has been asked to consider favourably the backfilling of posts vacated by the appointment of individuals to new mental health development posts to ensure that the objective of enhancing General Adult and Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams will be maintained.</p><p>  As at 30th April, 2013, 383 of the 414 posts approved in 2012 have either been filled, are under offer or awaiting clearance.  The National Recruitment Service (NRS) of the HSE creates national panels in anticipation of vacancies.  On occasion however, it is difficult to fill some posts for various reasons including geographical location, international shortage of some grades, most notably clinical Psychologists etc.  The NRS  is currently working to ensure that the remaining posts will be filled as soon as possible, subject to appropriately qualified candidates being available.  </p><p>  Budgetary pressures within the HSE delayed the full utilisation of the 2012 funding, but this sum is available again this year along with a further additional &euro;35m which was provided in Budget 2013 for the continued development of mental health services across a range of headings, including the further ongoing development of community services.  477 posts have been approved to implement these measures.  Each of the four HSE regions were asked to submit a business case against each of the identified objectives detailing how the funding is to be spent and the type and number of WTE to be recruited.</p><p>  Approval has issued to three of the Regions, HSE Dublin North East, HSE South and HSE West and it is expected that approval will issue to the remaining HSE Region shortly to enable recruitment to commence.</p><p>  I have received assurances from the HSE that the recruitment process for the new posts being funded in 2013, and any outstanding  posts from the 414 approved in 2012, is being given priority within the HSE.</p></reply>

It is also a vital support to older people in facilitating their early discharge from, and in preventing inappropriate admissions to, acute hospitals. </p><p>  The HSE, equally, recognises the importance of home help and home care in supporting older persons to live in their own homes and communities, in accordance with Government policy. The 2013 National Service Plan includes the provision of 10.3 million hours of home help service, the same level as planned for in 2012.</p><p>  The number of hours worked by home helps varies according to service needs, given that the home help service requires a unique set of arrangements to achieve the level of flexibility required. On 29 June 2012, the Labour Court recommended that the HSE and SIPTU should engage in relation to matters concerning the contracts of home helps. Subsequently, on 16th October 2012, it identified mechanisms to define specified hours and protocols to be followed where specified hours are not met as issues to be addressed. At a further hearing on 12th  December 2012, it noted that management proposals to deal with these issues would be encompassed in a comprehensive delivery model for home help services. </p><p>  The parties subsequently met on a number of occasions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, most recently on 30th April. While significant progress was made on a range of contractual matters, the Commission is referring a number of outstanding issues, including a revised contract for all home helps, back to the Labour Court.</p></reply>

The programme involves a number of measures, including the Performance Improvement Action Plan, development of the intermediate care service (ICS), the trial emergency aeromedical service (EAS), and the National Ambulance Service (NAS) Control Centre Reconfiguration Project.  </p><p>  The NAS is taking steps to address challenges nationally, such as reliance on on-call rostering, geography,  resourcing and the use of emergency ambulances for routine transport. The move from on-call to on-duty rostering for ambulance services is a key part of improving the service as highly trained paramedic crews are on site in their stations or vehicles to respond immediately to dispatches. The NAS is also developing a non-emergency transport fleet, the national intermediate care service (ICS), for routine clinical transfers of patients, freeing emergency ambulances for emergency responses.   </p><p>  A key priority for the NAS is the upgrading of its fleet and communications systems. The NAS has had a comprehensive capital upgrade programme over the last number of years which includes provision for replacement of existing emergency ambulances, with installation of cameras to ensure safety for staff and patients as a standard. </p><p>   In relation to the details of the query raised by the Deputy in relation to ambulance equipment and vehicles, as these  are operational issues for the HSE I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

My priority is to ensure that those affected by narcolepsy, with symptom onset post pandemic vaccination are provided with a range of services and supports to meet their health needs.  The Health Service Executive has responsibility for health service delivery and at my request, the HSE developed a range of appropriate services and supports to address the needs of this group.  Together, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills provide a very comprehensive range of services and supports to those affected.</p><p>  These supports and services include access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred. This includes expenses for counselling services for individuals and also for families of children affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination,  in cases where such services are not already available through the HSE.  Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place are ongoing.  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected.</p><p>  The HSE's advocacy unit is in regular contact with the support group SOUND and last met representatives of the group on 17 May 2013.  Through regional co-ordinators the HSE also has frequent contact with individual members of SOUND to assist them in service access and reimbursement of expenses.   The HSE recently held an information day for staff, also attended by SOUND, to ensure awareness of all the relevant services available.</p><p>  My Department is considering all possible supports which may need to be put in place for those affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination.   I would like to assure the Deputy that this matter continues to be a priority for my Department.</p></reply>

However, people attending outpatient and hospital appointments are, in general, expected to make their own travel arrangements, using private or scheduled public transport. The exceptions are for dialysis, cancer (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and post-operative transplant patients, where transport may be provided.  In these cases, the patient's appointment  should be directly related to the treatment. </p><p>  Transport may also be provided where, in the clinician's view, the patient would be unable to make the journey without clinical assistance or where the patient must be transported on a stretcher.  </p><p>  Following implementation of the HSE's non-ambulance patient transport policy, responsibility for the arrangement and provision of non-ambulance transport has moved from the HSE National Ambulance Service to local health offices in each region.  Patients or their clinicians should contact their local health office directly in relation to transport requests. </p><p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department of Social Protection administers a scheme which may help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as Exceptional Needs Payments (ENPs).  Enquiries relating to this scheme should be addressed to the Department of Social Protection.</p></reply>

Within this context it has a responsibility to ensure that the health related needs of children with special needs are addressed and that these children are appropriately supported in pre-school and school settings. This is done in a number of ways such as by providing grant aid to support pre-school provision in community pre-schools and by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for pre-school children with disabilities. It also facilitates children with special needs to attend mainstream pre-school by providing the necessary assistant supports. The HSE&rsquo;s role in supporting children with special needs involves it working in close co-operation with the disability service providers that it funds, with the education sector and with the parents and families of the children in question.</p><p>  The inclusion of young children with disabilities in mainstream pre-school settings is an integral part of the Government&rsquo;s policy on mainstreaming and the intellectual disability services in Donegal are currently developing a project to facilitate the inclusion, where appropriate, of children with an intellectual disability in mainstream pre-schools. </p><p>  A project team has been established by the HSE in Donegal to determine the supports that will be required in mainstream pre-schools to accommodate children with an intellectual disability and to ensure these children receive the assistance necessary for them to reach their full potential. The overall aim of the project is to ensure that children with an intellectual disability can be educated in their own communities and with their own peers rather than being segregated in specialist disability services, unless a child is assessed as requiring specialist care. The intention is that specialised pre-school provision will only be used in cases where the nature of a child&rsquo;s disability is so complex or severe that it requires significant levels of care to the extent that integration in a mainstream pre-school setting is not feasible. It is estimated that this would apply in no more than 5% of cases of children with a disability.</p><p>  The HSE has no immediate plans to close Ballaghderg pre-school in Letterkenny and this pre-school will continue to deliver services until 2015. The HSE will continue to engage with parents as the transition project develops and that each child will be individually assessed and will continue to receive the supports and services they need. Any future plans for services will be fully discussed with parents with a view to ensuring their children receive the best possible support in the most appropriate setting.</p></reply>

New cases of C.diff have been notifiable in Ireland since 4th May 2008.  In 2008 some 1,614 cases of C.diff were reported, 1,895 in 2009, 1,692 in 2010 ,1,848 in 2011 and 1,619 in 2012.   Figures up to 25th May, 2013 indicate some 708 cases have been reported so far this year.</p><p>  It should be noted that prior to 2012 only new cases of C.diff were notifiable.  Since 1st January, 2012 both new and recurrent cases are notifiable.  In addition the surveillance system only covers 85% of all acute public hospital data and this should be taken into account when interpreting trends.</p><p>  As data on individual hospitals is not available on the HPSC website, I have arranged to have the Deputy's question forwarded to the HSE for attention and a more detailed reply.</p></reply>

The programme involves a number of measures, including the Performance Improvement Action Plan, development of the intermediate care service (ICS), the trial emergency aeromedical service (EAS), and the National Ambulance Service (NAS) Control Centre Reconfiguration Project.</p><p>  The NAS is taking steps to address challenges nationally, such as reliance on on-call rostering, geography, resourcing and the use of emergency ambulances for routine transport. The move from on-call to on-duty rostering for ambulance services is a key part of improving the service as highly trained paramedic crews are on site in their stations or vehicles to respond immediately to dispatches. The NAS is also developing a non-emergency transport fleet, the national intermediate care service (ICS), for routine clinical transfers of patients, freeing emergency ambulances for emergency responses.</p><p>  In relation to the query raised by the Deputy in relation to ambulance services specifically in the North East, as these are operational issues for the HSE I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients' rights in cross-border health care - due 25/10/13</p><p>  The purpose of the EU Directive on the Application of Patients' Rights in Cross Border Health care is to establish a clear legal framework to facilitate cross border health care with a focus on patient rights, information for patients on entitlements and patient choice.  The Directive deals with complex issues, both nationally and between Member States, and work continues on the preparation of proposals for legislation.  At this time it is not possible to be specific regarding dates for such legislation but details will be announced in due course.</p><p>2.  Commission Implementing Directive 2012/52/EU of 20 December 2012 laying down measures to facilitate the recognition of medical prescriptions issued in another Member State - due 25/10/13</p><p>  It is anticipated that this Directive will be transposed by the due date.</p><p>3.  Directive 2012/26/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October, 2012 amending Directive 2001/83/EC as regards pharmacovigilance - due 28/10/13</p><p>  It is anticipated that this Directive will be transposed by the due date.</p><p>  In addition to the above, one article of Directive 2011/62/EU amending Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use, as regards the prevention of the entry into the legal supply chain of falsified medicinal products - the &quot;Falsified Medicines Directive&quot; - remains to be transposed by my Department.</p><p>  This Directive constitutes a major revision of the EU legislative framework regulating medicines. The Directive, other than Article 85c, was transposed into Irish law by means of four Statutory Instruments on 22 May, 2013.</p><p>  Article 85c of the Falsified Medicines Directive relates to regulation of the internet supply of medicines.  Article 85c will come into effect one year after the Commission adopts an Implementing Act regarding a common logo for internet sites.  This Implementing Act has not as yet been adopted by the Commission. Drafting of a Statutory Instrument to transpose Article 85c into Irish law is at an advanced stage.</p><p>  My Department continues to monitor the transposition of EU Directives on an ongoing basis and makes every effort to transpose Directives by their deadline.</p></reply>

In this regard, 150 additional posts were allocated to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams in 2012, and a further 80 posts have been identified for allocation to this specific service area in 2013, arising from targeted Government investment of &euro;35 million for each of these respective years.</p><p>  As of 29 April last, 100 of the designated 150 WTE posts for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services were filled (20 successful candidates had taken up their positions prior to the end of December 2012); a further 10 candidates had accepted a post and start dates had been agreed.</p><p>  The National Recruitment Service (NRS) of the HSE creates national panels in anticipation of vacancies.  On occasion, however, it is difficult to fill some posts due to various reasons, such as geographical location or shortage of suitable candidates at certain times for some grades such as Clinical Psychologists.  However, given the policy and service requirements identified, the NRS is currently working to ensure that remaining posts will be filled as soon as possible, subject to qualified candidates being available.</p><p>  In relation to the additional funding and posts available for mental health services in 2013, each of the four HSE regions were asked to submit a business case against each of the identified objectives detailing how the additional funding is to be spent and the type and number of WTE to be recruited.  Approval has issued to three of the Regions, HSE Dublin North East, HSE South and HSE West and it is expected that approval will issue to the remaining HSE Region shortly to enable recruitment to commence.  I have received assurances from the HSE that the recruitment process for the new posts being funded in 2013, and any outstanding posts from those approved in 2012, is being given priority within the HSE.</p><p>  I wish to re-iterate this Government's strong commitment to enhance this year in practical terms mental health services for children and adolescents and I will continue to closely monitor the position over the remainder of 2013.</p></reply>

These Diabetes Nurse Specialists will work 1 day per week in a hospital setting and 4 days per week in primary care.

Approximately 10 per cent of the Irish diabetic population has sight-threatening Diabetic Retinopathy and around 90 per cent of this group will develop some form of retinopathy.</p><p>  Diabetic RetinaScreen offers free, annual diabetic retinopathy screening to people with diabetes aged 12 and older (approximately 190,000 people).  All people with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are at risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, a common complication of diabetes which affects the small blood vessels in the lining at the back of the eye and can lead to deterioration in vision.  Eye screening uses specialised digital photography to detect, at an early stage, when it is effective at reducing or preventing damage to sight.  The NCSS is working closely with treatment centres to ensure they are ready to provide timely, quality assured treatment as part of the programme.</p><p>  A quality assurance framework and a central database of the eligible diabetic population has been developed for the programme.   The first round of screening is being introduced on a phased basis, in line with the roll-out of the first round of screening across other international programmes.  Approximately 30 per cent of the eligible diabetic population is expected to be invited in 2013.  The remaining 70 per cent will be screened in 2014.  Treatment is tailored on a case-by-case basis.  Adequate funding has been assigned for the programme for 2013.</p></reply>

The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has incorporated key elements of the Report into its own Model of Care and adopted the Strategy's recommendation of &quot;hub and spoke&quot; model for specialist rehabilitation services and is keen to progress with a comprehensive model for the continuation of such service into the community.

Areas and functions will be targeted where, due to reorganisation or workplace reform, there is scope to reduce employee numbers.

Where blood tests form part of the investigation and necessary treatment of patients' symptoms or conditions, these should be provided free of charge to medical card and GP visit card holders.  The HSE also points out that, in many GP surgeries, it is the practice nurse who takes blood samples.  The HSE significantly subsidises the cost of employing practice nurses.</p><p>  The HSE is continuing to advise eligible patients who believe they have been inappropriately charged by a GP for routine phlebotomy services, to seek a refund from the GPs in question.  It is appreciated that because of the nature of the GP/patient relationship, it may be difficult for patients to make such complaints.  Where public representatives are made aware of GPs charging GMS patients in error, they may wish to notify the HSE directly.</p><p>  The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS GP contract with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams.</p><p>  Officials in my Department are in consultation with the HSE with a view to drawing up a new contract.  I have recently had discussions with the IMO during which I outlined the Government's policy in relation to free GP care and I intend to engage in further discussions with the IMO once that legislation is published.  The appropriate arrangements in relation to phlebotomy services and anti-coagulation therapy will be considered as part of the new GMS contract.</p></reply>

Prescription charges are not payable in respect of items supplied under the Long Term Illness Scheme.</p><p>  In the case of persons who have both the medical card and LTI, the HSE policy is that they should use their medical card to access medicines.

The Deputy should contact my Ministerial colleagues in the Departments of Finance (registering with the Revenue Commissioners), Transport (insurance) and Justice (vetting by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) regarding the other issues.</p><p>  The introduction of a licensing system for food deliveries from restaurants and take aways is a matter which would require careful examination. In particular it would need to be demonstrated that the benefits for consumers and additional guarantees for food safety are necessary, worthwhile, and outweigh the associated costs of a licensing scheme, plus the additional administrative burden on food business operators. At present there is no data to suggest that the introduction of such a scheme is warranted for food safety purposes. In any event, restaurants and takeaways are not subject to a licensing scheme.</p><p>  Food business operators are required to comply with current food hygiene and safety rules, which extend to include any home delivery service offered by them. They are also required to ensure that the safety of the food provided is not compromised by poor practice during delivery.  Consumers who are concerned about a home delivery service are advised to contact the restaurant/takeaway which sold the food, and/or the Environmental Health Service of the Health Service Executive or the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, which will ensure appropriate follow up and investigation.</p></reply>

The programme involves a number of measures, including the Performance Improvement Action Plan, development of the intermediate care service (ICS), the trial emergency aeromedical service (EAS), and the NAS Control Centre Reconfiguration Project.  </p><p>  In July 2012, the HSE National Ambulance Service commenced developing non-emergency transport, through a national intermediate care service (ICS) , which is key to resolving bed and clinical management pressures.   ICS will allow for safe, planned and timely clinical transfers of inpatients to the most appropriate facility, depending on their acuity and clinical needs.  This will allow for beds to be made available for higher acuity admissions through emergency departments.  ICS will also release emergency resources from this service and back to emergency functions, for improved response times and performances in pre-hospital care. </p><p>  To date, ICS has been implemented in Cavan, Castleblayney, South County Dublin, Letterkenny, Sligo, Galway, Limerick, Roscommon, Mallow and Bantry.  Supported by the 2013 National Service Plan, the NAS intends to expand ICS to Waterford, Cork Tralee, Castlebar and Drogheda and to increase services in Dublin and Galway during 2013.</p><p>  In relation to the particular queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.</p></reply>

The Directive does not establish any new entitlements or rights to treatment<i>.</i></p><p>  It should be emphasised that the vast majority of EU patients receive healthcare in their own country and prefer to do so.  The Directive seeks to provide a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross-border healthcare within the EU, for those occasions where patients seek health care in another Member State rather than in their home country.    The Directive should, therefore, be seen as complimentary to the current situation under EU Regulation 883/04.  While there may be resource implications as a result of its transposition, it is particularly difficult to quantify them at this time as they may be of the nature of displacement away from the EU Regulations rather than totally new demands.  In view of this and the tight financial position regarding the funding of the health services generally,  no additional provision was made in the 2013 Estimates for the Directive.</p><p>  My Department continues its work on the required legislative framework to facilitate the assimilation of the Directive into domestic legislation.  Details of legislative changes required will be published closer to the date for transposition of the Directive.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.   The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p><p>  In July last year local authorities were invited to submit applications for consideration for funding in 2013 under the Specific Improvement Grants Scheme.  Fingal County Council applied for funding for five projects under this grant category but the Castle Mills Link road was not among the Council&rsquo;s applications.</p><p>  The Specific Improvement Grants Scheme is being discontinued from 2014 onward in order to maximise the funding available for repair and strengthening work. The small amount of funding available for major schemes will focus on projects already under construction or that the Department is already committed to.</p><p>  It is also important to re-iterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement Councils like Fingal County Council in their own resources spending in this area.   It is open to the Council to fund this project from its own resources.</p></reply>

For the purpose of road traffic legislation, traffic sign number RUS 015 is considered to be a prohibitory road traffic sign.  Failure of vehicle to comply with prohibitory traffic signs is both a fixed charge and penalty point offence.   The fixed charge for the offence is &euro;60 if paid within 28 days from the date from the original fixed charge notice and &euro;90 if paid within 56 days from the date of the original fixed charge notice.   The penalty points for the offence are 1 point on the payment of the original fixed charge notice and 3 on conviction in Court.</p></reply>

At the meeting, a paper on the Great Britain market was also discussed.</p><p>  The next NSMC meeting in Tourism Sectoral format will take place on 26th June 2013 in Armagh.  Amongst the anticipated discussion items will be Tourism Ireland's Annual Report for 2012, a review of the 2013 tourism season to date (including major tourism initiatives North and South) and the tourism prospects for the remainder of 2013 and beyond. </p><p>  There is also ongoing co-operation between the tourism agencies and Government Departments north and south in a number of other areas including the selection of suitable tourism projects to benefit from Peace/INTERREG funds, work to harmonise and share tourism statistics north and south and specific initiatives by the agencies in relation to major events such as the Giro d'Italia.  I look forward to this work continuing and to availing of any other beneficial opportunities for north/south cooperation in the tourism sector in the future.</p></reply>

While we have very much targeted this year, I have no doubt that the pay-off for participation will have longer term positive consequences with many of the events developing into annual traditions and creating on-going connections with other parts of the world. The Gathering 2013 project advisory board has been working with the Gathering 2013 team and the tourism agencies on securing the legacy of the Gathering 2013, to ensure the good work being achieved is continued, and that the outcome of the Gathering continues to have lasting positive benefits. With regard to the building of a brand Ireland, from a tourism perspective, responsibility for the overseas promotion of Ireland  rests with Tourism Ireland Ltd.  The agency undertakes regular reviews of the brand itself as well as detailed market research in all of our main overseas tourism markets. In terms of the overall brand, the island of Ireland tourism brand was reviewed and refreshed in 2011. As a result, a new three-year global advertising campaign &ndash; &ldquo;Jump into Ireland&rdquo; &ndash; comprising TV, radio, print, cinema and on-line advertisements has been rolling out across the 22 markets in which Tourism Ireland has a presence to an estimated audience of 200 million potential visitors worldwide. The campaign has been developed to be flexible and adaptable and will evolve over its three-year lifespan to capitalise on events such as &lsquo;The Gathering Ireland 2013&rsquo;.</p><p>  Tourism Ireland also works closely with the Irish Embassies in all tourism markets and with agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Bord Bia, Culture Ireland and the Irish Film Board on projects including St Patrick&rsquo;s Day, overseas trade missions, and to maximise the tourism potential of Irish food and film. In addition, Tourism Ireland, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation (ITIC), established a Tourism Recovery Taskforce during 2011 to further ensure that Ireland is promoted at home and abroad with one strong brand message and a coordinated strategy and action plan involving wide public and private sector participation.</p></reply>
