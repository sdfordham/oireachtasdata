The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants in the sector.</p><p>   The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 is currently before the Oireachtas.   It will, <i>inter alia</i> , extend the remit of the Act and of the Board to the approved housing body sector and will give legal effect to the administrative merger of the Rent Tribunal and the PRTB. It will also streamline and simplify aspects of the Act to assist the Board in meeting its service obligations and in addressing the additional demands associated with the proposed expansion of its remit.   </p><p>Demand for the PRTB&#8217;s services has grown significantly in recent years reflecting the very sizable growth in the sector in the most recent intercens al period. While the PRTB is a self-financing bod , it is however necessary in the current constrained economic environment that it   contribute s to the overall reduction in public expenditure, including in regard to numbers employed. This presents obvious challenges for the Board , which has responded by pursuing a range of outsourcing, shared service and other modernisation initiatives. Building on what has been achieved to date I am confident that the Board, in its future legislative context, will continue fully to discharge its statutory obligations in an independent, fair and efficient manner.   </p><p>My Department continues to keep the resources available to the PRTB under close review and engages regularly with the Board on this and other matters.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-05a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020500052#WRA01000"><p>On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears the Government launched a mortgage to rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012. This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners. Eligibility requirements are in line with other forms of social housing support. To date, 671 cases have been submitted by lenders. Of these, 332 are currently being processed, and 181 borrowers have been engaged with or are in the process of being engaged with by the lender. Sales have been agreed on 16 properties, and 8 of these have now been completed. A breakdown of these completed transactions by local authority area is set out in the table I am circulating with the official report.   <font color="#FF0000"> </font></p><p>  The numbers of completed transactions is low but significant progress has been made. All of the main lenders and so called sub-prime lenders are fully engaged and have instituted the necessary internal processes. It is also important to bear in mind that the transition from being a homeowner to a social housing tenant is a major one for families. Mortgage to rent or other such interventions cannot be rushed for any party. For example, the process provides a 60 day decision period and a 28 day cooling off period within the timeframe of the scheme. My Department estimates that the overall timeframe per case from start to completed transaction will be up to eight months. This compares favourably to the timeframes in other jurisdictions operating similar schemes.</p></reply>

As I stated in that reply, I see a central role for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht in the policy development process. That is why, in drafting the Programme for the development of national policy and legislation, I earmarked a significant period of time for the Joint Committee to reflect on the outline Heads of the Bill and the policy analysis undertaken by the NESC Secretariat. In view of the short period of additional time which I am taking before issuing the outline Heads of the Low Carbon Development Bill , I appreciate that the Committee may need some extra time to complete its consideration of the issues and submit its report , and I will raise this matter with the Chairman when I am referring the outline Heads to the Committee. As I indicated in the policy development Programme, the Committee&rsquo;s report will be a key input to the Government&lsquo;s deliberations on finalising a national policy position on transition to a low carbon future and the introduction of climate legislation. I look forward to engaging with the Committee in its work and to receiving its report in due course.   </p></reply>

On foot of correspondence received in 2011 regarding a possible governance issue at Mayo North East LEADER Partnership Company, a comprehensive investigation into the issues outlined was instigated. This proved to be a very complex investigation and, on foot of its initial findings and in the context of the Department&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that RDP funding is delivered in an efficient and effective way, a decision was made to suspend project approvals by the Partnership on 7 March 2012. However, the issuing of payments to eligible approved applications is progressing as normal.</p><p>  The Final Report has been provided to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine Managing Authority for the RDP. The Managing Authority has subsequently reported the findings to the European Commission and the external accreditation auditors (Deloitte). The findings of the investigation have also been reported to both the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Standards in Public Office Commission and consideration of these findings will be subject to the relevant processes in these bodies. The Report has been considered in my own Department and an Action Plan has been agreed with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. My Department has also agreed a series of actions to be taken by Mayo North East LEADER Partnership Company. In the coming period, if and when these actions are completed to the satisfaction of my Department, and adherence to all other regulatory and governance requirements is assured , the suspension of project approvals in Mayo North East Leader Partnerships will be reviewed. It is critical that the funds delivered through the LEADER elements of the RDP are managed in an efficient and effective way.</p><p>  While we must ensure correct and proper management and implementation of the LEADER elements of the RDP from both a regulatory and value for money perspective, my Department&rsquo;s objective is to conclude the processes associated with this investigation with a view to reinstating access to RDP funds to the citizens of Mayo North East, while ensuring regulatory compliance, value for money and maximum impact for the people of North Mayo.</p></reply>

Where defects occur remediation is a matter between the parties, and their agents and insurers, subject to any contractual arrangements that have been entered into. Enforcement is a matter for the building control authority in whose functional area the relevant building is situated. As Minister I have no role in relation to enforcement and cannot interfere in individual cases.</p><p>  In addition to their powers under the Building Control Acts, local authorities also have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Acts and the Planning and Development Acts. I am aware of such powers having been used to good effect on a number of occasions in recent times where concerns have arisen in relation to a number of developments, including Belmayne . I expect local authorities to continue to use all of the powers currently available to them to respond appropriately in such cases, and in particular in those circumstance where building defects and fire safety concerns have been visited on vulnerable residents through no fault of their own.</p><p>  I understand that Dublin City Council will respond directly to the correspondence referred to in the question within the next week. I have asked my Department to continue to liaise closely with the City Council in relation to the on-going programme of remedial works being undertaken at Belmayne.</p></reply>

The deadline for householders to register was 1 February. At the passing of that deadline, applications in respect of the on-site wastewater treatment systems of 373,954 owners, who have registered online, by post or in person at their local authority offices, had bee n processed and approximately 25,000 additional registration applications were awaiting processing by the bureau operated by the Local Government Management Agency.  I propose to circulate with the Official Report a tabular statement setting out details of the number of processed registrations for each County and City Council by 1 February 2013.</p><p>The 2012 Act also provides that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will make a National Inspection Plan for domestic wastewater treatment systems. I expect that the National Inspection Plan will be published shortly, and that inspections will commence in the middle of this year. Inspections will be carried out by appropriately qualified local authority staff who will be appointed as inspectors. A training course for inspectors is currently being finalised and it will be rolled out to all local authorities in the coming weeks.</p><p>The extent and cost of the remediation works that may be required will depend on the condition of the individual system and the extent of the risk to public health and the environment. Inspections carried out by Cavan County Council, based on bye-laws adopted by that authority in 2004, revealed an initial failure rate of approximately 25% of on-site systems, with remediation costs averaging &euro;2,500. However, the enactment of the bye-laws and the related public information campaigns by Cavan County Council have increased householders&rsquo; awareness of the necessity to operate and maintain their systems correctly and the failure rate has, over the intervening years, decreased to approximately 15%. At this stage it is not possible to indicate how many systems will require remediation. However, t he remedial action required on foot of an inspection of a septic tank will, in many cases, only involve householders having to de-sludge their tanks more frequently.</p><p>I recently announced my intention to introduce a grant scheme to provide financial assistance to households whose septic tanks and other domestic wastewater treatment systems require remediation or upgrading following inspection. The scheme will apply to treatment systems which have been registered by the due date of 1 February 2013 and which are deemed to require remediation having failed an inspection carried out under the 2012 Act. The grant payable will depend on the cost of the work necessary and the income of the household concerned , and t he scheme will provide a higher level of support to households on lower incomes.  Full details of the scheme will be defined in regulations which I will make in advance of inspections commencing this year.</p><p>Registrations processed as of 4 February 2013</p><p><table><tr><th>Water Services Authority </th><th>Estimated total number of on-site waste water treatment systems </th><th>Number of on-site waste water treatment systems registered <br /><br /></th><th>Number of on-site waste water treatment systems registered as a percentage of the estimated total number </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council </td><td><div>7190 </div></td><td><div>5,369 </div></td><td><div>74.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County Council </td><td><div>14477 </div></td><td><div>12,064 </div></td><td><div>83.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council </td><td><div>19769 </div></td><td><div>17,579 </div></td><td><div>88.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council </td><td><div>586 </div></td><td><div>496 </div></td><td><div>84.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council </td><td><div>57993 </div></td><td><div>39,309 </div></td><td><div>67.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council </td><td><div>32955 </div></td><td><div>20,284 </div></td><td><div>61.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council </td><td><div>2718 </div></td><td><div>102 </div></td><td><div>3.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council </td><td><div>1928 </div></td><td><div>989 </div></td><td><div>51.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council </td><td><div>5213 </div></td><td><div>2,821 </div></td><td><div>54.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council </td><td><div>1145 </div></td><td><div>645 </div></td><td><div>56.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council </td><td><div>42161 </div></td><td><div>30,895 </div></td><td><div>73.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council </td><td><div>28277 </div></td><td><div>28,153 </div></td><td><div>99.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council </td><td><div>16795 </div></td><td><div>12,165 </div></td><td><div>72.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council </td><td><div>15368 </div></td><td><div>11,705 </div></td><td><div>76.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois County Council </td><td><div>11309 </div></td><td><div>8,557 </div></td><td><div>75.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim County Council </td><td><div>7005 </div></td><td><div>6,149 </div></td><td><div>87.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City Council </td><td><div>420 </div></td><td><div>205 </div></td><td><div>48.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick County Council </td><td><div>24207 </div></td><td><div>17,949 </div></td><td><div>74.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford County Council </td><td><div>7556 </div></td><td><div>5,849 </div></td><td><div>77.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council </td><td><div>11633 </div></td><td><div>7,530 </div></td><td><div>64.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council </td><td><div>26659 </div></td><td><div>22,586 </div></td><td><div>84.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council </td><td><div>21687 </div></td><td><div>16,159 </div></td><td><div>74.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council </td><td><div>12065 </div></td><td><div>7,423 </div></td><td><div>61.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>North Tipperary County Council </td><td><div>12342 </div></td><td><div>9,931 </div></td><td><div>80.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council </td><td><div>11170 </div></td><td><div>8,286 </div></td><td><div>74.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon County Council </td><td><div>14297 </div></td><td><div>11,973 </div></td><td><div>83.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council </td><td><div>11192 </div></td><td><div>9,196 </div></td><td><div>82.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council </td><td><div>2266 </div></td><td><div>1,085 </div></td><td><div>47.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>South Tipperary County Council </td><td><div>14442 </div></td><td><div>10,971 </div></td><td><div>75.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City Council </td><td><div>488 </div></td><td><div>343 </div></td><td><div>70.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford County Council </td><td><div>11466 </div></td><td><div>7,655 </div></td><td><div>66.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath County Council </td><td><div>12165 </div></td><td><div>9,506 </div></td><td><div>78.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council </td><td><div>26267 </div></td><td><div>20,282 </div></td><td><div>77.0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council </td><td><div>12070 </div></td><td><div>9,743 </div></td><td><div>80.0 </div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is framed in a manner which optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.</p><p>  In relation to homelessness, my Department&#8217;s role involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level. Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities. The Programme for Government committed to reviewing the homeless strategy, <i>The Way Home: A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness in Ireland 2008-2013</i> and to implementing a housing-led approach to homelessness. Work on the review is complete and I intend to issue a policy statement on homelessness very shortly. That statement will take account of demands on existing housing and will assess how best to continue providing services in a manner consistent with the elimination of existing homelessness and to ensure more effective prevention strategies. I will be indicating what I expect from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness.</p></reply>

Under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Investment Programme, local authorities are allocated funding each year in respect of a range of measures to improve the standard and overall quality of their social housing stock. The programme includes a retrofitting measure aimed at improving the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses by reducing heat loss through the fabric of the building. Over the past two years, the retrofitting measure focussed on improvement works to vacant houses with the objective of returning as many as possible of these dwellings to productive use and combat ing dereliction and associated anti-social behaviour.

The Walks Scheme was launched in March 2008 on the recommendation of Comhairle na Tuaithe (The Countryside Council). It represents an innovative response to facilitating the development and maintenance of many of Ireland&rsquo;s key walking trails. The Scheme brings in landholders as key participants in the provision of high quality walking trails, by contracting them to undertake maintenance work on the selected trails, in line with agreed work plans. It is currently operating on 40 trails supported by 1,811 landowners.</p><p>  My Department chairs regular meetings of Comhairle Na Tuaithe (The Countryside Council) where matters are discussed   relating to rural recreation/activity tourism and furthering the implementation of the priorities of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy (NCRS). Comhairle Na Tuaithe was established in February 2004 with a primary focus on the following priority areas; access to the countryside, developing a countryside code and developing a countryside recreation strategy. It comprises representatives of the farming organisations, recreational users of the countryside and state bodies with an interest in the countryside.</p><p>  My Department is continuing negotiations with a number of State Agencies to agree a National Outdoor Recreation Plan for Public Lands and Waters in Ireland . It is intended to put in place a structure to ensure coordinated and appropriate development of State lands for recreation and activity tourism purposes. Over 15% of the lands and waters in the State are under the control of various Agencies and Departments and offer significant potential for further development. A coordinated approach will facilitate greater efficiency in the use of existing resources and support professional development of those working in the sector. In addition, my Department is a main funding partner of Leave No Trace Ireland which promotes responsible recreational use in the outdoors. It encourages all outdoor enthusiasts to act responsibl y in the outdoors and to do their part to protect those lands used by the public for the benefit of the environment and for future generations.</p><p>  A Mountain Access scheme is under development. It is intended to facilitate access to the uplands for hill walking and similar activities. A pilot scheme has be en   initiated at Mount Gable in Connemara and discussions are ongoing for a similar type scheme at Carrauntuohil , Co. Kerry, with the possibility of being extended to the entire MacGillicuddy Reeks.Discussions with local landowners have been initiated and it is intended to progress consideration of the most appropriate management structures and funding mechanisms during the first half of 2013. To support the ongoing development of Mountain Access areas and to facilitate access to the countryside for other recreational pursuits, my Department is currently negotiating the implementation of a National Indemnity Scheme which would indemnify private landowners against claims from recreational users for injury or damage to property. The Occupiers Liability Act of 1995 already provides significant protection to landowners, but the upfront costs of successfully defending a claim can be difficult. Perceptions regarding potential liability for claims from recreational users, due to injury or damage to personal property, have made access agreements more challenging . The proposed National Indemnity Scheme has the potential to address these perceptions and to unlock the latent potential of our countryside for recreation and activity tourism. This will support the economic development of rural communities and enhance employment capacity in those areas.</p><p>  The State Claims Agency , with the cooperation and support of my Department and other key State Agencies, has established an Irish branch of the Visitor Safety in the Countryside Group (VSCG). It will use and further develop best practice to achieve a safe and pleasant experience for outdoor enthusiasts and visitors to the countryside.  Discussions are ongoing with other key stakeholders and partners such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Trails Office regarding the development of greenways and cycleways and to secure better coordination and oversight of future proposed developments.</p></reply>

The recommendations can be broken into two categories, those dealing with the delivery of solutions to homeowners whose homes are affected by pyrite and who have no other option for redress, and recommendations to limit the occurrence of similar problems in the future and to enhance consumer protection. The implementation of many of the recommendations in the pyrite report requires the involvement and co-operation of a number of parties, and implementation will be on a progressive basis. Given their particular impact on affected homeowners, priority is being given to the recommendations around the delivery of a remediation process for affected homeowner , including funding for a remediation scheme, the establishment of a Pyrite Resolution Board , and the development of standards for the testing and categorisation of dwellings and for a remediation method statement.</p><p>  I have recently received Government approval for the imposition of a levy on both the quarrying and insurance sectors as a mechanism to provide the necessary funding for a remediation scheme. The imposition of these levies will require primary legislation and I am committed to having the legislation published and enacted in the shortest timeframe possible. The Government also approved the establishment of a Resolution Board as recommended in the pyrite report. I am currently finalising membership of the Board. I have previously announced the appointment of the Chairman and I will announce the full Board membership shortly. The role of the Board will be to oversee the operation of the remediation scheme and to ensure that the public interest, and the interest of the affected homeowners, is well served.</p><p>  Reflecting the approach recommended in the report for the engagement of stakeholders in processes to provide a solution to the pyrite problem, my Department and I have been involved in on-going discussions with key stakeholders and in particular with representatives from the Construction Industry Federation, Irish Concrete Federation, HomeBond, and the Irish Banking Federation since July 2012. The Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation and HomeBond have agreed to establish an entity for the purposes of operating the remediation scheme in respect of those homes affected by pyrite. A number of financial institutions have agreed in principle to make initial loan funding available to facilitate the early commencement of pyrite remediation work and it is intended that the entity will engage with those institutions in relation to the loan facility.</p><p> In July 2012, shortly after receiving the pyrite report, I asked the National Standards Authority of I eland (NSAI) to undertake the development of protocols for the testing and categorisation of dwellings and for a remediation statement as recommended in the report. I am pleased that the NSAI fast-tracked this work and the two new standards were published on 29 January 2013. Their publication represents another important step in the advancement and implementation of solutions for homeowners. In October 2012, the NSAI announced the review and development of the existing specification for unbound granular fill (hardcore) for use under concrete floors and sought submissions from the public. This work will now progress and I look forward to its completion which will represent an important safeguard for consumers in the future. The new Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, currently being finalised, require the submission of compliance documentation to Local Authorities and inspection and certification of building works by registered professionals providing an added level of consumer protection. This is in line with recommendations in the pyrite report. Work is underway on the scope and the terms and conditions of the remediation scheme and the cost of testing will be dealt with in that context.</p></reply>

However, the move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by AHBs to more revenue funded options presents challenges for them. As such, I am developing an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself, and to its external partners, as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it in the policy statement and to underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions.   </p><p>  This framework is being developed in consultation with the sector and I am currently considering the range of submissions received on foot of publishing a draft voluntary code in August 2012. It is my expectation that this code, which I hope to launch later in 2013, will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop a longer-term statutory framework to best support the enhanced role of AHBs.</p><p>  Specifically under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), funding of up to 100% of the approved cost is available for the provision of accommodation to meet the needs of persons with specific categories of housing need including older people, people with an intellectual, physical or mental health disability, the homeless, returning emigrants and victims of domestic violence. My Department&rsquo;s involvement with these voluntary and co-operative housing schemes relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects. The detailed administration of the schemes, and the certification that projects comply with the terms and conditions of the funding schemes, are the responsibility of the relevant local authority.   </p><p>In 2012 I provided funding of &euro; 66 million for the provision of accommodation under the voluntary housing capital funding schemes. Work is currently underway in my Department on preparing the capital allocations under the housing programme for 2013, including al locations to local authorities in respect of the CAS. I intend to announce details of these allocations as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Subsequently, Longford County Council established an expert steering group and appointed a firm of consulting engineers to investigate the cause of the explosion. A second explosion occurred in this development at the beginning of October 2012. The specific findings of the investigation carried out on behalf of the Council have been made available to residents of the terrace in Gleann Riada, as well as general advice to other residents in the estate. Longford County Council has also established a steering group to address the range of issues faced by the occupants of the Gleann Riada development and is liaising with the other State authorities involved, including the Health and Safety Authority.</p><p>  My Department initially approved funding totalling &euro;91,753.40 for Gleann Riada in August 2012 to cover the cost of addressing immediate public safety concerns. In November I approved further funding of &euro;200,000 taking account of additional information which had been provided by Longford County Council in regard to public safety issues within the development. A comprehensive underground CCTV survey has been carried out on the estate, supported by funding provided under the public safety initiative. This identified the need for repair work on the foul and storm networks. Longford County Council will install or improve vents, manholes and gullies to ensure the major issues which led to the explosion are alleviated. Issues regarding public lighting will also be addressed, while such necessary works as are required will be carried out on the internal road network.</p></reply>

In distributing Local Property Tax income to local authorities through the Local Government Fund, I will seek to ensure that a significant element of the tax is retained in the local authority area in which it is collected in order to fund essential local services in our communities.   </p><p>Currently, general purpose grants from the local government fund are structured to bring about equalisation over time: that is , a position of balance where the financial needs of local authorities are met by their resources and they are able to provide an appropriate level of service to their customers.    Local authority cost and income bases vary significantly from one another and calculating an appropriate distribution of these grants is complex.   </p><p>In determining these grants a number of factors are taken into account including the overall funding available for this purpose, the estimated cost to each authority of providing a reasonable level of services to their customers, the income each authority should generate from local sources and the necessity to provide each authority with a baseline allocation that will support its financial stability .   </p><p>In time, local authorities may vary the local rate of the Local Property Tax. This function will improve the governance of local authorities by strengthening their accountability to local taxpayers. The tax will alter the relationship between the citizen and his or her local authority in a way which will be altogether beneficial for good governance. As noted in the Action Plan for Effective Local Government, Putting People First, if local elected members have relatively little responsibility for raising revenue, their rigorousness in prioritising its allocation, overseeing its efficient use and stewardship, and oversight in relation to the performance and management of local authority operations generally, is likely to be diminished.   </p><p>Currently, different local authorities vary in their degree of dependence on the local government fund. Differences in population densities and settlement patterns will, of course, have an impact on the extent to which a given local authority will be funded by the Local Property Tax. In accounting terms, the gearing of funding from local authority to local authority will differ and as such, equalisation measures may be needed to address such variations.</p></reply>

The RAPID programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion in RAPID areas nationally. The programme has made substantial progress in identifying the needs of disadvantaged communities and in bringing forward appropriate local projects in response to those needs. </p><p>My Department has provided an indicative allocation of more than &euro;2 million for RAPID in 2013, which will mainly be used to meet the Department&rsquo;s existing contractual commitments on RAPID projects throughout the country , mainly Sports Capital top-ups and CCTV systems, jointly funding by the Departments of Transports, Tourism and Sport and Justice and Equality respectively . My Department is not in a position separately to meet the salary costs , for 2013 , of RAPID coordinators, who are local authority employees, but is providing significant general purpose funding to local authorities under the Local Government Fund to assist in meeting day-to-day operational costs.</p></reply>

Among the measures included in the policy is the establishment of an interdepartmental working group to report to Government with options to minimise the impact of waste charges on low income households. The working group, which comprises representatives of my Department and the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Finance; and the T&aacute;naiste's Office, submitted its first report to Government on 11 December 2012.  Government considered the report and the working group is to continue to examine the design and implementation of measures to address the issue and will provide a further report to Government by 31 March 2013.   </p><p>  Another measure of the Government&rsquo;s waste policy is the revision of the current regulatory regime, to ensure, inter alia, that waste collection providers have Customer Charters in place. The Customer Charters will be required clearly to set out information for customers in relation to issues such as charging structures, procedures for dealing with customers who may fall into arrears, and arrangements for switching from one waste collector to another.  I wrote to the waste management industry in September and October, 2012 in relation to the development of such charters and I understand that a number of waste collection providers have already put in place a Customer Charter ahead of the development of the new regulatory regime. I further understand that a number of waste collection operators have notified former local authority customers of the offers and discounts available to those previously in receipt of a local authority waste collection waiver.</p></reply>

I n late 2011 the European Commission approved a change in co-funding rates for Rural Development Programmes (RDP) for countries that are part of the Financial Stabilisation Mechanism. This change enabled Ireland to increase the co-financing  rate from 55% to 85% under the Axes 3 and 4 elements of the RDP and came into force on 1 January 2012.</p><p>The change involves an increase in the co-financing rate to 85% for 2012 and 2013 without a concomitant increase in the amount of funding to be provided by the EU. Accordingly the overall funding available to the programme has changed from an original amount of &euro;427 million to an estimated amount of &euro;314 million (&euro;252 million of which is estimated to be the project allocation).</p><p>The new co-financing rate applies to expenditure incurred in 2012 and 2013 only and the estimated programme complement of &euro;314 has been calculated on that basis. From 1 January 2014 the co-financing rate will revert to 55% for any remaining unspent funding which will necessitate a further revision of the programme complement at that time. In this context and on the basis of extrapolations from the annual levels of expenditure to date it is estimated that the final programme complement will be approximately &euro;370 million.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>   RDP Measure</div></th><th><div>Current Project Allocation           (&#8364;314  Complement)</div></th><th><div>Estimated final  Project Allocation             (&#8364;370  Complement)</div></th><th><div>Commitments</div></th><th><div>Expenditure</div></th></tr><tr><td>311 - Diversification</td><td><div>&#8364;12,265,335.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;14,387,209.71</div></td><td><div>&#8364;7,373,944.36</div></td><td><div>&#8364;5,362,320.07</div></td></tr><tr><td>312 - Business creation</td><td><div>&#8364;35,529,718.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;41,676,274.94</div></td><td><div>&#8364;26,142,749.89</div></td><td><div>&#8364;13,072,341.54</div></td></tr><tr><td>313 - Tourism</td><td><div>&#8364;33,424,144.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;39,206,441.83</div></td><td><div>&#8364;28,586,519.79</div></td><td><div>&#8364;11,192,613.34</div></td></tr><tr><td>321 - Basic Services</td><td><div>&#8364;36,523,608.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;42,842,105.26</div></td><td><div>&#8364;42,066,027.83</div></td><td><div>&#8364;17,491,311.71</div></td></tr><tr><td>322 - Village renewal</td><td><div>&#8364;39,902,833.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;46,805,928.35</div></td><td><div>&#8364;32,365,436.04</div></td><td><div>&#8364;19,054,932.96</div></td></tr><tr><td>323 - Conservation and upgrading</td><td><div>&#8364;39,645,158.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;46,503,676.04</div></td><td><div>&#8364;18,984,266.07</div></td><td><div>&#8364;9,188,798.90</div></td></tr><tr><td>331 - Training</td><td><div>&#8364;21,681,521.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;25,432,372.51</div></td><td><div>&#8364;16,162,343.49</div></td><td><div>&#8364;5,074,824.32</div></td></tr><tr><td>341 - Skills acquisition, animation</td><td><div>&#8364;25,495,113.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;29,905,706.62</div></td><td><div>&#8364;6,843,665.21</div></td><td><div>&#8364;894,170.35</div></td></tr><tr><td>421 - Co-operation</td><td><div>&#8364;7,877,496.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;9,240,284.75</div></td><td><div>&#8364;4,488,603.22</div></td><td><div>&#8364;762,369.70</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>&#8364;252,344,926.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;296,000,000.01</div></td><td><div>&#8364;183,013,555.90</div></td><td><div>&#8364;82,093,682.89</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am aiming to achieve First Reading Agreement on this dossier.   The second policy priority will be the European Climate Adaptation Strategy. Following the expected publication of a proposal by the Commission in March 2013, I am aiming to agree Council conclusions at the June 2013 Environment Council meeting.</p><p>I will also be prioritising a range of legislation aimed at protecting Europe&rsquo;s natural resources and environment and will seek First Reading Agreements on the following dossiers:priority Substances in Water; batteries; CO2   emissions from new cars and vans; ship Recycling, and two amendments to the Emissions Trading Scheme, in relation to backloading and aviation.   </p><p>I also intend to progress a number of other key files, particularly those on fluorinated greenhouse gases, the LIFE programme, the recast of the Environmental Impact Assessment ( EIA ) Directive, and the proposed Directive on Indirect Land-Use Change   . </p><p>The Presidency also has a significant international environmental agenda in four priority areas. Firstly, the final round of negotiations took place in mid January at the fifth session of the UN Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC5) in Geneva, where agreement was reached on a global, legally binding instrument on mercury. Secondly, there will be the follow up to the outcome of the Doha Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Thirdly, there will be the follow-up to the Rio+20 Conference on sustainable development and, lastly, &ldquo;back to back&rdquo; meetings will take place in Geneva during a two-week period in April/May 2013 regarding the three UN Waste and Chemicals Conventions &ndash; the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions. In all of these areas, the Irish Presidency will be playing a leading role on behalf of the EU.   </p><p>Finally, as evidenced in the recently published Presidency programme,   Ireland will be pursuing an ambitious green theme running throughout its Presidency. Resource efficiency, sustainable development and the advancement of the green economy, with a particular focus on green jobs, will all feature across a range of Council formations. This process will be assisted by way of environmental input into the European Semester, building on the work already done by the Cypriot Presidency. </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency agenda in relation to Biodiversity matters, at EU and international level, is being led by my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p></reply>

This provides for greater consistency of plans at regional, city/county and local level, including through the requirement for a core strategy to be incorporated into development plans to reinforce the practice of including evidence-based policy objectives in future development plans. These new provisions are being reflected and implemented in new development plans and in variations to existing plans, and planning authorities are ensuring that local area plans are consistent with the development plan thereafter.   </p><p>I am further strengthening transport planning in local development planning by a more formalised process of integration through the statutory planning guidelines for planning authorities. In this context, the forthcoming Guidelines to Planning Authorities on Local Area Plans, which I expect to publish shortly outline, will encourage, among the key policies and objectives for inclusion in local area plans, smarter travel patterns through more compact, less sprawling, and better structured urban areas .   They will also promote more sustainable and healthier travel habits such as walking, cycling, and the use of public transport.   </p><p>I will, in addition, provide an update of the Development Plan Guidelines during the coming year,   inter alia, further to strengthen the integration of transport planning and forward planning.   </p></reply>

The consideration of the objections and the making of the order declaring the road to be a public road is a reserved function, so that the decision whether to take the road in charge is ultimately one for the discretion of the elected members.In relation to estates which have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced within the relevant period, section 180 also provides that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the owners, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act. However, in this case the section provides that the provision in section 11 of the Roads Act requiring the authority to consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge is to be disregarded.</p><p>  Section 180 also provides that where a planning authority, in complying with section 180, makes an order under section 11 of the Roads Act, it must also take in charge any open spaces, car parks, sewers, watermains, or drains within the attendant grounds of the development.</p><p>Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a planning authority may take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the planning authority consider that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer. Planning authorities have also been empowered to take in charge part of an estate or some, but not all, of the facilities in an estate.   </p></reply>

To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to &euro;332.7m in 2012, with an anticipated outturn of some &euro;299m for 2013, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities are forced to operate, the projected outcome for 2012 is expected to be in the region of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units. Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply, it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year. However, it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.  </p><p>Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure delivery of housing units for social purposes.</p><p>  My Department does not hold information on the number of households on local authorities&rsquo; waiting lists. This figure continuously fluctuates as households are allocated housing and new households apply for housing support. Detailed information on the latest statutory assessment of housing need carried out in March 2011, including a breakdown by housing authority, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website &ndash; www.environ.ie or on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at www.housing.ie.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to provide a comprehensive environmental legislative and policy framework within which the relevant enforcement authorities operate.  Much enforcement activity takes place at local authority level, with the support, as appropriate, of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other bodies. The Office of Environmental Enforcement within the EPA has a mandate to deliver enhanced environmental compliance through enforcement of EPA licences issued to waste, industrial and other activities. It also exercises a supervisory role in respect of the environmental protection activities of local authorities. </p><p>I have made clear my commitment to support the work of the EPA and the local authorities in this vital area. Income from the Environment Fund is used to support a range of enforcement measures. Specifically, I am providing funding to support the work of 120 waste enforcement officers in the local government sector. The level of intimidation to which local authority staff engaged in such work have been subjected is also a cause of concern. As part of the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s new waste policy, A Resource Opportunity, my Department is working closely with the full range of enforcement agencies within the State to ensure a robust enforcement framework is in place both to deter and respond to such criminal activity.</p></reply>

These powers include the power to refuse to allocate, or to refuse to sell, a dwelling to a person engaged in anti-social behaviour and the power to seek a court order excluding a person engaged in anti-social behaviour from entering a local authority dwelling or estate for a period of up to 3 years. Each housing authority also has a statutory duty to adopt and review an anti-social behaviour strategy for the prevention and reduction of anti-social behaviour in its housing stock, which must provide for co-operation with other relevant bodies, notably the Garda&iacute;, who have a range of measures in place to deal with allegations of such behaviour generally.   </p><p>I intend to commence section 29 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 this year and to make the necessary regulations to give effect to the Programme for Government   commitment to introduce a 12-month probationary tenancy for all new social housing tenants, which will include provision for termination in the event of anti-social behaviour. </p><p>Proposals for new housing legislation currently being developed in my Department will include a revised procedure to replace section 62 of the Housing Act, 1966, which will be designed to enable housing authorities to recover possession of their dwellings from households engaged in anti-social behaviour. I am also   examining the scope for making the excluding order powers of housing authorities   more effective in tackling anti-social behaviour without having to evict entire families from their homes. I n the context of the new legislation, I am giving particular consideration to the issue of anti-social behaviour in the arrangements to be made for transferring responsibility for rent supplement households with an established long-term housing need from the Department of Social Protection to housing authorities.   </p><p>While action to deal with anti-social behaviour is primarily a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of private residential estates and complexes, under Section 15 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 a landlord of a dwelling owes a duty to enforce the obligations of the tenant to each person who could be potentially affected by the breach of those obligations.   </p><p>The Act specifically prohibits a tenant in a private residential tenancy from engaging in anti-social behaviour in, or in the vicinity of, a dwelling to which the Act applies and allows a landlord to terminate any tenancy where the tenant is engaging in or allowing others to engage in such behaviour. This termination is subject to a notice period of only 7 days in the case of serious anti-social behaviour or 28 days in the case of less serious but persistent behaviour.   </p><p>Section 77 of the Residential Tenancies Act also provides that a third party who is directly and adversely affected by anti-social behaviour may refer a complaint to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) against a landlord who has failed to enforce tenant obligations. It also allows the PRTB to furnish the name and address of the landlord concerned to a person who proposes to make such a complaint. However, the third party complainant must have taken reasonable steps to resolve the matter by communicating or attempting to communicate with the parties to the tenancy concerned before referring the complaint to the PRTB.   </p><p>The effectiveness of these provisions was clearly demonstrated in a recent case taken in Cork against the landlord of two properties the tenants of which were found to be engaging in anti-social behaviour. A group of 13 residents took a case to the PRTB and were awarded combined damages of just under &euro;30,000 against the landlord for his failure to address the behaviour of his tenants.</p></reply>

The experts quantified the likelihood of incidents occurring at Sellafield resulting in the release of radioactive material, and as stated in the public summary, the team found that such an incident at the Sellafield site would give rise to &#8220;no observable health effects in Ireland&#8221;.</p><p>  The team recommended that the full report should not be published because to have such a substantial volume of security-sensitive information in the public domain would serve to increase the risks posed by Sellafield to both the UK and Ireland. For that reason, I do not intend to make the full, 1,000 page, report publicly available. However, the full Report is a valuable input to developing Government policies including National Emergency Planning.

There are 35 Local Action Groups (LAGs) contracted, on my Department&rsquo;s behalf, to deliver the RDP throughout the country and these groups are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding. Such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups and in line with Departmental operating rules and EU regulations.</p><p>Projects that request funding of &euro;150,000 or more are required to seek final approval from my Department. The assessment of these higher value projects usually involves detailed consultations between my Department and the relevant local development company. It frequently necessitates the provision of further documentation or clarifications. It may also, in some instances, result in modifications to the project proposed to ensure best value for money and compliance with all the necessary regulations, both national and European, governing the activities funded under the programme. My Department currently has 45   projects at various stages of assessment and the Local Development Companies that have projects currently undergoing assessment are listed in the following table.</p><p>The policy in my Department is to work with the Local Development Companies to ensure that the projects submitted are fully compliant and can be approved rather than to refuse approval for funding; it can therefore take some time to come to a final conclusion. My Department will continue to work with the relevant LAGs to make a full assessment of the eligibility of these projects and will inform the LAGs once all queries have been addressed satisfactorily.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>LAG</div></th><th><div>Date Received</div></th><th><div>Grant aid requested</div></th></tr><tr><td>Ballyhoura Development Ltd</td><td>10/10/12</td><td>&#8364;500,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>Ballyhoura Development Ltd</td><td>20/07/12</td><td>&#8364;500,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Development Partnership Ltd</td><td>26/06/12</td><td>&#8364;480,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Development Partnership Ltd</td><td>10/09/12</td><td>&#8364;254,643.75</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Development Partnership Ltd</td><td>10/09/12</td><td>&#8364;298,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan Monaghan LEADER</td><td>17/09/12</td><td>&#8364;500,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan Monaghan LEADER</td><td>17/09/12</td><td>&#8364;327,050.25</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan Monaghan LEADER</td><td>17/09/12</td><td>&#8364;265,680.00</td></tr><tr><td>Cill Dara ar Aghaidh Teoranta</td><td>22/01/13</td><td>&#8364;200,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>Cill Dara ar Aghaidh Teoranta</td><td>09/11/12</td><td>&#8364;500,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>Clare Local Development</td><td>18/01/13</td><td>&#8364;230,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>Clare Local Development</td><td>18/01/13</td><td>&#8364;200,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal Local Development Co Ltd</td><td>21/12/12</td><td>&#8364;200,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal LEADER Partnership Co</td><td>30/10/12</td><td>&#8364;493,385.02</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal LEADER Partnership Co</td><td>21/12/12</td><td>&#8364;494,938.81</td></tr><tr><td>Forum Connemara </td><td>23/08/12</td><td>&#8364;431,887.50</td></tr><tr><td>Galway Rural Development</td><td>25/01/13</td><td>&#8364;239,949.46</td></tr><tr><td>Galway Rural Development</td><td>25/01/13</td><td>&#8364;156,914.04</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny LEADER Partnership</td><td>12/11/12</td><td>&#8364;200,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny LEADER Partnership</td><td>05/11/12</td><td>&#8364;428,868.75</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny LEADER Partnership</td><td>04/12/12</td><td>&#8364;300,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny LEADER Partnership</td><td>16/01/13</td><td>&#8364;268,125.00</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny LEADER Partnership</td><td>16/01/13</td><td>&#8364;497,212.87</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny LEADER Partnership</td><td>16/01/13</td><td>&#8364;255,384.18</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny LEADER Partnership</td><td>16/01/13</td><td>&#8364;225,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim Development Company</td><td>30/11/12</td><td>&#8364;333,935.25</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim Development Company</td><td>30/11/12</td><td>&#8364;178,216.68</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo North East LEADER Partnership</td><td>03/10/12</td><td>&#8364;194,725.50</td></tr><tr><td>Meath Partnership</td><td>21/12/12</td><td>&#8364;246,940.38</td></tr><tr><td>North &amp; East Kerry Development</td><td>27/07/10</td><td>&#8364;193,360.00</td></tr><tr><td>North Tipperary LEADER Partnership</td><td>18/10/10</td><td>&#8364;250,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>North Tipperary LEADER Partnership</td><td>18/01/13</td><td>&#8364;199,993.63</td></tr><tr><td>North Tipperary LEADER Partnership</td><td>16/07/12</td><td>&#8364;407,675.25</td></tr><tr><td>South and East Cork Area Development </td><td>28/11/12</td><td>&#8364;500,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>South Kerry Development Partnership</td><td>10/08/12</td><td>&#8364;295,396.27</td></tr><tr><td>South Kerry Development Partnership</td><td>21/12/12</td><td>&#8364;500,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>South Kerry Development Partnership</td><td>25/01/13</td><td>&#8364;168,392.50</td></tr><tr><td>South West Mayo Development</td><td>21/12/12</td><td>&#8364;500,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>South West Mayo Development</td><td>21/12/12</td><td>&#8364;200,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford Leader Partnership</td><td>10/12/12</td><td>&#8364;200,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford Leader Partnership</td><td>05/11/12</td><td>&#8364;200,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>West Cork Development Partnership </td><td>25/10/12</td><td>&#8364;200,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>West Cork Development Partnership</td><td>21/11/12</td><td>&#8364;199,290.00</td></tr><tr><td>West Limerick Resources </td><td>21/12/12</td><td>&#8364;196,313.77</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow Partnership</td><td>08/08/12</td><td>&#8364;303,000.00</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In contrast to the 1995 scheme, the discounts provided under the incremental purchase principles are based on household income rather than length of tenancy, thereby allowing low-income households to move into home ownership earlier than otherwise might have been possible. The scheme is structured to make it attractive for households to put down long-term roots in the community and to commit to an area, thereby contributing to more sustainable and integrated communities.</p></reply>

The report was published by the Local Government Management Services Board and a copy is available in the Oireachtas Library. The information in respect of unaccounted for water does not differentiate between the types of properties supplied from public water mains.</p><p>  My Department&#8217;s Water Services Investment Programme 2010 &#8211; 2013 places a high priority on water conservation. Funding is particularly targeted at areas where the level of unaccounted for water is unacceptably high.</p><p>  Since the national water conservation programme was implemented in 2003, over &#8364;247 million has been specifically invested in water conservation measures by my Department. In addition, local authorities fund active leakage control, detection and repair from their own operational budgets. Most of the effort to date has been focused on putting in place the water management systems to allow for active leakage control and better planning of mains rehabilitation. Most local authorities have now prepared watermains rehabilitation strategies, which set out the priority mains for replacement and repair, and provide the platform for accelerated investment in this area over the coming years. The primary objective of this programme of work is to reduce water loss and leakage in the distribution networks to an economic level and to address high levels of unaccounted for water. Over time, this investment coupled with ongoing active leakage control should lead to marked reductions in unaccounted for water and improve service to customers.</p><p>  The proposed water metering programme will complement the continuing programme of investment in water mains rehabilitation and replacement. The installation of water meters will encourage households to conserve water, reduce consumption and ensure that customer side leaks can be identified and fixed. Metering will, therefore, achieve significant reductions in the volumes of water that are required to be produced and treated and will lead to savings in the operational costs of delivering water services and in deferred capital expenditure.</p></reply>

The Emigrant Support Programme   (ESP) provides funding to non-profit organisations and projects to support Irish communities overseas and to facilitate the development of more strategic links between Ireland and the global Irish.  The emphasis of the Emigrant Support Programme is on supporting culturally sensitive, frontline welfare services, targeted at the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities. These services have made a substantive difference to the lives of Irish communities overseas (particularly in Britain and the United States), reducing homelessness, tackling social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access their local statutory entitlements.  </p><p>  Under the ESP grants are allocated to a range of non-profit organisations and projects to support Irish communities overseas and encourage closer links between these communities and Ireland. </p><p>  These grants are a key part of the Government&rsquo;s approach to developing strong and meaningful links with Irish communities overseas and to securing the long term future of these communities. In recent years, as the demographic profile of our overseas communities has changed, there has also been an increased focus on funding community, heritage and capital projects. As part of this, grants have been approved for strategic capital projects.   </p><p>  Since 2004, the total budget for the Department of Foreign Affair&rsquo;s ESP, which supports Irish welfare, culture and heritage organisations abroad, has been in excess of &euro;104 million. Despite the difficult financial situation we face, the Government has maintained funding under the ESP at a level of &euro;11,595,000 for 2013.    </p><p>  The 2013 grant round will be open from 16 January and will run until 20 February.   </p><p>  The ESP does not have a minimum or maximum amount of funding that may be applied for.</p><p>The Reconciliation and Anti-Sectarianism Funds   assist individuals and organisations involved in reconciliation and anti-sectarianism work and encourage and facilitate better relations within and between the traditions in Northern Ireland, between North and South, and between Ireland and Britain. Funding is provided on a one-year basis for project-based activities. Funding is not provided to cover salaries, overseas travel, events which have already taken place, or for capital costs. </p><p>  Approximately 140 grants are awarded per year to support projects which best fit the eligibility criteria of the Funds. The total amount available for 2013 is &euro;2.7 million. There are no set maximum or minimum grants; the average grant awarded is &euro;15,000-&euro;20,000. Information on the funds, including eligibility criteria, can be found on the Department&rsquo;s website.  Application forms can also be downloaded from the site.</p><p>Applications are accepted throughout the year, and are assessed during two funding rounds. The closing date for receipt of applications for consideration in the first round of funding in 2013 is Friday 1st March, and the closing date for the second round is Friday 27th   September.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s aid programme, managed by Irish Aid, provides funding to NGOs, educational institutions and community and voluntary organisations implementing development education programmes in Ireland.</p><p>The Development Education Annual Grant   is provided to organisations engaged in promoting understanding of, and engagement with, global development and justice issues in Ireland. Initiatives funded are aimed at deepening understanding of global poverty and encouraging the Irish public to take action for a more just and equal world. All development education approved programmes and projects have a strong focus on achieving results in the youth sector as well as in the adult and community sector.</p><p>Each year, a call for proposals is issued for the Development Education Annual Grant. The 2013 call for proposals opened on the 21st of December 2012.  The closing date for expressions of interest was 15th   January 2013.  Applications from organisations which completed an expression of interest form by the deadline must be received by Friday 8th, February 2013. The minimum grant that organisations may apply for through the Development Education Annual Grant is &euro;10,000 and the maximum grant is &euro;200,000.  The next call for proposals will issue in late 2013.</p></reply>

These are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia in sub-Saharan Africa, and Vietnam in Asia. Timor Leste has now ceased to be a Programme Country.

A resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants will continue to be an important priority for the Government in our ongoing contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  </p><p>  The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election. The emphasis he placed on immigration reform in his inauguration address as well as his subsequent speech on the issue on 29 January sent a very positive signal in this regard.  The indications of emerging bipartisan support for reform in Congress is also encouraging.</p><p>  Through our Embassy in Washington and in close liaison with Irish-American community representatives, our contacts with the US Administration and Congress continue with a view to ensuring that the interests and concerns of undocumented Irish immigrants are captured in any future legislative deal in this area that emerges.  In this regard, I raised the issue with Secretary   of State Hillary Clinton during our bilateral meeting on 6 December last and recalled our strong support for comprehensive immigration legislation and the passage of E3 visas for Irish citizens.   I will also hold a series of telephone discussions with key US Senators over the coming days.    The Taoiseach also discussed immigration reform when he spoke with President Obama to congratulate him on his re-election and wrote to him on 30 January to thank him for the priority being attached by the US Administration to the issue. </p><p>  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system before the shape of any legislative deal is clear.  It is therefore not possible at this stage to identify an exact timescale in which these may become clear but the area will continue to receive the Government&rsquo;s close attention over the period ahead.</p></reply>

I would, however, hope to see it continue to play a full and active part into the future.   Like all Member States, the UK gains from its membership of the European Union, not least through unfettered access to a Single Market of more than 500 million people. At the same time, the UK it also makes a valued contribution to our Union of 27 &ndash; soon to be 28 &ndash; Member States. The EU is stronger for having the UK as a Member State.  From a national perspective, having the ability to work together within the Union on the many issues on which we are of like mind - the single market, trade to name just two &ndash; amplifies the impact of our excellent relationship generally. </p><p>  Both nationally, and as Presidency, the Government&rsquo;s focus is on ensuring that the Union is properly equipped to meet the challenges of the future. This is a shared interest among all EU partners. To this end, much work has already been done together in the face of the unprecedented economic challenges we have faced. We are primarily focused on getting on with the job of meeting those challenges, and are determined not to be distracted from that task.</p><p>  As the Union has grown larger, we have also become more flexible &ndash; not everyone is in the euro or participates in Schengen. But we need to ensure that flexibility doesn&rsquo;t become fragmentation &ndash; in designing banking union we have been careful not to erect barriers between those inside the euro area and those outside. We have also been careful to protect the single market.

Three diplomatic missions &ndash; Embassies to the Holy See and Iran, and our Irish Aid office in East Timor - were closed during 2012. The figures do not include the costs of the Irish based staff as these are a charge on the overall budget of the Department rather than on a specific Mission.    Ireland&rsquo;s missions abroad perform a wide range of functions in pursuit of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy interests.  These include representing and advancing government policies with other States and in international organisations, in particular the EU and the UN; economic and cultural promotion; frontline consular and passport services to Irish citizens overseas; engaging with Irish communities and harnessing the resource they offer in assisting economic recovery; and programme management, particularly in Irish Aid priority countries.</p></reply>

At its meeting on 22-23 November 2012, the European Council gave a mandate to President Van Rompuy and President Barroso to pursue work on the MFF, with a view to reaching agreement at the beginning of 2013. President Van Rompuy now hopes to close negotiations at the meeting of the European Council on 7-8 February. The Irish Presidency will support President Van Rompuy in his efforts to secure a deal on the MFF. </p><p>  The EU and its Member States are collectively the largest provider of development assistance in the world, providing over 55% of global ODA.  This will remain the case under the next MFF. The strength of the development budget enables the EU to implement large scale projects and to respond effectively to humanitarian crises when they emerge. It also confers great legitimacy on the Union when it calls on all international donors, including new and emerging partners, to raise their level of ambition and to increase their ODA efforts to a level similar to the EU, thus contributing their fair share to the global development efforts. </p><p>  In the course of the MFF negotiations, Ireland has sought to ensure that a fair proportion of the EU budget is allocated to development assistance.  We have pointed out that this will allow the EU to continue playing a leadership role, to engage effectively when humanitarian crises emerge and to target extreme poverty and hunger. Given the financial constraints across the EU there has been pressure from Member States to seek reductions across every Heading of the MFF. Nevertheless, I am hopeful that development funding in the next MFF will be at a higher level than for the current 2007-2013 MFF.</p></reply>

Sanctions have been placed on some Iranian financial institutions because of their involvement in supporting the nuclear and military programmes, or their involvement in evading sanctions or money-laundering. While this has meant some inconvenience for non-sanctioned commerce, there are specific exemptions in place in the financial sanctions in both the EU and the US for transactions relating to medicines.   There have been anecdotal reports in some media about possible shortages of some medicines in Iran. I would indeed be deeply concerned if I felt this was due to sanctions, but no real grounds have been advanced for concluding thus. There has been, and continues to be, considerable discussion and work within the EU on monitoring and fine-tuning the sanctions to ensure this does not occur, and both in the EU and the US the details of sanctions and controls have been adjusted to avoid possible problems which were foreseen. This process will continue, and Ireland will continue to play an active role in these discussions, based on ensuring that all legitimate trade with Iran is facilitated and all necessary humanitarian exemptions are provided. </p><p>  There are a number of very important points which also need to be remembered in relation to this issue.  The sole purpose of sanctions is to persuade Iran to negotiate seriously on the issues of concern in relation to its nuclear programme. It is open to Iran to do so at any time.</p><p>  Iran has simply refused to respond seriously to either the international community or the IAEA despite nine years of efforts to engage with them diplomatically. </p><p>  Sanctions have been slowly and reluctantly applied as a result of this intransigence. Their aim is to avoid a possible nuclear arms race in the Middle East, or actual warfare aimed at preventing this. The motivation for the sanctions thus could not be higher.</p><p>  Shortages of medicines or other goods in Iran, which are attributed to sanctions, may also be due to the collapse in value of the Rial, which is itself more likely due to long term economic mismanagement, or to the priority given by the Iranian Government to continued massive military and nuclear expenditure.</p><p>  Iran continues even now to devote enormous resources to a secret nuclear programme and the massive enrichment and stockpiling of uranium for which it has no civilian use and which returns no revenue whatever to Iran.</p></reply>

The ADF assists development in the poorest countries of Asia and the Pacific by providing low-interest loans and grants to fight poverty.    ADF operations provide infrastructure and services to boost economic growth; assist countries with fragile and conflict-affected situations; and expand the access of the poor, women, and children to quality education and health care, reliable supply of electricity and clean water, and economic opportunities.  ADF also helps these countries improve their institutional capacities and implement needed reforms.   In conjunction with the Asian Development Bank, Enterprise Ireland and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, my Department supports the promotion of business opportunities for Irish enterprise in the recipient countries.   Procurement contracts with ADB are generally awarded on the basis of international competition which is open to firms and individuals from any ADB member.  I understand that there is considerable interest among suppliers, contractors and consultants from Ireland and in this regard a Business Opportunities Seminar was hosted by Enterprise Ireland in Dublin in October 2012.      Further information regarding the involvement of Irish businesses in ADB loan and technical assistance projects is available on the Bank&rsquo;s website www.adb.org      </p></reply>

Their &ldquo;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013) which is published on the Revenue website (www.revenue.ie  ) includes a range of measures designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for illicit tobacco products.</p><p>This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, and optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and within the country to intercept and seize contraband products and to prosecute those involved.</p><p>Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>In carrying out this important work Revenue works in close cooperation with other relevant agencies, both nationally and internationally. There is extensive cooperation between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the agencies concerned in the State and in Northern Ireland work closely together, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to combat the organized crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market. In addition, cooperation takes place with other Revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing efforts to tackle the illicit trade in tobacco products at international level.</p><p>Considerable success has been achieved in combating the illegal trade. Details of the quantities of cigarettes seized each year since 2005 are set out in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Quantity of cigarettes seized (millions)</th></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>51.3</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>52.3</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>74.5</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>135.2</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>218.5</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>178.4</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>109.1</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>95.6</td></tr></table></p><p>The quantity of cigarettes seized in a given year can be influenced significantly by the occurrence of a particularly large seizure or seizures. For example, the quantity of cigarettes seized in 2009 includes one seizure of some 120 million cigarettes that were uncovered on a vessel at Greenore, Co. Louth. This was the largest seizure of cigarettes ever recorded by any EU country, and it would be unrealistic to gauge the numbers of seizures in subsequent years by reference to this exceptional event.</p><p>Revenue is committed to ensuring that the highest possible levels of seizures of illicit products are achieved on an ongoing basis and will ensure that this work continues to have the high priority that has been accorded to it to date.</p><p>There has been considerable success also in detecting and prosecuting those involved in the illicit trade. In 2012, there were 57 convictions for tobacco smuggling, resulting in fines of &euro;93,550 and 26 custodial sentences, 7 of which were suspended. There were, in addition, 75 convictions connected with the sale or keeping for sale of unstamped tobacco products, resulting in fines of &euro;153,050 and 21 custodial sentences, 14 of which were suspended.</p><p>Revenue is conscious that those involved in the illegal trade in tobacco are constantly striving to avoid detection by seeking out new ways of smuggling the illicit product and putting it on the market, and that its own response needs to be agile and adaptive in combating this criminal activity to take account of this.</p><p>In relation to staff numbers I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, that they are a fully integrated tax and customs administration and that it is not possible to disaggregate resources deployed exclusively at any given time on customs work or on policing illegal cigarette smuggling. Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to target and confront non-compliance. These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners are subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions imposed since 2009.  Revenue&rsquo;s overall staffing levels have reduced from a total of 6,581(FTE) at the end of  2008 to its current level of 5,745 (FTE).  Notwithstanding this reduction, Revenue staff resources assigned to compliance activities have been maintained at around 2,000. The Revenue Commissioners have accorded a very high priority to the tackling of the illicit tobacco trade and they are committed to ensuring that despite the staff reductions that this enforcement work will continue to be resourced to the maximum extent possible.</p></reply>

This cumulative figure amounted to &euro;50.4bn at 30 June 2012 including &euro;45.2bn representing sale and repurchase agreements with banks and central banks. This amount will have to be repaid over time, mainly from annual instalments on the Promissory Notes. The realisable value on the remaining IBRC loan book (&euro;15.6bn at 30 June 2012) will also be used to reduce this liability over time. The amount of money required by IBRC to repay total liabilities (including these sale and repurchase agreements) is subject to material uncertainty and market factors which include; the expected timing of asset recoveries and sales (themselves dependant on property prices, especially in the UK and Ireland); the volume and timing of maturing funding commitments and deposits; and projected interest rates within the Eurozone.   The bank&rsquo;s policy is that, due to the commercially sensitive nature of such information as noted above combined with the many external variables involved, it does not issue formal projections. However, as you may be aware, the Chairman of IBRC stated at the Oireachtas Committee for Finance and Public Expenditure that he hopes the final bill for Anglo Irish Bank, &ldquo;will come nearer to &euro;25 billion....than the &euro;29 billion to &euro;34 billion figure&rdquo;, previously announced. The bank remains of the view that there will be a small return to the State at full resolution, given the assumptions currently being used. </p></reply>

However, the Government decided that while the NPPR will be collected in 2013 when a half-year LPT will apply, it should be discontinued thereafter.  There is no exemption from the LPT for those who are liable for the NPPR.</p><p>  As set out in the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, liability to pay the NPPR is determined on the basis of ownership of the property in question on the &quot;liability date&quot; which is 31 March for 2013.  The LPT does not come into effect until 1 July 2013. The Government decided to extend the NPPR into 2013 to ensure as smooth a transition as possible for local authorities pending the introduction of the full LPT.</p><p>  Residential properties rented by landlords will be subject to Local Property Tax from 1 July 2013, with the owners of the property &ndash; in those cases, the landlord &ndash; being the liable person for payment of the tax. The Thornhill Group, the inter-departmental group, chaired by Dr Don Thornhill, established to consider the structures and modalities of a property tax, recommended that owners and not occupiers be the liable persons for the Local Property Tax.  This was also the view of the 2009 Commission on Taxation.  Given that some rental properties have high tenant turnover, which would present significant difficulties in determining liability and collecting taxes, as well as increasing the cost of collecting the tax, the Government accepted this recommendation.  Occupier liability may also give rise to perceptions of unfairness if the occupier on the valuation date (i.e. the date at which occupation of the property is deemed by law to create the tax liability) is no longer the occupier on the date at which payment of the tax becomes due.  </p><p>  The Local Property Tax is not an allowable deduction from rental profit for tax purposes.  This is the same treatment which applied to the Household Charge and the NPPR Charge.  It is, however, proposed to phase in deductibility of the Local Property Tax.</p><p>  Water charges are a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

I also set out the assumptions underpinning my assertion that an extension of our EFSF and EFSM loans could yield significant further savings, over time.  In my answer on 30 January I noted that the savings arising will depend on a number of factors - the amount of loans for which a maturity extension is agreed, the length of any maturity extension and the assumption made about the extent to which the EFSF and EFSM borrowings are cheaper than borrowings by Ireland.  It is possible to draw up various combinations of these factors which would give rise to significant savings of the order of magnitude referenced.  Any such scenario would be highly tentative and sensitive to the assumptions about the various factors outlined.  As the Deputy is aware this matter is under discussion at EU level, and at this stage I do not think it is appropriate to provide any particular estimate, even for illustrative purposes.</p></reply>

Chaired by Revenue, it is a multilateral group comprising of representatives of IBEC, SFA, CIF, ICTU and SIPTU, Government agencies, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the National Employment Rights Agency.  Its terms of reference are to provide a forum for the exchange of views on the effectiveness of measures introduced in combating the hidden economy between the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the National Employment Rights Agency and representative bodies of employers, unions and industry, and to prepare a brief report on its activities each year for presentation to the Department of an Taoiseach.</p><p>  The group met three or four times a year between 1990 and 2011 and contributed to the establishment of multi-agency investigation units, producing a &quot;Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals&quot;, and in 2007 sponsored legislation which provided for the exchange of employment information on the earned income of individuals between the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners, the first steps into information exchange.  Under its terms of reference, the Group prepares a written annual report that is presented to the Department of the Taoiseach.  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in 2011 the Group reviewed its own effectiveness and ability to deliver, in accordance with its terms of reference, and reached the conclusion that its would be better served by operating at a more local level, utilising resources more familiar with the difficulties that were being experienced by small and medium sized enterprises and unions locally and using local Government agency resources to arrive at workable solutions.</p><p>  In November 2011, the full HEMG devolved its terms of reference to four regionally based liaison groups, namely the Border Midlands West, Dublin, East &amp; South East and South West Hidden Economy Monitoring Liaison Groups, with a requirement that all groups meet regularly and provide reports as required to the HEMG.  The constituent members of the Regional Liaison Groups nominated were locally based members of the original attendee representative bodies and agencies, with the meetings organised and chaired by Revenue officials.  The four Regional Liaison Groups met a total of 11 times during 2012.  The 2012 report of the HEMG is currently being prepared.  On 30 January 2013 the full HEMG met to review the effectiveness of the first year of operations of the Regional Liaison Groups and to see what supports could be put in place to achieve and sustain improved outcomes from the work of the Groups.  In order to make the HEMG more representative it was expanded to include a number of other interested representative bodies such as ISME and Retail Ireland.  A schedule of meetings was agreed that requires the full HEMG to meet twice and the Regional Liaison Groups to meet quarterly in 2013.</p><p>  None of the members of any of the Groups receives remuneration or expenses from the Exchequer arising from their membership of the Groups, or for any of the additional work they have carried out on behalf of the Groups.  Given that individuals attend in a representative capacity, the actual members attending meetings varies from time to time.  The Group is chaired by Mr. Declan Rigney, Assistant Secretary, Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the most recent meeting was attended by the Revenue Planning Division team - Mr. S&eacute;amas &Oacute; Cathasaigh, Mr. Se&aacute;n Nolan, Mr. Vincent Kenrick and Mr. John Morrissey; the Chairmen of the four Regional Liaison Groups (also Revenue) - Ms Phil U&iacute; Bhr&oacute;ithe (Border/Midlands/West Region), Ms. Lynda Hendley (Dublin Region), Mr. Pat Murphy (South-West Region) and Mr. Thomas Keating (East/South/East Region); representatives of the other Government Agencies representatives - Mr. Phil Cox (Department of Social Protection), Mr. Fran Power (National Employment Rights Authority) and Ms. Joan Kehoe (Department of Jobs Innovation and Enterprise); representatives of the Employee Group (Unions) - Mr. Fergus Whelan (Irish Congress of Trade Unions) and Mr. Christy McQuillan (Services Industrial Professional and Technical Union); representatives of the Employer Group - Mr. Ger Brady (Irish Business and Employers Confederation), Mr. Eddie Keenan (Construction Industry Federation), Ms. Liz Carroll (Irish Small and Medium Enterprises) and Mr. Jim Copeland (Hardware Association of Ireland); and apologies were received from Ms. Avine McNally (Small Firms Association), Mr. Stephen Lynam (Retail Ireland), Mr. Donal O&rsquo;Keefe (Licensed Vintners Association) and Mr. Patrick Cribben (Vintners Association of Ireland).</p></reply>

To the extent that such groups are charities and are engaged in the provision of special needs housing, they should be eligible for the exemption for such housing which is provided for in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012.  I understand that most of the various bodies that comprise the voluntary and co-operative sector in respect of the provision of social housing would have been approved for charitable status by the Revenue Commissioners.  Indeed, such bodies must have such charitable status before they can be approved by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for funding to be used in the provision of social housing.  Such groups also provide general needs housing in the same way as a local authority provides such housing.  Depending on the level of local authority funding provided, some voluntary bodies may have flexibility to provide housing for those not eligible for local authority housing.  To provide for a blanket exemption for such bodies would obviously be inequitable <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> local authority tenants.  For this reason, the Government decided not to accept the recommendation of the Thornhill Group that all charitable bodies should be exempt but to restrict the exemption to those properties that are used to provide special needs accommodation to persons who, for reasons of old age, physical or mental disability or other cause, need special accommodation and support to enable them to live in the community.  I accept that Government policy places significant emphasis on the approved housing body sector as an important part of social housing supply in the future.  Issues relating to the impact of the Local Property Tax on approved housing bodies are being examined.</p></reply>

The SFT was reduced in Budget and Finance Act 2011 by over 50% to a level of &euro;2.3 million with effect from 7 December 2010 with transitional arrangements to protect the capital values of the pension rights of individuals where these exceeded the reduced SFT on that date.  No underlying data are available to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners on which to base reliable estimates of the savings from a further significant reduction in the SFT to the level indicated in the question.  Information on the numbers and values of individual pension funds or on individual accrued benefits are not generally required to be supplied to the Revenue Commissioners by the administrators of pension schemes and personal pension arrangements.  The estimated savings indicated at the time in respect of the Budget and Finance Act 2011 change in the SFT were quite conservative, based as they were on incomplete data and using very broad assumptions.  Indeed, those underlying data and assumptions may not be directly applicable to determining the effect of a further significant reduction.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware of the announcement which I made in my Budget 2013 speech that changes to the SFT regime and other possible changes to give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government to cap taxpayers&rsquo; subsidies for pension schemes which deliver pension income of more than &euro;60,000 will be put in place in 2014.  On page A.10 of the Budget 2013 booklet which accompanied my Budget speech, I indicated that the full-year yield from these changes is estimated at &euro;250 million.  The Budget 2013 booklet made clear, however, that the estimated full-year savings are provisional at this time as further detailed analysis of the necessary changes and their impact will be required.  In this regard, my Department has been engaging with representatives of the pensions sector over some time with a view, among other things, to gathering private pensions-related data which may be of value into the future in estimating the costs of potential changes in the pensions tax area.  Those engagements will continue in the context of the further detailed analysis of the changes announced in the Budget.</p></reply>

The limit was introduced at a level of &euro;5 million and is referred to in the legislation as the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT). A higher limit on the capital value of pension benefits may apply in certain circumstances and this limit is called the Personal Fund Threshold (PFT).   The legislation contains provisions for the indexation of the SFT and PFT in line with an earnings adjustment factor at the discretion of the Minister for Finance. The thresholds were increased in both 2007 and 2008 such that, for example, the SFT was increased from its original level of &euro;5 million to just over &euro;5.418 million for 2008.  No adjustment was made for 2009 and Budget and Finance Act 2010 reduced the SFT to its current level of &euro;2.3 million.</p><p>  In Budget 2013, I announced that changes to the SFT and other possible changes to give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government to cap taxpayers&rsquo; subsidies for pension schemes which deliver pension income of more than &euro;60,000 will be put in place in 2014.</p><p>  I also announced that consultation on the specific changes required to the existing pension regime will continue with, among others, the pensions sector and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Social Protection. The future indexation or otherwise of the SFT will be considered as part of this process.	</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-05a.362.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020500058#WRG00900"><p>Chapter 2C of Part 30 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA), incorporating sections 787O to 787U, and the associated Schedule 23B provide for a maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes. The Chapter imposes a limit or ceiling on the total capital value of pension benefits that an individual can draw upon in their lifetime from tax-relieved pension products where those benefits come into payment for the first time on or after 7 December 2005. This limit is known as the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) and is set at &euro;2.3 million as on and from 7 December 2010. In certain circumstances, a higher threshold called a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) may apply.   Section 787Q deals with the concept of the &ldquo;chargeable excess&rdquo; and, among other things, with the arrangements for the recovery of tax paid upfront on a chargeable excess by a pension administrator in the public service. The SFT was introduced as a deterrent to prevent over-funding of supplementary pension provision from tax-relieved sources and there are penal tax consequences where benefits are taken from pension funds which exceed the SFT or a PFT, where applicable. There is an immediate ring-fenced tax charge of 41% on the &ldquo;chargeable excess&rdquo; over the value of the SFT or PFT. Furthermore, the remaining amount is taxed again at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate when taken as retirement benefits.</p><p>  The SFT regime operates as it is intended to do in the private sector to deter over-funding of pensions, as individuals have the flexibility (which they generally exercise) to cease contributing to or accruing benefits under pension arrangements in order to avoid exceeding the SFT or the PFT, if applicable.</p><p>  The situation is different for individuals in public service pension schemes who cannot opt-out of the schemes and have no control over their accrual of public service pension entitlements (other than to leave their jobs). Simply by continuing in their posts, a significant chargeable excess and tax liability could arise for certain individuals at the point at which they retire from the public service pension scheme. This situation is unlikely to arise in the private sector. It should also be borne in mind that in public service schemes there is generally no actual pension fund available out of which the tax liability can be met. For these various reasons, section 787Q sets out arrangements for the reimbursement of the administrator for tax paid on a chargeable excess in respect of a retiree in a public service context. This reimbursement can be effected by a reduction in the net retirement lump sum payable to the individual from the public service scheme, by recoupment directly from the individual, by recovery from the gross public service pension over a period or by a combination of these approaches.</p><p>  I have not been made aware of similar difficulties to those that I have described above in a public service context arising in the private sector. If such difficulties exist and are outlined to me, I will examine the matter further.</p></reply>

Revenue has a clear focus on making sure that every person and business complies with the requirement to file the relevant returns and to pay the appropriate tax or duty on a timely basis. That is an appropriate and correct focus for Revenue and one that I fully endorse. Delays in the collection of tax revenues properly due, adds to the level of Government borrowing and public debt interest and confers an unfair competitive advantage on non-compliant businesses. In instances where taxpayers or businesses pay their taxes late then interest on late payment, which is a statutory charge is applied. This is designed to compensate the Exchequer for the loss of revenue suffered as a result of the late payment and to encourage timely payments in future. Revenue applies a balanced approach to the imposition of interest on late payment and ensures that customers are made fully aware that by paying late they risk being charged interest.   I am informed by Revenue that the interest on late payment charge in question relates to the 2010 tax year and that the person was obliged under self assessment rules to pay preliminary tax for that year at an amount equal to either 100% of his final 2009 liability or 90% of his eventual 2010 liability on or before 31 October 2010.  The person did not make the required payment within the statutory timeframe but did eventually make the payments on a phased basis between 17 November 2011 and 8 February 2012. Because the payments were made well outside of the statutory timeframe the person was charged interest on late payment of &#8364;7,701.28. </p><p>  Unfortunately the person also breached preliminary tax payment rules in 2005 and 2009 and on those occasions suffered interest on late payment charges of &#8364;6,320.86 and &#8364;1,580.17 respectively. It is also noted that the person has again failed to adhere to preliminary tax rules for 2011 and has paid no preliminary tax for 2012 to date.</p><p>The Collector General&#8217;s Division of the Revenue Commissioners recently reviewed the application of interest on late payment against the 2010 tax year at the request of the person in question but found no grounds to mitigate the charge given the person&#8217;s track record of late payment. However if payment of the debt in one lump sum creates an undue burden on the person, then Revenue would be prepared to consider payment by way of an agreed phased payment plan.  Should the person wish to avail of such an arrangement he should urgently contact Mr. Jim Deery, Collector-Generals Office, Limerick, Telephone 061 488753 or email <i><font color="#0000FF">jdeery@revenue.ie</font></i>  to make a suitable arrangement for payment.</p></reply>

This provision is however specific to beer, and there is no corresponding provision to cover other fermented beverages, including cider. Under EU law (Art 13(2) of Council Directive 92/83/EEC) we are obliged to apply the same rate of excise duty to all other fermented beverages, which include cider. Ireland has however used the option under paragraph (3) of that article, to apply two lower rates to cider below 8.5% vol and 6% vol.   A reduced rate of tax for low strength cider was also introduced, with effect from 15 October 2008, for cider of a strength not exceeding 2.8% alcohol by volume, as provided for under Article 5 of the Directive.  Under the current EU legislative framework, a reduced rate could not be introduced for cider produced by small operators. </p><p>  While there is an exemption for small scale cider producers in the UK of up to 7000 hectolitres, I understand that this exemption pre-dates the Directive.</p><p>  A cider manufacturer's licence is also required for the production of cider on a commercial basis under the Finance (1909-1910) Act 1910.</p></reply>

This is regarded as land which is enjoyed as an amenity with the dwelling-house and includes driveways, yards and gardens which belong with the dwelling-house.   The tax is intended to be a tax on residential property as normally defined so I do not agree that taxing a residential property plus one acre means that revenue is being foregone.  In any event, it is not possible to estimate what yield would arise from applying the Local Property Tax to a larger area as no valuation of such property is available.  If a property is situated on grounds in excess of one acre, while the LPT will only apply to the house plus one acre, the balance of the property will be liable to CGT on disposal as it will not benefit from the CGT relief for principal private residences.</p></reply>

This engagement ended in April 2012. A fixed fee, including expenses, of &euro;2.75m was agreed for the engagement of McKinsey &amp; Company in 2011 and a further fee of &euro;0.87m was paid in relation to the work in 2012.

The aim of the Semester is that EU-level discussions on fiscal policy, macroeconomic imbalances, financial sector issues, and growth-enhancing structural reforms will now always take place before governments draw up their draft budgets and submit them to national parliamentary debate in the second half of the year.  Additionally, the so-called "six-pack" of economic governance legislative measures came into effect in 2011 in order to enhance economic and budgetary coordination across the EU.  The position on the date of budgets raised by the Deputy is as set out in section 6.4 of the Budgetary Reform Chapter of the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement published last November.</p><p>  One of a further two draft economic and budgetary regulations, known as the &quot;two-pack&quot;, nearing finalisation in Europe, will introduce a common budgetary timeline for all euro area Member States.  When this regulation is adopted and in force, all euro area Member States will be required to publish their draft budget for central government and the main parameters of all other General Government sub-sectors no later than 15 October each year.  The common budgetary timeline also foresees that the final budget should be adopted or fixed upon annually by 31 December.</p><p>  Accordingly, much of our existing budgetary process, which is currently completed in the first week of December, will have to be finalised earlier in the year. </p><p>  As the two-pack has not yet been adopted, this requirement has not yet come into force but I can assure the Deputy that we will take the necessary actions to ensure that Ireland will comply with the new requirements once they have been agreed. </p></reply>

The legislation sets out in detail how the tax is to be administered and provides how a residential property is to be valued for LPT purposes.  There is no specific exemption from the Local Property Tax for the type of cases outlined in the question from the Deputy.   I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Local Property Tax (LPT) is a self-assessment tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property and the impact of serious and regular flooding on a property would be one of the factors that a property owner would take into account in valuing their property. </p><p>  In addition, one of the advantages of the banding system of values provided for in the legislation is to remove the need for precision in relation to the market value, except for properties worth over &euro;1million.  The Revenue Commissioners are preparing valuation guidance and developing a guide to assist liable persons in assessing the value of their property which will take account of location.  Where these guidelines are used honestly, together with a liable person&rsquo;s own knowledge of their property, the property valuation will not be challenged by Revenue in accordance with their normal Customer Service Charter.</p></reply>

Generally I understand that previous claims experience will have a major influence on such matters.  Therefore, if there has been a major increase in claims in a particular area, then this will be reflected in an increase in premiums.   Competition in the market place acts as a constraint in such circumstances, however insurance companies have always to be conscious of their prudential obligations and are required by the Central Bank of Ireland to meet their capital requirements on an ongoing basis in order to ensure the sustainability of their business.  In these circumstances when they are exposed to a high level of claims, it is inevitable that their capital position will suffer and put pressure on prices. </p><p>  It is worth noting that past initiatives, in particular the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and legislation to improve road safety which has reduced accidents significantly still continue to make a major contribution to keeping insurance costs at a reasonable level. </p><p>  Finally, it should be noted that the ability of the Government to influence the competitiveness of insurance costs is limited as neither I as Minister for neither Finance nor the Central Bank can prohibit or restrict an insurance company from increasing its annual premium rates, as this is a commercial decision for the company in question. </p></reply>

The progression of school projects to construction, as set out in the Five Year Plan, to meet future demographic demand is the main focus of the Plan. In view of the funding constraints, it is not possible to progress all projects within my Department's building programme concurrently. Accordingly, it was necessary to prioritise school building projects already progressing within architectural planning in the context of the Plan, taking into account factors such as the funding available and the progression of other major projects required to meet demographic needs. Details of previous capital project announcements together with details of projects listed in the Five Year Plan may be viewed on my Department's website at www.education.ie and this is updated regularly.</p></reply>

Due to commercial sensitivities attaching to site acquisitions generally, it is not possible to comment further on the site acquisition aspect of these projects at this time. With respect to the remaining school, this has been devolved for delivery to the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA). The NDFA has recently appointed a Design Team to advance this project. All these projects are included in the Five Year Plan announced in March, 2012</p></reply>

It is also worth pointing out that, as part of last years budgetary measures, my Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. My Department also provided some limited short-term support to schools through curricular concessions in order to help them manage within their approved teaching allocation.My Department does not have the information sought by the Deputy. The day to day management of how teaching resources are used in schools is done at local school level. It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students. I am confident schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.</p></reply>

These consisted of twenty new primary schools and twenty new post-primary schools.  This announcement did not include a proposal to establish any new second level school in the area in County Westmeath referred to by the Deputy.  The Forward Planning Section of my Department will continue to monitor enrolments in the area referred to by the Deputy to ensure that there is sufficient school accommodation to meet any projected future demands.  If a decision is made to establish a new school in the area referred to by the Deputy, my Department will consider all suitable options for its location including the site referred to by the Deputy.  This process will take into account the suitability of any site for the development of school buildings as well as the cost of acquiring it.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. SENOs are a valuable source of support to parents who are actively sourcing a placement for their children.  Furthermore the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which assists parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.</p><p>  The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Health Service Executive is responsible for the provision of health supports, including therapies, to children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

The Plan included 48 rationalisation measures to be implemented by the end of 2012, as well as a further 46 critical reviews to take place by the end of June 2012, details of which are set out in Appendices IIa and IIb of the Plan which can be found on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s website.</p><p>With regard to the 48 agency rationalisation measures outlined in Appendix IIa of the Public Service Reform Plan, significant progress has been made by the responsible parent Departments on the implementation of these measures.  The latest position on these measures to reflect progress to end Q4 2012 is included in the table in Appendix 1.  Further detail or queries on this progress should be sought from the relevant Minister.</p><p>As the Deputy will see from the table, the Commission on Public Service Appointments merger with the Ombudsman&rsquo;s Office, both of which are under the aegis of my Department, was completed and is legislated for in the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012.</p><p>Other rationalisation measures may also have occurred outside or prior to the Public Service Reform Plan, these rationalisation measures are a matter for the individual Departments and should be directed to the relevant Ministers.</p><p>With regard to further rationalisation measures to be introduced, I refer the Deputy to my answer to PQ 2813/13 answered on Wednesday 23rd January, 2013, which outlines the results of the critical review process and further rationalisation measures to be implemented by end 2013.</p><p>Regarding savings, from the outset, I have maintained that the real benefit from the rationalisation of State Bodies will be a less crowded administrative landscape resulting in greater democratic accountability, less duplication of effort and clearer lines of responsibility for the citizen.  This will be of real and lasting benefit to all citizens, regardless of any headline figure on savings.</p><p>Specifically, the Public Service Reform Plan aimed to secure &euro;20 million in enhanced service efficiencies and value-for-money from the rationalisation programme.  The bulk of the savings are derived from a reduction in the number of public servants working in the State Bodies affected.  This rationalisation programme is just one of the reform measures announced in the PSR plan and the Programme for Government which facilitates the Government in ensuring delivery of critical services while still being able to reduce public service numbers.</p><p>There will of course be other cash savings realised over time as organisations, financial systems, office accommodation etc. are rationalised into leaner, more coherent structures.  These savings, some of which will be once-off, will be factored into the overall budgetary framework as they arise.</p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding the number of State Bodies that still exist, as I have stated before in previous PQs, there are three broad categories of State Bodies.</p><p>Firstly, there are a number of Offices of State which typically are staffed by Civil Servants and have their own Vote for the allocation of public monies and which are within a Vote Group.  A list of these bodies is set out in Appendix 2.</p><p>Secondly there are non-commercial State Bodies who are usually staffed by Public Servants and funded (or part funded) through a grant-in-aid from their parent Department.  Details of such bodies are set out in the Detailed Expenditure Information on Non-Commercial State Agencies included in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2012, which can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at:</p><p><i>http://per.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/REV-2012-Final.pdf</i></p><p>Beyond that within each Department there are many other executive offices, divisions and directorates, operational or consultative groupings, task groups or forums that exist for various purposes that might or might not meet the definition of &lsquo;entity&rsquo;.  Many of these groups are transient in nature in response to the needs and business pressures of particular Departments and sectors and details of which would not be held centrally.  Questions on such bodies should be directed to the relevant Ministers.  The internal organisation of my own Department is set out at Appendix 3.</p><p><bu>Appendix 1 - 47 Measures to be implemented by end 2012 (Progress to end Q4 2012)</bu></p><p><b>Bold text reflects those measures implemented fully </b></p><p><table><tr><th>Department </th><th>Ref No. * See Appendix IIa of the Public Service Reform Plan </th><th>Body and Action</th><th>Status </th></tr><tr><td>Education and Skills</td><td>1 to 3</td><td>Amalgamation of Further Education and Training Awards, Higher Education and Training Award Council and National Qualifications Authority of Ireland </td><td>Amalgamation completed - Quality and Qualifications Ireland was established on 6 November 2012 under the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>4</td><td>Reduce Number of VEC&#8217;s from 33 to 16</td><td>The Bill completed the Committee Stage on 17 January 2013 and the Minister expects the Bill to be enacted before end March 2013</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>5&amp;6</td><td>Merge Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology and Council for the Humanities and Social Science into consolidated single council under HEA.</td><td>Merger completed March 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation </td><td>7 &amp; 8</td><td>Amalgamate the Competition Authority and <br /><br />National Consumer Agency</td><td>The Bill is now included in the A List of the Government's Legislative Programme.

Public procurement in Ireland is governed by legal requirements, rules and guidelines set both at national and EU level.  The general requirements are set out in the Public Procurement Guidelines - Competitive Process 2004 (revised).  This guidance incorporates key elements of EU legislation that have been transposed into Irish law and is complemented by circulars and guidance issued by my Department and the National Procurement Service.</p><p>  The full range of regulations, circulars, guidelines and relevant template documents (e.g. standard forms of contract, model tender documentation) are available on the Government&#8217;s eTenders website at: <i><font color="#0000FF">www.etenders.gov.ie/guides/guides_main.aspx</font></i></p><p>  Public procurement rules apply to: Central Government Departments and bodies under their aegis; Commercial or non-commercial state bodies; Local and regional authorities; and, entities that are substantially state-funded (over 50 per cent).</p><p>  Certain categories of contracts are excluded from the scope of the general EU public procurement Directive (EU Directive 2004/18/EC).  These categories include:</p><p>  - contracts covered by the utilities rules (there is a specific regime for entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors - EU Directive 2004/17/EC);</p><p>  - property transactions;</p><p>  - employment contracts;</p><p>  - public service concession contracts; and,</p><p>  - contracts dealing with defence.</p><p>  The utilities sector has a more flexible regime as entities operating in these sectors are more likely to be in direct competition with private sector suppliers.</p><p>  The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.</p></reply>

D. Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) respectively.</p><p>  Under a public works contract the contractual relationship is between the public body and the main contractor.  The public body does not conduct the procurement process for each sub-contract package under a public works contract; this is carried out by the main contractor who is not subject to the rules governing public procurement. </p><p>  The public works contracts include a clause on pay and conditions of employment which require the main contractor to ensure that all those employed on the works (including those employed by sub-contractors) are paid in accordance with the Registered Employment Agreement (Construction Industry wages and conditions of employment).  This is enforced through a number of measures which include the display of the relevant clause on the site in a location that is readily accessible to all those employed on the site, a requirement for a certificate from the contractor with each payment application stating that all those employed on the works are paid in accordance with the REA, withholding of any payment if the certificate is not provided, a deduction from sums due to the main contractor of the amounts due to workers in accordance with the REA if a certificate is subsequently found to be false and termination of the contract in the case of a persistent breach.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware of the grounds upon which an applicant may be excluded from a public tender from my reply of the 16th January 2013 to a series of recent Parliamentary Questions on the same subject (Reference Numbers 57826/12, 57828/12 and 57830/12).  It is possible that following a public tender a company could be awarded a public works contract where a contracting authority <i>may not be aware of any outstanding judgements</i> by the Labour Court made against a tenderer.</p><p>  The management of a public works contract is a matter between a contracting authority and a main contractor.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that contractors comply with all the requirements of the contract.  If the Deputy is aware of any non-compliance he should contact the relevant contracting authority directly.</p></reply>

Their service can be contacted at (01) 676 1914 or by email at iis@iif.ie.</p><p>  If they need to pursue the matter further they can contact the Financial Services Ombudsman who deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers.  The Office can be contacted at  and is a free service to the complainant. </p><p>  On foot of my constructive engagement with the insurance industry last year, I indicated that I wished to see an agreement reached as quickly as possible between the Office of Public Works and the IIF on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes and works undertaken by the OPW or, in certain instances, by local authorities with OPW funding, and where the standard of protection afforded by these works could be verified.</p><p>  Work has been ongoing in OPW on compiling information on such completed flood defence works in an appropriate format.  A working group has been established between OPW, the IIF and representatives of several insurance companies to progress the work further.  The first meeting of this working group took place in January.</p><p>  I am confident that good progress can be made on the exchange of information in order that the insurance industry can be better informed as to the extent and standard of investment by the OPW in flood protection measures and that that investment is taken fully into account in assessing flood risk for insurance purposes</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, Dublin City Council developed proposals for a flood defence scheme to provide protection against coastal flooding in the Clontarf area, for which the OPW agreed to provide funding.  However, when the proposals were exhibited to the public by the Council there were a number of objections and as a result the scheme did not proceed.  If alternative proposals are developed by the Council, they will be considered for funding by the OPW having regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management.</p></reply>

The overriding objective is to have a more customer focused, leaner, more efficient and better integrated public service which delivers maximum value for money.  Number ceilings are set by Government for each Sector/Department, it is then a matter for individual Ministers to allocate staffing resources, within his or her own area of responsibility, with due regard to Government policies and priorities.</p></reply>

I am confident that a system of information sharing can be agreed which will enable the insurance industry to be more fully informed as to the extent of the OPW investment in flood protection measures and to take that investment fully into account in assessing flood risk for insurance purposes.  The first meeting of this working group took place in January.</p><p>  My colleague the Minister for Finance has recently reiterated that the issue of provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which has to be based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting.  These are often considered on a case by case basis and it is important to be clear that neither the Government nor the Central Bank has any influence over this matter.  </p><p>  The Local Property Tax (LPT) is a matter for the Minister for Finance and I understand the Deputy has tabled a separate Parliamentary Question to him on whether LPT applies to these properties.</p></reply>

These strategically important projects will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitive offering in a range of research and innovation areas spanning ICT, pharmaceutical, medical devices/technologies, energy and environment, food, culture and creative sectors, and nanotechnology.  The PRTLI also includes matching private and EU co-funding with most projects having multiple academic and industry partners.</p><p>The Deputy should also note that the PRTLI element is often part of bigger infrastructure projects supported across the various colleges.

Stimulating the flow of new high-potential start-ups (HPSUs) is one of the fundamental building blocks in Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s overall strategy for indigenous industrial development.</p><p>To this end Enterprise Ireland, through its Research and Innovation Programme, has supported the development of campus incubation centres in the Universities and Institutes of Technology with the objective of fostering spinouts from research in the colleges, and spin-ins from outside the college environment which leverage third-level expertise to develop their start-up venture.  The Campus Incubators are particularly important in providing a halfway house for academics who are transitioning towards launching a research spin-out, as well as providing initial incubation space for the entrepreneurs emerging successfully from Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s New Frontiers entrepreneur development programme.</p><p>At present, there are 330 companies in campus incubation units across the country, employing about 1,500 people.  These start-ups are operating across a range of areas including software, environmental technologies and digital media.</p><p>EI has invested &euro;50m to date in the provision of campus incubation facilities across the state.  At this stage, all Universities and Institutes of Technology have on-campus incubators already built and operational, with the exception of the National University of Ireland Maynooth where an incubation facility is at the design stage, and DIT, who plan to build a facility on the Grangegorman campus.</p><p>In total in 2013 &euro;1m is expected to paid in respect of campus incubation activities.</p><p><b>IDA Ireland</b></p><p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s Capital allocation for 2013 provides funding towards IDA&rsquo;s property function and grant payments.</p><p>The grant payments provided for in 2013 are in relation to projects which have been approved in previous years. The majority of grants paid in 2013 will be in the areas of Research, Development and Innovation, Training and Employment Projects and a small number of New Industry (Capital) Projects.  These latter grants are paid in the main for construction projects by client companies.  Grants are drawn down by Client Companies on reaching the relevant grant payment milestones and targets.</p><p>Commercial sensitivities and the demand led nature of payments preclude IDA Ireland from providing details of payments that will be made for New Industry Grants in 2013 until they are drawn down.

Ireland does not ratify international Conventions until any necessary amendments to domestic legislation have been identified and effected.  It is not for me to comment on the approach adopted by other Member States.</p><p>  My officials have carried out an initial assessment of the implications of ratifying the International Labour Organisation&rsquo;s Convention 189 on Domestic Workers.  The Assessment includes an Article-by-Article examination of the extent to which domestic legislation provisions already provide for the rights and entitlements enunciated in each Article, as well as the extent to which any legislative amendments will be required.  This assessment is being forwarded to the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office for their examination. </p><p>  I intend to progress the ratification of this Convention both nationally and at EU level during our Presidency. </p><p>  It is important to note, however, that domestic workers are protected by virtue of the fact that the full suite of employment rights legislation, including that of redress for violations of their employment rights, apply to domestic workers in the same way as they apply to other categories of employees in Ireland.  Also it is worth pointing out that NERA has carried out a programme of inspections involving Domestic Workers as well as continuing to respond to any complaints it receives from Domestic Workers.</p><p>  A voluntary Code of Practice for Persons Employed in Other People&rsquo;s Homes was developed under the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  The Code sets out certain employment rights and practices for persons employed in other people&rsquo;s homes and encourages good practice and compliance with the law in such employment situations.  In any proceedings before a court, or a workplace relations dispute resolution body, a code of practice shall be admissible in evidence and any provision of the code which appears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings shall be taken into account in determining that question.</p></reply>

All companies eligible for support from the Agencies have the same access to State services regardless of their location or status. </p><p>  While grant support is focussed in the main, on the manufacturing and internationally-traded sectors, for reasons of the potential for deadweight and displacement, many locally trading, established firms can avail of soft supports, such as mentoring and training, etc. </p><p>  Since coming into office, this Government has demonstrated our determination to fundamentally address the challenge of supporting micro and small businesses.  For example, we have introduced the Microenterprise Loan Fund and the Credit Guarantee Scheme to assist both new and established businesses in gaining access to much-needed credit.  These Schemes are available to all businesses, including those trading locally.</p><p>  I am currently in the process of reforming the national micro and small business support infrastructure by dissolving the City and County Enterprise Boards and establishing new Local Enterprise Offices that will operate from within Local Authorities, but with clear oversight by Enterprise Ireland.  To this end, a new Microenterprise Division has been established within Enterprise Ireland and this will become the national Centre of Excellence for supporting micro and small businesses, benchmarked to international standards.</p><p>  This fundamental reform offers the opportunity to revisit and refocus national policy in relation to the micro and small business sector with a view to ensuring that the State supports are properly targeted at that sector and that the LEOs become a &ldquo;First Stop Shop&rdquo; for micro and small businesses for the range of supports available across the system. </p><p>  The LEOs will engage will all local businesses and will offer a range of soft supports to those that are locally trading with a viable business proposition, including help with applying for a Microfinance Loan.  They will also be well positioned to assist in the early identification of start-ups with the best potential to move into the Enterprise Ireland portfolio.</p></reply>

New and renewal applications may also be considered in respect of non-EEA nationals already legally resident in the State on a valid employment permit. </p><p>  The application did not appear to meet a number of criteria.  Firstly, new employment permit applications are normally only considered where it is established that a minimum salary of &euro;30,000 per annum is on offer based on a 39 hour week and where the position on offer is one of the occupations currently eligible for a new employment permit.  The application indicated a salary below this level.  Also, the occupation of machine worker listed in the application is one of the occupations considered ineligible for a new employment permit.</p><p>  Secondly, the Employment Permits Act 2006 requires that employment permits will not issue where more than 50% of the employees in the company are non EEA nationals.  It appeared from the information submitted that more than 50% of employees in the company, at the time of application, were non EEA nationals.</p><p>  Finally, supporting documentation in respect of this application indicated that the proposed employee's immigration status at the time the application was made was not one which permitted them to enter full-time employment in the State.</p><p>  An appeal against this decision was received on 25th April 2012 and the decision was upheld on appeal on 3rd July 2012.

Such guidelines should specify how and when the employee should inform the employer of his/her absence; the circumstances in which an employee must provide a certificate from a medical practitioner; whether the employee can be referred to the employer&rsquo;s occupational health advisors etc. </p><p>  In circumstances where employees absent themselves from work on grounds of illness but fail to comply with an employer&rsquo;s documented guidelines, they can reasonably expect to be subject to their employer&rsquo;s disciplinary procedures.  It is also the case that employees who are frequently absent from work through illness or who are on extended sick leave, even when they adhere to the employer&rsquo;s notification requirements, may be liable to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. However, employees are afforded significant protection against unreasonable disciplinary action and dismissal through the provisions of employment legislation including the Employment Equality Acts, the Unfair Dismissals Acts and the Industrial Relations Acts.</p><p>  If an employee believes he or she has been unfairly disciplined or dismissed in any circumstances, including those referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, that employee, having exhausted the employer&rsquo;s internal procedures, may refer a complaint to the State&rsquo;s employment rights dispute resolution machinery. This machinery currently includes the Early Resolution Service (ERS), the Rights Commissioner Service, the Equality Tribunal, the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p></reply>

The places will be limited to low income families with children aged 4 to 12 years in primary school. </p><p>  This initiative is targeted at families that are most in need at a critical time in their progression into employment.

My Department is working closely with officials from Department of Children and Youth Affairs to fully define the scheme.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).  </p><p>  In 2011 I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.   The Advisory Group is charged with, inter alia, examining and reporting on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.   </p><p>  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed.  </p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.   The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&ndash;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.</p><p>  The Report of the Review did not analyse the economic contribution generally of the self-employed, or indeed any other group, vis a vis their entitlements to benefits under the social insurance scheme as these benefits are linked to the level of contributions made.  The report of the Actuarial Review found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  Therefore in terms of the pension entitlements, the report concludes that the self-employed achieve very good value for money in terms of the PRSI contributions paid.   </p><p>  The Review also addressed the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contributions rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.  The Review found that an incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.</p><p>  Any proposals to revise the social insurance system for self-employed persons by extending social insurance entitlements will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  </p><p>  Self-employed workers whose businesses fail or suffer from reduced demand or who do not have constant or continuous employment, may access social welfare support by establishing entitlement to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p></reply>

The number of under 25s on the Live Register in Kildare has decreased by 6% from 2,863 twelve months previously, having peaked at 3,926 in August 2009.</p><p>  Young people, typically, suffer disproportionately from job losses in recessions as they tend to have entered employment more recently, are more likely to hold temporary contracts and to be employed in cyclically sensitive industries than older workers.</p><p>  In the first instance, the Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.</p><p>  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies. These initiatives are being rolled out in all areas across the country including mid-Kildare. Details of these initiatives have already been outlined in earlier PQs relating to youth unemployment.</p></reply>

A key requirement of these regulations is that EU citizens living and working here must be accorded equal treatment with Irish citizens. The regulations are viewed by the EU as an important element in the arrangements in place to encourage and facilitate free movement across the Union.</p><p>  Child Benefit is classed as a family benefit for the purposes of the regulations. Generally speaking the competent State for the payment of benefits for a worker and his/her family is the country of employment. Accordingly, a person working here is entitled to receive Irish  child benefit in respect of his/her children, even if they are resident in another EU country. Payments are adjusted to take account of any payments the person may receive based on the domestic legislation of the country in which the children are resident. </p><p>  The cost of payments in respect of children resident in other EU countries was &euro;13.2 million in 2012.  This is substantially lower than the level of payments in 2008 which were at a high of &euro;20.9 million.  A breakdown by country is not readily available.</p><p>  I have raised the question of reducing child benefit payments in respect of children resident in other countries to reflect local conditions, with colleagues from other countries and with the EU Commissioner. The latter is strongly opposed to any such change because of the importance the EU attaches to free movement and the measures in place to support this, and because of legal precedence set by the Courts of Justice of the EU.  Any amendment to the current arrangements would require a proposal for legislative change from the EU Commission and given the position adopted on this matter by the Commissioner it is highly unlikely that such a proposal would be forthcoming. In the circumstances, it will be difficult to effect any change in this area but I will continue to raise the matter with colleagues and the Commission when the opportunity presents itself.</p></reply>

The total cost of the telephone allowance in 2013 is estimated at &#8364;48 million with 395,000 recipients. </p><p>Budget 2013 changed the structure of the electricity and gas allowance which is now aligned to the best average market rate currently available from energy suppliers for 150 units per month. The number of units remains unchanged from 2012.<b></b>  This allowance will now show as a cash credit of &#8364;35 on the customer's bill or will be paid as a cash allowance directly to the customer depending on their supplier.  Customers who don&#8217;t use their full entitlement, will be able to carry forward that unused monetary value.  There will be no upper limit on the amount of cash credit carried forward and customers may seek reimbursement, at any time, from their energy supplier for all unused credit that they have accumulated.   This will be particularly helpful in enabling customers to switch to a cheaper supplier. Prior to these budgetary changes, credit could not be carried forward and therefore, this acted as an impediment to customers achieving the best value for their particular needs.</p><p>  Regarding the question of unused units on the customer&#8217;s last energy bill for 2012, my Department is currently exploring various options with the main energy suppliers to ensure that customers are dealt with in the most equitable way possible. This issue will be resolved shortly and the energy suppliers will be communicating directly with customers to outline the arrangements in this regard.</p><p>  The amount of the telephone allowance payable by the Department in respect of each eligible customer is now &#8364;9.50 per month. This new monthly rate will show as a credit on the customer's bill or be paid as a cash allowance directly to the customer. Eircom is communicating directly with customers outlining these new arrangements. In response to this change, I am pleased to note that Eircom are also developing a package specifically for vulnerable customers.</p><p>In addition, these changes have been advertised as part of the general Budget release and are also detailed on the Department&#8217;s website .  Customers should be encouraged to get the best value possible for their allowances by regularly shopping around utility providers for their own specific needs.

The appeals process <font color="#2F2F2F">has a statutory basis in both primary and secondary legislation and Appeals Officers are quasi-judicial officers and are required to be free and unrestricted in discharging their functions. As far back as 1958, the Supreme Court found that Appeals Officers are required to free and unrestricted in the performance of their duties. The high level of appeals allowed </font>(54% in 2012<font color="#2F2F2F">) is evidence of the </font>independence of the process.  There are no plans to take legislative steps to change the method by which Appeals Officers are appointed.</p><p>  The report also criticises the delays being experienced by appellants. There was a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals from 2009 to date which has placed extraordinary pressure on the SWAO. Significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, improving business processes and implementing a new operating model.  </p><p>  As a result of these measures, there has been significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from an average of 13,500 to 32,558 in 2012 and processing times have been reduced by an 7.8 weeks overall in 2012 with time for an oral hearing time down by 18.2 weeks and the time for summary decision up by 2.7 weeks.  Of course, further improvement is needed.   In that regard</p><p>-  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012;</p><p>- There is a major programme of process redesign and modernisation currently underway in relation to many scheme areas which will reduce backlogs and will also reduce the time taken for the Department to respond to requests from the SWAO for submissions in relation to appeals;</p><p>-  It is planned to recruit additional Medical Assessors in 2013 which will assist in reducing the time taken for appeals where a medical assessment is required.</p><p> All these measures together will reduce the waiting time for appellants.</p><p>  Concern was expressed in the report that the higher number of summary decisions in 2011 indicated a move away from oral hearings. I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that the increases in the number of summary decisions in 2010 and 2011 was a result of having eight very experienced retired appeals officers working exclusively on summary decisions which had the effect of front loading summary decisions.    The percentage of summary decisions was 69% in 2010 and 65% in 2011, the two years for which the retired officers were retained, and has since dropped to 60% in 2012.</p><p>  In relation to consistency and transparency in decision making, this is addressed in a number of ways by the Department through training and communication and in relation specifically to the SWAO it is the statutory responsibility of the Chief Appeals Officer to convene meetings of Appeals Officers for the purpose of ensuring consistency.</p><p>  The Department provides funding to a number of agencies involved in providing advocacy and information services to persons regarding their social welfare rights and how to process its systems.</p></reply>

The sustainability of the pension system is a particular concern because of the demographic challenges Ireland faces, the associated increases in pension (and other age related) costs, and the deterioration in the public finances.  This means that, in the future, the task of financing increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population as demographic projections indicate the ratio of working age to older people will decrease from 5.3 to 1 at present to 2.1 to 1 by 2060.  Life expectancy in Ireland is also increasing and whilst this is very welcome development, it also presents very real and obvious public policy challenges. Compared to the rest of the population, older people in Ireland have the lowest poverty rates (at 0.9%)  and are least likely to be at risk of poverty (pointing to the adequacy of the State pension), nonetheless significant reform of our pensions systems are necessary to safeguard future sustainability and adequacy. </p><p>  A number of significant reforms to pensions have been introduced in recent years. In 2014, the State pension age will be standardised at 66 which will see the abolition of the State pension transition.  Thereafter State pension age will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  In September 2012, a number of changes to the State pension rate bands came into effect for new customers.  A move to a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo; for determining eligibility for the State pension is planned in 2020 to replace the current averaging system.  </p><p>  These reforms will ensure that the level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over the working life.  Aligning the rate of pension paid with the contribution made ensures that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions. </p><p>  Discussions on long term pension policy have identified the need for a short and focussed examination on the direction of pensions policy to ensure a modern, sustainable, and adequate pension system.  In this regard, the OECD has been commissioned by the Department of Social Protection to review long term pension policy in Ireland.  The review will take account of the Programme for Government commitments in the pensions area, including universal coverage, and is being informed by developments at EU level in relation to both pensions and increasing the labour market participation of older workers. </p><p>  The particular aspects being considered by the OECD include;</p><p>  - the sustainability of the pension system in the light of demographic and investment challenges;</p><p>  - the adequacy and coverage levels, in order to ensure adequate income in retirement with a particular focus on the lower and middle income group;</p><p>  - the modernity of pension systems to ensure flexibility in the labour market and supporting mechanisms for longer working;</p><p>  - equity within the pension system.</p><p>  The review is expected to be finalised in the first quarter of 2013. </p><p>  Significant developments have taken place in relation to defined benefit supplementary pensions.  Legislation enacted in 2012 strengthened the Funding Standard by introducing a requirement for schemes to develop a risk reserve from 2016 and to meet the reserve requirement in 2023.  In August 2012, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) announced details of the sale of over &euro;1billion of Irish Amortising Bonds which were purchased by pension schemes and welcomed pension funds into the economy.  Providers have also been introduced into the sovereign annuity market.   The overriding priority in this area is to ensure that members of pension schemes are protected and the future viability and sustainability of their schemes is ensured and made safer. </p><p>  Last October, the Department of Social Protection, working with the Central Bank and the Pensions Board, published a report on pension charges which looked at whether charges are reasonable and transparent to members.  I invited interested parties to submit comments and observations regarding the report in the period to the end of January 2013.  Comments and observations submitted will inform considerations in relation to any further policy or regulatory action that may be required. </p></reply>

The timescale for determining applications for rent and mortgage interest supplements is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements etc. In addition, some aspects of the application are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where investigations such as home visits or third party evidence are required. Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.</p><p>  Statistics are not available on the length of time taken to assess rent and mortgage interest supplement applications or the number of applications awaiting a decision. However, the average time to award a claim under the various supplementary welfare allowance schemes, including rent and mortgage interest supplement, is one week. The provision of a prompt service is a major objective for the Department&rsquo;s staff dealing with rent and mortgage interest supplement applications. This is tempered by the necessity to ensure that every case is fully investigated and that all cases are dealt with in a consistent and fair manner.  I am satisfied that the Department&rsquo;s staff dealing with these applications make every effort to ensure rent and mortgage interest supplement claims are processed in an efficient manner.</p></reply>

It is targeted at individuals who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments (Jobseekers Allowance/Jobseekers Benefit/One Parent Family Payment/Disability Allowance) or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months (78 Days).  The JobBridge Scheme has made significant progress to-date since it came into operation on 1 July, 2011. 14,149 internships had commenced by 31st January, 2013, with 5,565 participants on an internship and 1,909 opportunities advertised on <font color="#5291EF"> </font>  on that date.</p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the feedback to date has been very positive. In particular, the interim evaluation of JobBridge conducted by Indecon International Economic Consultants (published on 5 October, 2012) states that 61% of JobBridge finishers progressed into employment with either their host organisation or another employer within 5 months of finishing their internship. These progression rates compare very favourably with European averages in this area. Given that, in the past, some labour market programmes have been seen as having insignificant or even negative impacts on employment probabilities, this suggests JobBridge is an appropriate labour market intervention.</p><p>  Further information on outcomes will be ascertained as a result of the ongoing formal evaluation of JobBridge. It is anticipated that the final evaluation report will be available in the coming weeks. This evaluation will assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge Scheme, it will provide details of the nature of the work experience of the participants; a measurement of the relevance of that experience to the labour market, analysis of age categories and further findings concerning progression into employment. It will also present recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved and it is at that stage that further consideration will be given to amending the terms and conditions of the Scheme. Any such amendments to the scheme will be notified <i>via</i>  the website.</p></reply>

Such property includes houses and premises which are owned by a claimant, including property which they have inherited, and which the claimant may or may not be put to commercial use.  However, it does not include property such as the home in which the claimant resides or, for example, a premises used by the claimant in carrying out a business. </p><p>  For assessment purposes, the current market value of the property is established as well as the amount of any outstanding mortgages on that property.  The balance (market value less outstanding mortgage) is assessed by reference to a formula.  Where the current market value is less than the outstanding mortgage, no assessment is made.   The current market value of a property is the best estimate of what would be achievable if the property was offered for sale. Such an estimate will have regard to reductions in prices over recent years. Given that background, I have no plans to change the assessment of property for the purposes of means tested social assistance schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.</p></reply>

The decision to increase State pension age was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.  The standardisation of State pension age to age 66 is one of the measures planned which aims to improve the sustainability of the Irish pension system. As provided for in legislation, State pension age will further increase to age 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  These changes were provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011. Estimates at that time indicated that the gross estimated savings in 2014 were expected to be in the region of  &euro;33 million with a full year savings in 2015 of approximately &euro;65 million. These savings take into account claimants who would instead receive various other social welfare payments, including jobseeker benefits.</p></reply>

According to the records of the Department, she has a total of 303 full-rate paid contributions and 26 credited contributions from 1971 to 2012. She does not therefore satisfy the minimum paid contributions condition. Additionally, her overall record yields a yearly average of 8 only, which is insufficient to satisfy the qualifying conditions for State pension (contributory). Accordingly her pension claim was disallowed and she was notified of this decision on 18 June 2012.</p><p>  A social welfare inspector is currently investigating the employment of the person concerned from September 1968 to November 1970. The Department has no contributions recorded for this period. On completion of this investigation, if it is considered that additional contributions should be allocated to the person&rsquo;s insurance record, her entitlement to the State pension (contributory) will be re-examined. However, it is unlikely that an additional three years&rsquo; contributions will be sufficient to enable the person concerned to qualify for a State pension (contributory).  The person concerned has been advised that if she has had any additional insurable employment period(s) in Ireland not already notified that she wishes to bring to the Department&rsquo;s attention, these will also be considered.</p></reply>

The current average time taken to process jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance appeals decided by summary decision is 21.5 weeks and 28.5 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing.  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.</p><p>  Significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, improving business processes and implementing a new operating model.</p><p> - The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012 (There were 32,558 appeals finalised in 2012).</p><p> - There is a major programme of process redesign and modernisation currently underway in relation to many scheme areas which will reduce backlogs and will also reduce the time taken for the Department to respond to requests from the SWAO for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p> - It is planned to recruit additional Medical Assessors in 2013.</p><p>  All these measures together will reduce the waiting time for appellants.  However, by its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial process, the processing of appeals takes time even at the best of times and reflects the fact that while every effort is made to deal with appeals as fast as possible this cannot be at the expense of fairness of due process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-05a.862.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020500065#WRO01000"><p>I should state at the outset that it is important that, as a Government, we are committed to protecting and supporting the most vulnerable sectors of Irish society &ndash; through income and employment supports and through the provision of quality services. However, the steady increase in the numbers availing of illness and disability related income supports is clearly a matter for concern, in view of the fact that my Department will spend over &euro;2.5 billion in this area in 2013.</p><p>  I am satisfied that there is little basis for suggesting that the rise in the numbers can be attributed to any easing of access to illness and disability-related income support schemes - beyond some minor changes to the means-test associated with disability allowance scheme and the extension of entitlement to that payment to persons resident in institutions, the medical criteria governing entitlement to illness and disability related schemes have not been changed - but it has been evident to me since coming into office that a greater focus is required on addressing the drift from short-term illness into long-term disability.  </p><p>  The capping of entitlement to Illness Benefit to a maximum of two years, a measure introduced in 2009, was an important step in this regard.  The impact of this measure is not reflected in the data cited in the article referred to by the Deputy which relies largely on data from 2010.  Measures such as the Renaissance project, which provides for intervention by the Medical Assessors in my Department in cases of lower back pain, are also proving effective at encouraging people to return to work and this approach has been extended to claimants presenting with mild anxiety and depression. </p><p>  More generally, it is my belief that for all claimants, the welfare system must always have a strong focus on activation and employment where that is a feasible option.  The partial capacity benefit scheme, which I introduced in 2012, enables claimants of invalidity pension and illness benefit to take up some work while continuing to receive income support from the State. Similarly, the earnings disregard available under the disability allowance scheme is designed to facilitate claimants of that payment to avail of employment opportunities. My Department also funds the EmployAbility service, which provides a dedicated job-coaching service for people with disabilities as well as providing a range of supports to employers who employ people with disabilities. Finally, I should mention also that I was pleased to announce recently the allocation of over &euro;7 million to 14 projects across the Border Midlands and West (BMW) region as part of the Disability Activation Project (DACT). These projects will run until early 2015. The DACT Project is jointly funded by the European Social Fund and my Department and addresses four strands: (i) Improving Access to Employment, (ii) Progression Programmes for Young People, (iii) Support for Progression and Retention of People with an Acquired Disability&rsquo; and (iv) Innovative Employer Initiatives. These projects will, I am confident, provide invaluable guidance and learning on how best to ensure that the untapped potential of people with disabilities is allowed to flourish and that they are enabled to participate fully in the labour market. They reflect also my key objectives as Minister for Social Protection which are to ensure that those in most need of the support of the Department are protected and that we do everything possible to get people back to work.</p></reply>

The Part-Time Job Incentive Scheme (PTJI) is intended as a stepping stone into full-time work.  It allows long-term unemployed people to take up part-time work and get a special weekly allowance instead of their jobseeker&#8217;s payment.  <font color="#2F2F2F">The Department also operates a fast-tracking system for people who sign off a jobseeker's payment to take up work for short periods.

The payment preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he/she was unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments. To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with - or is in a family which is supported by - him/her.</p></reply>

The estimated expenditure on child benefit in 2013 is around &euro;1.9 billion and it is currently paid to around 609,000 families in respect of some 1.16 million children. </p><p>  The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, can be an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. The social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment. Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation.</p><p>  Issues relating to changes in taxation policy are primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  However I can confirm that the Government has not announced any plans to implement means-testing or taxing child benefit at this time. Neither taxing child benefit nor means testing the payment are simple solutions as there is a range of policy, legal and operational issues that would have to be addressed if a decision was made to proceed along the lines of either approach. In terms of means testing there would be a need to ensure that systems are in place to ensure that households only claimed benefits to which they were entitled, as the scale of means testing approximately 600,000 families would be significantly greater than anything required by the current social protection system in terms of means tested payment. In terms of taxing the payment there are questions relating to the ownership of the benefit and the effects of taxing the payments in the context of the treatment of married and co-habiting couples. Both approaches would also require major development work to enhance Department of Social Protection and Revenue systems.</p><p>  On a more general level, achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness and efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established in 2011 an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will be published in the near future. Given that the issues involved in this area are quite complex further consideration will be required as to how reform in this area might be progressed.</p></reply>

However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as the flooding of November 2009, October 2011 and June 2012. </p><p>  A humanitarian aid scheme was approved by Government in response to these floods. The humanitarian aid scheme, which is means tested, is available to people whose homes were damaged in the flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair as a result of the flooding damage. Payments issued to householders affected by these floods as follows:</p><p>-Following the 2009 flooding, 2,100 payments were made at a value of approximately &#8364;1 million during 2010.<b></b>  The majority of these payments were made in counties Galway and Roscommon.</p><p>-  The counties mainly affected by the autumn 2011 flooding were Dublin and Monaghan. Payments to the value of &#8364;920,177 have been paid to date in respect of 978 claims in Dublin and &#8364;28,767 in respect of 46 claims in Monaghan.  The total paid during 2011 in respect of these counties was approximately &#8364;359,000.</p><p>-  Following the June 2012 flooding, over 119 payments have being made to affected householders in the Cork area to the value of &#8364;128,894. </p><p>  Total payments to the value of approximately &#8364;807,200 were made in 2012 under the humanitarian aid scheme. In January 2013, approximately &#8364;38,200 was paid under the scheme in respect of 22 claims, of which over &#8364;30,000 was paid in Dublin and over &#8364;7,200 in Galway. </p><p>  With regard to my future plans for this scheme, the Department has received sanction, up to a maximum allocation of &#8364;10 million, to provide for the activation of the scheme in any future cases affected by severe flooding thereby ensuring immediate supports.</p></reply>

In the form proposed by the Commission, the Recommendation would be for Member States to ensure that all young people receive a quality offer of employment, continuing education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.</p><p>  To be adopted, the Recommendation has to be agreed by the Member States.  The process of negotiation on the Recommendation is currently under way, and the Irish Presidency has indicated our intention to have the agreed Recommendation adopted at the Council of relevant ministers at the end of February, and by the European Council before the end of our Presidency. </p><p>  The main issues under discussion in the negotiations relate to the identification of the target group of young people, to the length of the period within which a guarantee would apply, the types of measure that would qualify as meeting the guarantee, and the question of flexibility for Member States with particularly high levels of youth unemployment and/or particularly difficult circumstances in relation to their public finances.</p><p>  When an agreed Recommendation has been adopted, the Government will review existing policies related to youth unemployment and identify the measures that will be required for the implementation of the guarantee.</p><p>  With respect to the question of obtaining funding from the European Social Fund (ESF), in 2012 the European Council concluded that Youth Guarantee measures can be supported by the ESF. However, as of now there are no proposals to provide <i>additional</i>   ESF funds specifically for this purpose; funds devoted to measures related to a Youth Guarantee would therefore have to be diverted from other policy areas.</p></reply>

The pension remains payable while you remain widowed or a surviving civil partner. Section 124 (3) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, states that &#8220;a widow shall be disqualified from receiving a pension if and so long as he or she and any person are cohabiting as husband and wife&#8221;.

In the context of the insurance based schemes which provide for contingencies such as bereavement, it is important that the payments such as the widow&#8217;s, widower&#8217;s or surviving civil partner&#8217;s contributory pension should cease when the contingency has ceased.</p><p>  The EEC Equality Directive 79/9 and the subsequent Supreme Court case (<i>Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare, 1989</i>  ) led to the change in the treatment of non-married cohabiting couples in the social welfare code.  The Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</p></reply>

The package is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  The package is currently paid to over 415,000 customers and will cost an estimated &euro;284 million in 2013.</p><p>The fuel allowance is a means tested weekly payment of &euro;20 available for people on long term welfare schemes, including State pension, disability allowance, one-parent family payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (after 15 months); it is currently paid for 26 weeks from October to April each year. The scheme is available to approximately 400,000 customers and will cost an estimated &euro;211 million in 2013.</p><p>I am aware that any reduction in social welfare payments or benefits is difficult.  I also appreciate the important role that the household benefits package and fuel allowance scheme play in promoting social inclusion and preventing isolation of older people and people with disabilities. However, to allow the Government to protect the core payments which people receive such as pensions, disability payments and carer&rsquo;s allowance, we had to look very carefully at other additional payments such as the household benefits package.</p><p>It should be noted that Ireland&rsquo;s older population has the lowest rate of consistent poverty and, as a group compared to the rest of the population, are least likely to be at risk of poverty - pointing to the adequacy and importance of the State pension.  Between 2004 and 2010, consistent poverty for older people (those over 65) fell from 3.3% to 0.9%.  The &ldquo;at risk of poverty&rdquo; rate for people in that age group fell from 27.1% to 9.6% over the same period.</p><p>The Government committed itself in the Programme for Government to protect welfare rates. These weekly welfare rates were maintained in Budgets 2012 and 2013. All of the schemes operated by my Department, including the household benefits package and fuel allowance are kept under review given the on-going need for savings and to target expenditure at those most in need.</p><p>The following changes were made to the household benefits package and fuel allowance scheme since January 2010 starting with the most recent changes introduced in Budget 2013:</p><p><i>Budget 2013</i></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">-  Electricity allowance restructured and now based on the average best rate (minus the PSO) available for 150 units per month from Electric Ireland, Bord Gais Eireann and Airtricity. The new rate for both the electricity and gas allowances is &euro;35 per month. The change is effective from January 2013 and will generate savings of approximately &euro;37.6 million in a full year.</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">-  Telephone allowance reduced from &euro;22.50 to &euro;9.50 per month. This change is effective from January 2013 and will generate savings of approximately &euro;61 million in a full year.</div></p><p><i>Budget 2012 </i></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">-  New applicants for carer&rsquo;s allowance, who are not living with the person for whom they are providing care, are not be entitled to household benefits. The person receiving care may be entitled to household benefits in their own right.  This change was effective from April 2012.</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">-  Duration of the fuel season reduced by six weeks, from 32 to 26 weeks for fuel allowance recipients.</div></p><p><i>Budget 2011</i></p><p>Changes were made to the household benefits package and fuel allowance scheme during 2011. These changes were provided for in Budget 2011 but not specified at the time.</p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">-  The number of free units provided under the electricity and gas allowance was reduced to the level at the start of 2007 (from 2,400 to 1,800).  This change was effective from September 2011.</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">-  The telephone allowance was reduced to &euro;22.22 per month (from &euro;25.91 per month). However customers would continue to receive &euro;26.86 of value on their bills, at a cost to the State of &euro;22.22 per month. This change was effective from September 2011.</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">-  The smokeless allowance (additional &euro;3.90 per week) payable to some recipients was abolished and one standardised fuel allowance (&euro;20 per week) was available for all qualifying customers. This change was effective from September 2011.</div></p><p><i>Budget 2010</i></p><p>There were no changes to the household benefits package or fuel allowance scheme in 2010.</p><p>The change to the electricity and gas elements of the household benefits package in Budget 2013 will bring significant savings while aiming to encourage customers to achieve better savings through greater mobility.  The cost of the electricity and gas allowances has risen from &euro;110 million in 2005 to an estimated outturn of &euro;201 million in 2012, an increase of 83% over seven years.  In the current economic climate these increases were unsustainable.</p><p>The Affordable Energy Strategy drew attention to the fact that customers in receipt of household benefits were much less likely than other customers to switch energy supplier to obtain better value. Only 16% of social welfare customers have switched companies compared to 42% nationally.  There will also be some administrative efficiency through simplification of the scheme with one payment rate instead of five.</p><p>The change to the telephone allowance is a cost saving measure. The numbers in receipt of the telephone allowance has also increased significantly in recent years, while the nature of the telephone market has been transformed with deregulation, mobile services and bundled services including television, broadband and telephone.  There is a wide variety of deals available, for example, it is possible to get a standard pay-as-you-go brand name mobile telephone for as little as &euro;19.99 in large retailers.</p><p>The smokeless fuel allowance of &euro;3.90 per week was abolished from September 2011. This allowance was first introduced to lessen opposition to a ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal and to compensate people in receipt of fuel allowance who were living in coal ban areas for the anticipated higher cost of smokeless fuel.  The ban applied in sixteen towns and cities around the country (Dublin from 1990, Cork 1995, Arklow, Drogheda, Dundalk, Limerick and Wexford 1998, Celbridge, Galway, Leixlip, Naas and Waterford 2000, Bray, Kilkenny, Sligo and Tralee 2003).</p><p>The rationale for paying this allowance to customers in smokeless areas could not be maintained as the price differential between smoky and smokeless coal has dropped considerably over the years and is now as low as 2%, significantly less than the 20% supplement which the smokeless allowance represented.  Smokeless fuel is also much more energy efficient than conventional coal, more than offsetting any increase in cost. Research indicates that the efficiency gain can be up to 50%.  People were being compensated unnecessarily. Therefore, the smokeless allowance was abolished with a standardised fuel allowance &euro;20 per week for all recipients.</p><p>In 2005 there were 265,000 customers in receipt of Fuel Allowance; in 2011 there were 390,000, an increase of almost 50% over six years.  Of these, 147,000 recipients (38%) qualified for the additional smokeless allowance at a cost of &euro;18.7 million for 32 weeks.</p><p>The fuel allowance scheme was envisaged as a way of providing some additional support for those on long-term welfare payments during the winter season. Budget 2012 reduced the duration of the fuel allowance by 6 weeks from 32 weeks to 26. However, in paying the allowance for 26 weeks my Department is still providing a fuel support for half of the year and is covering the coldest months of the year from October to April.</p><p>The tables below outline the impact of the changes to the household benefits scheme and fuel allowance at an individual level.</p><p><b>Table 1: Impact of Budget Changes 2011 &ndash; 2013 &ndash; Household Benefits Package</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Electricity Allowance</th><th>Gas Allowance</th></tr><tr><td>From 1 September 2011 &#8211; allowance on bills adjusted from 400 units every two months to 300 units every two months.

Eligibility condition in respect of both initiatives can be accessed online or by making enquiries at the network of Social Protection offices nationally.  The Deputy may wish to note that a person who has completed four years on community employment will have exhausted their participation opportunities until they reach the age of 55. </p><p>  Eligibility on T&uacute;s, the community work placement initiative, is confined to those on the live register.  Persons with a disability are defined as one of the target group under the community services programme, however, the Deputy should note that the Department has no roles in the recruitment functions for organisations in receipt of a contract under this programme other than providing guidance.</p><p>  A number of practical supports and allowances are available to employers to proactively assist the participation of people with a disability in the workforce.  Funding can be provided to employers who wish to retain an employee who has acquired an impairment or illness and to employ a person with a disability.  The Department also funds the EmployAbility service nationwide, which is designed to enable jobseekers with a disability to secure open labour market employment with the assistance of tailored individual supports provided by job coaches.  Details are available on my Department&#8217;s website &#8211; .</p><p>  The focus of the new initiative which my Department plans with local authorities and which was announced in the recent Budget will focus on those on the live register for a significant time without engagement in training, education or work.  It is unlikely to provide for persons with a disability given other opportunities open to that cohort.  Development work on this new initiative is advancing with the aim of launching a number of pilot schemes to be commenced in the coming weeks to inform the design process.</p></reply>

Some 26% of this, amounting to approximately &euro;11.2m., was expended in December as follows:</p><p>  Arts, Culture and Film 				&euro;3.5m</p><p>  Heritage 					&euro;3.9m</p><p>  Irish Language, Gaeltacht and Islands     	&euro;3.8m</p><p>  These expenditure figures are provisional and are subject to verification by the Comptroller and Auditor General. </p><p>  The spending profile expected over the course of the year is set out at the beginning of each year, based on the best estimate that can be made at that time regarding the delivery timeframes and associated payment milestones for the full range of programmes concerned.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the actual pattern of spending that eventually occurs will usually show some variance from an estimate of this nature, for various reasons related to the particular projects concerned.  In the event, it transpired that the actual level of spending in December 2012 was &euro;3.7m. higher than was forecast at the beginning of the year.</p><p>  I would point out that my Department's total expenditure in 2012 at &euro;41.6m represents 97% of the actual allocation for the year.  &euro;1.2m. of the balance of &euro;1.4m. related to subhead B.5 Natural Heritage (National Parks and Wildlife Service) and was identified for carryover into 2013 via the deferred surrender of unspent capital mechanism.  The remaining &euro;200k in savings were achieved against the Department&rsquo;s own Administrative Budget. </p><p>  When account is taken of the capital carryover, approximately 100% of the capital programme allocation for 2012 will have been spent.  This underlines my commitment to ensuring that the maximum value is derived from my Department's budget in terms of maintaining, promoting and protecting Ireland&rsquo;s heritage and culture, developing cultural tourism, advancing the use of the Irish language and supporting the sustainable development of the islands.</p></reply>

This was in keeping with the recommendations of Justice Quirke following the Peatlands Forum and with the motion agreed unanimously by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 7 March 2012.</p><p>  The proposed approach to the development of the National Plan is available on my Department&#8217;s website at   . The Plan will provide for the long-term protection of Ireland&#8217;s raised bog SACs, will address the needs of turf-cutters and can unlock the flexibility available for dealing with the most difficult of bogs, within the terms of the Habitats Directive. </p><p>  Following a request for tenders, my Department is currently assessing proposals from prospective teams of consultants who will undertake the necessary scientific work to inform the future restoration and management of each of the SACs.  Draft proposals for each of the sites will be discussed with affected land-owners as part of this process. </p><p>  The detailed exploration of relocation sites is a key element in progressing the National Plan. In collaboration with the Peatlands Council, and with the assistance of Bord na M&oacute;na, my Department is actively engaging with turf cutting communities to consider how relocation can be progressed. </p><p>  Some 766 applicants for compensation to my Department have indicated an interest in relocation.  Arrangements for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs have been finalised, or are close to finalisation, for groups from 4 raised bog SACs. Out of the remaining 49 raised bog SACs, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 31 SACs and work is ongoing on investigating these sites. Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 15 raised bog SACs due, for example, to the small number of turf cutters that have been active on these sites. Options for the remaining sites are also being investigated.</p><p>  If, following an in-depth examination, there are a small number of SACs where there are genuinely no alternatives in terms of relocation, the National Plan may be able to provide some flexibility in this regard.  I hope that the Plan can be completed by November, in time to submit an application to the European Commission under Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, if required, prior to the 2014 cutting season. </p><p>  My Department has stepped up contact with turf-cutting groups to seek long-term resolutions to the issues for their particular bogs, in compliance with EU and national law. The engagement and agreement of turf-cutting communities to its proposed approaches will be essential to meeting this timeline and to unlocking the potential flexibility it offers.</p><p>  Officials of my Department have been in continuous contact with the organisation referred to by the Deputy over the past year and have met with members of the organisation on several occasions.  My Department is currently awaiting a report from Bord na M&oacute;na on the feasibility of using the specific relocation site mentioned by the Deputy to accommodate turf-cutters from the nearby SAC.  It will be discussed with the local committee once it has been received. My Department expects to receive this report within the next few weeks.</p></reply>

The Commission was appointed by me in July 2011 and its Report was published in January 2012.  The Report is available on my Department&#8217;s website: <font color="#0000FF">.</font>  This Report was subsequently considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture and the outcome of their deliberations was published in June 2012 on the Oireachtas website:   .</p><p>  EirGrid is fully committed to public consultation with local communities and all stakeholders on its transmission network development projects.</p><p>  In keeping with best international practice EirGrid will undertake regular reviews at all key stages of the project to test key technology assumptions.  This will take account of potential advances in technology.</p><p>  The Government wants to give a strong consistent message to Irish business and multinationals, and our citizens, that Ireland&#8217;s electricity networks are robust, modern comprehensive and safe.  The investment programmes of EirGrid are critical to ensuring that the national energy infrastructure is maintained and built cost effectively to the highest standards and with full regard for environmental, safety and health requirements and the needs of local communities.</p><p>The strategic and economic importance of investment in networks and energy infrastructure was emphasised in the &#8216;Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure&#8217;, published in July 2012, which is available on my Department&#8217;s website: </p><p>  The North-South transmission line is vital infrastructure for the island.  The lack of sufficient interconnection between the North and South is preventing the full benefits of the all-island market being realised for consumers.  The continued absence of the transmission line is costing the economies and consumers, North and South, up to &#8364;30 million every year, since without it, the electricity system is more inefficient from an operational perspective.  I understand from EirGrid that it is undertaking design work on the North South transmission line with a view to submitting the project to planning before the end of the year.  To date, every single affected landowner has been given the opportunity to participate in the consultation process.  EirGrid will also conduct new consultation with landowners and the general public before finalising its application for planning approval.</p><p>  Completion of the North South project will further consolidate the all-island electricity market established in 2007, providing for the seamless transfer of electricity across the island, delivering greater competition, reducing the need for further investment in thermal generation and ensuring the availability of low cost generation to the market.</p></reply>

The scheme is delivered through a combination of SEAI-appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors, in order to ensure national coverage and via an area-based approach.  Measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation and are free of charge to the customer.</p><p>The Scheme is an important element of the Affordable Energy Strategy that was launched in November 2011.  The energy efficiency measures are targeted at low income families and will make a lasting impact on households experiencing energy poverty.  Exchequer funding of over &euro;101 million has been allocated to the programme since 2000, which has successfully delivered energy efficiency measures to 92,563 homes.  In 2011 the scheme delivered energy efficiency measures to 20,388 homes experiencing energy poverty while in 2012 the programme delivered energy saving measures to 12,175 homes.  Despite the current economic challenges, the Government is committed to continuing to deliver energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme has been allocated Exchequer funding of &euro;20 million for 2013, and according to the most up to date analysis available, it is anticipated that the scheme will deliver upgrades to approximately 12,000 homes this year.</p><p>Following is the information requested regarding the number of applications received, approved and declined under the Better Energy Warmer homes scheme in 2011 and 2012.

This will determine whether it is beneficial for both countries to enter into an Inter-Governmental Agreement under the Renewable Energy Directive to provide for renewable energy trading. </p><p>  If an Inter-Governmental Agreement is entered into, there are potential significant employment opportunities.  As an example, employment creation arising from a 3,000MW project would be expected to be in the order of 3,000 to 6,000 job years in the construction phase, with the actual number dependent on the construction schedule to 2020.  There would also be additional jobs created in the on-going maintenance of turbines over a 20-year operating life.  Further employment opportunities could arise if turbines or components were to be manufactured in Ireland.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-05a.1060.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020500068#WRR04200"><p>The Programme for Government commits to examining the role and collection of the TV licence fee in light of existing and projected convergence of technologies and to transforming the TV licence into a household based Public Broadcasting Charge to be applied to all eligible households and applicable businesses, regardless of the device used to access content or services.</p><p>  In line with this commitment, my Department is involved in the ongoing analyses and policy development work that is necessary in advance of the implementation of any changes that may be required.</p><p>  Although subject to a degree of evasion, the existing TV licence fee system has provided a stable funding base for our public service broadcasters.  The rationale for providing State funding for public service broadcasting is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their public service objects while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence.  This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.</p><p>  The overall aim of Public Service Broadcasting is to provide services and content which cater for all interests in society, while ensuring that the varied elements of Irish culture and its intrinsic values are protected.  Through the obligations placed on the Public Service Broadcasters, which are established in legislation passed by the Oireachtas, and the criteria set for the funding of content through the Sound &amp; Vision Scheme, the production of quality indigenous programming and the production of minority interest programming is strongly promoted.</p><p>  Whatever the system of funding, the rationale for providing funding will continue to apply and any changes that may be implemented must continue to provide a secure funding base for public service broadcasting and content.</p><p>  It is also important, of course, that any changes to the system of funding should take account of the reality of new mechanisms to access such content and services and the pervasiveness of such content in today&rsquo;s society. </p><p>  Publicly-funded public service broadcasting and content are now available to everyone on an ever-increasing range of platforms and devices (radio, television, smart phone, pc, laptop and many other devices) and, in fact, access is not dependent on the ownership of a device.  In short, everyone benefits from the availability of these services, regardless of how content is accessed or relayed to the public, and, therefore, it is my view that the cost should be borne by society as a whole.  That said, I would like to make clear at this point that, while the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to a &ldquo;content licence system&rdquo;, the charge will not relate to the amount or type of content accessed by any one individual: it will be a charge that will be applied across all eligible households and businesses, the proceeds of which will be used to fund public service broadcasting and content.</p><p>  The replacement of the existing funding system based on the collection of television licence fees with one based on the imposition of device-independent charge on eligible households and businesses is a complex process and much of the detail has yet to be worked out.</p><p>  This includes identifying the most appropriate method for collecting the charge and the manner in which issues such as exemptions and enforcement should be dealt with. In this regard, my Department is currently carrying out a Value for Money Policy Review conducted by an independently chaired group on the proposed policy.  I would expect to receive a copy of the group&rsquo;s recommendations and report for my consideration by the end of quarter 1 2013.</p><p>  At this point, however, I can state that it is my intention that the charge, which will be device independent, will replace the current licence fee and all households and businesses will be subject to the charge, except for those that are specifically exempted.</p><p>  In regard to the issue of exemptions under any new system, this will have to be given detailed consideration when the type of model to be developed is agreed.  That said, it is my expectation that the current exemptions in relation to pensioners and those entitled to the Household Benefit Package will continue to apply.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the contract which my Department has in place with &ldquo;3&rdquo;, the NBS service provider, the NBS mobile wireless service currently offers minimum download and upload speeds of 2.3Mbps and 1.4Mbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 18:1.  The NBS satellite service, which is utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, offers minimum download and upload speeds of 3.6Mbps and 384 kbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 48:1.</p><p>  As regards service quality, my Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on &ldquo;3&rdquo;, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.  The NBS contract also provides that where NBS customers do not receive the minimum guaranteed service, as set out in the terms and conditions of their contract, they are entitled to service rebates.</p><p>  My Department liaises very closely with &ldquo;3&rdquo; to ensure that any issues relating to service performance, which are brought to its attention, are addressed as quickly as possible.  In the case of the person referred to by the Deputy, my officials had already, on receipt of earlier representations on his behalf, been in contact with &ldquo;3&rdquo; to assist in resolving his performance issues with his NBS mobile wireless service.  Likewise, my officials have been in direct contact with the customer in the matter.</p><p>  In this case, I understand that the customer was provided with an additional piece of equipment in order to boost the signal to his home and a review of his customer user experience across the NBS network found it to be performing within the contractually agreed specifications of the Scheme.  I have been informed that the customer to whom the Deputy refers has elected to use a different service provider and I regret that this customer&rsquo;s experience of the NBS was not to his satisfaction.</p><p>  While my Department has previously dealt with a small number of individual complaints from NBS customers in County Kerry there is no evidence to suggest widespread poor quality performance in the area.  Such a scenario would be of major concern to me.</p><p>  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government is committed to the provision of high speed broadband to all citizens and businesses across Ireland through a combination of public and private sector investment, which is set out in its National Broadband Plan.  The Plan commits to the provision of at least 30Mpbs connectivity to all parts of Ireland, including all areas within County Kerry.</p></reply>

This will determine whether it is beneficial for both countries to enter into an Inter-Governmental Agreement under the Renewable Energy Directive to provide for renewable energy trading.  If an Inter-Governmental Agreement is entered into, there are potential significant employment opportunities.  As an example, employment creation arising from a 3,000MW project would be expected to be in the order of 3,000 to 6,000 job years in the construction phase, with the actual number dependent on the construction schedule to 2020.  There would also be additional jobs created in the ongoing maintenance of turbines over a 20-year operating life.  Further employment opportunities could arise if turbines or components were to be manufactured in Ireland.  All relevant State agencies, particularly in the enterprise area, would have to coordinate their activities early in the process to ensure employment potential of export projects is maximised.  This opportunity has already been identified by the Industrial Development Authority and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technology growth strategies.  The amount of energy to be procured by the United Kingdom and the mechanisms for sharing the resultant economic benefits, including an appropriate return to the Exchequer, are matters to be addressed in the coming year, and ahead of signing a potential Inter-Governmental Agreement, which would have to ensure no financial cost or risk to the Irish State or consumer.</p><p>  Since taking up my position as Minister for Communications, Energy, and Natural Resources, I have been meeting with companies and individuals involved in the development of renewable energy on an on-going basis.  That includes several developers who have made presentations and discussed their ideas for the development of renewable energy projects for export.  In terms of our negotiations with the UK, we have not yet determined or agreed the selection process for potential joint projects, which will be a further matter to be discussed and negotiated in the coming year.  Any such selection process will, of course, be open and transparent.  Any new wind turbines that may be built will be subject to the Planning Acts, including the requirements for public consultation.</p></reply>

This was part of a climate and energy package, aimed at responding to the detrimental effects of climate change as well as improving energy sustainability and security.  Following on from this, a series of Directives were negotiated, including a specific Renewable Energy Directive, which assigned individual legally binding targets to each Member State in order that the EU target for 20% renewable energy in consumption by 2020 could be attained.  All member states in the EU agreed that in order to improve energy security of supply and to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels, in addition to reducing greenhouse gases in energy production, it was necessary to make a significant shift towards renewable energy.</p><p>  Under the Directive, Ireland is required to increase renewable energy from 3.1% in 2005 to 16% in 2020, with a minimum target of 10% in the transport sector.  Energy is consumed across the transport, heating and electricity sectors.  At end 2012, we had reached 6.4% of overall energy consumption from renewable sources.  Our intention is to reach our overall target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heat, which together amount to 16% of all energy consumption.  Under the Directive, Ireland was required to set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) the trajectory towards meeting its legally binding target.  The NREAP and the First Progress Report on the NREAP, which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, show the sectoral and technology breakdown that we anticipate in the achievement of our target.  Wind generated electricity is expected to play a major role.  At end 2012, approximately 17.3% of our electricity consumption was from renewable sources.</p></reply>

My Department continues to be responsible for a range of programmes and initiatives to support communities including the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).  The objective of the LCDP is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government, and its agencies, and people in disadvantaged communities.  It is a key tool of Government in providing supports for the 'harder to reach' in the most disadvantaged areas in society.  The Programme is managed by Pobal on behalf of my Department and is delivered at a local level by the nationwide network of Local Development Companies (LDCs). Some &euro;49 million will be invested in our communities through the Programme in 2013.  LDCs promote and actively pursue social inclusion policies, through which all people within a community can be supported and encouraged to participate in the life of their community.  Sustainable social, economic and cultural development for all members of the community is more likely to be achieved by fostering social inclusion and equality.</p><p>  The focus of the work of the LDCs is on marginalised groups and/or disadvantaged areas, groups and individuals who live in geographical communities, or communities of interest, experiencing high levels of poverty and social exclusion.  The LCDP identifies Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People (LGBT) as a group experiencing inequality and discrimination, and recognises that where this combines with other factors it can result in multiple disadvantage and social exclusion.  While the LCDP is not specifically aimed at this group, the Programme works to achieve full equality and inclusion for LGBT in Ireland, and protection from all forms of discrimination.  In 2009, the Local and Community Development Division collaborated, in conjunction with the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network (GLEN), the Family Support Agency and Pobal, on the development of a Code of Practice for Community Development Projects, Family Resource Centres and Urban Partnership/Integrated Companies supporting LGBT Communities.  Funding was also provided towards the launch and publication of the Code of Practice.  This Code of Practice went a long way towards promoting awareness and understanding of LGBT through the LCDP and other social inclusion programmes.  Furthermore, as examples of assistance provided under the LCDP:</p><p>- County Kildare Leader Partnership supported the establishment of a LGBT Group in Kildare, and the opening of a drop-in service;</p><p>- An inter-agency action supports the delivery of an LGBT Youth Drop-in Project located in Wexford and Gorey - this is a long-term preventative action, aimed at reducing the incidence and impact of homophobic bullying in post-primary schools thereby reducing early school leaving and/or poor educational attainment; and the</p><p>- Galway Rural Development Company was involved in research with GLEN which identified the need for supports for LGBT groups in County Galway.  The company now supports LGBT groups in County Galway through funding programmes that assist in the network and collaboration of various agencies.</p></reply>

The following table gives a breakdown of capital expenditure of some &euro;308m across the relevant programme areas in December 2012:</p><p><b>Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</b> <b>Capital Expenditure - December 2012</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Programme</b></th><th><b>&#8364;m</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>Housing</b></td><td>158.5 </td></tr><tr><td><b>Water Services</b></td><td>129 </td></tr><tr><td><b>Environment / Waste</b></td><td>2.5 </td></tr><tr><td><b>Local Government</b></td><td>7.5 </td></tr><tr><td><b>Community/ Other</b></td><td>10.5 </td></tr></table></p><p>The Estimates for Public Services 2013, published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, provide for carryover of &euro;43 million of capital funding from 2012 for use on my Department&rsquo;s programmes this year in the housing, environmental, local government and community areas.  In its management of capital programmes, my Department deals with applications for recoupment of expenditure as they are received from local authorities and other bodies, and makes the associated payments as they arise in the course of the year.  Capital expenditure on the relevant progammes has, however, tended to be incurred more towards the end of the year; this has been associated with, <i>inter alia</i>, the timing of the completion of work by contractors and of the certification of that work; use of annual planning processes in respect of some programmes; the timing of submission of applications for recoupment to the Department; and the need to address any issues arising on applications before payment is made.  In addition, adverse weather conditions in any year can delay progress and subsequent payment applications on many projects, particularly where groundworks and external finishing works are concerned.  The savings on capital expenditure in 2012 can be attributed<i>, inter alia</i>, to financial constraints on local authorities impacting on the progress of the water services programme and slower than anticipated project spend by Local Action (Leader) Groups under the Rural Development Programme.</p><p>As regards capital expenditure in 2013, a total of &euro;740 million (and the carryover amount of &euro;43 million brought forward from 2012) will be available for investment in a range of capital projects across the various programmes. Details of projects will be made available as part of ongoing programme management in the expenditure areas concerned.</p></reply>

This resulted in an increase in the EU co-financing rate from 55% to 85% for Ireland under Axes 3 and 4 elements of the RDP which came into effect on 1 January 2012. </p><p>  The change involves an increase in the co-financing rate to 85% for 2012 and 2013, without a concomitant increase in the amount of funding to be provided by the EU.  This resulted in a decrease in the overall funding available to the programme from an original &euro;427 million to an estimated &euro;314 million (&euro;252 million of which is estimated to be the project allocation) and also a readjustment of the levels of funding available under each of the RDP measures. </p><p>  The new co-financing rate applies to expenditure incurred in 2012 and 2013 only and the estimated programme complement of &euro;314 million has been calculated on that basis.  From 1 of January 2014 the co-financing rate will revert to 55% rate for any remaining unspent funding, which will necessitate a further revision of the programme complement at that time. On the basis of extrapolations from the annual levels of expenditure to date it is estimated that the final programme complement will be approximately &euro;370 million. </p><p>  In this context my Department is currently reviewing the levels of commitment and expenditure under each of the various measures of the RDP fully to assess the level of funding that remains for the various measures.  This review will be completed by the end of February, and it has required Local Development Companies to suspend their board approvals process for a short time only. This is necessary to ensure that each measure under the programme has the funding required to address eligible requests received by rural communities all over Ireland.  In this context this exercise is critical and it will be completed in the shortest possible timeframe. </p></reply>

It is a key tool of Government in providing supports for the &#8216;harder to reach&#8217; in the most disadvantaged areas in society. </p><p>  The Government&#8217;s commitment to enabling rural communities to become self sufficient has been reaffirmed this year through the increased funding it has provided to Axes 3 &amp; 4 (LEADER Axes) of the RDP. The funding available to the RDP has increased from &#8364;96m in 2012 to &#8364;105m for 2013. The LEADER approach ensures that communities are involved and have a say in their own development choices. In the vast majority of projects, the communities themselves apply for the funding under the Programme.</p><p>  My Department also implements a Scheme to Support National Organisations in the Community and Voluntary Sector. This Scheme provides multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services. Priority is given under this scheme to supporting national organisations which provide &#8216;coalface&#8217; services to disadvantaged target groups. Although this funding is for national organisations, these bodies work on the ground in local communities, for example Barnardos and the Simon Communities of Ireland. </p><p>Funding is also provided to various community and voluntary sector organisations for the purpose of promoting environmental awareness and participation in environmental activities. The LA21 Environmental Partnership Fund is designed to assist small scale, local, non-profit environmental projects aimed at increasing environmental awareness and developing sustainable communities.  Funding is provided to Environmental NGOs, directly and via the Irish Environmental Network, to assist their participation in environmental activities.  Funding is also provided to An Taisce to run the Green Schools Programme. </p><p>  Under my Department&#8217;s Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), funding of up to 100% of the approved cost is provided to approved voluntary housing bodies for the provision of accommodation for older people, people with an intellectual, physical or mental health disability, the homeless, returning emigrants and victims of domestic violence. The administration of the scheme, including the detailed appraisal of new projects and the certification that proposals comply with the terms and conditions of the scheme, is the responsibility of the relevant housing authority.  Funding is also allocated to housing authorities on an annual basis under the Social Housing Investment Programme and includes a provision to meet existing commitments for projects that are underway under CAS. </p><p>  I believe that all these initiatives and programmes combined will continue to enable communities to identify and address their own social and economic needs and allow them to work together to create vibrant and strong communities in Ireland. Compilation of the further detailed information requested in regard to terms and conditions attaching to all the many community programmes and schemes under my Department would involve an inordinate amount of staff time and cost which would not be warranted.

Failure by an owner or their agent to produce a BER certificate on demand may, if proceedings are initiated, result in a Class A fine or a term of imprisonment or both.</p><p>  While Ireland&rsquo;s Building Energy Rating system has been in place since 2006 and is well-established, it is anticipated that the requirement to advertise ratings which came into effect from 9 January 2013 will greatly assist compliance due to its visibility in the marketplace. In this regard, the new Regulations require a person, or agent, to state the energy performance indicator of the current Building Energy Rating (BER) certificate for the building in any advertisements, including newspaper notices, web-based notices, leaflets and other notices.</p><p>  My Department also continues to work closely with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (who are the issuing authority tasked with the day to day administration of the BER system) to promote awareness of the BER system and to guide and assist individuals, property agents and industry in general in meeting their obligations. </p></reply>

The information was gathered from a number of sources including local authorities, structural guarantee providers, representatives of homeowners, private builders, construction professionals and public representatives and was cross referenced to verify, as far as practicable, its validity.  According to its report , the pyrite problems appear to be confined to five local authority areas, Dublin City, Fingal, Meath, Kildare and Offaly. The Panel was not informed of pyrite problems in Cavan or Monaghan. </p><p>  I have recently received Government approval for the imposition of a levy on both the quarrying and insurance sectors as a mechanism to provide the funding necessary for a remediation scheme. The imposition of these levies will require legislation and I am committed to having the legislation published and enacted in the shortest timeframe possible.</p><p>  The Government also approved the establishment of a Resolution Board as recommended in the pyrite report. I have previously announced the appointment of the Chairman and I will announce the full Board membership shortly . The role of the Board will be to oversee the operation of the remediation scheme and to ensure that the public interest, and the interest of the affected homeowners, is well served.</p><p>  The Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation and HomeBond have agreed to establish an entity for the purposes of operating the remediation scheme.  A number of financial institutions have agreed in principle to make initial loan funding available to facilitate the early commencement of pyrite remediation work and it is intended that the entity will engage with those institutions in relation to the loan facility.  Both the Chairman of the Resolution Board and I are keen for the Board to commence its work as soon as possible and there will be no undue delay on my part or that of my Department in putting the necessary structures in place for a remediation scheme.</p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. </p><p>  I am aware of the Small Business Rate Relief Scheme in Northern Ireland. Within this jurisdiction, the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970 provides for the operation of rates waiver schemes. Under the provisions, a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme providing for a waiver of all or a portion of commercial rates due by ratepayers in respect of a specified class or classes of property.  The formulation of such a scheme is a matter reserved for the members of the relevant local authority and is subject to my consent as nister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. </p><p>  I have no plans to introduce a temporary levy on large out of town retail operations.  In terms of planning policy, I published new Development Contribution Guidelines on 21 January 2012.  The new guidelines build on the experience gained in recent years and also align development contribution policy with the Government&rsquo;s prioritisation of employment creation, investment and sustainable development.  Above all the guidelines are intended to support proper planning and sustainable development while also prioritising job creation and economic investment. </p><p>  I am acutely aware of the pressures on small and medium sized businesses at the present time.  Local authorities have been asked by my Department, by way of a circular letter, to exercise restraint or, where possible, reduce commercial rates and local charges for 2013. Local authorities have responded well to such requests in recent years.   </p><p>  I will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under active review, and am determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector.   </p></reply>

With the Minister of State for Housing and Planning, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, I published new Development Contribution Guidelines on 21 January 2012.  The new guidelines build on the experience gained in recent years and also align development contribution policy with the Government&rsquo;s prioritisation of employment creation, investment and sustainable development.   </p><p>  Above all, the guidelines are intended to support proper planning and sustainable development while also prioritising job creation and economic investment.   Key features of the new guidance include:</p><p>-	A requirement that development contribution schemes appropriately promote the development of areas prioritised in core strategies;</p><p>-	Reduced rates or waivers for certain categories of development;</p><p>-	A standard methodology for all planning authorities to follow in the preparation of development contribution schemes; and,</p><p>-	Measures to support new or existing enterprises through, for example, reduced development contribution rates, deferral payments, etc. </p><p>  The guidelines issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 - 2012.  This means that planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are required to have regard to the guidelines in performance of their functions under the Planning Acts. </p><p>  I will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under active review, and am determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector. </p></reply>

The Environmental Protection Agency, in its Code of Practice: Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems Serving Single Houses, advises that regular de-sludging of a septic tank is required to ensure that the system continues to operate effectively.   </p><p>  On 19 December 2012, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued a judgment against Ireland in the Case C-374/11 which imposed a lump sum fine of &#8364;2 million and daily fines of &#8364;12,000 for failure to comply with the ECJ judgment C-188/08 in which the Court found that Ireland had failed to transpose into domestic legislation the requirements of the Waste Directive regarding the disposal of domestic waste water from septic tanks and other individual treatment systems.  The European Commission has yet to write formally to the Irish authorities regarding the fines imposed by the ECJ and so there has been no payment or settlement of these fines yet.   It is understood that formal letters will issue from the Commission shortly.  My Department is liaising closely with the Commission on these matters.   </p><p>  The EPA, in its report Water Quality in Ireland 2007-2009, has identified on-site waste water treatment systems as one of a number of potential sources of micro-biological contamination of groundwater sources.  The EPA recommends that vulnerable groundwater sources may require special protection measures and that the design and location of abstractions wells is essential to protect against organic inputs.     </p><p>  The overall strategy of investment in water services is to ensure that the timing and scale of investment facilitates economic and other development, achieves compliance with statutory requirements and promotes environmental sustainability objectives.  The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for public wastewater infrastructure is the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme<i></i>2010-2013<i>. </i> The programme provides for the commencement of contracts with a value of over &#8364;1 billion in relation to wastewater infrastructure. </p><p>  The EPA is responsible for carrying out Ireland&#8217;s national groundwater monitoring programme which consists of a network of some 350 monitoring points.   The network has been designed to be representative of the variations in hydrogeology and anthropogenic pressures across a groundwater body and is subject to ongoing review as circumstances change.  Threshold values for mandatory substances under the Priority and Dangerous Substances Directives have been established in the European Communities Environmental Objectives (Groundwater) Regulations 2010 and they apply to all groundwater bodies nationally.   </p><p>  In addition to the above, the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2010 contain provisions aimed at protecting ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.   Such measures include a limit on the level of livestock manure which may be applied to land each year, the capacity levels of storage vessels necessary for livestock manure and periods when the land application of certain types of fertiliser is prohibited.</p></reply>

Dublin Fire Brigade provides the fire service for the four Dublin local authorities &ndash; Dublin City Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire/Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin County Councils.   </p><p>  My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy and guidance and the provision of capital funding, including the recoupment, within the overall funding available, of costs incurred by fire authorities in relation to approved construction projects and the purchase of fire appliances and equipment.

The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for wind energy developments.  This mapping of suitable locations is carried out through the development plan process which makes extensive statutory provision for public consultation. </p><p>  Planning legislation provides for extensive public notification of proposed development at the development management stage.  For example, article 17 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 &#8211; 2010 requires an applicant to erect a site notice in order to lodge a valid application for planning permission.  Article 19 of the Regulations requires that this notice must be placed in a conspicuous position on or near the main entrance from a public road to the land or structure concerned, so as to be easily visible and legible by persons using the public road.  Alternatively, if the land or structure does not adjoin a public road, the site notice should be placed so as to be easily visible and legible by persons outside the land or structure. </p><p>  The site notice must contain the date on which the notice is erected, state that the planning application may be inspected or purchased at the offices of the planning authority and that a submission or observation in relation to the application may be made to the authority in writing, on payment of the prescribed fee, within the five weeks beginning on the date of receipt by the planning authority of the application.  The applicant must erect the site notice no sooner than<b></b>two weeks before making the application for permission in order to facilitate third party inspection of the application.  Where it appears to a planning authority that any notice does not comply with these requirements they may require the applicant to give further notice and evidence in relation to compliance with such a requirement.Article 18 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2006 also provides that a notice be published in a newspaper approved for this purpose.  Each planning authority must decide which newspapers should be included on their approved list of newspapers in order to ensure that the newspapers used for the purpose of such notices have a sufficiently large circulation in its functional area.   </p><p>  In addition, the planning authority must, under section 34(3) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, have regard to any observations or submissions received concerning the proposed development in accordance with the relevant regulations. </p><p>  Furthermore, any person who makes a submission to the planning authority may appeal the decision of the planning authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The board in some instances, at its own discretion, holds oral hearings in relation to cases being considered by it, further adding to the opportunities to participate in the decision-making process.   </p><p>  Applications for wind energy development over 25 turbines and greater than 50 MW may be made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la under Section 37A (inserted by Strategic Infrastructure Act) of the 2000 Planning and Development Act, as amended. </p><p>  In order to ensure that Ireland continues to meet its renewable energy targets and, at the same time, that wind energy does not have negative impacts on local communities, my Department &#8211; in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders &#8211; is now undertaking a targeted review of certain aspects of the Wind Energy Guidelines 2006. </p><p>  This focused review will examine the manner in which the guidelines address key issues of community concern such as noise proximity, visual amenity and any other potential impacts as considered appropriate together, and will explore ways of building community support for wind energy development. </p></reply>

This recognises both the constrained funding levels available for local authority construction programmes and the capacity and track record of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector. </p><p>AHBs are uniquely placed to help drive the achievement of the housing supply responses set out in the policy statement.  However, the move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by approved housing bodies to more revenue funded options present s challenges for them.  As such, I am developing an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it in the policy statement.   </p><p>  The development of a regulatory framework will take time.  In the meantime, I am engaging with the sector on the development of a voluntary code which, I would hope, most approved housing bodies will sign up to over time.  A public consultation process on the code took place in the latter part of 2012 and I intend to publish a final version of the code in the coming months. </p></reply>

The bulk of the reduction has been applied to the main local authority capital programme which has come down from &#8364;1.029 billion in 2008 to a total of &#8364;115 million in 2012.  Clearly, the financial parameters in which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to very large capital funded construction programmes by local authorities.  Accordingly, the main focus in terms of supports provided by Government will be on meeting the most acute needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.   </p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be facilitated primarily through more flexible funding models.  The social housing leasing initiative and, in particular, the Rental Accommodation Scheme will each play their part as long term social housing supports.  The Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease, and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.   </p><p>  A three year programme of new local authority construction starts, covering the 2012- 14 period, is in train.  While there will be limited funding for this initiative, the intention will be to maximise the outputs that can be achieved from what will be a targeted programme. </p><p>  Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply, it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year.   However, it is provisionally estimated that in excess of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.  This will include:</p><p>-350 units for people with special housing needs;</p><p>-150 units specifically for people leaving institutional care;</p><p>-an additional 400 permanent homes delivered through capital expenditure under the Social Housing Investment Programme;</p><p>-300 transfers under the Mortgage to Rent Scheme;</p><p>-some 4,000 units will be delivered under social leasing, including property transfers from NAMA, the Rental Accommodation Scheme and mortgage to lease.   </p><p>Final details regarding the level of funding which can be allocated to these projects during the year will be determined as part of the Estimates process.  Local authorities will not be notified of specific allocations until after the Revised Estimates Volume is published.   </p><p>  My Department does not hold information on the number of households on local authorities&#8217; waiting lists.  This figure continuously fluctuates as households are allocated housing and new households apply for housing support.   </p><p>  Detailed information on the latest statutory assessment of housing need carried out in March 2011, including a breakdown by housing authority, is available on my Department&#8217;s website,<i><i></i></i>, or on the Housing Agency&#8217;s website at .</p></reply>

The cost of rent supplement to that Department in 2012 was over &euro;400m.  The ongoing management and financing of the rent supplement scheme is a matter for the Department of Social Protection. </p><p>  The most recent Housing Needs Assessment carried out in March 2011 showed that up to 41,112 households on social housing waiting lists were in receipt of rent supplement payments.   In accordance with relevant legislative provisions, housing authorities have been directed to provide a full summary of social housing assessments carried out in their administrative areas at the end of April 2013, including details of numbers on rent supplement.

Under Section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981, a fire authority is required to make provision for the delivery of fire services in its functional area, including the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of premises.  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each county and city manager is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authority for which he or she is responsible.  In addition, it is a reserved function of fire authorities to adopt fire and emergency operations plans indicating the provision made in respect of organisation, appliances, equipment, fire stations, training and operational procedures for the provision of a comprehensive fire service to the community.  My Department supports fire authorities through setting of general policy, training support and issue of guidance on operational and other related matters, and the provision of capital funding.   </p><p>  My Department&#8217;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management has developed a policy document, Keeping Communities Safe (KCS), which sets the future direction of fire services in Ireland.  <i>Inter alia</i>, it sets out future service delivery structures and a system of national processes and standards for fire service delivery in Ireland based on a risk management approach to fire safety, which combines the important elements of fire prevention, protection and response.  The draft KCS document is available on my Department&#8217;s web site at , and I intend to publish it as national policy in the very near future. </p></reply>

The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for public domestic water supplies is the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme<i> 2010-2013.</i></p><p>  The Programme provides for the commencement of contracts with a value of over &#8364;800m in relation to water supply infrastructure.  This includes contracts to address deficiencies in the quality of supply, to improve the overall capacity of the system and an accelerated programme of mains rehabilitation.  The Programme also provides for the advancement of a further range of schemes through planning, for progression to construction in future investment cycles.</p><p>  The Programme is based on an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services, undertaken by each water services authority, which were subsequently appraised by my Department.  In preparing their assessments, water services authorities were required to take into consideration key environmental and economic criteria in prioritising contracts and schemes to be progressed in their areas.  The development of the Programme was strongly influenced by reports by the Environmental Protection Agency on drinking water quality, and an assessment by Forf&aacute;s of the requirements of enterprise in Gateways and Hubs, as well as River Basin Management Plans.  In addition, a detailed project appraisal is undertaken during the planning phase of each scheme, which determines issues such as the appropriate source of water, projected future demand and the most cost effective solution to meeting needs.  There is, therefore, a strong evidence base, from technical assessments, environmental monitoring and policy studies to underpin the strategic direction of water services capital investment.</p><p>  The series of reforms being advanced in the water sector by the Government is designed to support additional investment in the sector.  An implementation strategy is now in place to deliver on these reforms.  This strategy is available on the Department&#8217;s website.  As part of this strategy, a specific work-stream is considering the matters arising in the proposed transfer of the responsibility for capital programme delivery from the 34 local authorities to Irish Water.  This includes the development of the capital investment programme for 2014 to 2015 and the development of a capital transition plan to manage the orderly transition from current arrangements to the new arrangements to be put in place by Irish Water.</p></reply>

My Department, on behalf of the State, has been liaising with the European Commission to ensure that the requirements of the judgment are fully met.  The Commission is concerned, as I am, to secure the urgent remediation of these sites.</p><p>Ministerial policy directions which issued in May 2005 and July 2008 provide guidance on the appropriate course of action to be followed where illegal deposition of waste is discovered.  The policy direction issued in 2005 sets the standard in terms of the expected response from the regulatory authorities, who are obliged to ensure that the necessary remedial measures are taken to ensure that sites are restored and that waste illegally deposited is appropriately disposed of or recovered.  The 2008 direction deals with the use of sanctions to ensure effective actions against those involved in unauthorised waste activities.</p><p>In practice, the bulk of the projects aiming to remediate the sites in question did not get underway until 2010.  Consequently, most of the claims to my Department for reimbursement of the costs to the relevant local authority were made from 2011 onwards.  The following table shows costs of remediation works totalling some &euro;5,556,322, as of the end of 2012.</p><p><table><tr><th>2008-2011</th><th>2012</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>&#8364;</td><td>&#8364;</td><td>&#8364;</td></tr><tr><td>2,983,000</td><td>2,573,322 </td><td>5,556,322 </td></tr></table></p><p>Remedial works at these illegal and unregulated sites are continuing as part of a process that will take a number of years to complete.  The ultimate final cost will be dependent on a range of factors, such as the actual quantities of waste involved, the technical approach taken to remediation and the outcome of tendering processes.  The vast majority of the costs involved are ultimately borne by the State, although the local authorities, where possible, seek cost recovery through the Courts.  The following table shows the future estimated costs arising in relation to the sites in question, on the basis of the best information to hand.</p><p><table><tr><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>&#8364;</td><td>&#8364;</td><td>&#8364;</td><td>&#8364;</td></tr><tr><td>5,000,000 </td><td>3,500,000</td><td>3,000,000 </td><td>11,500,000 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which include adopting the annual budget and authorising borrowing, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.</p><p>  Local authorities are subject to a number of financial reporting requirements.  Some of these requirements are statutory while others form part of my Department&rsquo;s own general governance processes, the financial oversight functions of the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and also specific requirements relating to the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  In addition, Government Departments that provide funding to local authorities on a programme or project basis have their own reporting and accountability arrangements and procedures.</p><p>  Engagement with the local government sector on financial matters is well established and is ongoing across a number of channels, in particular through the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association and its finance subcommittee.  In addition, my Department reviews in detail the financial position of local authorities and engages with individual authorities as required.  The reports of the Local Government Audit Service and local authority financial returns inform financial review meetings between senior officials of the authorities and my Department.  Matters discussed include the authority&rsquo;s income and expenditure, borrowing requirements, collection percentages (i.e. commercial rates, development contributions, commercial water charges etc. ) in addition to any other issues impacting on the local authority&rsquo;s finances.</p></reply>

It has however recruited fifty-eight Prison Administration and Support Officers (PASO) from within existing Civil Service resources as part of its commitment to the Public Service Agreement 2010 - 2014.  The purpose of this exercise is to reduce costs by replacing trained prison grade staff who were performing administrative duties with a new dedicated administrative grade at a reduced salary.  The Irish Prison Service has also recruited one Psychologist grade 2 in the past 12 months.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware the overall staffing level in the Public Service is determined within the context of the moratorium on staffing levels with particular regard to the Employment Control Frameworks currently in place.  Meeting our challenging numbers target will require continued implementation of the moratorium on recruitment save in exceptional cases where filling of essential posts is required, the filling of which is subject to  prior approval by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  There are no immediate plans to recruit additional Recruit Prison Officers.  The Director General of the Irish Prison Service anticipates recruitment of up to 7 Nurse Officers and 4 Doctors within the next 6 months.  In addition, the Service is currently interviewing for additional PASO grades, again from within existing Civil Service resources.  It is anticipated that up to 40 of these PASO grades will be recruited  within the next 6 months.</p><p>  I can also inform the Deputy that there are currently 503 candidates remaining on a panel who have passed phase 1 (aptitude test) of the existing Recruit Prison Officer recruitment process but who have yet to be called to stage 2.  This competition was run in 2008.  A further 77 candidates have passed phase 2 (interview) of the process and have been placed on a panel in anticipation of further recruitment, subject to pre-employment checks.</p></reply>

The specific location information is not available.</p><p>Supporting the statutory Diversion Programme, my Department, through the Irish Youth Justice Service administers the Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) which are nationwide, community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives run by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and funded by the Irish Youth Justice Service in my Department.  These projects seek to divert young people from becoming involved in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour.  The GYDPs are designed to engage with young people who have been identified as being at risk of involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  They aim to bring about the conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order can develop and mature through positive interventions and interaction with the projects.  The projects are particularly targeted at 12-17 year old &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; youths in communities where a specific need has been identified and where there is a risk of them remaining within the justice system.  There are two such projects in the Kildare area operated by the Kildare Youth Services and statistics for these are as follows:</p><p>  <b>2011 Stats from Kildare Youth Service</b><pli0><table><tr><th>Garda Youth Diversion Project Name</th><th>Catchment Area</th><th>2011 Participant Information (12-18 years)</th></tr><tr><td><br />Bridge Youth</td><td><br />Celbridge, Straffan &amp; Ardclogh: North-east Kildare.

There was 1 anti-social behaviour warning issued in Kildare in 2012.</p><p>Tackling youth crime continues to be a key priority for this Government as set out in the Programme for Government.  I am committed to continuing the Diversion Programme and this is reflected in the 2013 budget which remains similar to 2012.</p></reply>

These undertakings complement those structural reforms in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland aimed at removing restrictions to trade and competition relating to the legal professions and legal costs.</p><p>  Effect is being given to these structural reform commitments in the form of the extensive provisions of the Legal Services Bill 2011 which was published, in keeping with the relevant time-line under the Troika Programme, in the last Quarter of 2011.  The Bill, which remains a priority under the Government Legislation Programme, completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in February 2012 and is currently awaiting Committee Stage - priority also had to be given to the enactment of the Personal Insolvency Bill by the end of last year as a competing Troika Programme objective.  Detailed preparation of the Legal Services Regulation Bill is, therefore, ongoing at my Department in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel.  As I have previously indicated, amendments to the Bill will be made available for consideration prior to the commencement of Committee Stage which is anticipated during this Session.  The Bill has four main levers of modernisation and reform, namely, a new, independent, Legal Services Regulatory Authority with responsibility for oversight of both solicitors and barristers; an independent complaints system to deal with public complaints including those relating to professional misconduct.  There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal to deal with both legal professions; an Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator that will assume the role of the existing Taxing-Master.  The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated and two new Taxing-Masters have already been appointed in anticipation of this reform.  Determinations of costs made by the Adjudicator will be made public and the Adjudicator may also publish legal costs guidelines.  Separately, the Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a set of Legal Costs Principles.  It also imposes greater obligations on legal practitioners to disclose the actual or potential costs of legal proceedings to their clients; a framework for Alternative Business Models.  The Bill facilitates new forms of legal services provision that take account of the emergent new business models in other common law jurisdictions and the huge advances made in business technology.  These new or &quot;alternative&quot; business structures will be optional alongside current forms of practise and their availability will address a growing competitive disadvantage for our legal services sector.</p><p>    In relation to the specific point raised by the Deputy about a single legal profession, Section 30 of the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 provides for a report and recommendations to be prepared by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, within two years of its establishment, on whether the professions of barrister and solicitor in the State should be unified.  That Section of the Bill sets out, in some detail, how the relevant recommendations should be made having regard, among other things, to the public interest, the need for competition, the interest of consumers, the proper administration of justice and other matters as may be considered appropriate.</p></reply>

As well as providing for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board that will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges, the proposed Bill is aimed at providing a means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct supported by the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee which will have lay representation.</p><p>  In November 2011, the judiciary agreed to establish an Interim Judicial Council pending the publication and enactment of the proposed Judicial Council Bill.  A sub-committee of the Board of the Interim Judicial Council was subsequently established to consider the General Scheme for a Judicial Council Bill, a version of which had been published by the previous Government in August 2010.  The observations of the sub-committee were conveyed to me by the Chief Justice on 8 May 2012.  These observations were duly considered at my Department taking account of intervening developments and of current Government policy.  Following this consideration, I conveyed the relevant drafting instructions to the Attorney General in November 2012.  Work on the drafting of the new Bill continues, therefore, in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel and I very much appreciate the ongoing support being given to this initiative by the Chief Justice and her judicial colleagues.  Under the Government's Legislation Programme for the Spring Session, announced by the Chief Whip on 15<sup>th</sup> January 2013, publication of the Bill is expected later this year.</p></reply>

The Bill is in the course of being reviewed in my Department with a view, among other matters, to making it as cost-effective as possible.  The Bill, as published, provides for the comprehensive reform of the existing legislation and structures relating to coroners and provides for the establishment of a new Coroner Service.  The Bill incorporates many of the recommendations made by the Coroners Review Group in 2000 and the Coroners Rules Committee in 2003 and it aims to fulfil various obligations placed on the State by the European Convention on Human Rights and, particularly, the Article 2 requirement in relation to the investigation of deaths of persons involving the State.</p><p>  The key elements of the Bill include: enhancing inquiry and inquest processes; establishing the office of Chief Coroner to provide leadership and direction in all coronial matters; providing the necessary legal framework for the establishment of a new Coroner Service; moving to a smaller number of full-time coroners; statutory requirement to ensure that family members are notified at significant steps of the coronial process; clarifying a specific regime for coroner post-mortem examinations, including provision for retention and release of body parts and bodily samples, and promoting cooperation between coroners and other agencies also involved in investigations of deaths.</p><p>  It would be my hope to progress the Coroners Bill this year.  The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 provides for some early reforms in coronial matters, including an amalgamation of the Dublin County and City coronial districts.</p></reply>

Part 13 of the Act, which relates to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and finally to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.  With regard to adults, they include a warning and the making of a civil order by the court.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that since 1 January 2010 and up to 31 January 2013, 2,487 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 1,241 to children.  Two good behaviour contracts were made in respect of a child during the same period.  Two civil orders in respect of adults, (age 18 and over), and no behaviour orders in respect of children have been issued by the courts during this period.  In setting up the regime in the Act the intention was that the different interventions would address the problem behaviour.  If they succeeded, there would be no need to apply to the courts for an order.  It is only if they failed to lead to a behaviour adjustment by the person in question, that a court order would be applied for.</p></reply>

One of the difficulties relates to the issue of a need to demonstrate persistence in the harassment.</p><p>  Bullying in any form, including cyber bullying, may amount to harassment and may therefore be an offence under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, as amended.  Thus the outcome of the Law Reform Commission deliberations on the persistence element of the offence of harassment will inform the debate on the prosecution of all harassment offences including any potential prosecutions for harassment in cyber bullying situations.</p><p>  While, the time taken for the completion and delivery of individual Law Reform Commission reports and recommendations is a matter for the Commission itself as an independent body under the Law Reform Commission Act 1975, I understand they expect to complete a discussion or consultation paper in the first half of this year in relation to their consideration of the provision.</p></reply>

The Commission prioritises funding for activities that provide direct supports to victims of crime.  A substantial amount of the funding it provides is awarded to voluntary sector groups who provide an accompaniment service to victims of crime when attending court.  </p><p>  The Commission advertises its funding scheme each year.  It invites applications from registered charities, voluntary/community groups and other bodies.  Applicants must be either a registered charity and/or a limited company.  The Commission&#8217;s funding Scheme for 2013 was advertised on the 5<sup>th</sup> October, 2012.  The closing date for receipt of applications was the 23<sup>rd</sup>   November, 2012.  </p><p>  There are no minimum or maximum limits on the amounts an applicant can apply for.  However, as every effort is made by the Commission to provide funding to services throughout the country, the full amount sought by a service may not always be granted.</p><p><b></b><b><i>Cosc</i></b></p><p>  Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, operates a grant scheme which provides funding to support groups at local, regional and national level for awareness raising campaigns that increase understanding and recognition of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and provide information of the services available to victims.  Cosc strives to support the improvement of awareness raising through the implementation of a clear communications strategy and through transparent and fair funding procedures.</p><p>  As in previous years, it is anticipated that this year&#8217;s grant scheme will be initiated in mid-to-late March with a public announcement and call for applications via national press media as well as notification on the Cosc website (www.cosc.ie) and E-zine.  The closing date for the receipt of applications is normally 5 weeks later, i.e. mid-to-late April. </p><p>  There is no minimum or maximum limit on the amount an applicant group may apply for.  However, as Cosc makes every effort to provide funding to services in all regions of the country, the full amount sought by a service may not always be granted.  Cosc supports collaboration between groups in raising awareness as an effective and cost saving tool of communication in that it gives groups an opportunity to reach a wider target audience to reinforce a common message.  All successful grant recipients are subject to audit by Cosc and may also be audited by the Internal Audit Unit of my Department.  </p><p><b><i>Equality for Women Measure (EWM) 2008 - 2013</i></b></p><p>  The Equality for Women Measure (EWM) 2008-2013 is a positive action measure to promote equality of opportunity for women, supported by the European Social Fund, making funding available to community based not for profit organisations to provide developmental training to enhance labour market opportunities for disadvantaged women.  The Measure is not currently open to receive applications.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p><b></b><b><i>Equality Mainstreaming</i></b></p><p>  The Equality Authority does not operate a specific funding programme for community, voluntary and sporting organisations.  The Equality Mainstreaming Unit (EMU) programme, operated by the Equality Authority, is part-funded by the European Social Fund 2007-2013.  As part of its work programme, the EMU periodically funds projects to promote equality mainstreaming in the labour market and by further and vocational education providers.  In such instances, calls for proposals are issued which set out the terms of the particular initiative, including the opening and closing dates and amount of funding available.  Projects for funding are selected on a competitive basis.  Depending on the initiative, calls for proposals may be open to applications from community, voluntary and sporting organisations.  No calls for proposals are currently issued.</p><p><b></b><b><i>Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration</i></b></p><p>  The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration within my Department is responsible for the European Refugee Fund and the European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals.  The first-mentioned of these Funds provides grants for reception measures for refugees and asylum seekers and integration measures for refugees.  The European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals assists with integration actions in respect of persons who are not among the target groups of the Refugee Fund.  Currently, the contribution of the Funds to supported projects is 50% of the total cost and this may be increased to 75 % for projects addressing specific priorities identified in the strategic guidelines drawn up by the European Commission.  These co-financing rates are to increase by 20 percentage points for States, such as Ireland, which are in a rescue package, under a proposal currently before the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.  The national matching funding has to be sourced by the promoters of the project.  </p><p>  Two calls for applications under these Funds have taken place since their inception, which was 2008 in the case of the Refugee Fund and 2007 in the case of the Integration Fund.  Projects selected under the more recent call commenced in the second half of 2010.  This call specified a minimum grant of &#8364;70,000 and a maximum of &#8364;300,000 and projects could range in duration from 18 months to three years.  As projects selected are now coming to an end or have already ended, consideration is being given to conducting a further call for applications.  The conditions to be specified in such a call would not necessarily be the same as previously, particularly in regard to duration because the proposed EU Asylum and Migration Fund is due to replace the existing Funds from 2014 although the eligibility periods of the new Fund and the existing Funds will overlap for a period.   </p><p>  The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration has also made grants available to national organisations, including national sporting bodies, for the promotion of migrant integration.  This funding is continuing but on a limited scale because their resources are reduced in line with public expenditure generally.  There is unfortunately little or no scope at present to take on new projects.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

Members must retire on compulsory age grounds on reaching the age of 60. </p><p>  In actual fact, most Garda&iacute; take voluntary retirement ahead of their compulsory retirement age and it is not possible to predict with any certainty the number of Garda&iacute; who will leave the Force during the course of any one year. There are currently 1,450 Garda members who could retire in 2013 on full pension. However, there is no basis for expecting that all those who could retire will actually do so.</p><p>  Equally it is difficult to establish an average figure for Garda retirements, particularly as the annual rate of retirements has been affected in the past by one-off factors such as the grace period which lasted until the end of February last year. While it would not be unreasonable, therefore, extrapolating from recent experience, to expect that retirements might range somewhere between 350 and 400, it is not possible to give a scientific estimate. </p><p>  I have however, been informed by the Garda authorities that as of 1 February 2013, the number of Garda&iacute; who have retired or declared their intention to retire during the course of 2013 is 58.</p></reply>

This section is designed to allow schools and other institutions to maintain their religious ethos. It was examined by the Supreme Court in 1996 when the Employment Equality Bill of 1996 was referred to it under Article 26 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court found that it is a reasonable balancing in legislation of the different rights involved, including chiefly the right to earn a living and the rights to freedom of religion and association. I am concerned however that, in practice, the balance is not a fair one and that in practice this provision can operate in a way that is unfair to LGBT persons. I consider that an extensive consultative process and formal assessment of the options should be undertaken. It is therefore my intention to ask the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commissioners to examine the issue as a priority and to report on their views and recommendations to the two Ministers centrally concerned, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn and myself as the Minister for Justice and Equality and to the House. I am committed to bringing forward Government proposals for any necessary anti-discrimination amendment to this provision once this consultation process is completed</i>  .</p></reply>

These provisions are designed to ensure that the legal framework supports the parties in reaching an agreed and enduring resolution to their disputes where possible.  </p><p>  This measure will further enhance a successful initiative between the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board and the Family Mediation Service which has been operating in the Dublin District Family Law Courts in Dolphin House since March 2011.  The objective is to offer a robust alternative to a court determined outcome and a more appropriate means of resolving certain family disputes through mediation.  This project has resulted in a total of 570 agreements finalised without recourse to the courts up to end December 2012.  The project was extended further to Naas from September 2012 and to Cork with effect from January 2013.   <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following the consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p><p>  The person concerned would then appear to have left the State, on a date unknown, and travelled to the United Kingdom. Given that he had no permission to remain in the UK, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 16(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Dublin II Regulations, a formal request was received from the UK's immigration authorities, on 23 December, 2010, to &quot;take back&quot; the person concerned. Ireland agreed to the &quot;take back&quot; request on the basis that Ireland was the Member State responsible for examining the asylum claim by the person concerned.  The person concerned was returned to Ireland on 3 March, 2011 and was returned to the stage of the asylum/immigration process where he had been before he departed for the UK.</p><p>  Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 30 December, 2010, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the then Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</p><p>  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made.  Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</p><p>  The Deputy might also wish to note that the person concerned contacted the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in early April, 2011 indicating that he wished to return voluntarily to his country of origin.  In response to that request, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service advised the person concerned of the voluntary return options open to him.  Specifically, he was advised to contact the Dublin Office of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and while he did so, there were practical reasons as to why the voluntary return arrangement could not be concluded at that time.  The person concerned again contacted the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service on 15 June, 2012 indicating that he wished to return voluntarily to his country of origin, but he later withdrew that request.  As a result, his case will now be determined in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 and, if necessary, the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), in the order set out above.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that as the asylum claim of the person concerned has already been determined and refused, there is no basis under which he can now be granted refugee status.  However, his ultimate position in the State remains to be determined so he should await the outcome of his application for Subsidiary Protection.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

The threat which these groups present is a matter of shared concern North and South.  We also share a strong resolve to take all necessary actions within the law to bear down on these groups.</p><p>  The Deputy will know, of course, that these so-called &quot;dissident republicans&quot; are criminal terrorists who use lethal violence in pursuit of their own, often personal, ends.  They are deeply and inextricably involved in serious crime in order to fund their activities and their lifestyles.  I can assure the House that countering the paramilitary threat has always been a priority for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and nothing has changed in that regard.  The garda&iacute; will continue in their efforts to counteract these groups and their activities.</p><p>  The Garda&iacute; co-operate seamlessly with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in actively bearing down on these groups.  Operational policing co-operation is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI and both police chiefs have repeatedly emphasised the close and high quality co-operation between their forces.  This has been instrumental in preventing attacks, combating criminality and saving lives.</p><p>  There is also a close and ongoing working relationship between our officials.  By working together on matters of mutual concern and interest we can improve community safety for all the people on this island.  We will continue, in co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, to spare no effort to ensure that those criminal terrorists who seek to subvert the democratic will of the people will face the full rigours of the law.</p></reply>

The programme provides for new projects and the continuation of capital building work already underway.  An overall capital provision of &euro;9 million has been allocated to the Department for 2013.  Of the capital funds available for 2013, &euro;6.24 million has been allocated for capital building works at military installations.  The remainder of approximately &euro;2.76 million has been allocated to Information and Communications Technology development.  A further &euro;900,000 is also available for capital building works, as capital carryover from 2012 giving an overall allocation for capital building works of &euro;7.14 million.</p><p>  Some &euro;2.19 million of this allocation is being expended on a range of capital building projects which were already in progress from 2012 and which are at various stages of completion across a number of military locations.  These include the replacement of hangar No. 1 at Casement Aerodrome, a generator installation project at McKee Barracks and the provision of transport yard facilities at Clarke Barracks, Curragh. </p><p>  The balance of the provision for capital building works will facilitate new starts in 2013.  Principal new projects proposed for 2013 include the provision of an automated firing range facility at Oranmore, the upgrade of the Ammunition Depot Buildings at the Defence Forces Training Centre at the Curragh, the re-roofing of the Officer&rsquo;s Mess building at McKee Barracks which is a listed building and the refurbishment of the Cookhouse/Dining Hall at Casement Aerodrome in order to ensure compliance with Health and Safety standards.

The Board has wide powers to regulate all aspects of greyhound racing in the Republic of Ireland. </p><p>  The Board of Bord na gCon, comprising of seven members - a Chairman and six ordinary members, is responsible for leading and directing the activities of the organisation. Bord na gCon is required to act in accordance with it&#8217;s statutory obligations, the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies and any other directives issued by Government or by my Department. The Board is obliged to produce the annual report and accounts of Bord na gCon in accordance with legislation, in addition the Chairman of Bord na gCon provides me with a separate comprehensive report covering the Group in accordance with the requirements set out in the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies. Officials from my Department meet with Bord na gCon bi-annually to consider issues of mutual interest. Bord na gCon is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. It also has an Internal Auditor and an Internal Audit Committee.</p><p>  Bord na gCon has estimated approximately 10,500 people derive employment, directly and indirectly, from the greyhound industry in Ireland and the industry&#8217;s contribution to the economy is estimated to be in excess of &#8364;500m. </p><p>  Government support for the horse and greyhound racing industries is provided under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund (the Fund), which was established under Section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001 (the Act). The Fund indirectly supports the greyhound breeding and training industry which generates very substantial economic activity and makes a vital contribution to the rural economy including farm incomes. The industry attracts significant inward investment into the country. The funding has also contributed significantly to an investment program which has delivered the improved facilities now available at greyhound tracks around Ireland. Bord na gCon received &#8364;11.26m from the Fund in 2012 and is due to receive &#8364;11m from the Fund in 2013.

These are fully in accordance with EU testing requirements.</p><p>In addition the Product Official Sampling and Testing (POST) programme is a microbiological testing programme on samples taken from Department approved ready-to-eat food, meat product, minced meat and meat preparation plants i.e. added value plants. This is part of the official verification of food safety controls in the plants concerned as provided for in Regulations (EC) 852/2004, 854/2004 and 2073/2005. A total of 1,600 samples are taken annually and the sampling and testing is risk based.</p><p>DNA testing is not required under EU legislation and is not generally in use in relation to food production. It has however been deployed in recent times as part of the FSAI's checks on food authenticity and food fraud control programmes. In that respect it is another new layer to our food production controls.</p></reply>

For beef, the current rules require compulsory origin labelling, with place of birth, rearing and slaughter specified.  </p><p>In 2011 a new  Food Information for the Consumer Regulation (1169/2011/ EC) provided a framework for extending  explicit compulsory  origin labelling requirements to meats other than beef, with the detailed rules to be adopted in implementing acts by 13 December 2013, following an impact assessment by the Commission. The Department of Health (DOH) is the lead department on labelling, but, my Department  has played  an important role in ensuring that Ireland was a strong proponent of extending compulsory origin labelling requirements to meats other than beef. </p><p>  Under current rules the origin of processed products which undergo a &quot;substantial transformation&quot; may be regarded as the country in which that processing activity took place. </p><p>The Food Information for the Consumer Regulation also provides a framework for adopting  rules on compulsory labelling where the origin or place of provenance of a food is given and where it is not the same as that of its primary ingredient.  The Commission is currently conducting an impact assessment, and  detailed rules are to be adopted in implementing acts by the end of this year. It is intended that the legislation will come into effect<font color="#004080"> </font>  in 2014. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware,  the free movement of goods within the European Union provides that once goods (including meat) are produced in approved establishments in a Member State, which are  under the supervision of authorities in that  Member State, those goods are free to move within the Union without further official checks at borders within the Union. It would of course be entirely inconsistent with Single Market rules for a State to oblige processors to obtain raw materials from  particular member states, and the application of such strictures to processors in other member states could potentially  have an extremely detrimental effect on the agri-food industry in Ireland. </p><p>  The principle underpinning the Single Market, which is a critical success factor for the agri food and other sectors in an export oriented economy like Ireland&#8217;s,  is that horizontal public health and hygiene standards apply across the European Union  and that each member state is responsible for ensuring that approved food premises within its jurisdiction comply with the relevant EU regulations.  This system operates on the basis of a common application of the rules by veterinary authorities across the European Union, and is overseen by the Irish based European Food and Veterinary Office, which also conducts audits and inspections to ensure that the system is functioning correctly. </p><p>  On the other hand, meat products imported from outside the EU must come from plants approved under the European Union veterinary inspection regime and having equivalent standards as that within the EU. Meat products entering the EU from a third country are subject to documentary, identity and (if considered necessary) physical checks to ensure compliance with the requirements. </p><p>  My Department&#8217;s Veterinary Inspectors conduct audits on approved premises in Ireland. Audits on imported meat include physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. In addition, labelling and traceability checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. The Department maintains a permanent presence in approved slaughter plants. Regular visits are made to other Department approved meat plants. The frequency of these visits is determined by an annual risk assessment which is conducted for each plant. Checks are also conducted at retail level by the HSE, working under the aegis of the FSAI which has an overarching supervisory role in relation to labelling matters.</p></reply>

However before exports of beef from Ireland can take place, a bilateral Veterinary Health Certificate (VHC) must be agreed between the two countries. This VHC is effectively a guarantee that specific conditions, as stipulated by the Iranian authorities, have been met. The negotiation of bilateral veterinary health certificates is common practice with third countries and is taken very seriously by my officials. All VHCs must be signed by authorised veterinary officers in my Department and a certificate must accompany each consignment of beef. </p><p>  While the Iranian veterinary requirements are in excess of those required by the EU, I am hopeful that agreement on a bilateral certificate to allow for the export of beef from Ireland to Iran will be reached in due course. However it is important to point out that ultimately the decision to permit access to markets, on terms that make a trade commercially viable, rests with the veterinary authorities in the receiving country.  </p><p>  It is difficult to estimate the expected economic benefits to the economy here of exports of beef to Iran, as ultimately the pattern of trade is a function of commercial choice and based on market dynamics.</p></reply>

The Rates and Charges Order of 2012 is the legal instrument that provides for parking charges in the Fishery Harbour Centres, and that order provides for maximum charges. The specific elements of any possible scheme that might be introduced are currently being worked on and I will be deciding in due course on the matter, including the detail of how any scheme would apply, and the amount of charges for parking.  </p><p>  In order to improve traffic management, enabling works and upgrading works to the car parks within the Fishery Harbour, including lining of parking spaces, have been taking place over a number of months.</p><p>  Howth Fishery Harbour Centre is first and foremost a working fishery harbour.  It has a number of business customers, including business tenants, vessel owners and crew, etc and, full access is required for commercial traffic servicing the fishing side and the various ancillary enterprises, with appropriate parking arrangements.  It is acknowledged that there are, and have always been, a wide range of recreational users of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre also, including the yacht club, walkers, sightseers and other social users.  A significant number of parking spaces in Howth Fishery Harbour are currently being taken up by commuters using the DART service during the working week.  </p><p>  Traffic and parking management within the Fishery Harbour Centre itself has been an issue for some time, particularly in the light of concerns raised about safety and emergency access by the Coastguard, the Lifeboat service, and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The introduction of pay parking is one (and only one) of a number of measures being introduced to address those concerns.</p><p>  The introduction of parking charges at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre was originally examined in great detail in 2007 in the context of a proposed Howth Traffic and Parking Management Plan, in conjunction with Fingal County Council.  There was widespread public consultation at that time but that project did not subsequently proceed.  The outcomes of that public consultation as well as more recent correspondence from a wide range of harbour users, contact between my officials and harbour business tenants and general concerns about the possible effect that the introduction of pay parking might have will be taken into account in arriving at a final pay parking scheme at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre.</p><p>  Fishery Harbour Centres are financed from the Fishery Harbour Centres Fund.  All income generated in the Fishery Harbours is lodged to this ring-fenced Fund, and it is the only funding available for the operation and management of the Fishery Harbours, of which Howth is one of 6 in the State.  </p><p>  Any additional revenue that is generated from pay parking at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre will be re-invested in facilities and enhancements that would not otherwise have been possible given the current financial constraints.  This will, if anything, help to attract inward investments into the Fishery Harbour Centres, and ultimately provide more employment opportunities, not less.  </p><p>  Fingal Council has also been consulted about the current plans and in relation to issues of traffic management at both formal and informal meetings with my officials over the past year.</p><p>  There are approx 500 parking spaces in the Fishery Harbour Centre at present.  These spaces, although only recently lined and marked, have been in place for a considerable number of years and so it is not considered that a formal planning application should be required.  However, in November 2012, my Department wrote to Fingal Council in order to establish whether or not planning permission is required for the installation of pay and display machines, and a reply is awaited.  </p><p>  I can assure the deputies that the new parking arrangements will be designed as far as possible to be fair to all users, while ensuring that everyone pays their fair share of the cost of upkeep of the facility.  </p><p>  Pay parking was introduced into the Fishery Harbour Centre in Ros an Mh&iacute;l in June 2012, pay parking has been in operation at Dingle since before it was designated as a Fishery Harbour Centre in 2007 and there are currently no plans to introduce pay parking at the other fishery Harbour Centres (Castletownbere, Killybegs, and Dunmore East).</p></reply>

In 2012 it supported 140 organisations throughout every county in the country to the tune of &euro;1.365 million.  The funding available to individual organisations is intended only as a contribution to the overall costs of an organisation.  In recent years my Department has urged those organisations that have the capacity to deal with larger animals to consider placing greater resources in assisting with promoting horse welfare.</p><p>  Additionally, coastal community or voluntary groups may potentially be eligible for funding under the Seafood Development OP 2007-2013.  Axis 4 of the Programme aids the sustainable development of fisheries areas.  This is being implemented around the Irish coast by Fishery Local Action Groups (FLAG&rsquo;s) who develop and implement strategies in their local areas.  If any organisation submits a proposal that is coherent with the objectives of the local strategy, then funds may be allocated. </p><p>  The opening dates for funding under Axis 4 will be the date that local strategies are in place for each FLAG, which are scheduled to be approved by various FLAGs throughout 2013.  The closing date for the programme will be June 30th 2015.  FLAGs may invite applications for funding from time to time, subject to annual budgetary allocations from BIM.  FLAGs may limit the amount of funding allocated to individual projects.</p></reply>

The role of my Department is to verify compliance by the food business operators with this requirement. This is done by a combination of inspection of establishments and by audit on the food safety management systems which operators are required to have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b></b>  It is important to point out that the key controls carried out by my Department, under its contract with the FSAI, relate to food safety. </p><p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants. Controls at stand alone secondary processing plants are carried out at a frequency which is based on an annual risk assessment for each plant. </p><p>  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. In addition, labelling and documentary checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. </p><p>  Under the Department&#8217;s National Residue Programme, and including tests on bovine samples carried out by processors, some 30,000 samples taken at farm and factory level and covering a wide range of food stuffs are tested annually. These tests relate to microbiological and chemical standards, their primary focus being on food safety. These are fully in accordance with EU testing requirements.  </p><p>  In addition the Product Official Sampling and Testing (POST) programme is a microbiological testing programme on samples taken from Department approved ready-to-eat food, meat product, minced meat and meat preparation plants i.e. added value plants. This is part of the official verification of food safety controls in the plants concerned as provided for in Regulations (EC) 852/2004, 854/2004 and 2073/2005. A total of 1,600 samples are taken annually and the sampling and testing is risk based.</p><p>  DNA testing is not required under EU legislation and is not generally in use in relation to food production. It has however been deployed in recent times as part of the FSAI&#8217;s checks on food authenticity and food fraud control programmes. In that respect it is another new layer to our food production controls. </p></reply>

The Regulations further provide that any entitlements that remained unused over the two-year period must revert to the National Reserve and are thereby lost to the farmer. </p><p>  A letter issued to the person named on 9 January 2013 advising that 5.87 Entitlements had remained unused in the two &ndash; year period, 2011 and 2012.

If the person concerned wishes to set out any mitigating factors as to why the entitlements in question were not used in the period concerned he should make contact with my Department. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-05a.1661.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020500068#WRBB02500"><p>The overall funding of the CAP, including the amounts to be made available for direct payments (Pillar 1) and rural development (Pillar 2), are decided in the context of the negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the period 2014 to 2020. As the Deputy may be aware, EU Heads of State and Government tried unsuccessfully at the European Council last November to agree the MFF, and a further attempt will be made later this week. From an Irish perspective, the CAP remains our over-riding financial priority. The Government is therefore determined to protect the CAP to the maximum extent possible, and to defend Ireland&rsquo;s share of direct payments and rural development funding. </p><p>  The priority issues supplied by the Deputy relate more particularly to the reform of the CAP for the period post-2013. As President of the European Council of Agriculture Ministers, my objective is to negotiate a Council position on the reform package by the end of March, with a view to securing an interinstitutional political agreement with the European Parliament and the Commission by the end of June. Bearing this in mind, the position is broadly as follows:</p><p>  Two of the most difficult issues in the negotiations arise in relation to the administration of the single farm payment. These are internal convergence and greening. As regards internal convergence, the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to move to a system of flat-rate national or regional payments would, in the case of several Member States (including Ireland), result in significant transfers between farmers. These Member States are seeking a solution that will mitigate this impact and this is an issue on which Ireland too played a leading role. Other Member States - such as the newer Member States who already implement an area-based system - are seeking alternative solutions, while still others are happy with the flat rate system. I hope to be able to navigate a course through these diverging positions in the coming weeks and settle on a compromise acceptable to all Member States. </p><p>  As regards greening, all Member States (including Ireland), support further greening of the CAP, as it is consistent with the need to develop the agriculture sector in a sustainable manner. However, there are concerns about the separate and distinct nature of the greening payment, and the fact that it is to be paid on a flat-rate basis. Member States also have issues with the three greening criteria (crop diversification, maintenance of permanent grassland and ecological focus areas) and favour flexibility to implement these in a simpler manner that is also more relevant to local conditions. Again, I hope to bring forward proposals on these issues in the coming weeks that will strike a balance between the different approaches favoured by Member States.</p><p>  On the other direct payments issues raised by the Deputy, the main point outstanding, according to the Cyprus Presidency&rsquo;s Progress Report, is the question of the young farmers&rsquo; scheme, and whether it will be voluntary or mandatory for Member States. I have stated my preference for a mandatory scheme, but can live with a voluntary scheme in the interests of securing agreement with my colleagues around the Council table. I would also like to see eligibility criteria applied in order to avoid potential abuse.</p><p>  On rural development, apart from the question of funding, the main issues in the context of the CAP reform package are the effect of the greening of direct payments on the baseline for rural development payments, the delimitation of areas with natural constraints and the structure of risk management and income stabilisation tools. In addition, the Commission is pressing for greater coherence between the different EU funds and to ensure that all objectives are consistent with EU 2020 strategy priorities, which raises administrative difficulties for Member States. Some of these issues will again prove difficult to resolve, but I hope to make rapid progress over the coming weeks, </p><p>  As regards the common organisation of the market, I agree that adequate funding is an important prerequisite for the effective functioning of the various elements of the safety net mechanism. Particularly difficult issues in this dossier will be control measures in the form of sugar quotas and vine planting rights. Member States are pretty evenly divided on the question of whether sugar quotas should be abolished or extended, although the European Parliament generally favours extension. On vine planting rights, the report of the High Level Group will inform the next phase of the discussions, but again the question will be whether to extend the regime or allow the planned expiry in 2015 to proceed. Compensation for reduced milk supply, as proposed by the European Parliament, will also be a difficult issue as it too touches on the organisation of the market, on which there are contrasting views. On producer organisations, some progress has been achieved, with the Special Agriculture Committee this week reaching agreement on the issue of recognition. On exceptional measures and the crisis reserve, the key requirement is that funding is available to deal with whatever emergency situations might arise.</p></reply>

The completion of the full scheme is expected in 2015 and will include the replacement of some existing accommodation on the campus which has reached the end of its useful life.

This investment supports a key Programme for Government objective and demonstrates this Government&rsquo;s commitment to early intervention to support childhood development and tackle child poverty.  I know that early intervention improves life chances for children and families. This is even truer in communities with high levels of disadvantage and joblessness.  This new initiative will draw upon existing community strengths and efforts already underway.</p><p>  This initiative will build on and continue the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) which supports projects in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale. These projects involve a range of pilot programmes to improve outcomes in areas such as literacy, speech and language, parenting, health and pro-social behaviour. These programmes are currently being evaluated by national and international experts.   I believe that it is important that we mainstream the learning from these pilot projects so that proven and effective supports for children and families could be delivered right through the country, including through the range of services to be provided by the new Child &amp; Family Support Agency.</p><p>  The new initiative reflects the Programme for Government commitment to adopt an area based approach to child poverty in co-operation with philanthropic partners, drawing upon best international practice and existing services, to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched.  In line with this commitment, my Department in conjunction with the Office of the Tan&aacute;iste and the Departments of Social Protection, Environment, Community and Local Government, and Education and Skills will work in 2013 to expand the number of project sites from 3 to 6.  The new initiative will not simply be a continuation of the PEIP scheme but will instead seek to implement programmes which have already been evaluated and proven to work in improving outcomes for children and families at risk of disadvantage.   </p><p>  It is envisaged that this initiative will be co-funded by a philanthropic organisation and discussions are ongoing to this end.  It will not be possible in advance of the completion of these talks to know the final total funding levels including the co-funding component.</p><p>  The initiative will be overseen by a Project Team, chaired by my Department, with participation of the relevant Departments and Agencies.   This Project Team will agree criteria for selection of proposals to attract support under the programme and, in due course, will recommend participating consortia to Government.  </p><p>  The applications process is still in the planning stage, but it is not anticipated that additional sites will be selected before the Summer.</p></reply>

There will always be more construction projects than can be funded by the Exchequer and the Health Service Executive must prioritise infrastructure projects within its overall capital envelope.     </p><p>  I requested that the HSE accelerate the projects in both Wexford and in Kilkenny and for very good reasons.  At Wexford General Hospital the admissions lounge is in a portakabin-style building, as is the medical assessment unit at St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Kilkenny.</p><p>  The new Wexford project comprises an emergency department, a maternity delivery suite and theatre and the necessary equipping.  A main entrance / new concourse will also be provided.   The project is under construction and is making good progress.  It is expected to be completed and operational in mid to late 2014.</p><p>  The new Kilkenny project comprises an emergency department, a medical assessment unit and a day services unit including endoscopy. Construction commenced in 2012 and the project is expected to be completed and operational in mid to late 2014.</p><p>  Both projects were approved for inclusion in the HSE capital programme in 2008 and have been included in all of the HSE&rsquo;s multi-annual Capital Plans since then. </p><p>  My decisions fully supported the Government priority which is to improve conditions for patients and reduce overcrowding in Emergency Departments through the delivery of improved accommodation including medical assessment units.  </p><p>  As you will be aware, one of the concerns over many years has been capacity issues in the Emergency Departments. Since 2006 capital funding has been made available for an A&amp;E Initiative to provide a series of admission lounges and medical assessment units in order to relieve pressure on A&amp;E departments.   Continuing to address these capacity issues has always been a fundamental aspect of HSE&rsquo;s Capital Plans. The 2008 Capital Plan contained funding to complete developments underway, deliver new A&amp;Es and to upgrade and extend existing departments.   The Wexford and Kilkenny projects were part of this initiative to address capacity.  </p><p>  Following the 2009 Budget and Supplementary Budget the HSE&rsquo;s capital allocation was reduced by about 32%. As a consequence, certain projects were paused or deferred.  Those projects which were in construction or at the equipping stage were completed, whereas those which were at earlier stages of development such as appraisal or design were paused / deferred once those stages were completed.  The projects deferred included the Wexford and St Luke&rsquo;s Kilkenny projects.</p><p>  Both projects had advanced sufficiently by 2011 which enabled me to make my decision to accelerate them. Planning permission was in place and both had undergone the design phase.  No projects were delayed, held or omitted from the capital programme to accommodate these projects.</p><p>  I was delighted to receive an additional &euro;12 million from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in order to expedite the sorely needed facility in Wexford General Hospital.   Given that savings were achieved in the construction area due to reduced costs associated with the economic downturn it was also possible to expedite the St Luke&rsquo;s project.</p><p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sanctioned the 2011 Capital Plan which included these much needed projects.</p></reply>

Interested parties were invited to provide written submissions by Friday 4th January 2013.  The Irish Medical Organisation also outlined the concerns of its members in an oral presentation to Department and HSE officials, including difficulties faced by rural practices.

Thirty five locations for PCCs have been identified, of which 20 will be commissioned subject to (a) agreement between the local GPs and the HSE on active local GP involvement and (b) site suitability and availability.  The Capital Plan 2012-2016 contains provision for the delivery of primary care infrastructure at an additional 8 locations while the leasing initiative is expected to deliver up to an additional 15 facilities which should be substantially completed by end 2013/early 2014.</p></reply>

The plan affirmed Ireland's commitment to achieving compliance with the Directive over a three-year time period.

The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Service Plan for 2013 specifically recognises the need to address the issue as a priority, stating that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive amongst the non-consultant hospital doctor workforce, in line with the Implementation Plan submitted to the Commission in 2012. The HSE is currently finalising its National Operational Plan to support the implementation of the National Service Plan 2013. This will specify in greater detail the actions to be taken during the year in relation to EWTD compliance. A key priority for the HSE in 2013 will be a further reduction of average weekly hours worked and also a reduction in the duration of shifts undertaken.</p><p>  The HSE, as the principal health service employer, engages with the IMO on a regular basis in relation to contractual matters, including EWTD compliance, and will continue to do so.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-05a.1787.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020500068#WRDD00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 786 and 787 together.</p><p>  Under the Programme for Government 2011-2016, the Government committed to developing a universal, single-tier health service, which guarantees access to medical care based on need, not income.  On foot of this commitment the Government will introduce a system of Universal Health Insurance (UHI).  </p><p>  A key stepping stone to the new system will be to develop independent not-for-profit hospital trusts in which all hospitals will function as part of integrated groups.  The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients. </p><p>  The work on hospital groups is not about downgrading hospitals. It is about the bringing together groups of hospitals to form single cohesive entities to allow maximum flexibility in management, budgets and service delivery. </p><p>  The provision of services at any hospital site will primarily be determined by the appropriate clinical programme for that service, taking account of the population which the hospital serves and services provided by other hospitals which are within a reasonable commute.</p><p>  Each Hospital Group will have a single consolidated management team with responsibility for performance and outcomes.  It is intended that non-executive Boards, consisting of persons with expertise in key competencies such as clinical / business / legal / medical academic / patient advocacy, will oversee each Hospital Group management team and will have responsibility for decisions in relation to services in all hospitals in the Group.  </p><p>  In June 2012 I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups. A Project Team was tasked with developing criteria to assist my Department in the development of policy in relation to the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, current management frameworks and linkages to academic institutions. The Team carried out a comprehensive consultation process with all acute hospitals and other health service agencies as well as reviewing a significant number of written submissions. </p><p>  Work is nearing completion on the draft report on the wider issue of hospital groups: Prof. John Higgins will submit that report to me in early February, I will then bring it to Cabinet for decision. The Government will then decide on the initial make up of hospital groups which will be established on an administrative basis pending the legislation required to set up hospital trusts by 2015. Before those trusts are established the composition and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed. As such I cannot comment at this time on the final composition of the new Hospital Groups.</p><p>  The Galway/Roscommon University Hospital Group was established on a pilot basis in January 2012, consisting of University College Hospital, Galway, Merlin Park Hospital, Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe and Roscommon Hospital.  This was in response to budgetary and service issues in relation to Galway and the movement of services between Roscommon and Portiuncula hospital in line with the principles of the smaller hospitals framework, that service should be delivered as close to a person&rsquo;s home as possible. This is commensurate with the need to ensure quality and safety in service delivery such that more complex work generally needs to be carried out in larger hospitals. </p><p>  The Galway / Roscommon University Hospital Group has gone some way towards realising the governance arrangement which will be recommended by the Report with the appointment of Mr. Noel Daly as chairperson of the Board in May 2012.  Mr. Daly is former Chief Executive of An Bord Altranais and he has also served in senior management posts in the health services in Ireland and in the UK.   In January 2013 the HSE established an interim Board on an administrative non-statutory basis, pending the establishment of Hospital Trusts to manage public hospitals in line with the Governments programme for reform of the health service. The competencies of the individuals appointed are the key to better management of hospitals and it was on this basis that the Board appointments were made.  The administrative Board will be replaced in due course by a Trust Board on a statutory basis and may be dissolved and reconstituted at any time to facilitate the development of Hospital Trusts. </p></reply>

A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013.</p><p>  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. </p><p>  Should a patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.

Insurance will be provided under a multi-payer insurance model with no distinction between &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; patients. Under UHI, everyone will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy. </p><p>  In moving to a system of UHI,  there are  a number of key stepping stones  that are necessary to pave the way for the introduction of universal health insurance.  Work is underway on these critical building blocks that will bring benefits and drive efficiencies in advance of implementing UHI. They include:</p><p>  -the strengthening of primary care services to deliver universal primary care with the removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients;</p><p>  -the work of the Special Delivery Unit in tackling waiting times and establishing hospital groups;</p><p>  -the introduction of a more transparent and efficient &quot;Money Follows the Patient&quot; funding mechanism for hospitals, and</p><p>  -reform of the private health insurance market. </p><p>  The reform programme is a major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing over a number of years. The Programme for Government acknowledges that full implementation of UHI will take some time to achieve. <i>Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015 </i>  highlights the importance of a step-by-step evidence-based approach to achieving an effective, equitable and efficient system and sets out key actions to systematically deliver on reform.  It is anticipated that by 2016 the necessary groundwork will be in place to enable us to phase in   implementation of UHI, as promised in the Programme for Government. </p><p>  The Department is preparing a White Paper on Universal Health Insurance which will provide further detail on the UHI model for Ireland in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance. The work involved is both complex and technical, necessitating significant research and financial modelling to support analysis and costing of different design options.  This, in turn, demands a wide-range of specialised expertise. The Department is engaged in a process to ensure the provision of this expertise to feed into work on the preparation of the White Paper during 2013.  The White Paper will be published as early as possible within the Government&#8217;s term of office.  </p><p>  In advance of the White Paper, my Department has produced a Preliminary Paper on UHI, which I intend to publish in the near future. </p><p>  Finally, the Deputy has asked about a forum in which  private health insurers may engage in relation to plans on UHI.  Last year, I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum. The Forum comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority and the Department of Health.  The Forum provides a  platform for identifying ways of addressing costs throughout the industry, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law. In addition, it also gives a voice to insurers in raising issues relating to the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model.  </p></reply>

The scale of the problem was unmeasured and consequently no special action was taken to deal with it. This Government intends to change that. The Special Delivery Unit is now dealing with the issue of Out-Patient waiting lists on my instruction, with the assistance of the NTPF.</p><p>  Work has commenced on the systematic and automatic collection of waiting time data at an individual patient level, in a standardised format, from all hospitals providing an Out-Patient service. This will be the first time that such detailed data will be available at a national level from all hospitals. The collection and analysis of Out-Patient waiting time data will allow the SDU and the NTPF to address issues at regional / hospital/speciality and consultant levels.  The Special Delivery Unit and NTPF recently published the first set of validated out-patient waiting time data on the website www.ptr.ie. Published data is broken down by region and by hospital.</p><p>  The target maximum waiting time for a first Out-Patient appointment in 2013 is that no patient should be waiting more than 12 months by the end of November.  Hospitals will be held responsible and accountable for ensuring that patients are seen in Out-Patients within this maximum waiting time. The Special Delivery Unit and the NTPF will assist hospitals in targeting their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen, assessed and appropriately treated.</p><p>  In parallel with reducing the numbers of those waiting longest, the Special Delivery Unit will also commence work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of Out-Patient services to ensure that the right patient is seen by the right health professional at the right time.</p><p>  The goal of the measures outlined above is to improve access by implementing an Out Patient Service Performance Improvement Programme that will underpin a radical transformation of how Out-Patient services are delivered in Ireland.</p><p>  I have arranged for the question to be forwarded to the Health Service Executive, who will respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the information requested on Out-Patient waiting times in University Hospital, Galway and the particular case referred to the Deputy's question. </p></reply>

The policy advises hospitals that the process for scheduling patients for admission applies to both public and private patients.  i.e. once clinical urgency has been taken into account patients should be scheduled in chronological order.</p><p>  I have no role to play in the day to day running of private hospitals.  In July 2011, I announced the establishment of the Special Delivery Unit as a key part of my plans to radically reform the health system in Ireland.  The Unit&#8217;s purpose is to improve access to the emergency and elective care system.  Since it was established last year, it has been working to unblock public access to acute services by improving patient journeys through the system and by streamlining public hospital waiting lists, I am pleased to be able to say that very significant progress has been made by the SDU in relation to both emergency departments and waiting lists.</p><p><b>Scheduled care &#8211; in-patient and daycase</b></p><p>  -The initial focus for the SDU's Scheduled Care Team has been on waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery</p><p>  -By the end of December 2012, the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months for inpatient and day case surgery  was down to 86 from 3,706 in December 2011, a 98% decrease</p><p>  -The number of children waiting over 20 weeks for inpatient or daycase surgery was down to 89 from 1,759 in December 2011, a 95% decrease   </p><p>  -The number of patients waiting over 13 weeks for a routine endoscopy procedure went down from 4,590 in December 2011 to 36 at the end of December 2012, a 99% decrease.</p><p><b>Outpatient services</b></p><p>  -Improving access to outpatient services is also a priority for the Government and for the SDU Scheduled Care Team</p><p>-Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the NTPF has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data. For the first time, clear and comprehensive data are available on www.ptr.ie  </p><p>  -The data now being collected will allow the SDU and NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013.</p><p>  In the coming months, as winter pressures in Emergency Departments ease, the SDU will work towards re-balancing scheduled care to maintain the improvements seen in 2012 and to achieve the new 2013 target that no adult should be waiting &gt; 8 months for in patient and day case surgery. </p><p>  These significant improvements in access and experience are being achieved despite the economic and budgetary pressures which must be dealt with and managed.  They reflect the my commitment, and that of this Government, to ensuring patients can access the acute hospital services they need, when they need them. </p></reply>

It is intended that services will be provided by a team of nurses and consultant neurologists working as a virtual national network supporting all acute and primary care locations. Rapid Access Clinics (separate to the Epilepsy Monitoring Units) have been developed at four of centres so far, and 10.5 (WTE) Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANPs) have been recruited to lead these clinics, so that a total of 12 ANPs are now in place across the four centres. </p><p>  Regarding the Epilepsy Monitoring Units in CUH and Beaumont, these when open will increase pre-surgical evaluation capacity. Monitoring is required for the most vulnerable patients with the worst effects of epilepsy and their development is therefore a priority for the Programme. Patients at these units will require 24/7 care and the staffing requirements to enable the units to be safely opened have been identified.  </p><p>  With regard to Beaumont, the HSE has advised that Beaumont Hospital and the HSE are working jointly to fill the posts necessary to support the service development. I am advised that the staffing required for the unit includes five staff nurses, one consultant neurophysiologist and three technicians. Of these, three staff nurse posts and one technician post remain to be recruited and I am informed that this is being prioritised. The recruitment of nursing personnel is a key element to facilitate phased opening of the unit as nursing staff come into post.  </p><p>  With regard to Cork, the HSE has advised that the Service Plan for 2013 for CUH is being drawn up currently and will be finalised in the coming weeks, and that the provision of additional staff for the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit is being considered as part of that process. </p></reply>

Having regard to the average cost of care in public and private nursing homes and the average contribution made by residents, the HSE currently meets between 69% to 80% of the cost of care, depending on the nursing home involved. Even after the increased asset contribution comes into effect, the HSE will continue to meet the greater part of these costs. </p><p>  Given the extreme pressure that now exists on HSE funding across the full range of its services, it is necessary to apply an increase to the amounts that nursing home residents contribute towards their cost of care.

This external review looked at the opportunities and  costs involved in possible reductions in utilisation that can be achieved by implementing appropriate utilisation management approaches.  This is a major element of the VHI's drive to manage costs.  </p><p>  I have met with Milliman consultants who presented various cost savings initiatives for consideration by the VHI.  The next phase of this review involves the development of a Utilisation Management Plan by VHI, which is now progressing.</p><p>  Given the VHI's very significant share of the overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs and to address aggressively the base cost of procedures, including professional fees, with a view to containment and reduction of its overall cost base.  I am keen to explore all available measures to limit the costs related to private health insurance and have made it clear to the health insurers that I believe that significant savings can be made, with a view to minimising need for increases in premiums.  I welcome VHI's shared commitment to addressing the issue of costs containment.  </p></reply>

Each survivor received lump sums payments from a German Foundation and the Irish Government in the early 1970s. In 1975 the lump-sums paid by the Irish Government ranged from &euro;6,400 to &euro;21,000. In addition, each survivor receives on going monthly payments from both the German Foundation and the Irish Government. Combining the German and Irish payments, most individuals receive &euro;30,386 per annum or &euro;2,572 per month tax free.  The German and the Irish monthly allowance is not reckonable for State benefits and each individual is automatically entitled to a medical card.</p><p>  Given the challenges that persist for each individual, this Government's aim is to address the health and personal social care needs of thalidomide survivors living in Ireland.  I have stated that I am willing to enter into discussions about a health care package on a non-statutory basis; an ex-gratia payment having regard to current financial circumstances; and a statement to the D&aacute;il recognising the challenges faced by survivors.  </p><p>  There are two thalidomide representative organisations. The largest group, the Irish Thalidomide Association, announced publicly in 2012 that it had ceased talks with the Government and their legal advisors have initiated personal injuries claims for damages against the State. </p><p>  The other group, the Irish Thalidomide Survivors Society have sought an independent agency and a statutory health care package including other aspects of their needs such as housing, heating, transport and clothing, which are outside the remit of the health sector. I am not in a position to meet the demands of the Irish Thalidomide Survivors Society. My position remains unchanged from that outlined in my letter to the Irish Thalidomide Survivors Society in June last year in which I requested that the Society consider, in good faith, proceeding with a Health Care Protocol which envisaged appointing and training a multidisciplinary team, arranging a multidisciplinary health evaluation, identifying and documenting their health care needs/issues and developing plans to address those needs/issues.</p></reply>

The Medical Council 'Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners' provides guidance in relation to end of life care. The Guide states that the doctor shares with others the responsibility to take care that the patient dies with dignity, in comfort and with as little suffering as possible. There is no obligation to start or continue a treatment, or artificial nutrition or hydration that is futile or disproportionately burdensome, even if such treatment may prolong life. Doctors should respect the right of patients to refuse medical treatment or to request the withdrawal of medical treatment. The Guide states that doctors should take care to communicate with patients and their families so that they have a clear understanding of what can and cannot be achieved and offer advice on other treatment or palliative care options that might be available to them and ensure that support is provided to patients and their families, particularly when the outcome is likely to be distressing. Doctors must not participate in the deliberate killing of a patient by active means.</p></reply>

This report is based on a comprehensive consultation process, as well as a significant number of submissions from stakeholders and individual citizens. These recommendations have been considered and endorsed by a Strategic Board composed of representatives with national and international expertise in health service delivery, governance and linkages with academic institutions.  The report on the establishment of hospital groups as a transition to independent hospital trust will be presented formally to me by the Chair of the Strategic Board, Professor John Higgins, in the near future. I will prioritise consideration of that report, which will then be submitted to and presented to Government for decision on the hospital groups composition in light of the recommendations of the Report.</p><p>  The Framework for Smaller Hospitals defines the role of the smaller hospitals. It outlines the need for smaller hospitals and larger hospitals to operate together. The Framework outlines the wide range of services that can be provided within the smaller hospital.  It defines the need for the smaller hospital to be supported within a group of hospitals in terms of education and training, continuous professional development, the sustainable recruitment of high quality clinical staff and the safe management of patients who present with varying levels of complexity. It also sets out to address the categories of services that should transfer from the larger to the smaller hospitals and <i>vice versa</i>   within a Hospital Group so that services are delivered in the most appropriate hospital.</p><p>  I am determined to ensure that as many services as possible can be provided safely and appropriately in smaller, local hospitals. On this basis, the organisation of hospital services nationally, regionally and locally will be informed by the ongoing development of the HSE Clinical Programmes.  With this in mind the Framework will set out what services can and should be delivered safely by these hospitals in the interest of better outcomes for patients.  In relation to the specific details for the years 2011 and 2012 sought by the Deputy, as these are service matters they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  </p></reply>

The exceptions are for dialysis, cancer (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and post-operative transplant patients, where transport may be provided.  In these cases, the patient's appointment or treatment should be directly related to the condition. Transport may also be provided where, in the clinician's view, the patient would be unable to make the journey without clinical assistance or where the patient must be transported on a stretcher. </p><p>  Following implementation of the HSE's non-ambulance patient transport policy, responsibility for the arrangement and provision of non-ambulance transport has moved from the HSE National Ambulance Service to local health offices in each region.  </p><p>  For non-emergency stretcher-based patient transfers between hospitals, the Intermediate Care Service (ICS), is being progressively rolled out.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-05a.1970.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020500068#WRGG01000"><p>Under the provisions of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 there is a two-year transitional period from the date on which the register of the members of that profession is established during which existing practitioners may apply for registration.  The transitional period in the case of social workers ends on 31 May 2013.</p><p>  The Health and Social care Professionals Council is an independent statutory body and is responsible for setting the level of fees.  The Council has set a registration fee of  &euro;295 for existing practitioners and a fee of &euro;100 for new graduates.  An annual retention fee of &euro;295 for all registrants, including those who paid the lower rate on graduation, is payable on the annual renewal date.</p><p>  I am conscious that these fees represent a new cost to health and social care professionals who have already seen reductions in their incomes.  However, all health regulators must be self-funding by way of annual fee income.  Their operational costs are determined by the complexity and breadth of the statutory functions specified in the relevant legislation. Also, the greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged. For example, given the very large registrant base in teaching and nursing, the annual fee charged to registered nurses and teachers amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum.  Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the Council is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions which can add significantly to operating costs. The twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 clinical biochemists to 5,550 social care workers, which amounts to about 20,000 registrants in total across all twelve professions. This is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.</p><p>  The Council, together with the registration boards, has extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act and considers the annual fee of &euro;295 the minimum required to enable it to operate. The fee charged by the Council, which takes account of the requirement to become self funding as soon as possible,  is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases. The State is currently funding the Council in its establishment phase (&euro;1.5 million in 2012) to offset the current shortfall in income from registration fees and will continue to do so for the next few years.</p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fees, the Council has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for controlling registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures:</p><p>  -	The registration fee of &euro;295 paid by existing practitioners with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, who are granted registration during the transitional period, will cover them for the remainder of the transitional period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of the two year period.</p><p>  -	The Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost effective operating system and to keep costs to a minimum. This will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.</p></reply>

In recent years, a number of changes to the pricing and reimbursement system have been successfully introduced in Ireland. These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.</p><p>  The Department and the HSE have successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. Under this Agreement, from 1 November 2012, the HSE will only reimburse generic products which have been priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE will require a generic price to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate. In addition, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing for prescribed drugs and medicines.   These reforms will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for taxpayers and patients. </p></reply>

Provisional statistics for 2012 to end-September 2012 were published on the HPSC's website on 19/12/2012 and are still subject to revision; full year statistics are not yet available but it is expected that data will be ready for publication by March 2013.</p><p>  The information currently available on the number of cases of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureas (MRSA) and Clostridium Difficile (C.

This is most frequently after treatment in a hospital, but can also happen after treatment in outpatient clinics, nursing homes and other healthcare settings.  Healthcare associated infections that are picked up in hospital are also known as &quot;hospital acquired infections&quot;.   The HPSC collect, analyse and interpret large volumes of data on notifiable pathogens such as C. difficile, MRSA, E.coli and Carbapenem Resistant Enterobacteriaceae(CRE) originating from a variety of sources including hospitals and other healthcare settings.  The Centre also co-ordinated the Point Prevalence Survey of Hospital-Acquired Infections &amp; Antimicrobial Use in European Acute Care Hospitals 2012 .  This survey, in which 50 Irish hospitals (42 public and 8 private) participated in May 2012,  was carried out across all of the European Union Member States. </p><p>  If the Deputy could specify the healthcare associated infection(s) of particular interest to him, my Department officials will, with the assistance of the HPSC, collate the data required without delay on receipt of the Deputy's additional queries.</p></reply>

As and from that date, all licences issued will be in the new format.</p><p>   The transition to the plastic card has been planned carefully, with the RSA taking the lead and other key stakeholders involved at each stage.  In parallel, a new structure for delivering driving licences under the RSA is being introduced.  The RSA became the national driver licensing authority from 12 January.  The new system will be fully in place later this year, but at present a transitional arrangement is in place, with local authorities continuing to perform a number of driver licensing functions on behalf of the RSA.</p><p>  Reaction to the new format licence has been very positive and I believe the public in general welcome this change.  The new licence is more durable and more convenient to carry than the paper format which it is replacing as well as offering greater security.</p></reply>

The Convention aims to ensure that fishers:</p><p>- have improved occupational safety and health and medical care at sea, and that sick or injured fishers receive care ashore; 	</p><p>- receive sufficient rest for their health and safety;</p><p>- have the protection of a work agreement; and </p><p>- have the same social security protection as other workers.</p><p>  There are also measures to ensure compliance and enforcement. The work in fishing  convention will enter into force 12 months after the date on which the ratifications of ten Members, eight of which are coastal States, have been registered with the Director General of the ILO. At present only two countries have ratified i.e. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Argentina.</p><p>  It is generally accepted that attention within the marine sector will focus on the International Labour Organisation Work in Fishing Convention (ILO C188), after the MLC 2006 comes into force. </p></reply>

The Plan is premised on the principle that through accessibility improvements to the public transport system for people with disabilities, access for all people will be improved.</p><p>  This is being done as extensively as possible having regard to the availability of resources. However, it is inevitable that some people, because of the severity or nature of their disabilities, will not be able to travel on public transport services (or may not be able to do so at all times). In these cases, specialised transport services provided by specialist agencies may be the most appropriate form of transport.</p></reply>

This allocation of such funds is related to the planned sale of State assets, clarification has been sought from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the timelines involved.  Once appropriate funding arrangements are put in place, the NRA will be in a position to prepare the project implementation schedule.</p></reply>
