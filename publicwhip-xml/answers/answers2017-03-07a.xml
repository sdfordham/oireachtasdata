In addition, as part of the Government&rsquo;s initiative on the North East Inner City, I awarded a grant of &euro;35,000 this year to Fire Station Artists' Studios, Buckingham Street, to assist in providing additional studio space in conjunction with Dublin City Council.</p><p>In terms of investment by my Department, I recently announced details of more than &euro;9 million in capital funding for 56 arts and culture centres across the country.  This capital scheme is the most significant investment in arts and cultural centres in a decade and will target investment at a range of different facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces.</p><p>Eight of grants relate to artist studios and creative spaces amounting to a total of &euro;850,000.  These are set out in the table to the question which will be published in the official report.</p><p>A full list of organisations to benefit from funding under Stream 1 and 2 of the Arts and Cultural Capital Scheme 2016-2018 is available on my Department's website.</p><p>Furthermore, I will be announcing a new small capital grants Scheme in the coming weeks which will be geared towards providing grants of up to &euro;20,000 to not-for-profit organisations with a defined arts and cultural remit.  Organisations with artists' studios will also be eligible to apply under this new scheme.</p><p><b>TABLE</b></p><p><b>Artists' studios and creative spaces funded under the Arts and Cultural Capital Scheme </b><table><tr><th>Firkin Crane Cork </th><th>&euro;150,000 </th></tr><tr><td>A4 Arts Studio &amp;amp; Community Education Centre Limited, Dublin </td><td>&euro;22,800 </td></tr><tr><td>Fire Station Artists Studio, Dublin </td><td>&euro;30,643 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Aerial Creation Centre, Limerick </td><td>&euro;35,0000 </td></tr><tr><td>Dance Limerick </td><td>&euro;75,015 </td></tr><tr><td>Custom House Studio </td><td>&euro; 43,274 </td></tr><tr><td>Old Post Office Clones /Monaghan County council </td><td>&euro;144,077 </td></tr><tr><td>Birr Stage Guild </td><td>&euro;32,844 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>&euro;848,653 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for the protection of architectural heritage.  The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p><p>Under Section 54 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a planning authority may add to or delete from its record of protected structures, a structure, a specified part of a structure or a specified feature of the attendant grounds of a structure.  Such a structure, specified part of a structure, or specified feature remains on the record of protected structures until such time as the planning authority deletes it.  Provision is made in the Act for the carrying out of works to protected structures either by way of planning permission or on the foot of a declaration received from a planning authority that certain works that would not materially affect the character of a structure are exempted development.  There is a duty of owners and occupiers to protect structures from endangerment.  Where structures become endangered or unauthorised development has been or is being carried out, the planning authority has the powers to take appropriate action.</p><p><i></i>As Minister, and in terms of being a prescribed body under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001-2015, I also have a role whereby development proposals that may impact on our built heritage are referred by a planning authority to my Department so that recommendations can be made as appropriate to avoid or mitigate any such impacts.</p><p>Under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts 1930-2014, my Department has established and maintains the Record of Monuments and Places, which affords legal protection to over 120,000 recorded archaeological sites and monuments in the State.  Anyone proposing works to a monumentÂ that isÂ included in the Record of Monument and Places must give my Department two months prior notice before works can start.</p><p>My Department has a number of measures at its disposal to facilitate the maintenance and restoration of major historical or cultural sites.  As Minister, I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at approximately 750 sites and in such cases there is a statutory duty to maintain the national monument.  Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW).  Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians.</p><p>My Department is also providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the OPW in 2017 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership.  OPW undertakes the care and maintenance of national monuments in my ownership or guardianship (of which there are approximately 750).  My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care.</p><p>There is a number of ways in which my Department acts in respect of possible heritage sites/buildings deemed to be at risk.  One of these is the receipt of applications for funding for the repair, conservation, preservation or safeguarding of protected structures, sites or monuments.<b></b>Financial support is being provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings.</p><p>I launched a new &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme - for the repair and conservation of protected structures on 21 October 2015.Â  This scheme operated in 2016 and is being operated in 2017, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  It is expected to support in excess of 330 projects across the country in 2017 and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.Â  </p><p>The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.Â  This fund, administered through the local authorities, supported 57 projects nationally in 2016. It seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.Â  The scheme is operating again in 2017.</p></reply>

From my experience the response to the <i>Creative Ireland Programme,</i>and to the significant increases in funding for the arts and culture which I secured in Budget 2017, have been widely welcomed across the sector.</p><p>This is a cross-Government initiative to mainstream culture and creativity in the life of the nation and to promote individual, community and national wellbeing.  The Creative Ireland Programme embraces the whole cultural sector, bringing together all those involved in the arts, film, broadcasting, visual arts, cultural heritage, the Irish language and Gaeltacht, with Government Departments and State agencies. </p><p>The core proposition of this programme is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.  The programme is based on five pillars:</p><p>- Enabling the creative potential of every child</p><p>- Enabling creativity in every community</p><p>- Investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure</p><p>- Establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production</p><p>- Unifying our global reputation.</p><p>In Budget 2017, I secured &euro;5m to commence the implementation of the Creative Ireland programme which includes an ambitious plan to deliver 10 major initiatives by the end of this year.  Further details of these initiatives are available on<i></i>.</p><p>It is important to note that the delivery of the Creative Ireland Programme, while under the aegis of my Department, will primarily be through, and in partnership with, existing agencies, local authorities, cultural institutions and State bodies.  For example I have already made a specific allocation of &euro;1m out of the &euro;5m available to the local authorities towards the implementation of the 2017 Creative Ireland Plans and it is the local authorities that will decide how this money will be spent.  Significant funding will also be provided for <i>Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca</i>on the Easter Bank holiday.</p><p>The objectives of the Programme will also be delivered through the Arts Council, the Irish Film Board, the Heritage Council, Culture Ireland and the national cultural institutions.  All of the institutions received substantial increases in funding this year, which waswarmly welcomed.</p></reply>

This work contributes to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to produce a National Heritage Plan and it is also meeting Ireland&rsquo;s obligations as a Party to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.  This will be the third such plan for Ireland, and it will capture the actions for biodiversity that will be undertaken by a wide range of government, civil society and private sectors to achieve a long term vision for Biodiversity: <i>&ldquo;That biodiversity and ecosystems in Ireland are conserved and restored, delivering benefits essential for all sectors of society and that Ireland contributes to efforts to halt the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystems in the EU and globally&rdquo;.</i></p><p>The draft Biodiversity Action Plan was developed in cooperation with an inter-departmental Biodiversity Working Group, and the Biodiversity Forum which represents various interested sectors of Irish society.  I invited views of the public on the draft Plan on 21st of December 2016. </p><p>90 submissions were received, and these will be published on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.npws.ie,</i>with a summary of the views provided and with comment on the main strands of the submissions made.</p><p>I recognise the value of Natural Heritage Areas in conserving this country&rsquo;s rich biodiversity and in providing connectivity and resilience to the Natura network.  I note also that there has been a substantial response on this particular matter in the public consultation process.  Therefore I will ensure that an action to continue to collect information on sites which are potential Natural Heritage Areas will be included in the Action Plan.</p><p>However, I am required under European Directives to focus efforts at this time on the completion of the designation process for the Natura network of SACs and SPAs, and to work through a Conservation Objective setting exercise for these sites, and furthermore a process to identify the Conservation Measures required to safeguard the network.  Such tasks demand considerable resources and my Department is therefore constrained in the commitments it can make in regard to further work on proposed Natural Heritage Areas at this time.</p><p>At present there are 148 Natural Heritage Areas designated under the Wildlife Acts - 75 raised bogs and 73 blanket bog sites.  I am pleased to note that County and Local Development Plans continue to aim to protect both the designated Natural Heritage Areas and the many proposed NHAs which were published in the 1990s.</p></reply>

The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department has been involved in the monitoring of hen harrier at the national scale for nearly twenty years.  National breeding surveys have been undertaken on a five yearly basis and the recent national survey, undertaken in 2015, estimated the population in Ireland to be between 108 and 157 breeding pairs.  It is therefore a very scarce species.  Over the last 15 years or so it has been estimated that the national population of hen harriers has declined by more than 30%.  Research and monitoring initiatives undertaken by my Department and other bodies have identified likely pressures acting on the population that include continued afforestation; wind farm development; and agricultural intensification as well as possible increases in predation that are likely to be linked to the recently recorded declines.  These led to the decision to develop a Hen Harrier Threat Response Plan.  The primary focus in developing this plan is to set out a comprehensive framework of measures to ensure the recovery of the hen harrier population, and its continued conservation, in Ireland.   </p>  <p>  Development of the Hen Harrier Threat Response Plan is being led by my Department in cooperation with other Departments whose remits impact on the hen harrier and its supporting ecology.Â  In July 2014 my Department established an inter-Departmental Steering Group, incorporating representatives fromÂ the key Departments to assist in the development of the Plan.Â In addition, a Stakeholder Consultative Committee has also been established to assist in drafting the Plan. The Committee is chaired by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and includes representatives from the forestry, agriculture and wind farm sectors.  As a key stakeholder, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is represented on both the Steering Group and the Stakeholder Consultative Committee.</p>  <p>  The Inter-Departmental Steering Group has met on eight occasions.  The main issues regarding land uses, wind farming, forestry and agriculture have been investigated and discussed in detail by the Steering Group and the Stakeholder Consultative Committee.  The report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on this matter has also been taken into account.   </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are in active discussions with the key Departments at this time in order to finalise the draft Plan shortly.  It will be shared for discussion with the Stakeholder Consultative Committee and will then undergo a public consultation and screening for Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment.Â  </p>  <p>  Substantial work has been, and is being, carried out by my Department, and the other stakeholders, in setting the key issues around managing the recovery and conservation of the hen harrier population in Ireland, with full recognition of the concerns of landowners and the other key groups involved in the development of this Plan.</p></reply>

The development and promotion of this sector will provide opportunities for economic growth and jobs in rural areas in particular, by facilitating businesses to leverage their local tourism assets to support activities such as canoeing, cycling, angling, surfing, and hill walking.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development, which was published in January, contains a number of specific measures for delivery by a range of Departments and agencies to develop and promote activity tourism in rural areas. </p>  <p>  For example, I will be providing funding of &euro;7 million this year through the Rural Recreation Scheme for new recreational infrastructure and the maintenance of existing infrastructure.Â  The scheme will be opened for applications shortly and all counties, including Sligo and Leitrim, will be invited to submit applications.</p>  <p>  My Department will work with Waterways Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland to develop and promote Blueways on the Royal Canal, Grand Canal and Barrow Canal and on the Shannon navigation, with a capital investment of &euro;6 million over the period 2017-2019.   </p>  <p>  My Department will also develop a Public Outdoor Recreation Amenities Plan, in association with a number of State agencies, to transform the provision of outdoor recreation facilities and services on public-owned land and waterways over the next five years.</p>  <p>  I am confident that investment in the infrastructure that supports recreational activities in this growing sector will bring tangible benefits for those living in rural Ireland in terms of increased tourist numbers and job opportunities.  For example, the Blueway Flagship Initiative, which was launched in June 2016, is bringing tourism to the rural areas of Cavan, Leitrim, Longford and Roscommon, by connecting 22 towns and villages along the River Shannon and the Shannon-Erne Waterway, through a Blueway.</p></reply>

This is a cross-Government initiative to mainstream culture and creativity in the life of the nation and to promote individual, community and national wellbeing.  This will focus on boosting cultural provision and participation in communities and harnessing the goodwill and engagement generated by the 2016 commemorative programme.</p><p>The core proposition of this programme is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.  The <i>Creative Ireland Programme </i>is the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in <i>Culture 2025/&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach,</i>the draft cultural policy which I published last year and which sees a vibrant cultural ecosystem as essential to society.</p><p>The programme is based on five pillars:</p><p>- Enabling the creative potential of every child</p><p>- Enabling creativity in every community</p><p>- Investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure</p><p>- Establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production</p><p>- Unifying our global reputation</p><p>The <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i>is supported by significant additional resources which are being directed towards the arts and culture sector.  In Budget 2017 I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board.  The increase in the Arts Council's allocation in 2017 is &euro;5 million, or 8%, and will assist the Council greatly in implementing its 10-year strategy Making Great Art Work (2016-2025).  I also secured an increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board, representing a 14% increase in its annual budget. </p><p>Budget 2017 also includes:</p><p>- increased funding for all of the National Cultural Institutions;</p><p>- an increase of &euro;1 million for Culture Ireland;</p><p>- an additional &euro;1 million to the Heritage Council; and</p><p>- funding of &euro;5m for the implementation of the <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i>. </p><p>I also recently announced details of more than &euro;9 million in capital funding for existing dedicated arts and culture centres across the country.  The Arts and Culture Capital Scheme is the most significant investment in arts and cultural centres in a decade and will target investment at a range of different facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces.  This kind of investment is at the centre of what I am trying to achieve through <i>Creative IrelandProgramme</i>and the <i>Action Plan for Rural Development.</i>In this regard, I announced funding of &euro;1M for Wexford Arts Centre.</p><p>All of this represents real and substantial funding increases across the arts and cultural area and has been welcomed across the sector.  It re-affirms the commitment of this Government to progressively increase funding for the arts as the economy improves, as set out in <i>the Programme for a Partnership Government</i>. </p><p>I understand that the source of the reference quoted by the Deputy is a Council of Europe research project and that many European countries, including ten EU member states, are not included in the data.  I understand also that the data is not standardised and is not comparable across countries.  For example, local authority expenditure on the arts, the artists' exemption tax relief, expenditure on public service broadcasting and the Irish language are not included in the figures for Ireland but comparable figures are included in the data for some other countries.</p><p>I have previously stated that further research on this issue is warranted.  The issue of a definition of culture and of capturing public expenditure on culture is an element of the draft <i>Culture 2025</i>framework policy, which was sent to the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for input in July 2016.</p></reply>

The Arts Council is dedicated to supporting a vibrant community of visual artists, visual arts groups and organisations so that the public can experience the highest standard of visual arts, in urban and in rural parts of Ireland.  The strategic context for the Arts Council&rsquo;s support all areas of arts practice is set out in<i>Making Great Art Work: Arts Council Strategy (2016 &ndash;2025).</i>This describes how the Council will lead the development of the arts in Ireland over the next decade.  Its strategy has five priority areas: the artist; public engagement; investment strategy; spatial and demographic planning; and developing capacity.</p><p>The Arts Council offers a number of complementary supports so that visual artists can develop their practice and create artistic work.  Through its partnership with <i>Culture Ireland</i>and a number of Cultural Institutions, the Council supports representation of visual artists internationally.  A number of schemes and initiatives have been established by the Arts Council towards the support of visual arts and full details can be accessed on the Arts Council website at the following link:</p><p><i> </i></p><p>In Budget 2017, I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council of &euro;5m, or 8%.  The increase will assist the Council in implementing its 10-year strategy.  It also reaffirms the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to progressively increase funding for the arts as the economy improves.</p><p>Artists may benefit under the artists' exemption tax relief (Section 195 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA 1997).  The first &euro;50,000 per annum of income earned by writers, composers, visual artists and sculptors from the sale of their work is exempt from income tax in Ireland.  </p><p>In December, I announced that my Department in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection would devise a mechanism during 2017 to assist self-employed artists who have applied for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance.  I have been in contact with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection on the matter and officials of our two Departments have already begun working on this initiative in consultation with the Arts Council.  The scheme will be a pilot scheme and is part of the <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i>launched in December.  Details of the pilot scheme will be announced as soon as possible.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, in 2016, I provided capital funding of &euro;150,000 over a three year period for the development of the Irish language and Cultural Centre referred to by the Deputy.

This is a cross-Government initiative to mainstream culture and creativity in the life of the nation and to promote individual, community and national well-being.  This will focus on boosting cultural provision and participation in communities and harnessing the goodwill and engagement generated by the 2016 commemorative programme.</p><p>The core proposition of this programme is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal well-being and achievement.  The <i>Creative Ireland </i>Programme is the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in <i>Culture 2025/&Eacute;ire </i>Ild&aacute;nach, the draft cultural policy which I published last year and which sees a vibrant cultural ecosystem as essential to society.</p><p>The programme is based on five pillars:</p><p>- Enabling the creative potential of every child</p><p>- Enabling creativity in every community</p><p>- Investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure</p><p>- Establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production</p><p>-Unifying our global reputation</p><p>Specifically the 5<sup>th</sup>Pillar - <i>Unifying our Global Reputation</i>- is about presenting a coherent representation of Ireland to the world as a creative people.  This will seek to capture the overarching narrative of Ireland&rsquo;s unique creativity and cultural heritage, and builds on the work of <i>Culture </i>Ireland, a division of my Department, which has an existing remit to promote Irish arts worldwide.  The Government&rsquo;s intentions in this regard were welcomed when I launched the <i>Creative Ireland </i>Programme on the international stage in New York in January and in London last week.</p><p>In addition, the <i>Action Plan for Rural </i>Development, which I launched with the Taoiseach last month, is the first whole-of-government strategy aimed at people living and working in rural Ireland.  It aims to unlock the potential of rural Ireland through a framework of supports at national and local level which will ensure that people who live in rural areas have increased opportunities for employment locally, and access to public services and social networks that support a high quality of life.</p><p>The Action Plan is an overarching structure for the co-ordination and implementation of initiatives right across Government which will benefit rural Ireland. It takes a cohesive and coordinated approach across the whole of Government to the implementation of both economic and social policies that impact on rural communities. </p><p>The Plan contains 276 actions which aim to improve both the economic and social fabric of rural Ireland spread across five pillars. </p><p>Arts and Heritage are covered under the fourth pillar of the plan - Fostering Culture and Creativity in Rural Communities.</p><p>The key objectives of this Pillar are to;</p><p>- Increase access to the arts and enhance cultural facilities in rural communities.</p><p>- Further develop and enhance culture and creativity in rural Ireland through the establishment of culture teams and creativity hubs as part of the <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i></p><p>- Promote the Irish language as a key resource in Gaeltacht and other rural communities.</p><p>These policy initiatives are supported by significant additional resources which are being directed towards the arts and culture sector.  In Budget 2017 I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board.  The increase in the Arts Council's allocation in 2017 is &euro;5 million, or 8%, and will assist the Council greatly in implementing its 10-year strategy Making Great Art Work (2016-2025).  I also secured an increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board, representing a 14% increase in its annual budget. </p><p>Budget 2017 also includes:.</p><p>- increased funding for all of the National Cultural Institutions;</p><p>- an increase of &euro;1 million for Culture Ireland;</p><p>- an additional &euro;1 million to the Heritage Council; and</p><p>- funding of &euro;5m for the implementation of the <i>Creative Ireland Programme.</i></p><p>I also recently announced details of more than &euro;9 million in capital funding for existing dedicated arts and culture centres across the country.  The Arts and Culture Capital Scheme is the most significant investment in arts and cultural centres in a decade and will target investment at a range of different facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces.  This kind of investment is at the centre of what I am trying to achieve through <i>Creative Ireland Programme </i>and the <i>Action Plan for Rural Development</i>. </p><p>All of this represents real and substantial funding increases across the arts and cultural area and has been welcomed across the sector.  It reaffirms the commitment of this Government to progressively increase funding for the arts as the economy improves, as set out in <i>the Programme for a Partnership Government.</i></p><p>These initiatives and additional funding will all support the achievement of the objectives set out in the questions.</p></reply>

Longford.  The Plan contains over 270 actions to be implemented by a range of Government Departments, agencies and other bodies to progress the economic and social development of rural Ireland.  It is the first time a framework such as this has been developed to provide a co-ordinated approach across Government to the economic and social development of rural areas. </p><p>In relation to the implementation of the LEADER Programme, over 3,000 Expressions of Interest requesting funding of over &euro;140 million have been received since the new programme was launched in July 2016.  The Local Action Groups are now concluding calls for proposals and working with potential applicants to develop and finalise project applications in each area.  A significant increase in project approvals and payments is expected as the year progresses, and a total of &euro;40 million has been provided for the LEADER Programme in my Department&rsquo;s Estimate this year.</p><p>Minister of State Michael Ring has secured an allocation of &euro;5 million for the CL&Aacute;R programme for 2017 and details of the particular measures to be funded will be announced shortly.</p><p>I have secured funding of &euro;12 million for an enhanced Town and Village Renewal scheme this year and I will be launching the first phase of this scheme shortly. Â As part of the scheme, I intend to launch a pilot project to encourage residential occupancy in rural towns and villages and this phase will be launched in the second half of the year. </p><p>My Department is working with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Local Authorities on an on-going basis to facilitate the roll-out of the National Broadband Plan.  An Implementation Group has also been established to oversee the implementation of the actions contained in the Report of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce, which was published last December.  The Implementation Group will meet for the first time this week and will be co-chaired by myself and Minister Naughten.</p><p>Yesterday, An Taoiseach and Minister of State Ring convened the inaugural meeting of a new Atlantic Economic Corridor Taskforce in Castlebar.  The Taskforce will provide a platform for collaboration between stakeholders from the private sector, the public sector and the wider community, to identify how best an economic corridor can be created along the Atlantic seaboard region.  The Atlantic Economic Corridor concept aims to contribute to effective regional development by creating sufficient scale along the western part of Ireland to match other regions &ndash; and particularly the East coast - in attracting Irish and multinational investment, growing jobs and supporting vibrant local communities.</p></reply>

This will focus on boosting cultural provision and participation in communities and harnessing the goodwill and engagement generated by the 2016 commemorative programme.</p><p>The core proposition of this programme is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal well-being and achievement.  The <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i>is the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in <i>Culture 2025/&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach</i>, the draft cultural policy which I published last year and which sees a vibrant cultural ecosystem as essential to society.</p><p>The programme is based on five pillars:</p><p>- Enabling the creative potential of every child</p><p>- Enabling creativity in every community</p><p>- Investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure</p><p>- Establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production</p><p>- Unifying our global reputation</p><p>Specifically the 5<sup>th</sup>Pillar - <i>Unifying our Global Reputation</i>- is about presenting a coherent representation of Ireland to the world as a creative people.  This will seek to capture the overarching narrative of Ireland&rsquo;s unique creativity and cultural heritage, and builds on the work of <i>Culture </i>Ireland, a division of my Department, which has an existing remit to promote Irish arts worldwide.  The Government&rsquo;s intentions in this regard were welcomed when I launched the <i>Creative Ireland </i>Programme on the international stage in New York in January and in London last week.</p><p>In addition, the <i>Action Plan for Rural </i>Development, which I launched with the Taoiseach last month, is the first whole-of-government strategy aimed at people living and working in rural Ireland.  It aims to unlock the potential of rural Ireland through a framework of supports at national and local level which will ensure that people who live in rural areas have increased opportunities for employment locally, and access to public services and social networks that support a high quality of life.</p><p>The Action Plan is an overarching structure for the co-ordination and implementation of initiatives right across Government which will benefit rural Ireland.  It takes a cohesive and coordinated approach across the whole of Government to the implementation of both economic and social policies that impact on rural communities. </p><p>The Plan contains 276 actions which aim to improve both the economic and social fabric of rural Ireland spread across five pillars.</p><p>Arts and Heritage are covered under the fourth pillar of the plan - Fostering Culture and Creativity in Rural Communities.</p><p>The key objectives of this Pillar are to;</p><p>- Increase access to the arts and enhance cultural facilities in rural communities.</p><p>- Further develop and enhance culture and creativity in rural Ireland through the establishment of culture teams and creativity hubs as part of the <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i></p><p>- Promote the Irish language as a key resource in Gaeltacht and other rural communities.</p><p>These policy initiatives are supported by significant additional resources which are being directed towards the arts and culture sector.  In Budget 2017 I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board.  The increase in the Arts Council's allocation in 2017 is &euro;5 million, or 8%, and will assist the Council greatly in implementing its 10-year strategy Making Great Art Work (2016-2025).  I also secured an increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board, representing a 14% increase in its annual budget. </p><p>Budget 2017 also includes:</p><p>- increased funding for all of the National Cultural Institutions;</p><p>- an increase of &euro;1 million for Culture Ireland;</p><p>- an additional &euro;1 million to the Heritage Council; and</p><p>- funding of &euro;5m for the implementation of the <i>Creative Ireland Programme.</i></p><p>I also recently announced details of more than &euro;9 million in capital funding for existing dedicated arts and culture centres across the country.  The Arts and Culture Capital Scheme is the most significant investment in arts and cultural centres in a decade and will target investment at a range of different facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces.  This kind of investment is at the centre of what I am trying to achieve through <i>Creative Ireland Programme </i>and the <i>Action Plan for Rural Development. </i>In this regard, I announced funding of over &euro;728,000 for 3 projects in Sligo and Leitrim.</p><p>All of this represents real and substantial funding increases across the arts and cultural area and has been welcomed across the sector.  It reaffirms the commitment of this Government to progressively increase funding for the arts as the economy improves, as set out in <i>the Programme for a Partnership Government.</i></p><p>These initiatives and additional funding will all support the achievement of the objectives set out in the questions.</p></reply>

The region is unique in that it provides an interface between the economies of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Each of the counties in the region has its own characteristics and its own economic ties with areas both North and South of the Border. The region faces a number of challenges because of the peripherality of some of its areas and its potential exposure to the impact of Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs for the North West and North East regions, which is overseen by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor, T.D., is seeking to develop the potential of the region through enhanced cooperation between public and private stakeholders to support enterprise growth and job creation. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Action Plan for Rural Development, which I launched recently, includes a number of measures to support the region, including through the development of cross-Border tourism initiatives.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Simon Coveney, T.D., also recently launched a consultation process on the development of a new National Planning Framework which will provide a basis to support more effective regional development in the future.</p>  <p>  In light of the initiatives outlined above, I do not have any additional plans at this point in time to develop a Border development zone. However, the outcome of the National Planning Framework process should help to inform the potential for the development of the Border region in the long-term.</p></reply>

The Plan contains over 270 actions to be delivered by a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other bodies to support the economic and social development of rural Ireland.  The Plan was developed following an extensive consultation process with stakeholders to identify the key issues affecting rural communities today.</p><p>The Action Plan contains measures across a range of policy areas which will help to maintain and revitalise rural communities. For instance, a key component of the Plan is to support the creation of jobs throughout the regions to ensure that people who live in rural areas have increased opportunities for employment locally.  The Plan aims to deliver 135,000 extra jobs outside of Dublin by 2020.</p><p>Our towns and villages are the heart of our rural communities, and it is important that we implement measures to help breath life back into these rural towns and villages.

Nonetheless, the Government is committed to working with all stakeholders to find solutions to the sustainability of the post office network in this changing business environment.  The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a number of commitments in this regard.</p>  <p>  Two Working Groups were established last year to progress the recommendations in the report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group which was published in January 2016. The first Group, chaired by Mr. Bobby Kerr, examined, on behalf of An Post, issues such as the number and spatial distribution of post offices, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts, and training and qualifications for post office employees. Arising out of the Group&rsquo;s work, a report was submitted to An Post for their consideration on 23 December 2016.   </p>  <p>  For my own part, I established the Post Office Hub Working Group last year to identify potential models under which the post offices could act as community hubs, especially in rural areas. I chaired the meetings of this Working Group, which included representatives from An Post, the Irish Postmasters Union and rural representatives.  This Group has completed its work and I will report to Government shortly on its findings.</p>  <p>  In addition, my officials have been examining the potential for the post offices to deliver other services, including the renewal of motor tax.  A number of options for the delivery of this service have been identified and proposals are currently being finalised in consultation with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.   </p>  <p>  The implementation of any of the recommendations or proposals which have emerged from this process will require the agreement and input of An Post, which is a commercial State company.</p></reply>

The annual Census of Industrial Production, which is a component of SBS, is based on survey returns from a sample of about 2,000 industrial enterprises, combined with estimates for other enterprises based on Revenue data.  The sample returns give an indication of whether the enterprise is involved in exporting goods.</p><p>  In 2014, there were 16,497 active industrial enterprises in Ireland.  Of these, 11,183 employed less than three persons.  The following information relates to the responses to the survey from industrial enterprises which employed three or more persons. </p><p>  From the sample returns for 2014, it is estimated that 54% of industrial enterprises with three or more persons employed exported some goods and exports accounted for about 65% of turnover.  In the case of SMEs, 52% exported some goods and their exports accounted for 46% of turnover.</p><p>For large enterprises, employing 250 persons or more, 85% exported some goods and exports accounted for 71% of turnover.  These are very broad estimates and a more detailed breakdown is not available from the SBS survey questions.</p><p>While corresponding figures for other EU Member States or further breakdowns of these CSO figures are not available, some breakdowns of trade by size of enterprise are available from the Trade by Enterprise Characteristic (TEC) statistics.</p></reply>

The 2013 data was transmitted to Eurostat by the deadline in 2015, however at that time the data was marked confidential. </p>  <p>  During 2015, the Central Statistics Office implemented major revisions to the trade data to take account of new methodology for the treatment of trade in aircraft.  As this revised time series of data had not been published nationally, and was still being incorporated into Balance of Payments and National Accounts statistics, the TEC data submitted to Eurostat were temporarily marked as confidential.  When the nationally published data were fully revised in early 2016, the confidentiality marks for the 2013 TEC tables were removed and resubmitted to Eurostat in March 2016. </p>  <p>  As a result of this temporary confidentiality flagging of 2013 data, the "Entrepreneurship at a Glance 2016 " report includes 2012 data, but not 2013 data for Ireland.  We expect that the OECD will update their website to take account of the 2013 data, and the CSO are currently liaising with Eurostat to clarify issues surrounding the 2014 data before publication on the Eurostat and OECD databases.</p></reply>

I have also attended all meetings of the European Council, both formal and informal. At all my meetings I have highlighted and explained Ireland&rsquo;s particular concerns arising from Brexit, including in relation to Northern Ireland and the peace process; the Common Travel Area; our interwoven economies; and the future of the EU. </p>  <p>  I met with First Vice President of the Commission, Frans Timmermans, in Government Buildings on 21 February. </p>  <p>  His visit followed those of other Commissioners, including Mr. Moscovici and Ms. Vestager, which have served to underline the Commission's understanding of Ireland's particular concerns and support for our approach.Â </p>  <p>  The meeting was friendly and constructive, with Commissioner Timmermans demonstrating a good understanding of Ireland's concerns, and offering strong Commission support for our approach in addressing these.</p>  <p>  I visited Brussels on 23 February and met with the Prime Minister of Belgium, Charles Michel, and the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. I also participated in a business event organised by the Ireland Belgium Business Association, supported by the Embassy of Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  Continuing this strategic programme of engagement, I again travelled to Brussels on 2 March, when I had separate meetings with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk; the recently elected President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani; a number of key Members of the European Parliament; and the chief Commission Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier. </p>  <p>  The focus of these meetings was on Brexit as well as the future direction of the EU. In addition to setting out our concerns around the economic and trade implications of the UK departure, I again explained in detail the peace process in Northern Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement, and the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland that must be recognised from the start and reflected in the final agreement.Â President Tusk, President Tajani and Mr Barnier understood and acknowledged these issues and expressed their openness to working closely with us in the negotiations ahead.</p>  <p>  It was also useful to highlight these issues to key MEPs. The European Parliament will adopt a resolution on Brexit in the coming months and will ultimately have to approve the final exit deal, so it is very important that we continue to engage to seek support there.</p>  <p>  With regard to the debate on the future of the EU, I underlined to all my interlocutors the need for unity and the importance of our core European values which are central to our continuing peace and prosperity. </p>  <p>  I believe that we must deliver for our citizens and, in that context, press ahead in areas of particular relevance, including jobs, growth, investment, the Single Market and Digital Single Market. I will continue to make these points in the build up to the Summit in Rome at the end of this month and into the future.</p>  <p>  The next European Council meeting will take place on 9 March. The draft agenda, published by the General Secretariat of the Council, envisages that the Maltese Presidency will provide an overview of progress on the implementation of earlier European Council conclusions, and that the European Council will look at a number of the most pressing issues, including in relation to Jobs, Growth and Competitiveness; Security and Defence; Migration; and External Relations. Decisions are also to be taken on the position of the President of the European Council and establishing the European Public Prosecutor's Office. The agenda is in order from Ireland's perspective and I have therefore not sought any particular items for inclusion on it. I will be making a full statement on the European Council, as I always do, on Wednesday 8 March.</p></reply>

The sample returns give an indication of whether the enterprise is involved in exporting goods.</p>  <p>  In 2014, an estimated total of 199,200 persons worked in enterprises employing three or more persons: 103,300 of these were in SMEs and 95,900 were in large enterprises.  Exporting firms accounted for 82.2% of jobs in respondent enterprises and they accounted for 73.0% in SMEs and 89.0% in large enterprises.

The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers. The immediate objective of the revaluation programme is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in more than 150 years is conducted as soon as possible. Following this revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation, in accordance with Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions and decisions with regard to the selection of rating authority areas for revaluation is his sole prerogative. Section 19(1) of the 2001 Act empowers the Commissioner, after consultation with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the rating authority concerned, to make a Valuation Order specifying a rating authority area over which a revaluation is to be conducted. I am advised that the revaluation programme which began with South Dublin, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council areas has also been rolled out to the Dublin City Council area, Waterford City and County Council area and Limerick City and County Council area.</p>  <p>  The current phase of the National Revaluation Programme known as "ReVal 2017" covers revaluation of counties Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Kildare, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny for the first time since the nineteenth century. These are the nine counties referenced in Action No. 76 in the Government's Action Plan for Rural Development "Realising Our Rural Potential", published on 23 January 2017. The revaluation of these nine rural counties is expected to be completed in September 2017 and become effective for rates purposes from 2018 onwards.</p></reply>

The preliminary outcome of this review identified an anomaly, between the number of breath tests recorded on PULSE and the number of breath tests recorded on the recording equipment.</p>  <p>  In April 2016, new procedures were put in place by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the recording of the number of breath tests conducted at each MAT checkpoint, with additional instructions issued in May, 2016, including that the information being recorded on PULSE be verified on a monthly basis.</p>  <p>  In June 2016, a National Audit was directed by Assistant Commissioner, Traffic, of all the data recorded on the Garda PULSE system relating to the number of roadside breath tests conducted at MATs in each Garda Division, for the period 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2016. The data collated during the National Audit is currently being verified in conjunction with the Medical Bureau of Road Safety. It is anticipated that the matter will be finalised in the second quarter of 2017 and it will not be possible to give the statistical information sought until the data has been verified by way of the National Audit.</p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have assured me that no issues stem from this audit with regard to the performance of MAT checkpoints or prosecutions emanating therefrom.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  </p>  <p>  The Garda Reserve was established in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to enhance the links between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and  local communities and consists of voluntary unpaid members, drawn from the community, to support the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Reserve perform policing  duties as determined by the Garda Commissioner, while accompanied by full time Garda&iacute;. Their role is to provide local patrols and participate in crime prevention initiatives targeted at specific local problem areas. Reserve members are also involved in policing major incidents and events, and in providing other operational support to full time Garda&iacute;. In recent years the Garda Commissioner has conferred further powers on reserve members under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Road Traffic Act 1961 and has also decided that they should carry out more duties including the serving of summonses, and the issuing of Fixed Charge Penalty Notices where offences are detected.</p>  <p>  The "Programme for a Partnership Government" includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures. Reserve members have undergone training in many of the skills required to be an effective full-time member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is important that we build on the very real contribution that they are making to the policing of communities right across the country. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p>  <p>  In relation to what steps that might be taken to ensure that the expanded Reserve is used to best effect in support of communities  I am informed that the Garda Reserve Management Office is undertaking an audit of the experience and skills of Reserves which, when completed, will assist Garda management in considering the future role to be played by the Reserve including whether additional powers should be conferred on Reserve members.  Work is also well advanced on the development of a recruitment plan with the objective of recruiting and training 300 new Reserves annually starting later this year, to bring the strength of the Reserve up from its current strength of 690 members to 2,000 by 2021. </p></reply>

Probate functions are also carried out by County Registrars at District Probate Registries in a number of provincial court offices. </p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that while the staff member who dealt with probate matters in the Castlebar Office retired recently, management in the office were aware of the pending retirement and another staff member in the office has been trained and has commenced processing probate applications. The Castlebar Office will be reviewing all cases to identify urgent cases and priority will be given to probate applications where it is considered that extenuating circumstances so warrant. It is open to the executor, in the case referenced, to make an application to the Probate Section of the Castlebar Court Office to have the probate matter expedited, if they have not already done so. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has also informed me that the current waiting times in the Probate Office in Dublin for Grants of Representation are 20 weeks for applications lodged by a solicitor and 28 weeks for personal applications. There have been a number of staff changes in the Probate Office during the last year due to retirement and promotion and this has impacted on the waiting times. The examination of probate applications requires a thorough legal examination of documents and it takes a new staff member a period of at least six months to acquire a satisfactory knowledge in this area. As new staff members become more proficient, the waiting times will reduce.   Additional staff resources are now being provided in Dublin to address the current situation and I am optimistic, subject to full staff capacity being in place, that there will be a reduction in waiting times this year. Efforts continue to be made to give priority to urgent applications. The backlogs in the probate system are a cause for concern and review of the probate system is being carried out at present.  It is anticipated that a report with recommendations for the modernisation of the process will be presented by mid 2017 to the Senior Management Team of the Courts Service and to the Courts Service Board for their consideration.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. </p>  <p>  The Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021 envisages a range of actions to be implemented by State, voluntary and community sector organisations aimed at preventing and responding to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to supporting this strategy, and in 2015 a number of Garda units were brought together to leverage their experience and expertise in investigating serious crimes against the person, including sexual offences, to form the Garda National Protective Services Bureau (GNPSB). </p>  <p>  The GNPSB is a specialist team dedicated to making sure each and every complaint relating to child protection, human trafficking and domestic and sexual violence is thoroughly investigated and handled correctly. In addition, the GNPSB is responsible for working with other agencies to manage sex offenders in the interest of community safety. I am informed by the Commissioner that as of 31 January 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 29 Garda members and 8 civilians assigned to the GNPSB.</p>  <p>   As part of the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 Protective Services Units (PSUs) are to be established in every Garda Division with specially trained staff. These PSUs will ensure a consistent approach to domestic abuse and sexual crime, which will be supported by the national Bureau. The PSUs will work with the Garda Victim Service Offices in their area to ensure that the needs of victims are adequately catered for. I am advised by the Commissioner that these Divisional PSUs are being rolled-out in two phases. Phase 1 which will commence shortly, will involve the setting up of an initial three PSUs in the DMR West, Cork City, and Louth Garda Divisions over the next year on a pilot basis. The assessment of this pilot phase will inform the further roll-out to of PSUs to each Garda Division.</p></reply>

The preparation of a Gambling Control Bill, and of a number of related early measures for inclusion in the General Scheme of the forthcoming Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, continues on that basis. I intend to move forward as quickly as possible with the appropriate measures on both of these fronts. In that endeavour, I am being assisted by the staff of the Department of Justice and Equality who have been previously assigned to support me in this work in both the Gambling Policy and Civil Law Reform areas. Against that background I am not aware of any issues that are, as the Deputy has put it, hindering final drafting of the legislation concerned. I can also confirm that it remains my intention to bring forward the main Gambling Control Bill for government approval and publication, as the Deputy has anticipated, later this year.</p><p>Work on the preparation of the General Scheme of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is at an advanced stage in my Department. The General Scheme for this Bill will contain a range of provisions, many of them technical in nature, that are expected to relate to such matters as electronic courts services and some early amendments, as previously signalled, to gaming legislation. In that regard, we expect to bring forward a number of useful modernisation and clarification measures to the outdated Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956. In particular, it is hoped to address issues concerning minimum age for gambling activities, realistic stake and prize amounts and a clearer setting out of the circumstances for the conduct of certain activities. It is anticipated that the General Scheme of the miscellaneous Bill will be brought to Government by the T&aacute;naiste this month for approval both to publish it and to submit it for  pre-legislative scrutiny and for detailed drafting to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. </p><p>In parallel to these imminent measures, work also continues in bringing forward the main Gambling Control Bill building on the General Scheme that was published in 2013. Deputies should be cognisant that the preparation of legislation providing for the regulation of a large, multi-million euro economic activity, with significant cross-border and electronic on-line operations, will be a major and complex undertaking.</p><p>In support of this work, I published, on 23 February 2017, a study by University College Dublin under Dr. Crystal Fulton which I had commissioned at the end of 2016. The aims of the study, entitled &quot;Developments in the Gambling Area - Emerging trends and issues supporting the development of policy and legislation in Ireland&quot;, were to identify developments in the area of gambling, inclusive of all aspects of gambling such as technological innovation and international legislation, and, to identify new or emerging legislative and policy issues in the area of gambling not currently represented in the original General Scheme and which may need to be addressed in new legislation.  The study can be accessed through the internet link .</p><p>Along with officials of my Department, I am continuing to consult with relevant stake-holders. We are particularly mindful to hear from those who work with persons for whom gambling has become a problem.  In that spirit, I look forward to discussing quite soon, with the Deputy and other Members, the gambling measures that will be contained in the General Scheme of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and, after that, to discussing the main Gambling Control Bill when it, in turn, is approved by Government for publication.</p></reply>

The Tribunal has discretion to hear any claim at a hearing before three members of the Tribunal and a person who is dissatisfied with a decision given by one member may also have his/her claim so heard.  In the latter case the member who gave the initial decision will not be one of the three members of the Tribunal who hear the appeal.  At appeal, an application is considered &quot;de novo&quot;.  Consequently, the Tribunal may uphold the decision at first instance, increase/decrease an award or make no award.  The number of appeals received in each of the years in the period 2012 -2017 are as follows.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>General Scheme - Appeals</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>2</td></tr></table></p><p>The Deputy should note that Tribunal members, who are practising barristers and practising solicitors in the Courts system, provide their services on a part-time basis. Under the terms of paragraph 6 of the Scheme of Compensation for Personal Injuries Criminally Inflicted, the Tribunal is obliged to determine applications and may award ex-gratia compensation &quot;<i>on the basis of damages awarded under the Civil Liability Act</i>&rdquo;.  Each case is addressed on the basis of its individual circumstances.  While applications are processed with the minimum of formality compared to court proceedings where compensation is being claimed under the Civil Liability Acts, in making their decisions Tribunal Members must be satisfied that all supporting documentation submitted is in order.  In some cases there can be delays pending the availability of all required documentation and some cases are complex in terms of medical conditions.  As a result, waiting times can vary significantly and no data is currently available on what constitutes an average waiting time.</p></reply>

In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of approximately 300 Garda Reserves.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that there are currently in the region of 2,000 civilians undertaking administrative and technical duties within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Increasing the number of civilians in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by 2,000 to 4,000 civilians will effectively double this figure and represents a medium term target of 20% civilians by 2021.  This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently with 14% civilians, more into line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff.  I have requested the Garda Commissioner, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, to prepare a 5 year plan to achieve this 20% target by way of a twin-track approach (i) a civilian by default policy and (ii) the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to operational policing posts and backfilling by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.  The "civilian by default" policy refers to a policy where all new posts, other than operational policing posts, and non-operational policing posts that become vacant, are to be filled by suitably qualified civilian staff. </p>  <p>   I am advised by the Garda Authorities that the estimated cost of an additional 2,000 civilians is &euro;86 million including 20% administration costs and employer&rsquo;s PRSI on a full year basis.  This estimated cost is contingent on the make up of the civilian staff profile in the 5 year plan currently in development and in particular on the qualifications and skills required on the part of civilians to backfill posts occupied by redeployed Garda&iacute;.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Deputy will be aware of the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment to significantly increase parental leave in the first year of a child&rsquo;s life over the next five years.

Probate functions are also carried out by County Registrars at District Probate Registries in a number of provincial court offices. </p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the current waiting times in the Probate Office in Dublin for Grants of Representation are 20 weeks for applications lodged by a solicitor and 28 weeks for personal applications. </p>  <p>  Where a person elects to apply for a Grant without the assistance of a solicitor the process requires significant support from the Probate Office and is more resource intensive.  The Probate Office is actively involved in preparing the necessary paperwork and in servicing queries from the applicants by way of telephone, e-mail or post. Each personal applicant is required to attend at the Probate Office in person by prior appointment to complete the application process.</p>  <p>  All applications for Grants of Representation in deceased persons' estates are made on foot of a number of mandatory legal documents which must be furnished by the applicants and these require detailed checking by the Probate Office to ensure that the estate of the deceased person is administered correctly and in accordance with the law.  All applications are assessed on the basis of the date on which they are lodged, an approach which provides fairness and equity to all applicants. Priority is given to probate applications which display a particular urgency or where it is considered that extenuating circumstances so warrant. In such circumstances it is open to applicants to bring the matter to the attention of the Probate Office.  </p>  <p>  The Courts Service also informed me that there have been a number of staff changes in the Probate Office during the last year due to retirement and promotion and this has impacted on the waiting times.  The examination of probate applications requires a thorough legal examination of documents and it takes a new staff member a period of at least six months to acquire a satisfactory knowledge in this area. As new staff members become more proficient, the waiting times will reduce. </p>  <p>  Additional staff resources are now being provided in Dublin to address the current situation and I am optimistic, subject to full staff capacity being in place, that there will be a reduction in waiting times this year.  Efforts continue to be made to give priority to urgent applications.  The backlogs in the probate system are a cause for concern and review of the probate system is being carried out at present.  It is anticipated that a report with recommendations for the modernisation of the process will be presented by mid 2017 to the Senior Management Team of the Courts Service and to the Courts Service Board for their consideration.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  </p><p>The Garda Reserve was established in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to enhance the links between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities and consists of voluntary unpaid members, drawn from the community, to support the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Reserve perform policing  duties as determined by the Garda Commissioner, while accompanied by full time Garda&iacute;.  Their role is to provide local patrols and participate in crime prevention initiatives targeted at specific local problem areas.  Reserve members are also involved in policing major incidents and events, and in providing other operational support to full time Garda&iacute;. In recent years the Garda Commissioner has conferred further powers on reserve members under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Road Traffic Act 1961 and has also decided that they should carry out more duties including the serving of summonses, and the issuing of Fixed Charge Penalty Notices where offences are detected.</p><p>The &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures.  Reserve members have undergone training in many of the skills required to be an effective full-time member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is important that we build on the very real contribution that they are making to the policing of communities right across the country. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment.  Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014 and the current Government is committed to steadily increasing Garda numbers.  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.

The sector, which predominantly operates in the commercial sphere, recruits students from a wide range of international markets with a particular focus on students from within the European Union.  Students from the European Economic Area (EEA) are under no obligation to register for an immigration permission while in the State and will have no interaction with the immigration authorities.  Similarly, participants in programmes of short duration who are from outside the EEA will not require to register for an immigration permission for their stay in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the main group of English language students who will have any significant interaction with the immigration authorities will be adult non-EEA nationals participating in examination focused programmes of twenty five weeks or longer duration.  ELT providers seeking to recruit from this particular student group are required to satisfy a number of minimum standards in order to be listed by my Department on the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP). </p>  <p>  Several of the standards imposed by my Department are intended to ensure that measures are put in place by the providers for the financial protection to students under the ILEP.  These standards are set out in the Criteria for English Language Programmes publically available and published on the website (www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/ELT%20criteria%20for%20ILEP%20Updated%2009%20November%202016%20.pdf/Files/ELT%20criteria%20for%20ILEP%20Updated%2009%20November%202016%20.pdf) of the Irish Immigration and Naturalisation Service.</p>  <p>  Specifically, they include important measures to protect students who make payments of fees up front for their courses and also to protect students in the event of an ELT provider goes out of business. </p>  <p>  With regards to quality standards, my Department works closely with their colleagues in the Department of Education and skills, who have responsibility for the quality of education delivered. This cooperation includes a joint inspection regime including unannounced visits to the schools.  As outlined above my role is limited to those schools on the ILEP and in that regard, I am informed by the Irish Immigration and Naturalisation Service (INIS) of my Department that the programmes of one hundred and twenty five (125) ELT providers are listed on the ILEP at this time.</p></reply>

Unannounced inspections of educational providers by the immigration authorities began in November 2015.

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p><p>I am informed that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Garda Division on the 31 January 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available was 672, of which 21 were assigned to the Divisional Drugs Unit.  It is important to note that all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences or otherwise.  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs supply.  This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.  When appropriate, the work of the Division is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that 838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 66 of whom have been assigned to the DMR North Garda Division.  I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation including the Divisional Drugs Units.</p><p>The investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling illicit drug activity.</p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that the following table gives a breakdown of the number of Garda members assigned to the DMR North Divisional Drugs Unit  by rank in each of the years 2014 to 31 January 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available.  <table><tr><th>DMR North Divisional Drugs Unit Personnel 2014 - 2017</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Sergeant</td><td>Garda</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>2</td><td>14</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>3</td><td>22</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>3</td><td>18</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>*2017</td><td>3</td><td>18</td><td>21</td></tr></table></p><p>*As of 31 January 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that 838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 24 of whom have been assigned to the Waterford Division.  I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.  </p><p>The following table shows the number of Community Garda&iacute; assigned to Waterford Garda Station for each of the years since 2007 to 31 January 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, as provided by the Commissioner.<table><tr><th>Community Garda&iacute; Waterford Garda Station  2007-2017</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>2017*</td><td>13</td></tr></table></p><p>*As of 31 January 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available</p></reply>

The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs supply and works closely with dedicated Divisional Drugs units and other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.

Legal proceedings in relation to a number of similar such applications are currently before the courts, and accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that I am somewhat limited in what I can say on the matter.  However, I can say that there has been an exponential increase in the number of such applications and with it increasing concerns around potential abuse of the Directive in relation to such cases.  This has given rise to a current caseload in the region of 10,500 applications overall which have to be assessed very carefully to ensure that any fraudulent applications or potential abuses of the Directive are detected and dealt with appropriately.   </p>  <p>  While every effort generally is made to process these applications as soon as possible, processing times will vary having regard to the volume of applications, their complexity, the possible need for the Visa Office to investigate, enquire into, or seek further information in relation to certain applications, and the resources available.  Unfortunately, due to the large number of applications waiting to be processed and the fact that such applications are processed in chronological order (i.e. based on date order of receipt), I cannot at this time give a definitive date as to when this application will be finalised.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.  </p>  <p>  In addition, applicants may themselves e-mail queries directly to the INIS Visa Office (visamail@justice.ie).     </p></reply>

In that document the EuropeanÂ Commission acknowledged the work undertaken by the Government in addressing the current shortage of housing, includingÂ 'Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness'.  This comprehensive Action Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector.  While the primary focus of the Action Plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time-bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector.  In my view the wording used by the Commission in relation to the help to buy scheme is not definitive, and merely points to the possibility that it could act to increase prices.  However, the impact of the Help to BuyÂ incentive on the property market generally cannot be considered in isolation from the impact of other measures contained in the Action Plan, which are primarily designed to increase supply.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Help to Buy incentive is not a broad based relief available for the purchase of any home by any buyer.  Rather,Â it is a targeted response that is aimed solely at first-time buyers, buying (or building) new residences.  This targeting is designed to help encourage the building of new homes, thereby increasing supply, by turning notional demand into real demand.  By restricting this initiative solely to new dwellings and new self builds, it is anticipated that the resulting increase in demand for affordable new build homes should encourage the construction industry to provide for an additional supply of such properties.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the property market on an ongoing basis.  I have also committed to commissioning an independent economic impact assessment of the Help to Buy incentive which will look at a variety of issues relating to the scheme'sÂ impact on theÂ property market.</p></reply>

ThisÂ effortÂ is being led by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, RuralÂ and Gaeltacht Affairs in conjunction with Ministers and officials from other Departments, as well as the Local Authorities and a range of other stakeholders.  A variety of actions included in this plan aim to assist in improving rural towns and making rural Ireland a better place to live.  These include the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, under which funding of up to &euro;12 million per annum is available to revitalise rural towns and villages, while there is also a commitment to develop and pilot an initiative to encourage increased residential occupancy in town and village centres.</p>  <p>  MyÂ Department isÂ engaged in a range of actions relating to theÂ action plan including tax related measures for the farming and fisheries sectors.  However,Â theÂ action plan does not provide forÂ additionalÂ tax incentive schemes targetedÂ specifically at theÂ owners of property in rural towns and villages.  However,Â the Deputy may be aware of a number of tax incentives that are already available to the owners of residential property in all areas, including rural towns and villages.</p>  <p>  TheÂ Home Renovation Incentive provides for an income tax credit for homeowners or landlords of residential property, who carry out repair, renovation or improvement works on their property.  It provides for tax relief by way of an income tax credit of 13.5% of qualifying expenditure.  Qualifying work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 (including VAT).  The maximum qualifying cost for the purpose of the incentive is (&euro;30,000 including VAT), which equates to a maximum credit of &euro;4,050.  The tax credit is payable over two years following the year in which the work is paid for and I have extended the scheme for a further two years in the recent Budget.</p>  <p>  In addition, (limited) relief is available for expenditure on approved gardens and buildings in the State in accordance withÂ Section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. To qualify for this relief the relevant building must be determined by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to be of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest and the Revenue Commissioners must be satisfied that reasonable access to the building is afforded to the public.</p></reply>

The intention to backdate the scheme to this date was announced at that time with a view to avoiding any potential interruption in house sales, by purchasers who may otherwise have deferred purchases, pending the commencement of the incentive.</p>  <p>  One of the primary policy aims of the incentive is to assist those struggling to save for the deposit required in purchasing a house.  Individuals who contracted to purchase new homes before the announcement of the incentive, did not need the assistance of the State to fund the required deposit.  Such individuals made their purchasing decisions on the basis of the information available to them at the time of purchase, and could not have expected a subsequently introduced tax relief to also be available to them. Similarly, those who commenced the drawdown of agreed mortgages in respect of self built properties before 19 July 2016, could also not have expected a subsequently introduced tax relief to be available to them.  It is not clear from theÂ example providedÂ by the Deputy, whether the couple purchasing off plans entered into a contract to purchase on 17 July, or merely put down a booking deposit.  If it was the former then the couple would not be eligible for a tax refund under the Help to Buy incentive, as the contract would have been entered into before 19 July 2016.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I do not believe that having separate criteria for applicants that are purchasing a new build, or those undertaking a self build, means that either group are disadvantaged in the manner suggested by the Deputy.  The scheme aims to assist a first-time purchaser with funding aÂ deposit at the outset ofÂ the purchase or self building process.Â  However, there are inherentÂ differences in the relevantÂ processes.  For a purchaser buying a new build, the first major expenditure is the point at which they enter into a contract to purchase and pay over the deposit, which is usually 10% of the value of the home.  This is usuallyÂ some time before a mortgage is drawn down or a purchase is completed.  For a self-build property, the first major expenditure usually coincides withÂ the draw down of theÂ first tranche of the relevantÂ mortgage, and thus the refund is payable at this point in respect of self builds.</p></reply>

TheÂ Programme for a Partnership GovernmentÂ sets out a number of important and practicalÂ measures which can be taken to improve the position ofÂ mortgagorsÂ and in particular variable rate mortgage holders.  Firstly, it wishes toÂ promote competition in the supply of mortgage finance.Â  To that end, theÂ Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has been asked toÂ work with the Central Bank to set outÂ options forÂ Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and toÂ improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.Â  The CCPC has now commenced this work, with aÂ public consultation phaseÂ closing on 20 March 2017 and the CCPC will then produce a final report by the end of May 2017.</p>  <p>  Secondly, the Government considers that measures to encourage and promote a greater level of switching in the mortgage market would alsoÂ help boost the level of competition in the market for existing mortgages.  In particular, the Programme for Government considers that the development of a code of conductÂ for switching mortgage provider would be a useful and practical initiativeÂ which would have the potential to deliver savings to many existing mortgage holders.  To that end, the Central Bank has commenced a programme of further research on this topic and the Bank has indicated that the output of this work will be used to inform its consideration of the need for any future work in the area of mortgage switching and specifically around the need for a mortgage switching code.Â  However, Central BankÂ research hasÂ already shownÂ the scope for borrowers to save money by switching mortgages and the CCPCÂ has launched a mortgage switching tool to assistÂ consumers (which itself notes the findings of the Central Bank research of cases where borrowers could make savings).  In conjunction with this,Â my Department has also launched a media campaign to raise awareness and promote consumer switching in the retail financial product area, including mortgages.Â  This initiative was funded in its entiretyÂ by AIB and PermanenttsbÂ as was agreed in the context of both banks restructuring plans.Â  The campaign website www.switchyourbank.ie provides straightforward practical information and support on switching and I would strongly encourage people to visit it.</p>  <p>  While the Central Bank does not have a statutory role in relation to prescribing the rates that mortgage lenders charge on their loans, the Bank does require that all mortgages are advertised and sold in accordance with the requirements of financial services legislation (including Central Bank Codes), and that consumers who choose a given mortgage product (or to switch to a new product) are treated in accordance with these requirements in the context of the product they have chosen. Â Also,Â it couldÂ be noted that when it appeared before theÂ Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on 8 December last, the Central Bank indicated that it had not seen any sign of interest rates on mortgages being increasedÂ by entities which acquiredÂ loans from lenders which initially provided the mortgage.Â  </p>  <p>  In overall terms, the Government is of the opinion that increased competition rather than administrative controls is the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole but without giving rise to potentially undesirable consequences for the provision of new mortgage lending.  This is a policyÂ area that the Government will keep under active review in itsÂ ongoing engagement with mortgage lenders and in implementing the Programme for Government commitments to help deliver on a long term basis better outcomes for all mortgage borrowers.Â Â </p></reply>

This includes decisions in relation to products and lending as determined by the banks. </p>  <p>  There are a number of initiatives that have been introduced to assist SMEs with access to credit.Â  I would particularly recommend that the firm set out in the details suppliedÂ make contact with theÂ Credit Review Office (further informationÂ below):</p>  <p>  In 2014, I launched an SME online-tool, a website which makes it easier for small businesses to find information on over 170 Government business supports from 30 Departments and Agencies.  On answering eight quick and simple questions, businesses are returned a list of all available Government business supports tailored to their business requirements, with further information on each support and contact details for follow-up.  I would encourage all SMEs, at any stage of their development, to check which supports are available.  The Supporting SMEs online tool can be found at www.supportingsmes.ie. </p>  <p>  The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by participating banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  They also look at cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. Further details on this process are available at www.creditreview.ie.Â  </p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector, as reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government, and sees it as a key engine of ongoing economic growth.Â  Consequently, my Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate indigenous viable SMEs, including those in the construction sector, to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.</p></reply>

Furthermore, my officials meet the banks on a quarterly basis to ensure an informed understanding of the wider SME bank lending environment which assists the development and implementation of policies aimed at ensuring SME access to finance and increased competition in the SME lending sector.</p><p>It should be noted that the results of the most recent Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey, covering the period April to September 2016, show that, when pending applications are excluded, 84% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved.Â  Demand for credit remains subdued and the latest survey shows only 39% of SMEs in the construction sector requested bank finance in the previous six months a decrease of 9% from September 2015. Furthermore, the main reason for not applying for bank finance is that SMEs do not need it (86%).Â  Further results from the survey can be found at. </p><p>I note that the data recently published by the Central Bank of Ireland for Credit Advanced to Irish Resident Small and Medium Sized Enterprises shows that new lending to the Construction sector (construction of buildings carried out on contract) for Q1 to Q3 2016 totalled &euro;59 million compared to &euro;50 million for Q1 to Q3 2015.Â  New lending to Property Investment / Development enterprises for Q1 to Q3 2016 totalled &euro;961 million a growth of &euro;582 million (c. 154%) when compared to the same period in 2015. This data can be found in Table A.14.1 Credit Advanced to Irish Resident Small and Medium Sized Enterprises published on the Central Bank's website.</p><p>Separately, the Deputy may also wish to note that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) has been actively involved in a number of important initiatives which enhance the availability of finance to the construction sector in line with the terms of the Fund's mandate.  This includes its investments in:</p><p><b>- </b>Activate Capital - which is an innovative non-bank financing platform that has the potential to provide funding for substantial numbers of new homes in Dublin and the other major urban centres in which demand is most pronounced; </p><p>- Ardstone Residential Partnership - which is a residential equity investment fund that is focused on delivering residential units to the market over the short-to medium-term; and </p><p>- Wilbur Ross Cardinal Commercial Real Estate Mezzanine Debt Fund - which has funded a number of residential developments in recent months.</p><p>The Government remains committed to the SME sector, including those involved in the construction sector, and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department, working with other relevant Departments, Bodies and Agencies, such as the Credit Review Office, will continue to advance policies to ensure the availability of both bank and non-bank credit so as to ensure that viable Irish SMEs have sufficient access to finance.</p></reply>

I am advised that the categorisation of claims by the requested loan-to-value ratios as of end February 2017 was: <table><tr><th>Loan-to-value (LTV)</th><th>90% </th><th>85% to 90%</th><th>80% to 85%</th><th>Below 80% (and above 70% minimum LTV)</th></tr><tr><td>Total (449)</td><td>120</td><td>175</td><td>83</td><td>71</td></tr></table></p><p>The purpose of the application stage of the HTB process is such that would-be first-time buyers can determine whether, and to what extent, they qualify for the incentive.Â  As the data from the application stage are only an indicator as to possible take-up of the incentive, for example, an applicant may not proceed to claim stage or may not get mortgage approval, the application statistics are not collated by County.</p><p>Successful applicants are required to provide information on the location of the qualifying residence in finalising their claims, and therefore Revenue is in a position to provide certain details on the location of HTB claims made.Â  However, to protect the confidentiality of taxpayer information, I can only provide a breakdown based on properties situated in Dublin and in provincial locations.  Up to the end of February 2017, Revenue has processed 449 claims and the relevant breakdown is as follows:<table><tr><th>Location</th><th>Connacht/ Ulster</th><th>Dublin</th><th>Leinster <br /><br />(outside Dublin)</th><th>Munster</th></tr><tr><td>Number (449)</td><td>31</td><td>179</td><td>157</td><td>82</td></tr></table></p><p>The number of applications and claims for the incentive continue to be too small to materially affect the previously estimated cost of the scheme.  In this regard, the Deputy may wish to note that at Budget time,Â it was estimated thatÂ the Help to Buy incentiveÂ wouldÂ cost &euro;40m per annum, but &euro;50m in 2017 due to the backdating of the relief in respect ofÂ properties which became eligible for the scheme since 19 July 2016.</p></reply>

Â For example, the National House Construction Cost Index, published by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, provides an indication of labour and material cost developments within the construction industry.  The latest available figures suggest annual house construction cost inflation of 0.1 per cent on average between 2010 and 2016.  A number of construction sector organisations also conduct periodic assessments of construction costs in Ireland. Â For example, in May of last year, the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI) published a report The Real Cost of New House Delivery which examined the component costs of housing delivery in the Dublin region.Â  </p>  <p>  As part of Rebuilding Ireland, the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, detailed studies into construction costs are currently ongoing.  A Working Group, chaired by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, has been established to work with industry representatives in order to benchmark housing delivery input costs in Ireland.  It is my understanding that the Housing Agency is also coordinating an independent review and analysis of delivery costs in Ireland.  Both of these studies are due to be completed during the first half of 2017. Â </p>  <p>  With regards to the construction projects undertaken by my Department over the past six years, a project to update fire and electrical systems has recently been completed in offices shared by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The programme wasÂ managed by the Office of Public Works.  My Department made a fixed contribution to the total cost of the project.</p></reply>

Â Once a financial services entity is authorised in one European Economic Area (EEA) Member State the financial services passport allows that firm to carry out its authorised permitted activities in any other EEA state.

However,Â I assume that the Deputy is referring to theÂ Rent-a-Room scheme, which is provided for in Section 216A Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.Â  ThisÂ scheme was introduced with the aim of increasing the availability of rented residential accommodation.  The room or rooms must be used for the purposes of residential accommodation, i.e. the occupants are effectively using the room on a long-term basis, either on its own or in conjunction with other parts of the residence, as a home.  The relief does not apply to rooms that are used for business purposes.</p>  <p>  Under the scheme, sums arising to an individual in respect of the letting, for residential purposes, of a room or rooms in his or her home, including, for example, sums arising from lettings to students for an academic year, and the provision of meals or other services supplied in connection with the letting, may be exempt from income tax where they meet the conditions of the schemeÂ and where the individual's total gross income from such letting(s) is below the annual limit for the tax year in question.  This limit was increased to &euro;14,000 with effect from the 2017 tax year.</p>  <p>  Income from the provision of accommodation to occasional visitors for short periods, including, for example, where the accommodation is provided through online accommodation booking sites, does not qualify for relief as the visitors use the accommodation as guest accommodation rather than for residential purposes.  The tax treatment of such income is dependent on the nature of the accommodation irrespective of whether or not this is arranged through an internet letting platform or other form of intermediary.</p>  <p>  I am not favourably disposed to the extension ofÂ rent-a-room relief to income earned from the provision of accommodation through platforms such as the company in question, I am mindful such an extensionÂ could lead to unfair competition in the guest accommodation sector generally, by placing B&amp;B and guest house operators who provide accommodation in the course of a trade at an unfair disadvantage.</p></reply>

However, by way of context, it is important to point out that income tax and VAT accounted for around two-thirds of the total tax yield last year.Â  Furthermore, it should be noted that corporation tax as share of all Exchequer tax revenues in 2016Â is in-line with previous parameters.Â  For example, throughout the first half of the last decade, corporation tax receipts varied in a range between 14-16.5 per cent as a share of all Exchequer tax revenues.Â Â  </p>  <p>  My Department and the Revenue Commissioners have highlighted on many occasions that corporation tax is highly concentrated in Ireland, with approximately 80 per cent of receipts received from the multinational sector.Â  In addition, in 2016, it is estimated that the top ten tax paying companies accounted for around 37 per cent of the total corporation tax receipts, down slightly from an estimated 41% in 2015. Â It is for these reasons that a potential concentration risk in corporation tax receipts, was acknowledged and highlighted in the Budget 2017 document.</p>  <p>  In terms of the sustainability of the corporation tax receipts, following the 'level shift' in 2015, these receipts increased by a more modest 7 per cent in 2016. Â Â For 2017, the corporation tax forecast produced by my Department with assistance fromÂ the Revenue Commissioners is prudent.Â  Overall growth of 5.0 per cent in corporation tax is projected for 2017, which is comfortably below the year-on-year growth recorded in 2016.Â Â Â  </p>  <p>  Finally, to sustain the hard won improvements inÂ our public finances, we must guard against complacency and maintain our prudent management of the public finances in order toÂ provide a sustainable budgetary platform upon which funding for the provision of public services can be provided for the years ahead. Â Accordingly, we are committed to complying with the fiscal rules, which are designed to ensure that increases in public expenditure are sustainably financed and decoupled from dependence on cyclical or windfall revenues.</p></reply>

However, as I advised in my response to PQ numbers 130 and 156 of 14 February 2017, section 865(4) provides that that right is subject to a statutory limit of four years from the end of the chargeable period to which the claim relates.  That statutory limit is binding on Revenue as well as on the taxpayer.  Decisions of the Tax Appeals Commission in differing appellant circumstances published recently have confirmed that there is no discretion in the application of the four-year rule for claiming repayments. </p>  <p>  Section 865Â of theÂ TCA was introduced in 2003 and provides a statutory general right to repayment of tax as well as payment of interest, subject to a four year time limit.Â  It provides that no repayment may be made based on claims submitted more than four years after the end of the period to which they relate.  Prior to that there was no statutory right to repayment, though a taxpayer could sue for repayment under common law.Â  The Minister at the time indicated that, in introducing the new arrangements, he was satisfied that they achieved the necessary balance between establishing a fair and uniform system for taxpayers while providing necessary protection for the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  At the same time, the general right of the Revenue Commissioners to raise assessments or make enquiries as respects taxpayer returns was also reduced to four years though in certain circumstances, for example where fraud or neglect is suspected, or in the context of the application of general anti-avoidance rules, Revenue's right to enquire or raise assessments is not time limited.  Previously, the general time limit on the raising of assessments by Revenue had been ten years. The convergence of these various time limits on four years creates parity between a taxpayer's right to repayment and Revenue's powers to raise assessments. </p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that any repayment claims made in relation to the deduction ofÂ Non Principal Private Residence chargesÂ against rental profits that are received within the statutory time limits, as they apply to each year of assessment, will be retained and processed when the outcome of the Appeal case is known.  Revenue also advises that they are developing a simple, easy to use process to facilitate taxpayers who may wish to lodge a claim in relation to this matter and that this will be available in the very near future. </p></reply>

This was followed by aÂ Council DeclarationÂ by EU countries.</p>  <p>  Ireland made a commitment through the allianceÂ to review and expand its apprenticeship system.Â  An independent group produced the Review of Apprenticeship Training in Ireland, which was published in 2014.Â  The review contained a range of recommendations to expand participation of apprenticeship, including the establishment of an Apprenticeship Council.Â  The Council was established in November 2014 and immediately began work on a call for proposals for the development of new enterprise-led apprenticeships.Â  The call issued in January 2015 and over 80 proposals were received from industry stakeholders working with education and training providers.Â  The Apprenticeship Council has been working with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them in sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.  The funding for planned and forecast expansion in 2017 will see an additional &euro;20 million provided.Â  </p>  <p>  An Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020 was launched on the 26th January 2017 and sets out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period to 2020.  50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes over the lifetime of the Action Plan, a doubling of current activity.Â  The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals in 2017.Â  </p>  <p>  The Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship, the first of the new programmes developed through the Apprenticeship Council&rsquo;s first call for proposals, launched in September 2016 and an Industrial Engineer Apprenticeship commenced in November 2016.Â  13 further new apprenticeships are due to launch later this year in various sectors including medical devices, polymer processing and financial services.</p></reply>

Large amounts of research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children.</p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year. No allocation made for such pupilsÂ by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school.</p>  <p>  IÂ also announced that an additional 900 teaching posts will be provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model. The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additionalÂ teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools. This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011, when 5265 teachers were allocated, as opposed toÂ provision for 7542 posts in the current school year.</p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model. Supports for children with special educational needs is a huge priority for this Government. We currently spend over &euro;1.6 billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  This investmentÂ will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocationÂ of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupilsÂ who require such support.</p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools will beÂ provided with a total allocation which includesÂ a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile.</p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need and pupils in each school.</p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school's profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This willÂ reduce the administrative burden on schools as they will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils, or pupils transferringÂ in to the school,Â who require resource hours, including those children with developmental coordination disorder dyspraxia.</p>  <p>  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications for newly enrolled pupils, for whom resource teaching hoursÂ may have been provided under the old model, as school will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the NCSE advised schools that there was no longer a requirement for schools to make applications for special education teaching supports for individualÂ pupils withÂ special education teachingÂ needs, as resourcesÂ would be provided for schools by theÂ profiled allocation.</p>  <p>  For the introduction of the new allocation model, from September 2017, the NCSE &lsquo;Low Incidence&rsquo; allocations which had been made for each school during the preceding year 2016/17 school year, have been used to establish the complex needs component of the new allocation model for each school.</p>  <p>  A model for the identification of pupils with complex needs in future is being devised by the NCSE, in consultation with the Health Service Executive and National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS). This model will take account of the qualification criteria for the selection of children for access to HSE Children Disability Network Teams.</p>  <p>  For the next re profiling of the model, the pupils with newly identified Complex Needs will be included in this revised allocation.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model. By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria it is expected that allocations made to school will beÂ sufficient to meet both current and future needs as they arise until the next review.</p>  <p>  Currently most schools' educational profilesÂ remain relatively constant from year to year.Â  Each year, some studentsÂ with additional teaching needs willÂ leave and others willÂ enrol, broadly balancing the school profile.</p>  <p>  The model will provide, from this year, additional resources to schools where it is expected that there will be additional needs. In protecting resources in schools where the profiles indicate that the levels of need areÂ lower than are currently provided for some additional capacity is also provided for in those schools. Accordingly, all schools should have the capacity to meet the needs of additional children enrolling in the school in the following school year without the need for additional or new resources.</p>  <p>  The modelÂ will, however,Â allow for some additional provision for veryÂ exceptional circumstancesÂ or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase veryÂ substantially prior to the next review of the model. The Inclusion Support Service,Â being established under the National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance. Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed veryÂ significantly since the allocation was made to the school,Â mayÂ an additional allocation of hours be made to the school.</p>  <p>  AÂ new Circular will be issued to schools shortly which will provide details of how the scheme will operate while details of the allocations for each school will also be provided to schools.</p></reply>

The Home Tuition Grant is an interim measure to provide for education until an educational placement is becomes available. When a school placement becomes available the Home Tuition Grant will be discontinued.</p>  <p>  The religious ethos of a school is not considered when determining the availability of a school placement.</p>  <p>  Article 44 of the Constitution and Section 30 of the Education Act 1998, provides that parents have a right to have their children opt out of religion classes if they so wish. The manner in which any school ensures that the right to opt out of religion classes is upheld is a matter for the school concerned.</p>  <p>  Each individual school must determine the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances having regard to local issues such as available space, supervision requirements and how the school concerned organises classes etc.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school&rsquo;s arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction. This is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard.</p>  <p>  The operation of all other recognised schools, is subject to ongoing inspection and evaluation. My Department's school inspectorate inspects the schools on an ongoing basis and this has included a Whole School Evaluation in certain cases. The findings of such Whole School Evaluations are published on my Department's website. In addition, the schools all engage in school self-evaluation, the findings of which are published on school websites.

The attention of the parents/guardians of the pupil concerned in this question should be drawn to the terms of this policy in the particular school and the process forÂ pursuing investigation of any bullying allegations enshrined therein.</p>  <p>  In relation to psycho-educational assessment myÂ Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides an educational psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through an assigned NEPS psychologist and in some cases through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are in the NEPS section of my Department's website. Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. This process is moderated through the school.</p>  <p>  I have made enquiries in the matter and can confirm that NEPS has not been contacted by the schoolÂ regarding the child inÂ question. I would advise therefore that the parents/guardians of theÂ childÂ should raise the matter, in the first instance, with the principal of the school concerned with a view to his / her discussing the matter with the assigned NEPS psychologist.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that an extended absence from school is a matter for the local Educational Welfare Service. The parents/guardians of the child inÂ this caseÂ should make contact with Tusla to seek advice on how the child can best pursue or recommenceÂ their Second Level education.</p>  <p>  My Department's NEPSÂ service is available to assist as appropriate, if requested by either the School Principal or the Educational Welfare Service.</p></reply>

Accordingly, my colleague Mr. Simon Coveney T.D., Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, on 19 July 2016 published &ldquo;Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&rdquo;, following Government approval of this comprehensive and ambitious Plan.  The full plan can be accessed at: .</p><p>My Department worked closely with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in developing this Plan, with a specific focus on student accommodation, and I very much welcome the commitments contained in the plan and I look forward to working with colleagues on a cross-Departmental basis to ensure that the commitments contained in the Plan are implemented as soon as practicable.</p><p>As outlined in the Action Plan for Education 2017 which wasÂ published on 6 February 2017 and in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan, my officials have been working closely with officials from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and with other relevant stakeholders with a view to implementing all of the relevant actions in relation to student accommodation that were detailed in Rebuilding Ireland.  This includes theÂ development of a national student accommodation strategy which is due for completion in Q2 2017 and which will set out a broad framework for delivery of an enhanced level of student accommodation.</p><p>In addition to this an inter-departmental steering group on student accommodation has been established which is chaired by the Deputy Secretary General of my Department.  This steering group is comprised of officials from my Department in addition to representatives from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance, the Higher Education Authority, the Irish Universities Association, the Technological Higher Education Association, the Union of Students in Ireland, the University of Limerick, Trinity College Dublin and the National Treasury Management Agency.</p><p>Turning specifically to UCD, I welcomed the launch of a new Student Accommodation Block in UCD in September 2016 which provided an additional 350 new student accommodation bed spaces on campus bringing total student accommodation now available on campus to 3,164.</p><p>The university also plans to develop this area of the campus as a vibrant residential sector and hopes to double resident numbers to just over 6,000 in the coming years.</p><p>UCD also provides a dedicated off-campus support office to its students to give advice and actively identify and register private individuals and companies who are interested in renting out rooms, apartments, and houses to UCD students.Â  Students can also seek advice from their Students Union, and other state organisations such as the PRTB and Threshold.</p><p>In addition to this, &euro;30,000 was provided to USI by the HEA to fund their 2016 #HomesForStudy campaign.  A Final Report on the 2016 campaign published by USI showed that at least 2,258 students accessed &ldquo;DIGS&rdquo; accommodation directly as a result of the campaign spearheaded by USI.  This is a significant win &ndash; win situation, as students get accommodation and homeowners can now earn up to &euro;14,000 a year tax - free providing this service.  The Government provided for an increase in the ceiling for exemptionÂ from income tax under the Rent-a-Room scheme in Budget 2017.  The ceiling has increased from &euro;12,000 to &euro;14,000 from 2017.</p><p>Funding for a full-time Student Housing Officer for the 16/17 academic year has also been provided by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to the Union of Students in Ireland.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.</p><p>Following a review of the staffing allocation forÂ Small Primary Schools, Budget 2017 announced two adjustments in relation to one teacher schools. Where the school is the sole primary school on an island the school will be able to appoint a second teacher.</p><p>In relation to single teacher schools generally with an enrolment of 15 or more pupils, the school can apply to the staffing appeals board for a second post where the single teacherÂ hasÂ pupils across 6 or more class groups.  This new measure is in recognition of the challenges faced by the teacher having to teach 6 class groups or more.</p><p>These arrangements will beÂ effective from September 2017 and will be set out in the staffing schedule circular for the 2017/18 school yearÂ which will be available on my Department's website in the coming weeks.</p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy had an enrolment ofÂ 15 on 30<sup>th</sup>September 2015.

The Basic Building Cost along with site specific Abnormal Costs, External Works costs and Fitted Furniture costs are used to calculate the predicted construction cost of a project ahead of a tender exercise.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s Basic Building Cost limit was first introduced in 1975 (&euro;136/m<sup>2</sup>). It reached a peak of &euro;1,230/m<sup>2</sup>in June 2006.  The cost limit was reduced for the first time ever in November 2009 to &euro;990/m<sup>2</sup>(a 19.5% reduction) and again in January 2011 to &euro;930/m<sup>2</sup>(a further 6% reduction).  The Basic Building Cost limit has undergone three increases since then &ndash; April 2014 (&euro;1,050/m<sup>2</sup>, +12.9%), June 2105 (&euro;1,150/m<sup>2</sup>, +9.5%) and February 2016 (&euro;1,210/m<sup>2</sup>, +5.2%) and currently stands at &euro;1,210/m<sup>2</sup>.  It should be noted that a significant proportion of the recent increases relate to improvements in building standards and not just construction inflation.</p><p>The Basic Building Cost limit is regularly adjusted to take account of construction inflation and changes in building standards. The Department continuously monitors tender details across all major school building projects, as well as trends in labour and materials costs, and periodically adjusts it&rsquo;s Basic Building Cost limit accordingly.

Introduction of the TTSI programme enabled the start of a process of development of technology transfer offices (TTOs) with appropriate skills, and access to funding for the management of intellectual property (IP), to facilitate meaningful interactions with business. Prior to the programme there was little or no such capability available within Ireland&rsquo;s HEIs.</p><p>The period of the Technology Transfer Strengthening Initiative (TTSI1) programme maps a period of evolution in the technology transfer and commercialisation system in Ireland. From a low baseline of technology transfer capacity from the Higher Education Institute (HEI) sector within the State, through the creation and management of the Initiative, Enterprise Ireland has been able to develop infrastructure within the HEI sector to support the engagement of businesses with the research base with a view to supporting those businesses that want to enhance their competitiveness.</p><p>A review of the technology transfer system shows that in 2005, prior to the introduction of TTSI1, HEIs across the State transferred technology and intellectual property to business by way of only 12 licences, option or assignment agreements (LOAs) with business and spun out five new companies. By the end of the funding period, in 2012, the average number of LOAs executed each year was up over seven-fold to 85 and the number of spin-out companies created each year was averaging 22, an increase of nearly 450%.</p><p>Further information on the first TTSI1 is available in the review of the programme:</p><p>.</p><p>TTSI continues and is now in its third phase which commenced this year and runs to 2021.</p><p>The national IP Protocol 2012 &ldquo;Putting public research to work in Ireland&rdquo; was developed by a task group comprised of leaders from industry, the investment community and TTOs.  The new protocol built on earlier guidelines and codes of practice, using the lessons learned from their use. In particular the protocol replaced three earlier documents:</p><p>- National Code of Practice for Managing Intellectual Property from Publicly Funded Research (Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, January 2004)</p><p>- National Code of Practice for Managing and Commercialising Intellectual Property from Public-Private Collaborative Research (Advisory Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, November 2005).</p><p>- Funding Agency Requirements &amp;amp; Guidelines For Managing Research-Generated Intellectual Property (February 2006).</p><p>In 2013 the Government established a centralised function with responsibility for technology transfer in the State which led to the creation of Knowledge Transfer Ireland, launched in May 2014. Knowledge Transfer Ireland (KTI) now has responsibility for setting direction for research performing organisations (RPOs) best practice to enable compliance with IP policy and procedures.</p><p>The publication of the national IP protocol in 2012, and its subsequent refresh in 2016, sought to establish policy and guidelines on the interactions between industry and Ireland&rsquo;s Higher Education Institutes, including the treatment of intellectual property.Â  It provides guidelines and sets expectations for the RPOs and for industry.</p><p>The national IP Protocol 2016 comprises two volumes:</p><p>(i) the National IP Protocol policy document which sets out the framework underpinning research collaboration and access to intellectual property from state-funded research</p><p>(ii) the IP Protocol Resource Guide which provides an overview of the national IP management guidelines and links to resources and template documents, available for industry and RPOs.Â  It also provides an overview of the knowledge transfer structures in Ireland and the kinds of agreements that can be used to formalise research-industry engagements.</p><p>The protocol explains the National IP Management Requirements and requires that RPOs have in place and operate internal IP management systems that meet or exceed these.  The protocol also includes &ldquo;good practice&rdquo; that will normally be followed.  However, industry and RPOs are free to adopt a different approach where this is in the best interests of successful relationships and research commercialisation.  Practices are also highlighted that may be followed if industry / RPOs choose to do so.</p><p>The IP Protocol is a key reference source for Ireland&rsquo;s HEIs and research funders. HEIs have developed IP policies that are in line with national guidelines and good practice.  These will include policy on spin-out formation.  The detail of policies will differ amongst institutions.</p><p>Responsibility to ensure implementation of IP policies is a matter for the relevant higher education institution.  I have not been informed of occasions where breaches of policy have occurred.</p><p>The Protocol and related information can be accessed on the KTI website at .</p></reply>

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools. This data is applied uniformly across all schools in the country.  The Pobal HP Index provides only one element of the data required for the assessment of schools, accordingly the HP score for the small area in which a school is located is not relevant to the new identification process.</p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme. Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.</p><p>Schools included in the list published by my Department on 13th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.</p><p>Schools which have not been included at this stage, including the schools referred to by the deputy, are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new model, which is fair and objective.</p><p>The implementation of a new objective, central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to ensure that levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by the model.</p><p>Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p><p>Further information is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at .</p></reply>

These students may find the demands of mainstream schools very difficult, or may have complex learning or other difficulties which require smaller class sizes. In order to be placed in a special school, a child must have a formal assessment of disability/professional report stating that s/he has a special educational need, which requires placement in a special school setting. The type of professionalÂ assessmentÂ will depend on the category of special educational needÂ of the child involved.</p><p>The enrolment of a child to a school, however, is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.  Where a parent seeks to enrol their child in a school and that school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p><p>SENOs are also a valuable source of support to parents who are actively sourcing a placement for their children.  SENO contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.  The NCSE has published a Guide for Parents and Guardians of Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs on Choosing a School,Â which is also available on their website.</p><p>The NCSE works in collaboration with the Educational Welfare Services of the Child and Family Agency which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child or can offer assistance where a child is out of school.  The EWS may be able to offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement withinÂ a pupil's area.

Furthermore, in recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time.

Large amounts of research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupilsÂ by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts will be provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additionalÂ teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011, when 5265 teachers were allocated, as opposed toÂ provision for 7542 posts in the current school year.</p>  <p>  The additional funding will provideÂ extra supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a huge priority for this Government.  We currently spend over &euro;1.6 billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  This investmentÂ will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocationÂ of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupilsÂ who require such support.Â </p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools will beÂ provided with a total allocation which includesÂ a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile. </p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need and pupils in each school. </p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school's profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This willÂ reduce the administrative burden on schools as they will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils, or pupils transferringÂ in to the school,Â who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  FullÂ details of the scheme will be set out in the Circular which will be published this week.</p></reply>

The Primary Curriculum 1999 is complemented by Guidelines on Traveller Education in Primary Schools (DES, 2002) and Intercultural Education in the Primary School (NCCA, 2005).  These guidelines promote an intercultural approach in the classroom and provide practical examples of how intercultural themes, including Traveller culture, can be accommodated through the various curriculum areas. </p>  <p>  The current history specifications at junior and senior cycle have the flexibility to look at different aspects of Irish history on a thematic basis or on the basis of local historical study.  Junior Cycle History is currently under review by the National council for Curriculum and Assessment andÂ will shortlyÂ go to public consultation.  The potential for Traveller history and culture to beÂ examined in this context will be fully explored. </p>  <p>  Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE) at junior cycle and the new Politics and Society subject at Leaving Certificate level also present opportunities to explore the theme of Traveller culture and society and the issues involved in questions of ethnic identity and interculturalism.  In Transition Year also,Â schools offer modules on interculturalism and many schoolsÂ examine Travellers as an ethnic group in this context.</p>  <p>  The Framework for Junior Cycle which was published in October 2012, is underpinned byÂ eight keyÂ principles - one of which is inclusive education - whereby the educational experience is inclusive of all students and contributes to equality of opportunity, participation and outcomes for all. </p></reply>

Variables used in theÂ compilation of theÂ HP Index includeÂ those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data is applied uniformly across all the schools in the country and are not affected by electoral boundaries.</p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model, applied across all schools,Â identified schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.Â </p><p>This has resulted in the addition ofÂ 15 new UrbanÂ Band 1 schools,Â 30 Urban Band 2 raised to Band 1, 51 new rural DEIS schools and 13 new Post-Primary schools.  Schools entering DEIS for the first time represent no more than 2% of all schools.</p><p>The implementation of a new objective, central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to ensure that levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by the model.</p><p>Once this workÂ has beenÂ completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a school in any area has not been included in the programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.</p><p>In the 2016/17 School Year there are 825 schools participating inÂ the DEIS Programme.

The Panel recommended a priority list, including the Milltown scheme at priority five, to my Department, which accepted the recommendations in full when approving the rural water allocations for 2016.</p><p>As only two demonstration group sewerage schemes can be advanced in any given year, funding will not be available to Monaghan County Council for the Milltown scheme until 2018 unless a scheme prioritised higher than Milltown is not be in a position to be advanced this year, whereby the Milltown scheme would be given a higher priority.  </p><p>It is intended to make interim funding allocations under the programme to the local authorities by the end of March 2017 and any reprioritisation of the Milltown scheme would be notified Monaghan County Council at this time.</p><p>A copy of the Expert Panel's report and consideration of all proposals under the Programme for 2016 for are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p></reply>

The length of the service level agreement and the fact that the agreement will include a programme of change are reflected in a Framework document, agreed with the Trade Unions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission.

At an overall level, 25,000 new homes per year are targeted to meet demand nationally.  The key objective of the Government's Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness is to increase and accelerate housing delivery, across all tenures, to help individuals and families find homes.</p><p>With regard to increasing the supply of private housing in particular, Pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland, entitled &ldquo;Build More Homes&rdquo;, has as its key objective a doubling of housing output, from approximately 12,500 homes in 2015, to deliver at least 25,000 homes per annum by 2021.  In order to support the supply of affordable housing and to ensure a steady supply of development land and planning permissions so that housing providers can plan ahead effectively in response to current and emerging demands in Donegal and other counties, Rebuilding Ireland sets out key actions which provide for: </p><p>-  active State-land management;</p><p>-  greater certainty in the planning process, including provisions introduced in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016;</p><p>-  targeted investment in enabling infrastructure, including through the &euro;200 million Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund; </p><p>-  competitive financing for developers to fund on-site housing infrastructure through ISIF;</p><p>-  reviewing and adjustment as necessary and practicable, in relation to construction cost inputs; and,</p><p>-  development of capacity and skills within the construction sector.</p><p>The Strategy for the Rental Sector published in December 2016 also contains a number of actions targeted at increasing the supply of properties to rent; these actions have been incorporated into the reporting under Rebuilding Ireland.  Updates on the implementation of Rebuilding Ireland, including those that will encourage the supply of housing nationally, are outlined in the first two Quarterly Progress Reports, covering the cumulative period from July to December 2016, available on <i>www.rebuildingireland.ie</i>.  The Third Quarterly Progress Report, covering Quarter 1 2017, is expected to be published in late April/early May.</p><p>A new monthly housing activity report is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:</p><p><i></i>. </p><p>It shows upward trends in activity in terms of planning permissions, commencements and completions; indeed, completions reached approximately 15,000 homes in 2016. </p><p>Of course, while building new homes is a key part of the overall delivery under Rebuilding Ireland, making better use of vacant houses and property is another key objective under Pillar 5 &ndash; Utilise Existing Stock.  A new National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy is currently being finalised and I have already announced a &euro;32m Repair and Leasing initiative for vacant housing, one of several initiatives under Pillar 5.  Other initiatives include the Buy and Renew Scheme which provides funding for local authorities to purchase and remediate vacant properties.  Under the auspices of the Cabinet Committee on Housing, chaired by An Taoiseach, the Government and I will be keeping the implementation of Rebuilding Ireland under regular and active review.</p></reply>

Section 180 also provides that, following a request by the majority of the house-owners, a planning authority must initiate procedures to take an unfinished estate in charge, where the authority has not commenced enforcement proceedings in respect of the estate within seven years of the expiry of the planning permission concerned.  In the case of an unfinished estate, where the planning authority has commenced enforcement proceedings within seven years of the expiry of the planning permission or considers that enforcement proceedings will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate, section 180 provides that, following a request by the majority of the house-owners, the authority may at its absolute discretion initiate procedures to take in charge the roads and some or all of the other services in the estate.  A planning authority may, for the purposes of section 180, hold a plebiscite to ascertain the wishes of the house-owners.</p>  <p>  My Department, by way of circular letter PD 1/2008 dated 26 February 2008, issued updated policy guidance to planning authorities on Taking in Charge of Residential Developments/Management Arrangements.  This advised each planning authority to develop or update, as appropriate, its policy on taking-in-charge by the end of June 2008, based on the following principles (among others):</p>  <p> - Certain core facilities/infrastructure to be taken in charge on request - public roads and footpaths, unallocated surface parking areas, public lighting, public water supply, foul and storm water drainage and public open spaces;</p>  <p> - The procedures for taking in charge to begin promptly on foot of a request by the majority of the residents in the development or by the developer, as appropriate.  Protocols, including time frames, must be set out by planning authorities to respond to requests for taking in charge.</p>  <p>  Each planning authority&rsquo;s policy on taking in charge is required to be made available to the public and published on its website, and the policy is reported on to the elected members on a regular basis, and at least once annually.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of Section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) I am specifically precluded from intervening in individual cases.  However my Department has made enquiries to Sligo County Council in relation to the estate the subject of this question and I have been informed that the vast majority of this estate has been completed to a satisfactory standard.Â  The portion of the lands which has been left unfinished has recently been sold and the new owners have met with the planning and enforcement sections of Sligo County Council to outline their intentions for the lands.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide housing authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas and I have no plans to amend the position in this regard.  The limits are broken into three different bands according to the authority area, with in come being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy. The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all housing authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge.  The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and housing authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.</p><p>I am satisfied that the current income limits generally provide for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources.  These limits will continue to be kept under review by my Department, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda set out in the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>.</p></reply>

This does not account for all group water schemes in the country as not all group water schemes claim subsidies.  Some smaller schemes, particularly those that are supplied water from the Irish Water public mains supply, do not currently apply for subsidies.  However, these figures are understood to represent the majority by household that avail of group water schemes to supply their domestic water.

In line with the suspension of domestic water charges for a period of nine months from 1 July 2016, as set out in the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2016, and to ensure equity of treatment with households on public water supplies, my Department advised local authorities in August 2016 that, for the duration of the suspension period, the subsidy rates were adjusted up to pre-2015 levels to reflect the suspension of domestic water charges for households connected to the public water supply.  My Department will give further consideration to the subsidies available for the operation of group water schemes in light of the Oireachtas decision on the enduring funding model for public domestic water services.</p><p>Details of the level of subsidies are available from local authorities and on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:  <i>.</i></p><p>Census 2011 indicated that 161,532 private dwellings in the country are dependent on a private non-mains source of water supply (more commonly called private wells) for their household water supply.

Eligible households in all 31 local authority areas can now avail of an immediate form of social housing support, with &euro;153 million being made available for the scheme in 2017.</p><p>Upon commencement of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme in a local authority administrative area, the availability of rent supplement support is altered and in general rent supplement will no longer be available to any new applicant households that have an identified long-term housing need.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection may request long term recipients of rent supplement to contact their local authority in order to have their housing need assessed which could potentially allow them to access HAP. Should a rent supplement recipient fail to engage with their local authority as requested, the Department of Social Protection may suspend, or ultimately cease, their rent supplement payment. Local authorities are working closely with local Department of Social Protection staff to transfer eligible households from the rent supplement scheme to HAP.  The phased process of transferring households from rent supplement to HAP, which only begins after the scheme has been introduced and established in a local authority area for some months, is carefully managed in order to ensure that no gaps in support arise within the transfer process.  While the operation of the rent supplement scheme is a matter for the Department of Social Protection, I understand that rent supplement has yet to be suspended or ceased due to the refusal of an existing landlord to accept HAP.</p><p>A landlord or an agent acting on behalf of a landlord is not legally obliged to enter into a tenancy agreement with a HAP recipient.  However, since 1 January 2016, a person cannot be discriminated against when renting because they are getting rent supplement certain other payments, including HAP.  If a person feels that they have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent, they can make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts.</p><p>Following the commencement of the provisions in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, HAP is considered to be a social housing support and consequently households are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list.  However, acknowledging that households on the waiting list who avail of HAP might have expectations that they would receive an allocated form of social housing support, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.  With the completion of the HAP rollout and the ending of the scheme&rsquo;s pilot phase, I recently signed a Ministerial Direction instructing Local Authorities to continue to offer HAP tenants access to other forms of social housing through the transfer list.  This refreshed directionÂ ensures that following completion of the HAP pilot phase, HAP tenants still get all the benefits of HAP and are no less likely to get a different form of social housing support.</p><p>The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their scheme of letting priorities.  The setting of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority and as such is a matter for the elected members.  I understand that the majority of HAP households do avail of the option to be placed on a transfer list.  Since its statutory commencement in September 2014, some 240 households (at the end of December 2016) have transferred from the HAP scheme to other forms of social housing support.</p><p>Further information in relation to the HAP scheme is available on <i>www.hap.ie</i>.</p></reply>

In this regard, Action 5.1 of Rebuilding Ireland commits to developing a National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy by the first quarter of 2017, informed by Census 2016 data, to:</p><p>-  inform the compilation of a register of vacant units across the country,</p><p>-  identify the number, location and reasons for longer-term vacancies (i.e. over 6 months) in high demand areas, and</p><p>-  set out a range of actions to bring vacant units back into reuse.</p><p>To this end, the Housing Agency which has lead responsibility for co-ordinating the development of the Strategy has established a working group, comprising senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself to inform the Strategy.  The Working Group has met five times to date, and is considering a range of potential interventions with a view to facilitating and incentivising the greater re-utilisation of vacant properties.  Ultimately, issues in relation to taxation are a matter for the Minister for Finance.</p><p>Furthermore, in relation to under-utilised and vacant lands, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, enacted in July 2015, introduced a new measure , the vacant site levy, which is aimed at incentivising the development of vacant, under-utilised sites in urban areas.  Planning authorities are empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy, from 2019 onwards, of 3% of the market value of vacant sites, exceeding 0.05 hectares in area - with reduced or zero rates of levy applying in specific circumstances &ndash; which, in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion, were vacant or idle in the preceding year, in areas identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development.  The 3% rate of vacant site levy is consistent with the rate applied to derelict sites under the <i>Derelict Sites Act 1990</i>and is considered reasonable, without being over-punitive, for the purposes of incentivising the activation of such sites for residential or regeneration purposes.  In this regard, it is also worth noting that all levies due on an individual site remain a charge on the land concerned until all outstanding levies due are paid.  Accordingly, there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development purposes for each year a site remains vacant or idle.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 874,000 customers with direct eligibility with an annual allocation of &euro;80 million.</p><p>The free travel scheme was introduced in 1967.  It is not operated as a public service obligation (PSO) and it does not confer any financial advantage on participating transport undertakings or place participating transport undertakings in a more favourable competitive position as regards non-participants.  The scheme operates in an objective and transparent manner and on the basic premise that participants should be left no better or worse off as a result of the existence of the scheme.  To this end, compensation under the scheme is calculated on the basis of fares foregone at a reduced rate to take account of travel generated by the free travel scheme.  Those operators which participate in the scheme receive a payment<b><i></i></b>from my Department significantly below the standard fare whereas those operators which do not participate in the scheme are free to charge full fare for all passengers.  Operators and routes<b><i></i></b>have to be commercially viable in their own right and cannot rely on payment from the free travel scheme as some form of subvention.

At 20 years old, the original site was showing its age.  For example, although it enabled jobseekers to search for job opportunities based on job type and location, it wasn&rsquo;t possible for employers to search for suitable jobseekers on the site.</p><p>Accordingly, my Department issued a tender last year for the development and implementation of a new service that would enable both employers and jobseekers to search for each other using competencies and skillsets as well as the traditional job-type classifications.  As part of the new service, candidate profiles will be automatically matched to job specifications posted by employers.  Candidates can also use the site to apply for the jobs advertised.  The system will also integrate my Department&rsquo;s Intreo service.</p><p>Following the procurement process, a young Irish tech company is building and delivering the new service on a phased basis.  There were some teething problems with the first phase implementation, but performance issues have largely been resolved.  The Department continues to work with the supplier to enhance the service and to add new functionality over the coming months.</p><p>In addition to the online service, the Department&rsquo;s National Contact Centre provides a telephone service to assist employers and candidates.  The original service operated from 10am to 4pm, Monday to Friday.  In response to an increase in queries, additional staff were assigned to deal with phone queries and operating hours were extended to 9am to 5pm daily.</p><p>Employers can contact the JobsIreland team on LoCall 1890 800024 or Tel: +353 (0)1 2481398.  Rates charged for the use of Lo-Call numbers may vary among different service providers.  JobsIreland phone service details are available on the &lsquo;Contact Us&rsquo; section of the website and on home page by clicking &lsquo;Contact Us&rsquo; and then &lsquo;Employer Engagement Support Network&rsquo;.</p></reply>

Contractors are paid via a combination of an initial registration fee and thereafter only on the basis of job sustainment fees: which are only paid in respect of each period of 13 weeks the former jobseeker is in sustained employment, up to a maximum of 52 weeks (i.e. a maximum of four payments).</p>  <p>  Failure by a provider to deliver the service to the satisfaction of the Department may result in the application of penalties by the department.  Contractors are subject to regular inspections, assessment of their performance against contracted targets and surveys of customer satisfaction.  If the service is not being delivered to the department&rsquo;s satisfaction and/or if the employment placement targets as set out in the contract are not being achieved this may result in the application of penalties by the department through the retention of fees.  Fees may be reduced by up to 15% until the underperformance is addressed.  In addition, ultimately the Department has the right to terminate the contract in such circumstances.</p>  <p>  No such penalty clauses apply to the department.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Since the introduction of this flexible approach, almost 11,200 persons at imminent risk of homelessness have been supported through increased rent supplement payments.  A county breakdown of these payments is provided in the following tabular statement.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the strategic policy direction of the Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support with the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, which from 1 March, 2017, is now available nationwide.  HAP was first piloted in the Limerick area in early 2014, with the number of HAP recipients (c. 1,600) in Limerick City and County now exceeding the number of rent supplement recipients (945).  In addition to the ongoing transfer of tenancies from rent supplement to HAP, the majority of new applicants in Limerick seeking State support towards their rent are being supported under HAP rather than rent supplement.  This activity is reflected in the low number of increased payments provided under rent supplement in this area.</p><p>In tandem with the revised rental limits introduced in July 2016 and on-going transfers to HAP, my Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach where rents may exceed the appropriate maximum limit ensuring where possible that rent supplement tenants can retain their homes.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Tabular Statement</b></p><p><b>Total Cumulative Increased Rental Payments by County as at 28</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b>February, 2017</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Cumulative Awards under National Tenancy Sustainment Framework</th><th>Cumulative Awards under protocol with Threshold</th><th>Total no. of increased payments by County</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>75</td><td></td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>66</td><td></td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>60</td><td></td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>454</td><td>97</td><td>551</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>4,320</td><td>2,570</td><td>6,890</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>207</td><td>3</td><td>210</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>206</td><td></td><td>206</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>558</td><td>3</td><td>561</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>136</td><td></td><td>136</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>119</td><td></td><td>119</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>101</td><td></td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>17</td><td></td><td>17</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This includes large-scale annual customer satisfaction surveys.  It draws upon an episodic administrative database, the Jobseekers&rsquo; Longitudinal Database (JLD), capturing jobseekers spells of unemployment and exits to employment, training and education, from 2004.</p><p>The two major evaluations currently under way using the JLD are the evaluation of the Intreo &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; service for jobseekers, and of the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA).</p><p>As part of this evaluation programme, the JobBridge evaluation report was published in October 2016.  It had 3 elements: a rigorous counterfactual impact evaluation (that used cohort-building techniques to continuously assess impacts); a survey (response rate: 33.5% of all participants and 23.3% of all host organisations); and a cost-benefit analysis.  Key findings included:</p><p>- Individuals similar to those who participated in JobBridge had a 36.6% probability of securing employment within one year, whereas the JobBridge interns&rsquo; probability of securing employment within one year increased to 48.4% (an 11.8 percentage point difference and a 32% increase in the probability of becoming employed).</p><p>- The overall economic cost-benefit analysis, taking account of increased employment and incomes, indicates a positive economic net benefit.</p><p>- Amongst interns, there was broad agreement that the internship provided them with new job skills and an opportunity to gain quality work experience.  However, there was dissatisfaction with the value of the top-up payment and some aspects of the administration of the scheme.</p><p>Following publication of the evaluation in October 2016, I announced my intention to replace JobBridge in 2017 with a new work experience programme that better reflected the improved labour market and addressed certain criticisms of the scheme.  The design of the scheme will be informed by learning from the evaluation, by proposed design principles as recommended by the Labour Market Council, and by consultation with stakeholders.</p><p>In relation to Springboard and Momentum, which are operated under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills, there have been formal evaluations undertaken of both programmes in recent years.  The latest statistics for Springboard show that 80% of participants between 2011 and 2015 are no longer on the Live Register.</p><p>The above information was supplied to the European Commission during the drafting of the 2017 Country Report on Ireland.</p></reply>

Such property includes all monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares and houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use.  However, it does not include property such as the family home or, for example, a premises used by the claimant in carrying out a business.</p><p>For assessment purposes, savings are assessed by reference to the following, as follows: </p><p><b>Capital &ndash; Assessment Formula</b><table><tr><th>AMOUNT OF CAPITAL</th><th>WEEKLY MEANS ASSESSED</th></tr><tr><td>Up to &euro;20,000</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;20,000 - &euro;30,000</td><td>&euro;1 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;30,000 - &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;2 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Over &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;4 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr></table></p><p>It should be noted that for the purposes of the State pension non-contributory, the amounts above are doubled in the case of a couple.  In addition, the State Pension Non Contributory has a general means disregard of &euro;30 per week.</p><p>This means that a single claimant of SPNC with no other income can have savings of &euro;40,000 (which would result in a weekly means assessment from capital of &euro;30) and this would have no impact on their SPNC payment.  Similarly, a SPNC claimant who is one of a couple can have savings of &euro;80,000 (and no other means) and the claimant would still receive the maximum weekly rate of SPNC.  Note that each member of the couple is assessed with half of the total property and income of the couple.</p><p>Furthermore, no account is taken of interest or dividend payments received in the means assessment.  The assessment formula reflects the fact that there is an expectation that persons with reasonable amounts of capital and property are in a position to use that capital or to realise the value of property to support themselves without having to rely solely on a means tested welfare payment.</p><p>If the threshold were to be increased, the people who would benefit would be those who had income or assets of varying levels and, accordingly, such claimants would be treated more favourably than claimants who had fewer or no personal resources.  Any changes to the current arrangements would have to be considered in an overall policy and Budgetary context.</p></reply>

The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced.  Payment rates are banded, e.g., someone with a yearly average of 48 or more contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20-29 will qualify for a pension at the 85% rate.</p>  <p>  In most cases people will have a working life of between 40 and 50 years.  However there would be a small number of cases where someone first entered employment in their early 50s, make 10 years of paid PRSI contributions, and manage to qualify for a full rate pension if their yearly average is 48 or higher.  As the Deputy suggests, this is an anomaly, and has been inherent in the contributory pension since its introduction over 50 years ago.</p>  <p>  The switch to a Total Contributions Approach is one of a number of planned reforms to State pensions set out in the National Pensions Framework (NPF) commissioned by the then Government and published in March 2010, and this will remove this anomaly.  The aim of the total contributions approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the Total Contributions Approach with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of women who have gaps in their contribution records as a result of caring duties, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform.  When data becomes available from the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which is currently underway, it will be used to draft material for use in the consultation phase of this reform.  This is expected in the middle of this year.</p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;222 (95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension).  This will rise by &euro;5 this month.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Diet supplement is a means tested payment payable to qualifying persons, in receipt of the supplement prior to February 2014, who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition. There are currently 3,400 in receipt of diet supplement at a cost of &euro;4.6 million in 2017.</p>  <p>  Following the outcome of a review of the costs of healthy eating and specialised diets by the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute commissioned by the Department in 2013, the scheme is closed to new applicants since February 2014. In cases of particular hardship, officials continue to have the legislative power to award a SWA payment in cases of exceptional need.</p>  <p>  When the diet supplement was abolished for new applicants, existing recipients continued to receive the supplement at the current rate of payment for as long as they continue to have an entitlement to the scheme or until their circumstances change.  Arrangements are being put in place so that the effect of the Budget 2017 increase on weekly social welfare payments will not impact on the payment of diet supplement. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through Pathways to Work to ensure that as many of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register, including young people. </p>  <p>  To date, these policies have been effective in reducing youth unemployment. The youth unemployment rate has fallen from 31.1% in July 2012 to 14.5% in February 2017. The actual number of young unemployed has fallen from 70,000 to 30,500 over this period. Irish youth unemployment is now significantly below the EU average.</p>  <p>  As many of the elements of a Youth Guarantee were already in place in Ireland prior to the EU Recommendation, the implementation of the Irish Youth Guarantee focused on enhancing processes and policies for assisting young unemployed people to find and secure sustainable jobs. To this end there is monthly engagement by case officers with all young unemployed to facilitate their return to employment.  </p>  <p>  Places on most of these programmes are demand led, and take-up by young people has fallen in line with the substantial fall in youth unemployment. The number of young people entering the programmes was 23,000 in 2014 and 19,000 in 2015. Final figures for 2016 are not yet available, but are expected to show a further fall on the 2015 level. </p>  <p>  While systemised data are not readily available on employment outcomes on all programmes specifically for those jobseekers under 25, some indicative figures are available. For example:  </p>  <p>- The evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon (report published October 2016), shows on the basis of self-reported survey results that 61% of interns aged 20 to 24 years (and 53.8% of those aged 15-19) were currently in employment at the time of the survey. Overall,   individuals similar to those who participated in JobBridge had a 36.6% probability of securing employment within one year, whereas the JobBridge interns&rsquo; probability of securing employment within one year increased to 48.4% (an 11.8 percentage point difference and a 32% increase in the probability of becoming employed). 70% of participants were engaged by private sector host organisations. </p>  <p>  - JobsPlus provides subsidies to employers for the full-time employment of those formerly long-term unemployed on the Live Register. Between 2014 and 2016 a total of 2167 participants aged under 25 benefited from JobsPlus in 1,757 private sector companies.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the measures taken under the Youth Guarantee, together with the continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in youth unemployment.</p></reply>

The Department of Social Protection participates in the EU-wide annual data collection to monitor progress on the Youth Guarantee, which includes tracking the employment outcomes of the young unemployed over 6, 12 and 18 months.  In relation to the year 2014, the data showed that almost 31,000 young people who had been wholly unemployed and receiving job-seeker&rsquo;s payments exited unemployment to take up jobs during that year.  Two-thirds of this group were still in employment 18 months later.  Initial indications are that the follow-up information for those who exited unemployment in 2015 (which will be available in mid-2017) will show a broadly similar pattern of outcomes.</p>  <p>  On this basis, a significant proportion of the young unemployed can be assessed as having taken up a quality job offer, in line with the Youth Guarantee Recommendation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-07a.862.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017030700079#WRW01000"><p>The overall concern in recent years has been to protect the value of weekly social welfare rates.  Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7 billion each year, is the largest block of expenditure in my Department in the Estimate for 2017, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing by approximately &euro;200m year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.</p>  <p>  There are three main pensions paid by my Department to people aged 66 and over, namely the State pension contributory (which is based on PRSI contributions), the State pension non-contributory (which is based on means), and the Widows/Widowers/Surviving Civil Partners Contributory pension (which is based on PRSI contributions, and is also payable at a lower rate before 66).</p>  <p>  The State pension contributory (previously called the Old Age Contributory Pension) was introduced in 1961, and is funded by PRSI contributions, on a pay-as-you go basis.  Since its introduction, the rates of payment has been based on the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; test.  These rates are banded, and those bands have been amended from time to time, most recently in 2012.  </p>  <p>  As provided for in Budget 2012, and announced in late 2011, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced from September 2012.   This resulted in one of the bands (in respect of those with a yearly average of 20-47 contributions) being replaced with three bands (in respect of yearly averages of 40-47, 30-39, and 20-29 respectively).  These additional bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life are likely to benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cost of reverting to the rate-bands which existed between 2000 and 2012 would be over &euro;60 million in 2018, if introduced from January 2018, and that this annual cost would rise at a rate of some &euro;10 million each year.</p>  <p>  Prior to these changes, in the period from 2000-2012, someone with a yearly average of 47 contributions qualified for the same rate of payment (98% of the maximum rate) as someone with a yearly average of 20 contributions, despite generally their much more significant PRSI record, and this was regardless of their means.  A person with an average of 48-52 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 more than someone with a yearly average of 20 PRSI contributions.  Aside from the lack of equity involved, this was a significant disincentive to longer working, as in most cases, contributions paid by people in their sixties had no impact upon the rate of their State pension upon retirement.</p>  <p>  Given the requirement to make savings in recent years, it was considered more equitable to address this disparity, than to reduce the rate of payment for all pensioners by an across the board cut in payment rates.  Such a cut would have reduced the incomes of the most vulnerable pensioners, who do not receive such reduced rate contributory pensions, but rather receive a maximum rate non-contributory pension, or a maximum rate contributory pension if they have the required contributions.</p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a full rate State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;222, or just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if a person&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;209, which is just less than 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory).  The latter payment is made directly to them, and is based upon their own means, and not their household means.  An additional &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment for maximum rate social welfare pensions will come into force this week, with proportionate increases for qualified adults and those on reduced rates of payment. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The Social Welfare Act does provide that Child Benefit can be paid between the ages of 16-18 in respect of children who are;</p><p>- Receiving full time education or </p><p>- Who have a disability. </p><p>Budget 2009 reduced the age for eligibility for Child Benefit from 19 years to less than 18 years.  </p><p>Families on low incomes can avail of a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including: </p><p>- qualified child increases (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments; </p><p>- family income supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children; </p><p>- the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families (paid at the full-time second level education rate). </p><p>These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked with household income and thereby supports low-income families with older children participating in full-time education. </p><p>Extending Child Benefit to students who are in full-time secondary education and who have reached 18 years of age if adopted would not be a targeted approach given the universality of Child Benefit.

The market has changed considerably since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates, and a range of bundled services including television, telephone and broadband and mobile phone services.  There are also personal security services that use mobile technology rather than land lines.  Accordingly, customers now have a choice of multiple competing offers.  </p>  <p>  In 2013 the value of the telephone allowance was &euro;114.00 per annum.  The cost of restoring the allowance at 2013 levels is estimated to be in the region of &euro;50 million per annum.</p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2016, the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years was given.  This has increased the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, it was announced that there will be a further increase in the rate of State pensions, by &euro;5, which will increase the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory) to &euro;238.30 this month.</p>  <p>  Therefore, over the past two Budgets, the maximum weekly rate for State Pensions has increased by &euro;8 per week, which is the equivalent of over &euro;416 per annum.  The value of these increases is in excess of the value of the telephone allowance previously provided, and it is not necessary to have a landline in order to benefit from these increases.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I have no plans to introduce an additional allowance to cover the cost of a telephone line where a person has installed a phone watch alarm, and have instead concentrated on increasing the basic rate of pension for all older people.</p>  <p>  The Department of the Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has responsibility for the Seniors Alert Scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes.  The grant assistance is made available through community and voluntary groups registered with that Department and the equipment supplied under the scheme remains the property of the community group.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is now in legislation.</p>  <p>  Under procurement rules it is not yet possible to provide further information on the nature of the report.  However, I can confirm that my Department has already liaised with the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) on the most efficient way forward.  On their advice an outline of the Request for Tender (RFT) was issued in December 2016 to potential providers seeking expressions of interest by 11th  January 2017.  The responses received confirmed that the RFT can issue under an existing OGP framework which is the most efficient way of procuring this evaluation.  </p>  <p>  My Department is in the process of finalising the RFT and has been in discussions with the Office of Government Procurement to discuss further the RFT in relation to its design and composition and the procurement process.  Once the RFT is finalised it will be issued by the OGP to relevant providers under their framework for response.  </p>  <p>  I expect that the RFT will be issued in the very near future.  It is critical that the RFT fully reflects the nature and scope of the report required and so it is important to dedicate the necessary time and effort to this step.  This is to ensure that the resultant tenders are of a high quality and that the end result is an effective and comprehensive evaluation. </p>  <p>  My Department is working to the timeframe of having the report completed within 9 months of the passing of the Social Welfare Act 2016.

Ireland made specific reference to Bahrain in our Statement on human rights situations requiring attention at the Human Rights Council in Geneva last September, expressing concern about &ldquo;restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly and association aimed at silencing the voice of civil society and human rights defenders in countries including Bahrain.  </p>  <p>  Ireland attaches a high priority to safeguarding human rights defenders, and has continually advocated for freedom for civil society actors to operate in a safe and enabling environment, without repression.  In August 2014, officials from my Department met with the individual who is the subject of this Question, and discussed with him the situation of human rights in Bahrain.  In October 2015, the Bahrain National Institution for Human Rights (BNIHR) came to Ireland on a training visit, which included meetings with Irish human rights and civil society organisations.  Officials from my Department met with this group also, and set out Ireland&rsquo;s support for human rights promotion across the Middle East region.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about human rights issues in Bahrain, in particular around civil liberties, are also regularly conveyed to the Bahraini authorities.  Ireland&rsquo;s non-resident Ambassador to Bahrain recently met with the Bahraini Deputy Minister for International Affairs, Abdullah Bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, and they discussed human rights.  The Irish Mission to the UN in Geneva supported an event by the Bahrain Center for Human Rights in early February, which provided updated information about the human rights situation in Bahrain in the context of its UPR review in May 2017 and the current session of the HRC.  Officials from my Department are also due to meet this week with an official from the Bahraini Embassy in London, to discuss the human rights situation.</p></reply>

We believe such a safe and enabling environment should be maintained in all States and indeed in international and regional organisations.  </p><p>We consistently also advocate strongly for the separate but related issue of the protection of human rights defenders, including through raising greater awareness on the international standards guaranteeing that human rights defenders should be able to operate free from fear of intimidation or reprisals &ndash; including intimidation or reprisals due to cooperation with the United Nations. </p><p>These are priority issues for Ireland and receive close attention throughout my Department including its network of Embassies and Missions and in particular in the context of our work in Geneva at the Human Rights Council. </p><p>Accreditation of participants to the meetings of the Human Rights Council in Geneva is properly a matter for the UN Office in Geneva and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, not the Human Rights Council itself.  This procedure is intended to ensure that decisions on civil society participation are taken independently and not determined by Governments.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s position is that procedures and modalities for the engagement of human rights defenders with international organisations, including the United Nations, should be of the highest standard and avoid placing those defenders at risk.  Similarly, Ireland&rsquo;s position is that the protection systems for whistleblowers should equally be of the highest standard. </p><p>My Department has taken and continues to take all appropriate measures to respond to threats to civil society actors and human rights defenders and particularly in the context of our work in the Human Rights Council.</p><p>I can however assure the Deputy that the case referred to has been and continues to be the subject of the appropriate attention.</p></reply>

Nor does it capture the accommodation, operational, staffing and other current costs incurred by our Embassies and Consulates around the world, including the Embassy in London, in providing passport services to our citizens.  In addition, centrally incurred headquarters-wide costs are not reallocated to the Passport Service and are therefore not included.  </p>  <p>  The cost of the Passport Reform Programme (2016-2018) &ndash; which has a combined capital and current investment budget of over &euro;18 million &ndash; is additional.  The reform programme will modernise systems, business processes and controls and will deliver a more efficient, secure, predictable and citizen-focused service in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s accounting system does not capture the non-direct passport costs, both in Ireland and overseas, in sufficient detail to allow an accurate assignment of these costs to the production of each passport.  As the production volume increases this would result in a marginal reduction in the cost of the production of a passport as the fixed costs involved are spread over a greater number of passports.  </p></reply>

This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations will work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on completed OPW flood defence schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  II members have committed to take into account all information provided by OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas.</p>  <p>  The Memorandum came into effect on 1 June, 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the OPW to II in respect of 12 completed flood defence schemes and showing the design, extent and nature of the protection offered by these works.  A further tranche of data was provided to II in January 2015 covering a further 4 completed flood defence schemes.  OPW will continue to provide data to II as flood defence schemes are completed.</p>  <p>  II estimates that flood cover is included as standard in 98% of household insurance policies throughout the country.  II has carried out a number of surveys among its members to ascertain the extent to which flood insurance cover is available in the areas for which OPW has provided data on completed flood defence schemes.  The results of the most recent survey were provided in December last year; they indicate that 83% of property insurance policies in these areas include cover against flood risk.  Where the defences are permanent in nature the percentage is 90%; where demountable defences are used the percentage is 77%.</p>  <p>  In line with Action No. 270 of the Action Plan for Rural Development, the OPW and the Department of Finance are now engaging with II on a quarterly basis.  At the most recent meeting on 8 December 2016, it was decided that a sub group be established to explore the legal, technical and administrative arrangements that may allow for the further sharing of data on flood insurance cover for those 300 areas where the OPW has mapped the flood risk through the CFRAM Programme.  This sub group held its first meeting on 18 January last. </p>  <p>  I am happy with the work of the Group thus far and am confident that it will continue to progress the issue of flood insurance.</p></reply>

The terms of that settlement have not impacted on pensions in payment and the current increase of &euro;1,000 for the period 1 April to 31 August 2017 on annualised basic salaries up to &euro;65,000 will not impact on pensions in payment also.</p><p>Reductions to public service pensionsÂ which took place by way of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) under the financial emergency legislation are being significantly reversed.  This is happening in three stages under FEMPI 2015, withÂ PSPR-affected pensioners getting pension increases via substantial restoration of the PSPR reductionsÂ on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.  As I have previously indicated, it will be for Government in due course to consider the issue of how to adjust the post-award value of public service pensions through appropriate pay or other linkages, as we move beyond FEMPI and PSPR restoration towards more normal pay and pension setting conditions in the public service.</p></reply>

This message has been conveyed to my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and officials of our Departments are working to ensure that cost containment is suitably prioritised.  This can be a challenging task given that overall expenditure on Tribunals has proven to be difficult to predict in the past. Timescale is also a key driver of total expenditure.  This Tribunal is expected to complete its work on Terms of Reference (a) to (o) within one year.The Deputy will be aware that the Tribunals are vested with powers,Â rights and privileges ofÂ the High Court as regards attendance and examination of witnesses.  Tribunals also have Â a significant measure of discretion as to the way in which they conduct proceedings and they generally establish their own rules in relation to the levelÂ of legal representation for witnesses.  The approach of the new Tribunal to representation for witnesses will no doubt become clear in this regard as it begins to undertake its work.  As Minister charged with ensuring appropriate management of public expenditure, I do welcome Mr. Justice Charleton's opening statement that acknowledged the Tribunal will be a drain on resources.  It is in all our interests that the Tribunal into protected disclosures can proceed promptly but with some reassurance about costÂ containment.

Notwithstanding this, a commitment has been given that a purchase and transfer facility would be provided by way of Regulations under the Single Scheme Act.</p>  <p>  Appropriate Regulations are being drafted and these will set out the rules of the new scheme.Â  Consistent with the structure of the Single Scheme, itÂ isÂ intendedÂ  that the Regulations will allow Single Scheme members to purchase additional pension and lump sum referable amounts to augment pension benefits accrued under the Scheme.  Under the new facility, itÂ is expected that each purchase agreement will beÂ entered into and completed on an annual basis and paid for either by way of a lump-sum contribution or by periodic deductions from salary, where the Relevant Authority offers such a facility.  The Regulations are also expected toÂ provide for the transfer of pension entitlements accrued in certain other Revenue approved pension schemes to the Single Scheme.  The pricing of purchased benefits will be based on the actuarially calculated cost of paying out those benefits at retirement and will operate on a cost neutral basis to the Exchequer.  </p>  <p>  The draft scheme is currently subject to detailed legal and other considerations and the intention is to bring forward Regulations on the new scheme as soon as these considerations are complete.</p></reply>

The Regulations will provide for limited managed hedge cutting, under strict criteria, during August to help tackle the impact overgrown hedges can have on road safety.  With these restrictions and conditions in place, the expert advice of my officials is that the overall impact of limited, managed hedge cutting in August on the bee population will be minimal.  </p>  <p>  I understand that for most hedgerow plant species, flowering is largely over by August.  The main hedgerow nectar resources will have been provided earlier in the year by species such as willow, blackthorn and hawthorn.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Heritage Bill provides for a &lsquo;sunset clause&rsquo; in that the provisions allowing hedge cutting in August are only in force for a pilot phase of 2 years and can only be extended by the Oireachtas.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department will be tasked with monitoring activity under the proposed new provisions and an assessment of any impacts will be carried out before any decision is taken on continuing the measures beyond the 2 year pilot phase.  </p>  <p>  I will also be issuing guidelines on hedge management along with the proposed Regulations; and these guidelines will advise that the best practice for hedge management is a 3&ndash;year or longer cycle of cutting.</p></reply>

Ancillary activities included a broad range of actions, such as equestrian centre and riding school projects.  </p>  <p>  In light of the considerable level of investment already undertaken in ancillary activities under the previous programme, it was decided that support for such activities would not be eligible under the 2014-2020 LEADER programme.  However, in the period since I launched the implementation of the new LEADER Programme in July last year, it has become clear to me that there is still some demand for further investment in ancillary activities, particularly where this contributes to rural tourism. </p>  <p>  On 28 February last I announced that I will be amending the ineligible list of activities to allow for funding of ancillary activities for the equine industry.  This will be on a targeted basis, with a particular emphasis on ensuring that the supported infrastructure is widely accessible to the public. </p></reply>

For example, local authority expenditure on the arts, the artists' exemption tax relief, expenditure on public service broadcasting and the Irish language are not included in the figures for Ireland but comparable figures are included in the data for some other countries.  I have previously stated that further research on this issue is warranted.  The issue of a definition of culture and of capturing public expenditure on culture is an element of the draft Culture 2025 framework policy, which was sent to the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for input in July 2016.</p><p>However, this Government is committed to increasing provision for arts and culture in Ireland.  The Taoiseach and I launched <i>the Creative Ireland Programme &ndash; Cl&aacute;r &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach 2017 &ndash; 2022</i>on the 8 December 2016.  This is a cross-Government initiative to mainstream culture and creativity in the life of the nation and to promote individual, community and national wellbeing.</p><p>This will focus on boosting cultural provision and participation in communities and harnessing the goodwill and engagement generated by the 2016 commemorative programme.</p><p>The core proposition of this programme is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.  The Creative Ireland Programme is the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in <i>Culture 2025/&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach</i>, the draft cultural policy which I published last year and which sees a vibrant cultural ecosystem as essential to society.</p><p>The programme is based on five pillars:</p><p>- Enabling the creative potential of every child</p><p>- Enabling creativity in every community</p><p>- Investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure</p><p>- Establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production</p><p>- Unifying our global reputation</p><p>The Creative Ireland Programme is supported by significant additional resources which are being directed towards the arts and culture sector.In Budget 2017 I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board.  The increase in the Arts Council's allocation in 2017 is &euro;5 million, or 8%, and will assist the Council greatly in implementing its 10-year strategy <i>Making Great Art Work (2016-2025).</i></p><p>I also secured an increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board, representing a 14% increase in its annual budget. </p><p>Budget 2017 also includes:-. </p><p>- increased funding for all of the National Cultural Institutions; </p><p>- an increase of &euro;1 million for Culture Ireland; </p><p>- an additional &euro;1 million to the Heritage Council; and</p><p>- funding of &euro;5m for the implementation of the Creative Ireland Programme. </p><p>I also recently announced details of more than &euro;9 million in capital funding for existing dedicated arts and culture centres across the country.

This kind of investment is at the centre of what I am trying to achieve through Creative Ireland and the Action Plan for Rural Development.  The Arts and Culture Capital Scheme was considerably over-subscribed. The Department received 106 applications in total under Stream 1 and 2 seeking total funding of over &euro;20m with eligible requests for funding totalling over &euro;14.6m.

It will provide smaller capital grants of up to &euro;20,000 to not-for-profit organisations with a defined arts and cultural remit.

As I mentioned in those replies, the implementation of the <i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 </i>is recognised as a key priority in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>insofar as it supports the maintenance and development of the Irish language as a community and household language in the Gaeltacht.  Other measures outlined in the Programme include: </p><p>- A focus on job creation in the Gaeltacht through investment in jobs by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta; </p><p>- Encouraging the attendance by children of Irish-medium pre-schools or na&iacute;onra&iacute; in Gaeltacht areas; and, </p><p>- Increasing investment in the Irish language.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that my Department, together with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, administers a wide range of schemes, programmes and initiatives targeting language and economic development in Gaeltacht areas.

In Budget 2017, I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council.  This will see an increase in the Arts Council allocation in 2017 of &euro;5m, or 8%, and will assist the Council in implementing its 10-year strategy <i>Making Great Art Work (2016-2025)</i>.  This strategy places specific emphasis on the need to plan and provide for children and young people.  The 5 high-level values of the strategy include a commitment to excellence, as well as respect for diversity of artistic practice, of public engagement, and of social and cultural traditions.  The strategy also commits to working to achieve full implementation of the Arts in Education Charter.  The Strategy is available on the website of the Arts Council.</p><p>The Creative Ireland Programme is the Government&rsquo;s Legacy Programme for Ireland 2016 and the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in <i>Culture 2025/&Eacute;&iacute;re Ild&aacute;nach </i>the draft framework policy which I published in July of last year.  It is a five-year all-of-government initiative, from 2017 to 2022, which places creativity at the centre of public policy.</p><p>The Programme is built around five pillars one of which is Enabling Creativity in Every Community.  The Centenary Programme demonstrated two critically important aspects of local governance: first, local authorities are the primary instruments of community engagement and second, local authorities have a particular capacity for local programme delivery, especially in the context of citizen engagement.  Further details of the Creative Ireland Programme can be accessed at the following link </p><p>In addition to the Creative Ireland Programme, I recently launched the Action Plan for Rural Development which is the first whole-of-government strategy aimed at people living and working in rural Ireland.  It aims to unlock the potential of rural Ireland through a framework of supports at national and local level which will ensure that people who live in rural areas have increased opportunities for employment locally, and access to public services and social networks that support a high quality of life.

This serves to raise the global awareness of the strong reputation of the Irish arts sector, generate new career opportunities for Irish artists and develop new audiences abroad for Irish artists. My Department continues to work with the Global Irish Network, which has to date made many significant achievements in relation to highlighting Ireland's creativity on the world stage. I consider that this is the most appropriate vehicle in which to highlight the achievement of Irish creativity as part of a wider cross-sectoral partnership.

Pillar 5 of the Programme - <i>Unifying our Global Reputation</i>- is about presenting a coherent representation of Ireland to the world as a creative people.  This will seek to capture the overarching narrative of Ireland&rsquo;s unique creativity and cultural heritage. The Government&rsquo;s intentions in this regard were welcomed when I launched the <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i>on the international stage in New York and London recently.</p></reply>

I hosted a productive public forum on Brexit in Monaghan last November which was attended by a range of interests from the Border region. I also hosted a Sectoral Dialogue on Brexit in Cavan on 6<sup>th</sup>February which was attended by over 100 stakeholders from across the arts, culture, film, heritage, Irish language, regional and rural affairs sectors. This Sectoral Dialogue meeting focused on the impacts of Brexit on the sectors served by my Department, with particular attention being given to the impacts on Rural and Border communities. This event was part of the ongoing engagement with civil society initiated through the series of All-Island Civic Dialogues hosted by the Taoiseach.</p><p>The actions set out in <i>Realising our Rural Potential, </i>the Government's Action Plan for Rural Development launched in January, will also assist in supporting rural communities, including those in border areas, to meet the challenges posed by Brexit and to position themselves to avail of the opportunities which also may arise.Â  The Action Plan contains over 270 actions to be delivered by a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other bodies and sets out to support sustainable communities, support enterprise and employment, maximise our rural and recreation potential, foster culture and creativity, and improve rural connectivity.</p><p>The plan sets out a number of actions which will address the effects of Brexit in particular. For example, a specific piece of research will be commissioned on the impact of Brexit on rural areas, and particularly rural areas in the Border region. Also, InterTradeIreland will fund the development of a programme of initiatives to increase the awareness and capacity of SMEs to deal with the practical consequences of Brexit for cross border trade.</p><p><i></i>The Government hasput in place a number of structural and other arrangements to address issues relating to Brexit. These include an inter-Departmental Group that was formed in April 2016. My Department has been represented on the Inter-Departmental Group since its establishment. In addition, a Working Group, chaired at Assistant Secretary level and composed of officials from across the Department was established within my Department todeal with Brexit issues. This Working Groupis supported by the Department's EU Coordination Unit which is also responsible for managing those issues relating to Brexit that fall within my Department&rsquo;s remit. These arrangements are being kept under review and will be enhanced if required in the coming period.</p></reply>

Under the current approach measures are in place toÂ increase the cohort of functional bilinguals in the civil service in order to reflect a more competency-based approach to recruitment and, where appropriate, promotion competitions. In the context of Workforce Planning frameworks, Departments are requested to identify theÂ posts/areas of work requiring functional bilinguals and to include these in their workforce action plans. HavingÂ regard to the implementation of the Gaeltacht Act 2012, Departments will be asked to pay particular attention to posts that are located in, or that are serving, Gaeltacht areas. This process will be central to ensuring that future recruitment and interdepartmental promotion competitions run by the Public Appointments Service make sufficient provision for appointments to posts requiring functional bilinguals. In the case of Departmental recruitment and promotion competitions, an assessment will be made of the requirement for functional bilinguals and, where necessary and appropriate, a sub-panel of functional bilinguals will be put in place. </p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s Implementation Plan for theÂ 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030Â includes measures aimed at building capacity in the provision of Irish language services in the civil service. Â In this context, ForasÂ naÂ Gaeilge currently has a contract in place withÂ Gaelchult&uacute;rÂ Teo.Â forÂ the provision of Irish language training to the public service. From 2011 to date, I understand that in the region of 1,200 public servants from over 80 state bodies have attended courses run by Gaelchult&uacute;r Teo. In addition to this, over 400 government employees from more than 20 public service bodies have undertaken Gaelchult&uacute;r&rsquo;s Certificate in Professional Irish. </p>  <p>  InÂ October 2014, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announcedÂ an end to the Moratorium on recruitment in the public service, to be replaced with new delegated management arrangements to be phased in during 2015 and 2016. Open recruitment competitions have now recommenced and my Department is monitoring early outcomes regarding the bilingual element.</p>  <p>  Given that it is the responsibility of each DepartmentÂ to identifyÂ and address its Irish language needs,Â I recently asked my officials toÂ open a discussionÂ with their counterparts inÂ otherÂ Departments andÂ inÂ the main public bodies, includingÂ the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform,Â in order to examineÂ theirÂ requirementsÂ for functioning bilinguals. These discussions are currently underway.   </p></reply>

The open season for deer operates generally from 1 September to 28 February, depending on the species and gender of deer.Â  The period referred to by the Deputy is largely outside the open season.</p><p>My Department carries out localised annual deer counts on State lands such as Wicklow National Park.

In relation to preventing such road accidents my Department is of the view that improving sight lines for motorists as well as improved (and possibly larger) signage is likely to be the most effective measure to assist motorists to be vigilant when driving through areas where populations of deer can be expected. </p><p>In 2015 my Department, together with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, published <i>DeerÂ Management in Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Action</i>, which recommends a series of actions onÂ deerÂ management and conservation in a number of areas, including addressing the impact ofÂ deerÂ in places where they are widespread. An IrishÂ DeerÂ Management Forum has been established to implement the various actions listed in the Report. The Forum itself comprises representatives from the main stakeholder areas such as landowners, forestry, hunting and conservation organisations, as well as representatives from both Departments. It is my understanding that the situation relating to the wild deer in Co Wicklow has been discussed at various meetings of the Forum.</p></reply>

With regard to deer in Killarney National Park (KNP) , as part of its regular on-going management operations, my Department carries out localised annual deer culls on State lands, if required.  My Department commissioned a comprehensive survey and report in the winter of 2016 on the distribution, population density and population structure of red deer and sika deer in KNP. The study found that the total estimated red deer density over the entire study area of 13.64km2 was some 708 deer. On foot of the recent report, personnel from the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department are currently undertaking a cull of deer in the National Park, which will be concluded by the end of March. The proposed cull is at a similar level to that which was undertaken in previous years. It is anticipated that up to 80 deer will be culled as part of this exercise, which will be completed by the end of March 2017. The aim is to cull approximately 20% males and 80% females. By the end of February 18 red hinds and 5 red yearlings had been culled.   </p>  <p>  As has been the case previously, this work is undertaken by experienced, relevantly qualified and competent National Parks and Wildlife Service personnel of my Department. The remains will be processed and disposed of in full compliance with the applicable Department of Agriculture , Food and the Marine guidelines, and with the involvement, as appropriate, of officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.   </p></reply>

These ancient features only come to light during peat extraction. Once a bog has been drained to facilitate such extraction, the conditions that ensured the preservation of the wooden toghers are no longer present with the result that they will inevitably decay slowly over time.  Considering the nature of the toghers, the circumstances of their discovery, their already compromised condition, as well as the co-operation of the landowner, it is not evident that the conditions that would normally be considered appropriate to the making of a Preservation Order are present in this case. My Department will instead continue to focus its efforts on seeking detailed information on the toghers through appropriate methods of recording. </p><p>It is also the case that the toghers extend beyond the area currently being worked into an area of &lsquo;high bog&rsquo; where significant elements may still be preserved.

I intend to launch the first phase of this scheme in the coming weeks, with a focus on improving the economic development of our towns and villages. Full details of the initiative will be available when the scheme is launched. </p>  <p>  I also intend to launch a second phase of the scheme later this year. This will be a pilot project to encourage residential occupancy in rural towns and villages.  My intention is that the scheme will be targeted at owner-occupiers and will assist with the cost of bringing buildings back into use for residential purposes only. The pilot will be launched in the second half of the year, when details of the scheme have been finalised in consultation with relevant Departments. Full details of the criteria to apply will be announced when the pilot is launched. </p></reply>

These Directives aim to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas.  Significant efforts have been made by the State to resolve the issue of the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation within the framework of the Habitats Directive. This has included intense and on-going engagement with turf cutting interests, the farming community, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission, as well as the establishment of a long-term compensation scheme for affected turf cutters. </p>  <p>  The National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan will set out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed including exploring the options in terms of certain provisions of article 6 of the Habitats Directive. It is intended that the Plan will be published in the coming period, subject to Government approval.</p>  <p>  11,593 annual payments and 901 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of applications received under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme for raised bog special areas of conservation. In addition, 1,707 once-off incentive payments of &euro;500 have been made. </p>  <p>  The Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network, published in January 2014, concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network. Arising from this review, the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 has been presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and is currently proceeding through the necessary stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas. Its purpose is to provide for the implementation of a reconfiguration of the natural heritage area network arising from the 2014 Review. </p>  <p>  Final resolution of all issues in relation to the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s protected raised bogs will only be brought about by everyone working together, within the law, with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established for the purpose of ensuring the input from all stakeholders.</p></reply>

The Board liaises with IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland to maximise joint opportunities for promotion of Ireland as a location for film productions.</p><p>The <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i>is a five-year all-of-government initiative, from 2017 to 2022, which places creativity at the centre of public policy and aims to improve access to cultural and creative activity in every county across the country.</p><p>Under Pillar 2 of the Programme - Enabling Culture and Creativity in Every Community - each local authority will be asked to develop a Culture and Creativity Plan, reflecting the overall structure and aims of the national strategy for culture and creativity.

It may also embody the industrial creative sectors, including audio-visual production. </p><p>My primary role is to support artists and the creative industries in Ireland using the mechanisms available to me across Government on common initiatives such as the Action Plan for Jobs.</p><p>For example, the Taoiseach and I launched the <i>Creative Ireland Programme &ndash; Cl&aacute;r &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach 2017 &ndash; 2022</i>on the 8 December 2016.  This is a cross-Government initiative to mainstream culture and creativity in the life of the nation and to promote individual, community and national wellbeing.  This will focus on boosting cultural provision and participation in communities and harnessing the goodwill and engagement generated by the 2016 commemorative programme. </p><p>The core proposition of this programme is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.  The <i>Creative Ireland Programme </i>is the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in <i>Culture 2025/&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach</i>, the draft cultural policy which I published last year and which sees a vibrant cultural ecosystem as essential to society.</p><p>The programme is based on five pillars:</p><p>- Enabling the creative potential of every child</p><p>- Enabling creativity in every community</p><p>- Investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure</p><p>- Establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production</p><p>- Unifying our global reputation</p><p>The <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i>is supported by significant additional resources which are being directed towards the arts and culture sector.  In Budget 2017 I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board. The increase in the Arts Council's allocation in 2017 is &euro;5 million, or 8%, and will assist the Council greatly in implementing its 10-year strategy <i>Making Great Art Work (2016-2025).</i></p><p>I also secured an increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board, representing a 14% increase in its annual budget.</p><p>Budget 2017 also includes:-.  </p><p>- increased funding for all of the National Cultural Institutions; </p><p>- an increase of &euro;1 million for Culture Ireland; </p><p>- an additional &euro;1 million to the Heritage Council; and</p><p>- funding of &euro;5m for the implementation of the <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i>.  </p><p>I also recently announced details of more than &euro;9 million in capital funding for existing dedicated arts and culture centres across the country.</p><p>The Creative Ireland Arts and Culture Capital Scheme is the most significant investment in arts and cultural centres in a decade and will target investment at a range of different facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces.  This kind of investment is at the centre of what I am trying to achieve through <i>Creative Ireland</i><i>Programme </i>and the <i>Action Plan for Rural Development</i>. </p><p>My Department has also commissioned an economic analysis of our screen based creative industries, in partnership with the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  This study will examine the economic impact including employment and the potential of the Irish film, TV and animation sector.  The commissioning of the study is a commitment to in the Action Plan for Jobs 2016 and its recommendations will inform the development of policy in this area under the Creative Ireland Programme.</p><p>All of this represents real and substantial funding increases across the arts and cultural area and has been welcomed across the sector.  It re-affirms the commitment of this Government to progressively increase funding for the arts as the economy improves, as set out in <i>the Programme for a Partnership Government</i>.</p></reply>

The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>contains a commitment to encourage strong, mutually beneficial links between the business community and the arts community to assist arts organisations to capitalise on sponsorship opportunities and to develop business partnerships and fundraising skills.  In this regard, I recognise the important work carried out by Business to Arts for which my Department provides a small amount of assistance.  In addition, the Arts Council operates the RAISE programme, which seeks to enhance fund-raising skills in arts organisations with a view to diversifying the sector's sources of funding.  It is designed to assist the sector in securing philanthropic contributions to the arts in Ireland.</p><p>In terms of other capital investment requiring co-funding, I have announced a new &euro;9 million investment scheme for arts and cultural centres to run over the next three years, focussed on upgrading the existing stock of such centres around the country.  The funding, which is being made available as part of the <i>Capital Investment Framework 2016-2021</i>, is dependent on matching funding being secured by project promoters and therefore provides an opportunity for philanthropists to involve themselves in the arts. </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to know that, on December 8 last, the Taoiseach and I launched the <i>Creative Ireland Programme/Cl&aacute;r &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach</i>as the Government&rsquo;s Legacy Programme arising out of the <i>Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme</i>and as the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in <i>Culture 2025. </i>The <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i>is a high-level, high-ambition, all-of-Government initiative to mainstream creativity in the life of the nation.  </p><p>My Department is now working to implement the Creative Ireland Programme with partners across Government and other key stakeholders. This includes delivery on an ambitious Year 1 Programme to deliver 10 initiatives by the end of 2017. Details of the Programme can be found on www.creative.ireland.ie. It is hoped that this initiative will further stimulate private support for the arts.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-07a.1155.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017030700085#WRCC04100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 439, 440 and 444 together.</p>  <p>  My role, as Minister, with regard to the protection and management of our architectural heritage, is set out in the provisions of relevant legislation, as are the roles of local authorities and the responsibilities of owners as regards heritage assets.  </p>  <p>  Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for the protection of architectural heritage.  The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p>  <p>  I also have a role, as Minister, in terms of being a prescribed body under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001-2015, whereby development proposals that may impact on our built heritage are referred by planning authorities to my Department so that recommendations can be made as appropriate to avoid or mitigate any such impacts.</p>  <p>  My Department has a number of measures at its disposal to facilitate the maintenance and restoration of major historical or cultural sites.  As Minister, I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts 1930-2014 of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at approximately 750 sites and in such cases there is a statutory duty to maintain the national monument.  Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW).  Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the OPW in 2017 to assist in the conservation   and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership.  My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care. </p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts, my Department has established and maintains the Record of Monuments and Places, which affords legal protection to over 120,000 recorded archaeological sites and monuments in the State.  Anyone proposing works to a monument that is included in the Record of Monument and Places must give my Department two months prior notice before works can start.</p>  <p>  I launched a &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme - for the repair and conservation of protected structures on 21 October 2015.  This scheme operated in 2016, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  It is operating again this year and is expected to support in excess of 330 projects across the country in 2017 and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas. </p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund, administered through the local authorities, supported 57 projects nationally in 2016.  It seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.   The scheme is operating again in 2017. </p>  <p>  Receipt of applications for both the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and Structures at Risk are now closed, however on-going queries can be addressed to all respective local authorities who are implementing both schemes throughout 2017.</p>  <p>  The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage is a state initiative to identify, record, and evaluate the post-1700 built heritage of Ireland, uniformly and consistently as an aid to its protection and conservation. The NIAH building surveys provide the basis for my recommendations, as Minister for Arts, Heritage Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, to the planning authorities for the inclusion of particular structures in their Record of Protected Structures. The published surveys are a source of information on the selected structures for relevant planning authorities.  They are also a research and educational resource. </p>  <p>  In view of the broad range of measures in place across the various areas of our built heritage which I have outlined above which involve my Department, Local Government and the OPW I do not consider that a further audit is required.  </p></reply>

In this regard, I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council in Budget 2017. The increase in the Arts Council's allocation in 2017 is &euro;5 million, or 8%, and will assist the Council greatly in implementing its 10-year strategy Making Great Art Work (2016-2025). In addition, the Taoiseach and I launched the <i>Creative Ireland Programme &ndash; Cl&aacute;r &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach 2017 &ndash; 2022 </i>on the 8 December 2016.</p><p>This is a cross-Government initiative to mainstream culture and creativity in the life of the nation and to promote individual, community and national wellbeing. This will focus on boosting cultural provision and participation in communities and harnessing the goodwill and engagement generated by the 2016 commemorative programme. </p><p>The core proposition of this programme is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement. The <i>Creative Ireland Programme </i>is the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in <i>Culture 2025/&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach</i>, the draft cultural policy which I published last year and which sees a vibrant cultural ecosystem as essential to society.</p><p>The programme is based on five pillars:</p><p>- Enabling the creative potential of every child</p><p>- Enabling creativity in every community</p><p>- Investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure</p><p>- Establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production</p><p>- Unifying our global reputation</p><p>Under the second Pillar  <i>Enabling creativity in every community</i>-  each local authority is being  asked to develop a Culture and Creativity Plan, reflecting the overall structure and aims of the national strategy for culture and creativity. Each local authority has now established a Culture Team bringing together arts officers, librarians, heritage officers, museum curators, archivists and other relevant personnel led by a Director of Services, with a nominated person as 'Creative Ireland Co-ordinator'. </p><p>&lsquo;Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca&rsquo;, an annual programme of arts activities and cultural reflection to be held on Easter Monday, will be developed &ndash; across the island, locally, with our Diaspora, curated by the national broadcaster and delivered primarily by the local authorities. Beginning in 2018, there will also be an annual County of Culture award. The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will be a key partner in this pillar.</p><p>In addition, the <i>Action Plan for Rural Development</i>, which I launched with the Taoiseach last month, is the first whole-of-government strategy aimed at people living and working in rural Ireland.  It aims to unlock the potential of rural Ireland through a framework of supports at national and local level which will ensure that people who live in rural areas have increased opportunities for employment locally, and access to public services and social networks that support a high quality of life.</p><p>The Action Plan is an overarching structure for the co-ordination and implementation of initiatives right across Government which will benefit rural Ireland.It takes a cohesive and coordinated approach across the whole of Government to the implementation of both economic and social policies that impact on rural communities. </p><p>The Plan contains 276 actions which aim to improve both the economic and social fabric of rural Ireland spread across five pillars. </p><p>Arts and Heritage are covered under the fourth pillar of the plan - Fostering Culture and Creativity in Rural Communities.</p><p>The key objectives of this Pillar are to;-</p><p>- Increase access to the arts and enhance cultural facilities in rural communities.</p><p>- Further develop and enhance culture and creativity in rural Ireland through the establishment of culture teams and creativity hubs as part of the<i>Creative Ireland Programme.</i></p><p>- Promote the Irish language as a key resource in Gaeltacht and other rural communities.</p><p>These policy initiatives are supported by significant additional resources which are being directed towards the arts and culture sector. In addition to the increase in funding for the Arts Council, I also secured an increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board, representing a 14% increase in its annual budget.</p><p>Budget 2017 also includes:-.  </p><p>- increased funding for all of the National Cultural Institutions; </p><p>- an increase of &euro;1 million for Culture Ireland; </p><p>- an additional &euro;1 million to the Heritage Council; and</p><p>- funding of &euro;5m for the implementation of the <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i>.  </p><p>I also recently announced details of more than &euro;9 million in capital funding for existing dedicated arts and culture centres across the country. The Arts and Culture Capital Scheme is the most significant investment in arts and cultural centres in a decade and will target investment at a range of different facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces.  This kind of investment is at the centre of what I am trying to achieve through <i>Creative Ireland</i><i>Programme </i>and the <i>Action Plan for Rural Development</i>. </p><p>All of this represents real and substantial funding increases across the arts and cultural area and has been welcomed across the sector.  It re-affirms the commitment of this Government to progressively increase funding for the arts as the economy improves, as set out in <i>the Programme for a Partnership Government</i>. </p></reply>

It consists of MEDIA and CULTURE sub-programmes as well as a Cross-sectoral strand.  The Creative Europe - Culture sub-programme has granted over &euro;13 million in project funding to projects with Irish partners in its first three years. The majority of the funding available under the Culture sub-programme is via the co-operation projects strand. </p><p>To date, at the mid-way point of the Programme, under the co-operation projects strand there have been four Irish festivals involved as partners in projects with a total project grant allocation of just under &euro;3 million:</p><p>- Bab&oacute;ro Galway International Children&rsquo;s Festival (<i>Small Size, Performing Arts for Early Years)</i></p><p>- Photo Ireland Festival Ltd (<i>Flaneur &ndash; New Urban Narratives)</i></p><p>- First Fortnight Ltd (Networking European Festivals for Mental Life Enhancement)</p><p>- Cuirt &ndash; Galway Arts Centre (<i>Sharing the Wor(l)D)</i></p><p>The Culture sub-programme also funds EU networks and platforms via operating grants for the lead organisations.

This includes referral by GP to Community Mental Health Teams for the appropriate service; liaison psychiatry services onsite in Model 3 and 4 and acute hospitals; a comprehensive mental health on-call service in Emergency Departments in the acute hospitals for people presenting in crisis during the on-call period; and self-harm clinical specialist nurses in a number of Emergency Departments. In addition, the Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse (SCAN) initiative enables GPs to refer directly to SCAN Nurses for assessment and advice on management of their patients who attend their surgeries with suicidal ideation. </p>  <p>  In each of these settings, a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment is carried out together with an assessment of mental state and a risk assessment for suicide. On the basis of this, a care plan is drawn up and the next steps depend on the psychosocial stresses identified together with the presence or absence of a mental illness such as depression. The progression of the development of a clinical programme for the assessment and management of self-harm presentations in Emergency Departments is one of the HSE's National Service Plan priorities for 2017.</p>  <p>  Community Child and Adolescent Mental Health teams are the first line of specialist mental health services for children and young people. There are currently 67 Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams and 3 liaison services nationally. The multidisciplinary team, under the clinical direction of a Consultant Child &amp;amp; Adolescent psychiatrist, includes junior medical staff, psychologists, social workers, nurses, speech &amp;amp; language therapist, occupational therapist and child care workers. The assessment and intervention provided by such teams is determined by the severity and complexity of the presenting problem(s).  This range of disciplines and skills offer a care and treatment package geared to individual needs.  </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) helps to support a wide array of work in communities, in partnership with the voluntary sector, across the country that focus on promoting positive mental health and reducing suicide and self-harm by providing significant grant funding each year, as well as by assisting in coordinating and giving strategic direction to the work undertaken in this area. NOSP supports a range of services for teenagers and young people including Pieta House, SpunOut.ie, ReachOut.com/Inspire Ireland, and BeLongTo.  The 24-hour call services provided by the Samaritans and Childline are available to any young person in distress and are also funded by the NOSP.  In addition, NOSP also worked closely with the Department of Education and Skills in the development of Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Well-Being in Primary and Post Primary Schools.</p></reply>

The central objective is to ensure that foods, food ingredients or food contact materials which pose a danger to health are identified, traced, removed from sale and that, where appropriate, the public and/or the relevant business are informed without delay.</p>  <p>  The FSAI and the contracted official agencies have protocols in place to deal with food incidents.  The identification of a food incident can arise for a number of reasons such as checks by a food inspector; a complaint from a consumer; the food business informing the FSAI that it has identified a potential risk with a particular food; laboratory results; or notifications from other Member States through the European Commission&rsquo;s network &ndash; known as the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF).</p>  <p>  In 2016, the FSAI dealt with 554 food incidents which resulted in 67 food alerts and food allergen alerts being issued.  The growth in incidents is the result of improving vigilance and co-operation on the part of the food control authorities within Ireland and the EU and a responsible attitude on the part of food business operators in informing the authorities of potential risks.</p>  <p>  Managing food incidents and quickly informing all relevant stakeholders, including the public is vital.  It is reassuring to know that Ireland has systems in place to identify, manage and deal with such food incidents and resulting food alerts when they arise.</p></reply>

The decision made in the Tyco case was based on a set of facts relating to the particular circumstances of peripatetic workers in the context of a pre-existing arrangement in respect of those journeys.</p>  <p>  In the Tyco case, the employer made a decision to abolish its regional offices and directed all regional workers to remotely report to its head office in Madrid.  This decision to abolish the regional offices put these workers at a disadvantage compared to their previous working arrangements. The CJEU found that the fact that the journeys of the workers, at the beginning and end of each day to and from customers, had been regarded by Tyco as working time before the abolition of the regional offices, showed that the work consisting of driving a vehicle from a regional office to the first customer and from the last customer to that office was previously considered to be working time by the employer.  The Court noted that the nature of those journeys had not changed since the abolition of the regional offices and it was only the departure point of the journeys that had changed.  It is these distinct facts pertaining to the circumstances of these workers that informed the decision of the Court.  </p>  <p>  In relation to how this ruling affects employees in the Irish Health Service, I will be guided by how our national court interprets this ruling in the context of the provision of home help and home support services.</p></reply>

The vaccine has not been available in Ireland since the end of April 2015.  Consequently, BCG vaccination clinics in HSE Clinics and Maternity hospitals have been postponed.</p>  <p>  There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland and to other countries within the EU.  The manufacturer has had difficulties in the production of the BCG vaccine.  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG vaccine to ascertain when the vaccine might be available.  The HSE has also asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which licenses and regulates all human medicines in Ireland, to source an alternate supplier of the BCG vaccine.  Efforts have been made to find a company who can provide the vaccine for use in Ireland which satisfies all the HPRA requirements on safety and efficacy.  There has been a worldwide shortage for over two years and to date no suitable alternative BCG product has been found.  Therefore the HSE has been unable to procure the BCG vaccine from any other source and still awaits the product from the HPRA licensed supplier of the vaccine. </p>  <p>  The supplier has indicated that supplies of the vaccine are not expected to be delivered into Ireland later in 2017.  When there is confirmation of the date of new supply, the HSE will be guided by the recommendations of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee on its administration.</p></reply>

The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  In order to determine how much an applicant will contribute to the cost of their care, a financial assessment is carried out by the HSE which takes account of a person's income and assets.  As part of this assessment, the HSE identifies any income or assets that the applicant and his/her partner may have deprived themselves of in the five years leading up to their application, or at any time on or subsequent to the date on which the application for financial support under the Scheme is first made.  Such assets are defined in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009 as 'transferred assets' and 'transferred income'.

A detailed response to the Deputy will be issued as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  With regard to urology services at Letterkenny University Hopsital, the Saolta University Healthcare Group advises that the Urology Specialty Lead at University Hospital Galway (UHG) is currently providing services in LUH, with 2 outpatient sessions per month, supported by a Urology Locum who provides 50% day surgery and 50% intermediate surgery sessions, including day-case cystoscopy, on 4 days per month in total.  All complex or Urgent Urology cases are referred to Galway.</p>  <p>  As part of its Strategic Plan, Saolta envisages operating a hub and spoke urology service model, with a sub-hub in the North West that will provide the majority of urology care locally, as a component of a Group-wide department. </p>  <p>  With regard to urology services at UHG, there are a number of measures that are being taken by the Hospital, and at national level, which are intended to reduce current pressure and improve timely access to services at UHG.  The UHG Urology Service is provided by 7.5 whole time equivalent Consultant Surgeons and has grown significantly in recent years.</p>  <p>  However, Saolta advises that the non-cancer elective and emergency workload has been impacted by limited access to diagnostics, in-patient beds and operating room time; due in part to challenges associated with demand for unscheduled care and shortages of theatre nurses, both of which are currently being addressed.  GUH has reinstated the Surgical Day Ward, which will facilitate the provision of day case treatment, including urology day cases. </p>  <p>  Also, University Hospital Galway is one of the two national  Patient Flow Project pilot sites; this project is assisting with improvements in patient flow, access and efficiency. </p>  <p>  In terms of general capacity expansion in UHG, funding has been provided in the 2017 Capital Plan to progress the design of a new ED, as outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government. </p>  <p>  New Development and Winter Initiative funding have also been allocated, such that 28 beds in the new ward block have already been opened in early January in order to alleviate seasonal congestion.  Recruitment is on-going in order to facilitate the timely opening of further capacity within the new ward block.</p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria. </p><p>1. The health needs of the public.</p><p>2. The cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services.</p><p>3. The availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement. </p><p>4. The proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks.</p><p>5. The potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item.</p><p>6. The clinical need for the item or listed item.</p><p>7. The appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety.</p><p>8. The efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it eats a condition than existing therapies). </p><p>9. The resources available to the HSE.</p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Respreeza, for reimbursement of maintenance treatment of emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency.</p><p>In June last year, the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.  The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation on 9 December 2016.  The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug and did not recommend it for reimbursement.</p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: .</p><p>The HSE considers the NCPE assessment, and other expert advice, as part of its decision-making process for reimbursement, which is made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed that the drug Respreeza was considered by the HSE Drugs Group, which did not make a recommendation for reimbursement on clinical grounds.  The HSE Leadership team has accepted the Drugs Group recommendation of non-reimbursement.</p><p>Under the HSE statutory assessment process, the HSE is required to set out a notice of any proposed decision to an applicant company.  The HSE is legally required to provide at least a 28 day period (from the formal written notice of proposal), to enable the pharmaceutical company to consider any such proposal not to reimburse and to make representations to the HSE if it wishes to do so.  The HSE is required to consider any such representations in advance of a formal decision.</p><p>Therefore, as the statutory process is still ongoing, the company has an opportunity to have further discussions with the HSE. </p><p>In relation to the compassionate access scheme operated by the manufacturer, CSL Behring, I note the decision of the Company to extend the scheme by a further two months.  However it is important to point out that the operation of such compassionate schemes is at the discretion of manufacturers.  I as Minister for Health have no role in the operation of these schemes.  There is no provision in Irish legislation for the approval of compassionate use programmes for specific groups of patients with an unmet medical need. </p><p>I have previously said that any attempts by manufacturers to link continued access for patients already being treated with a new medicine with decisions under the statutory reimbursement process is both inappropriate and unethical.  Manufacturers should operate such schemes in a compassionate and not a commercially-motivated manner.  There should be no link between compassionate use schemes and reimbursement decisions and manufacturers should be up-front with patients and clinicians from the outset.</p></reply>

Shortly afterwards, the second phase implemented universal GP care without fees for all people aged 70 years and over.  This has resulted in approximately 800,000 people now being eligible for GP care without fees, without having to undergo a means test and represents a major step forward in improving access, quality and affordability of health care in Ireland.  The under-6s GP service contract, which includes age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and a cycle of care for children with asthma, underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to enhancing primary care and keeping people well in their own community.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to extending in phases, and subject to negotiation with GPs, free GP care to all children under 18 years of age.  Legislative changes will be required for any such extension of GP care without fees to further cohorts of the population.</p>  <p>  The extension of GP care without fees to children aged 6-11 years is one of the actions listed in the HSE's National Service Plan 2017, however the timetable is subject to the outcome of discussions with GP representatives on this and other contractual matters.</p>  <p>  The next phase of discussions on a new GP contract is under way and engagement with GP representative bodies has commenced.  As with any negotiation-type process, and given the range and complexity of the issues to be discussed, the engagement may take some time.  While I am of course anxious to see good progress made, it is not my intention to set a deadline for completion of discussions.</p></reply>

Dr. Herity  recommended that the current 9 to 5 provision of these services should cease in order to allow the hospital to focus on the much larger volume of planned cath lab work.</p>  <p>  I accept Dr Herity's findings and recommendations.  However, as Minister for Health, I want to be sure that any services changes which we implement, will result in improved services for patients using that service.  Therefore, I have asked my Department to address the implications of this recommendation by undertaking a national review of all PPCI services with the aim to ensure that as many patients as possible have access, on a 24/7 basis, to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that Dr Herity concluded that the needs of the effective UHW catchment population could be accommodated from a single cath lab.  However, he recommended investment to enhance cardiac services at the hospital and to provide an additional 8 hours cath lab activity per week to address waiting times and to provide improved access for patients.  At the time of the report's publication, I committed to providing the additional resources to UHW as recommended.  I am pleased therefore to confirm that an additional &euro;500,000 has been allocated to the hospital for 2017.</p></reply>

The reports provide evidence that a number of the hospitals inspected have robust and effective governance systems in place for medicines management.  When taken together, these reports improve visibility of current medication management practice, identify variation in practice, where present, and identify system requirements to reduce risks.  This in turn provides a clear opportunity for improvement and further development of these systems.</p>  <p>  Individual hospitals, including University Hospital Waterford, now have direction in terms of their requirements for improvement.  As Hospital Groups continue to develop their governance structures, they are well placed to provide leadership and support to enable individual hospitals to address the findings of the HIQA reports.  Hospital Group CEOs have an important role to play to ensure that medication safety is prioritised and to ensure that smaller hospitals are supported in terms of the development, application and evaluation of Group protocols, processes and practices, to promote and ensure medication safety.  This approach will also ensure that resources required to underpin medication safety are optimised and maximised and that learning and expertise is shared across all hospitals and the system in general. </p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly in relation to your specific queries regarding University Hospital Waterford.</p></reply>

St. James's has the broadest range of national specialties of all our acute hospitals, in addition to a strong and well-established research and education infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to enable the children&rsquo;s hospital achieve our vision of excellence in modern paediatric practice.  A major milestone was achieved in this long awaited, much needed project when An Bord Ple&aacute;nala granted planning permission in April 2016 to build a state of the art hospital on a campus shared with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, together with two Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care centres at Tallaght Hospital and Connolly Hospital. The first phase of construction (site clearing works) on the site of the new children&rsquo;s hospital began in August 2016 and will be substantially completed within a matter of weeks.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital will open and provide services to children and young people in Ireland in 2021, and the Urgent Care Centres at Tallaght Hospital and Connolly Hospital will open on a phased basis from 2018.</p>  <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) was appointed in 2013 to design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital for children, young people and families in Ireland. An internationally recognised design team supported by an experienced Board and Project Team are in place, have followed best international design, planning and procurement process at each stage of the project.  The Project Team, during the design, planning and tendering phases, has constantly monitored the external environment &ndash; tracking construction inflation and market costs. The cost estimate for the core construction elements of the new children&rsquo;s hospital and the Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care centres at Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals was prepared in early 2014.  This estimate, prepared at a time when annual construction inflation predicted at 3% per annum, was &euro;650m.  The recently concluded tendering process for the main construction works determined the actual market cost of the construction elements of the project.  Due to annual construction inflation rising from 3% in 2013 to more than 9% in 2017 and the lengthened project timeline in the planning, design and procurement process, the cost of the core construction of the hospital and Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care Centres has increased from the original estimate.  The increase reflects the increasing volume of activity in the Irish construction industry which is having a significant impact on construction inflation. </p>  <p>  The Final Project Brief sets out the costs and funding proposals for the construction of the core hospital and satellite centres, including VAT provision, risk provision, all fees, decant, external works, enabling costs and project management costs.  Importantly, it also includes commercial spaces (underground carpark and retail space), higher education facilities, the Children&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Centre, and equipment.   </p>  <p>  While I am not in a position to comment on cost at this stage, I understand that the final construction elements of the project compare favourably to the costs of international projects of a similar size and scale.  I intend to bring a Memorandum to Government in the coming weeks on the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  Full details of the costs will be set out in the Memorandum for Government and will form the basis upon which the approval decision will be made.  The costs and funding will span the period up to and including 2021 in line with project requirements.</p>  <p>  The NPHDB and the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group Board continue to work closely with the HSE and the Department of Health to deliver this much-needed world-class hospital.  My priority, as I have stated before, is to make progress on the new hospital as soon as possible so we can ensure children, young people and their families have the facilities they need and deserve.</p></reply>

This followed the establishment of an Inter-Departmental Group by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in response to the revelations and public controversy regarding conditions in Mother and Baby Homes.  </p>  <p>  Communication between a hospital and bereaved parents following the death of a child  is a hospital service issue.  This is a devastating time for parents.  The development of appropriate bereavement care is an important step in the overall development of quality maternity services, and this is recognised in the National Maternity Strategy - Creating a Better Future Together 2016-2026.  In that regard, the Deputy may wish to note, that in August 2016, I launched the HSE National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death. These standards seek to ensure that clinical and counselling services are in place to support women and their families in all pregnancy loss situations, from early pregnancy loss to perinatal death.  The standards underline the important role that healthcare professionals play in providing a caring and compassionate response to parents, including that of the bereavement specialist teams which will be established in each maternity unit.  The HSE National Service Plan 2017 priorities the implementation of a range of improvement actions across all maternity units, based on the new Standards.</p>  <p>  In regard to past  post mortem practices,  the Deputy will be aware of two Reports by Dr Deirdre Madden published by my Department in 2006.  The first of these reports "Post Mortem Practice and Procedures" inquired into the policies and practices relating to the removal, retention and disposal of organs from children who had undergone post-mortem examination in the State since 1970.  In her report, Dr Madden set out the general facts in relation to paediatric post-mortem practice in Ireland from 1970 to 2000, the way in which information was communicated to parents of deceased children in relation to post-mortem examinations and how these practices might be improved upon for the future.</p>  <p>  The second report "Working Group on Post Mortem Practice" considered the application of the recommendations of the first Report to (a) babies who died before or during birth, (b) minors and (c) adults. </p>  <p>  Since that time, in  March 2012, the Health Service Executive published "Standards and Recommended Practices for Post Mortem Examination Services" and these were circulated to all relevant hospital staff.  The overall aim of the standards and recommended practices for post-mortem examinations is to drive high quality services based on best professional practice and current legal requirements.</p></reply>

This was done in the context of HSE management having developed a fully funded workforce plan for an additional 1,208 nursing/midwifery posts in 2017.  The proposal includes extensive education and personal development opportunities for nurses and midwives to upskill, and a pilot pre-retirement initiative as a method of retaining the expertise of experienced nursing/midwifery staff.  It also includes 127 promotional posts for staff nurses/midwives to Clinical Nurse/Midwife Manager 1.  The management side is also positively disposed to a proposal from the union side for the restoration of a number of allowances for new entrant nurses and this consideration will be concluded in the upcoming pay talks in the summer. </p>  <p>  The above is in addition to the many other initiatives currently underway to improve nursing and midwifery staffing levels throughout the country. Â The number of nursing and midwifery staff increased by 1,650 whole time equivalents between December 2013 and December 2016,Â notwithstanding intense global competition for our nurses and midwives.  The HSE has offered permanent posts to 2016 degree programme graduates in order to retain its graduates. The HSE is also offering full time permanent contracts to those in temporary posts and is also focused on converting posts filled by agency staffing to permanent posts.  Its National Recruitment Service is actively operating rolling nursing recruitment campaigns.  The HSE ran a 3 day open recruitment event over the Christmas holiday period in Dr Steevens&rsquo; Hospital for nurses and midwives from all disciplines interested in working in the Irish Public Health Service. A further event is scheduled for 31 March 2017. A relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 continues to be available to nurses who return from overseas.</p></reply>

The Authority works under the aegis of the Department of Health. </p><p>The Authority&rsquo;s key remit is the enforcement of food safety legislation which is carried out on behalf of the FSAI by a network of official agencies through the service contracts programme.  The FSAI monitors and reports on these activities and seeks continuous improvement and accountability through a programme of regular audits.  The Authority supports Ministers in the development of a well-functioning, robust and proportionate food regulatory framework and provides the best independent scientific advice to underpin policy and risk analysis in respect of food safety.</p><p>The use of additives in Irish food is strictly controlled by European Union (EU) legislation which requires that only authorised food additives may be used in the manufacture or preparation of foodstuffs.  At European level all additives approved for use in current legislation have been evaluated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) or previously by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF).  All approvals of food additives are kept under review by the regulatory authorities as and when scientific and medical information becomes available on possible adverse effects, not previously recognised or reported. </p><p>The FSAI has advised my Department that it is aware of a number of scientific studies linking the ingestion of Titanium Dioxide nanoparticles to potentially negative health effects.  The recently reported studies carried out in France and the USA raising concerns about Titanium Dioxide have been brought to the attention of the European Commission and EFSA.  </p><p>Titanium Dioxide&rsquo;s use as a food additive (E171) was last evaluated by EFSA in June 2016.  Taking all available evidence and data into account, EFSA experts concluded that titanium dioxide in food does not indicate health concerns for consumers, though further studies were recommended to bridge any data gaps on possible effects on the reproductive system in order to enable them to set an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI).</p><p>The European Commission is currently calling for scientific and technical data needed to address issues identified by EFSA in the re-evaluation of the safety of titanium dioxide as a food additive.  Once this data becomes available it will be assessed by EFSA.</p></reply>

The commitment is outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles, equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) is committed to protecting the level of Personal Assistant services available to people with disabilities.  In their National Service Plan for 2016, the HSE exceeded the expected activity level for Personal Assistant hours which was 1.3 million hours, by approximately 200,000 hours. This reflects the responsive nature of the service provided and takes account of assessed need over time, as individual needs change.

The Regulations also revise the list of Special Items of Service, which are made available to patients under the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the new Framework, if two practice units are providing general practitioner services in the same qualifying area, both practices may qualify for a modified allowance of &euro;10,000. GPs holding a permanent GMS contract who received the Rural Practice Allowance of &euro;16,216.07 immediately prior to the introduction of the new Regulations who do not meet the new qualifying criteria continue to receive the payment on a personal basis, provided they retain their contractual commitment to the remote rural area. </p>  <p>  As at 1st February 2017, there are 252 practice units in receipt of rural supports under the RPSF. 177 practices receive the financial allowance of &euro;20,000 and 19 practices receive the modified allowance of &euro;10,000. The full year cost of increasing the existing allowance to &euro;25,000 and the corresponding modified allowance to &euro;12,500 for these practices would amount to nearly &euro;1 million. Any increase in the financial allowance under the new RPSF would only apply to those practices that qualify under the new criteria, therefore these calculations have excluded the 56 GPs who currently receive the old financial allowance of &euro;16,216.07.</p></reply>

Among its recommendations were that approximately 10,650 Mental Health Whole Time Equivalents were required to fully implement the policy. </p>  <p>  This figure was based on Ireland&rsquo;s then population of 3.917 million, as indicated in the 2002 census. The population of Ireland today, based on the most recent confirmed Census figures in 2011, is 4.499 million. Taking into account this demographic change, the required number of Mental Health Whole Time Equivalents is now 12,240.</p>  <p>  As of November 2016, there were 9,576 Mental Health Whole Time Equivalents employed, a gap of 2,664. Using an average figure of &euro;66,000 per Whole Time Equivalent, the additional resources required to fill the gap would be &euro;175.8 million per annum.</p>  <p>  Since 2012, around &euro;115 million has been added to the HSE Mental Health Budget, which totalled &euro;826 million in 2016. Budget 2017 made allowance for an additional &euro;35 million for services to be initiated in 2017. Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with this increased allocation will be some &euro;15 million.  There will also be a further additional spend of &euro;9.5 million in mental health associated with increased pay rates.  With other minor adjustments the total budget for mental health in 2017 will be &euro;853.1 million.</p>  <p>Recruitment to meet the needs of our mental health services is therefore underpinned by the increased Budget Allocations in the National Service Plans of recent years, which have progressed the implementation of A Vision For Change. A Vision for Change has guided national mental health policy for the past 10 years and its term came to an end in 2016.  The Department of Health recently commissioned an expert evidence review and analysis of national and international best practice in the development and delivery of mental health services. This review of evidence will inform the parameters of a review of A Vision for Change  , by identifying sites of best practice and outlining how these models can apply to the Irish context.  The evidence review has now been completed and will inform the ongoing review of mental health policy. Consideration is currently being given to establishing an appropriate oversight structure for the mental health policy review process, based on the outcome of the expert review.</p></reply>

It will take into account such expert opinions and recommendations which it may have sought at its sole discretion, for example from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p><p>In considering an application, the HSE will also have regard to Part 1 and Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the 2013 Act.  Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria.</p><p>1. The health needs of the public.</p><p>2. The cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services.</p><p>3. The availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement.</p><p>4. The proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks.</p><p>5. The potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item.</p><p>6. The clinical need for the item or listed item.</p><p>7. The appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety.</p><p>8. The efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it eats a condition than existing therapies).</p><p>9. The resources available to the HSE. </p><p>I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of Orkambi.  This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets, including those associated with hospitalisation, disease management, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising for patients not taking Orkambi.</p><p>The NCPE has completed its health technology assessment and this is available on its website.  It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016.  The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE has confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis. In line with the HSE's assessment process, the HSE Drugs Committee considered the NCPE recommendation, the manufacturer&rsquo;s submissions and commercial and other information.  Following this consideration, the Drugs Committee did not recommend reimbursement at the current price.  The HSE Directorate considered the Drugs Committee&rsquo;s recommendation in December and the Directorate took the decision not to reimburse at the current price offered by the company. </p><p>The HSE has since re-entered negotiations with the manufacturer of Orkambi and Kalydeco. Meetings were held in December and in early January. </p><p>This process is now reaching a crucial stage, and it is expected that this will be concluded in a period of weeks.  However, given the scale of the investment and the potential benefits for Irish patients I continue to call on all parties to support the HSE in their engagement and to provide the space for this process to be concluded.</p><p>I am acutely aware of how difficult this is for CF patients and their families, there is no doubt that the last number of months have been a stressful and worrying time and I understand that people feel they don&rsquo;t have time to wait.  However, the Government&rsquo;s priority is to achieve the best outcome for Irish CF patients and the health system overall.</p></reply>

I would like to assure the Deputy that this is a priority action for me and my Department.</p>  <p>  As I have previously advised, my intention is that the review will have a wider scope than previous exercises and will examine key elements of primary and community care infrastructure in addition to hospital facilities.  </p>  <p>  Assessing capacity requirements is a complex task and cannot be divorced from considerations on the underlying model of care we want to develop for the Irish health service.  It is widely acknowledged that primary care can provide more appropriate and effective management and treatment of some illnesses and conditions, especially chronic diseases.  Similarly, the availability of non-acute beds and services in the community can mitigate the need for acute hospital admission, or facilitate earlier discharge.  These factors directly contribute to the demands on the acute hospital system.  It is important that it is within this context that the review is undertaken. </p>  <p>  Draft terms of reference for the review have been developed, these are as follows:</p>  <p>  - To consider current capacity in the health system and benchmark with international comparators;</p>  <p>  - to determine drivers of future demand for healthcare including demographic and epidemiological trends;</p>  <p>  - to analyse how reforms to the model of care will impact on future capacity requirements across the system; and</p>  <p>  - to provide an overall assessment of current and future capacity requirements for each year for the period 2017-2030.</p>  <p>  The review is being led by my Department and will be overseen by a Steering Group.  The Steering Group is now in place and includes senior officials from my Department and the Departments of the Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, and experts with a clinical and academic background.  It will hold its first meeting this month, at which I expect it to consider the terms of reference for the review and to begin discussions on issues such as the review process, external expertise requirements and stakeholder consultations. </p>  <p>  An independent peer group of international health experts will also be established to review and validate the review methodology and findings. </p>  <p>  It is essential that this review is progressed sufficiently to enable it to feed into the mid-term review of the capital programme, which will take place later in the year.  While the review will consider capacity requirements over the next decade or so, I am also anxious that it have a short-term focus and determine how capital investment over the coming years can be best targeted, given the current pressures being experienced within our hospital services. </p>  <p>  The mechanisms for the review are now in place, and I look forward to the emerging findings later in the year.</p></reply>

An applicant has this specified period of time in which to ensure all required documents are received by the NMBI in order to consider their application.

Any undue delays in registration of nurses are obviously of concern to both the NMBI and myself as Minister for Health.  The NMBI is very much aware of the importance of providing an efficient, high quality registration service.  The Board will continue to make improvements in this regard, however this will in part depend on the applicants providing all the required documentation. </p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross Border Healthcare provides rules for the reimbursements to patients of the cost of receiving treatment abroad, where the patient would be entitled to such treatment in their home Member State, and supplements the rights that patients already have at EU level.  Public patients may access the healthcare they require in either the public or private healthcare system of another Member State under the Cross-Border Directive (CBD).  Access to healthcare abroad is based on patients following public patient pathways, i.e. they must demonstrate they have followed the equivalent public patient pathways that a patient would follow if accessing public healthcare in Ireland.  It is important to note that reimbursement is confined to the costs of the care itself and that the rates of reimbursement cannot exceed the cost of provision of the care if it were provided in the Irish public health service.  Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other HSE clinicians.  The CBD excludes certain health services, e.g. services of public health, long-term care, organ transplantation, etc.  All persons on public waiting lists, other than for such exempt health services, are eligible for the Scheme.  Full details are available on the HSE website.</p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  </p>  <p>  In December 2016, I granted approval to the NTPF to dedicate &euro;5m to a daycase waiting list initiative with the aim of ensuring that no patient will be waiting more than 18 months for a daycase procedure by 30 June 2017.  In excess of 2,000 daycases will be managed through this process and outsourcing of treatment will commence from March.  </p>  <p>  In addition to this Daycase Initiative, the NTPF has been working closely with my Department and the HSE to agree an approach to the remaining 2017 allocation.  The HSE is currently developing a 2017 Waiting List Action Plans for Inpatient/Daycase procedures and Outpatient appointments to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 15 months by the end of October. The Inpatient/Day case Plan is being developed in conjunction with the NTPF's approach to the utilisation of its remaining &euro;10m funding for patient treatment in 2017. </p>  <p>  The HSE has now submitted Draft Waiting List Action Plans for Inpatient Daycases and Scoliosis.  My Department is currently reviewing and evaluating these plans and engagement is ongoing with the HSE and the NTPF towards the finalisation of the former.

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The HSE operates the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) for persons entitled to treatment in another EU/EEA Member State or Switzerland under EU Regulation (EC) No. 883/2004, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulations (EC) No. 987/2009, and in accordance with Department of Health Guidelines.  Patients apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the State through model form E112.  Subject to the EU Regulations and Guidelines, the TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland through the issue of form E112 (IE) where the treatment is:</p>  <p>  - Among the benefits provided for by Irish legislation,</p>  <p>  - Not available in Ireland,</p>  <p>  - Not available within the time normally necessary for obtaining it in Ireland, taking account of the patient's current state of health and the probable course of the disease.</p>  <p>  Applications to TAS are processed and a determination is given in accordance with the statutory framework prior to a patient travelling to avail of treatment.  The statutory framework stipulates the patient must be a public patient and is required to have followed public patient pathways.  GPs refer patients to consultants for acute care and it is the treating consultant who, having exhausted all treatment options including tertiary care within the country, refers the patient abroad under the terms of the TAS.  The consultant must specify the specific treatment and in making the referral accepts clinical responsibility in relation to the physician and facility abroad where the patient will attend. </p>  <p>  Each application is reviewed individually and a decision is made in accordance with the legislation and guidelines and on the basis of a review by clinical experts.  Each application is given a formal written decision and where a decision is one of decline, the reason for that decision is clearly outlined and the option of an appeal is afforded.  Previous approvals or declines are not used as an influencing factor on subsequent applications.  The appeals process is outlined in each decline letter without exception.  Where on appeal a decline decision is upheld, the appeal decision letter advises that the applicant can make a further appeal to the Office of the Ombudsman.   </p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  All relevant and appropriate information is taken into account when deciding to make changes to the State's immunisation programmes.</p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.  NIAC recommended that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.</p>  <p>  Gardasil is the HPV vaccine used in Ireland in the context of the HSE schools immunisation programme.  In Ireland more than 660,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and almost 250,000 girls have been vaccinated against HPV.  Over 205 million doses of the HPV vaccine Gardasil have been distributed worldwide, either as part of national immunisation programmes or by private doctors.  Gardasil is currently used in over 25 European countries, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses.</p>  <p>  The focus for the HPV programme in 2017 is to counter misinformation in relation to the safety of the HPV vaccine, and to increase the uptake rate in girls as part of the schools immunisation programme.  The benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh the known side effects.  The safety of these vaccines, as with all medicines, will continue to be carefully monitored and will take into account any future new evidence of side effects that becomes available.  I encourage the parents of all eligible girls to ensure that their daughters receive this important cancer-preventing vaccine.</p></reply>

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe.  Lyme disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe.</p><p>Lyme borreliosis can be asymptomatic or have a range of clinical presentations.  Current best advice is that diagnosis should be made only after careful examination of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk evaluation.  Exposure to ticks prior to disease manifestations is necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Since an awareness or recollection of a tick-bite is not always present, however, this should not exclude the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Later stages require the use of antibody detection tests (or advanced DNA detection techniques).  Testing for Lyme Disease is undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Public Health England Porton Down facility which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities.  This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test.</p><p>Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.  In Ireland, treatment by most clinicians is based on that laid out in evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and babesiosis published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2006.</p><p>This pharmacological regime can be summarised thus:</p><p>- Doxycycline, amoxicillin or cefuroxime for the treatment of adults with early localized or early disseminated Lyme disease associated with erythema migrans, in the absence of specific neurologic manifestations (ceftriaxone in early Lyme disease for adults with acute neurologic disease manifested by meningitis or radiculopathy);</p><p>- Doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime for adults with Lyme arthritis but without clinical evidence of neurologic disease;</p><p>- For late neurological disease in adults - intravenous ceftriaxone, cefotaxime or Penicillin G.</p><p>Since 2013, the HPSC has held an annual &lsquo;Lyme Awareness Week&rsquo; at the beginning of the tick biting season, the purpose of which is to draw attention - particularly in the media - to Lyme disease and the ticks that can spread this disease.  Lyme cases tend to appear in Ireland with greater frequency after April, hence the choice of this time of year for Lyme Awareness Week.  Both the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and Tick Talk Ireland provide guidance on protection against contracting Lyme borelliosis.  The best protection is to prevent tick bites, when walking in grassy, bushy or woodland areas, particularly between May and October. Further advice can be obtained from the HPSC website () and the HPSC produced a leaflet on &ldquo;<i>Protecting Yourself Against Tick Bites and Lyme Disease</i>&rdquo; which is available for the public to download.</p><p>My colleague, Minister of State Corcoran Kennedy, who has responsibility for health protection, met with representatives from Tick Talk last summer, and listened to their experiences and the impact of this condition.  Their stories showed the need for additional awareness of Lyme disease, both by the public and the health services.</p><p>A Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has been established to look at methods of raising awareness especially in those areas (including recreation areas) where Lyme-carrying ticks can be most expected to be found.  The aim of this Sub-Committee is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency, an Environmental Health Officer, and member of Tick Talk has been invited to be the patient representative on the Sub-Committee.  The initial involves a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners, the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland for general practitioners, and ongoing work in drawing together the Final Report of the Sub-Committee.</p></reply>

Two changes were made to the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule with the introduction of Men B and Rotavirus for all babies born on or after 1 October, 2016.  As the first doses of these vaccines are administered to children when they reach two months, the changes to the immunisation schedule took effect from 1 December, 2016.  All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule are provided free of charge.  However, there are no plans at this stage to introduce a catch-up programme for older children.

A lack of funding for the mental health care programme is not a difficulty at present for the HSE, but there are acknowledged staff recruitment and retention difficulties across the health care system, including CAMHS, that the Executive is addressing.  A new Standard Operating Procedures introduced in June 2015 has provided greater clarity and consistency on how this specialist mental health service for children should be delivered nationally.  Despite increasing demands overall on CAMHS, irrespective of the source of referrals, individual cases professionally assessed as requiring urgent access to services receive priority.</p>  <p>  The HSE Service Plan 2017 provides for further development of the CAMHS service, including better out-of-hours liaison and seven-day response cover, against a background where the population of children is expected to increase by around 8,500 over 2016-17.  Around 18,500 children will attend the HSE CAMHS service this year, including around 14,000 referrals.  Detailed activity data on access to CAMHS, and also on age-appropriate admissions to care units, is published by the Executive in its monthly Performance Reports available on the HSE website.  This shows, for example, 68% of children referred are seen within twelve weeks.</p>  <p>  In regard to admission of child and adolescent cases to adult units, there has been significant progress on age appropriate admissions since 2008 when there were 247 such admissions to adult units in that year.  This declined to 68 admissions in 2016, despite increasing demands overall.  The number of admissions does not necessarily equate to the actual number of children involved, as an individual child may be admitted on more than one occasion in any given year.  Performance generally continues to be above the HSE Service Plan target figure of 95%, and indications also are that where a child has been admitted to an adult acute in-patient unit, the length of stay has been kept to a minimum.  There has to be some operational flexibility surrounding emergency placements in Adult Units, particularly where very short-term placements occur, and where full account is taken of all relevant factors such as the preferences of all those involved, or geographical factors relating to access or visiting.  The HSE closely monitors on a weekly basis all child admissions to adult units, with a view to minimising these.</p>  <p>  Work is underway by the HSE to review existing levels of service provision generally, and to examine international models of best practice on the most appropriate models of delivery for use in the Irish context in order to enhance access to mental health care, including CAMHS.  My objective, and that of the HSE, is to further improve all aspects of mental health care nationally for those under age 18, including those relating to access and age-appropriate care settings.</p></reply>

In addition under the Initiative, since October: over 4,260 patients have availed of aids and appliances; over 1,050 additional homecare packages and 615 additional transitional care beds have been provided, enabling patients to be discharged from hospital sooner.</p>  <p>  The Special Delivery Unit in the HSE works with individual hospitals to drive process improvements and support hospitals in ensuring that effective discharge procedures are put in place.  Within this context hospitals are required to ensure that a predicted date of discharge is assigned to every patient and that regular ward rounds are conducted by senior clinical decision-makers, including at weekends as appropriate, to enable discharge of patients fit to go home.  Also a number of hospitals have established discharge lounges to support early discharging.  Further, the Winter Initiative supported the expansion of Community Intervention Teams, including where possible the provision of a 7 day service to enable discharge home over the weekends.</p>  <p>  As part of this oversight role, the HSE works with hospitals to ensure that appropriate senior cover, at management and consultant level, is provided at all times including at weekends and during public holidays.</p></reply>

While the market share for electronic cigarettes and refill containers is growing, the long-term effects of vaping on public health are not yet known.  Electronic cigarettes are regulated by the European Union (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco and Related Products) Regulations 2016.  These Regulations transposed the European Tobacco Products Directive and came into effect on 20 May 2016.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the workplace smoking ban was based on clear and unequivocal evidence that second hand smoke is harmful to non-smokers.  That evidence base does not exist for the aerosol generated from e-cigarettes.

Controlling the substances in the Act was part one of a two-step process and Regulations and various Orders are also required to allow legitimate users (e.g. patients with a prescription, health professionals) to possess the substances.</p>  <p>  Drafting of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations and Orders is complex and technical in nature and involved consultation with a number of State Agencies.  However, since Autumn 2016 significant resources in the Medicines, Controlled Drugs and Pharmacy Unit within the Department have had to be allocated to drafting of the Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Bill and also dealing with various issues in relation to the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes.</p>  <p>  It was also necessary to notify to the European Commission under the Technical Standards Directive.  Under this Directive Member States are required to inform the Commission of any new regulations or standards which may create a barrier to the free movement of goods.  Since these draft Regulations have the potential to affect trade, in particular because of the introduction of a requirement for import licences, they must be notified to the EU whilst they are in draft form and before they are adopted in national law.  This process has now been completed.</p>  <p>  It is therefore expected that various sections of the 2016 Act will be commenced in the coming weeks when the drafting of the various Regulations and Orders is complete.</p></reply>

In addition, early January 2017 saw continued significant pressure on our EDs due to high demand, increased incidence of flu mainly affecting older people, as well as ongoing bed capacity constraints due to staff shortages.</p>  <p>  The Emergency Department Taskforce (EDTF) was convened in December 2014 to provide focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by ED overcrowding.  The EDTF Implementation Oversight Group has met seven times over the course of 2016 and into 2017, most recently on the 6th January 2017.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in September 2016, the HSE launched the &lsquo;Winter Initiative Plan 2016-2017&rsquo; which provided &euro;40 million of additional funding for winter preparedness and to assist hospitals to deal with increased demand.  In January 2017, in response to significant pressures in our EDs in the early New Year, a series of enhanced measures were added to this Initiative.</p>  <p>  So far, the Initiative has delivered 90 newly-opened additional beds.  Also, as of 28 February, delayed discharges have reduced nationally to 517, freeing up hospitals beds to alleviate ED pressures.  In addition under the Initiative, since October: over 4,260 patients have availed of aids and appliances; over 1,050 additional homecare packages and 615 additional transitional care beds have been provided, enabling patients to be discharged from hospital sooner.  The work of the EDTF and Implementation of the Winter Initiative is supported by the work of the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) of the HSE on the ground supporting process improvement and the delivery of key targets at sites throughout the country.</p>  <p>  A key element of the Winter Initiative has been for the HSE to work with hospitals to develop key improvement actions and Winter Plans at each site aimed at preparing for the expected increased demand during the winter period.  This essential work continues and there are indications that some of our larger hospitals have harnessed Winter Initiative measures and improved processes, to decrease the number of patients waiting on trolleys, whilst contending with increased demand.  Learning from this Winter Initiative will be used to improve planning for future years and along with my Department, every week, I meet with senior officials from the HSE, including the Director General, to monitor progress on the Winter Initiative and ED Performance.</p></reply>

A large part of the Strategy is focused on youth mental health, and sets out a vision where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and well-being.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) oversees the implementation of this strategy.  The Strategy assigns specific responsibility to NOSP as a statutory agency to fulfil a number of tasks, including the development and provision of suicide prevention training and education programmes, increasing national awareness about suicide prevention and setting out a national suicide research and prevention programme.  In this way there is on-going oversight of the supports that are in place across the country for children and young people. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is currently leading the review of A Vision for Change with a view to the development of a successor policy which will complete the process of modernising mental health services and effectively promoting mental health, for both adults and children.  In the first instance, an expert review and analysis of international evidence and best practice in the development of mental health services, including a review of current delivery of services in Ireland, has recently been completed.  This expert review will provide evidence to determine the policy direction for a revision of 'A Vision for Change'.  An Oversight Committee will also be established within three months of completion of the expert review to oversee the development of a new policy, informed by the expert review.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have convened and Chair the National Taskforce on Youth Mental Health.  This group is considering how best to introduce and teach resilience and coping mechanisms to children and young people.  The aim of the Taskforce is to provide national leadership on youth mental health and wellbeing in order to enhance how the public, private and voluntary and community sectors work together to improve; emotional literacy in the population; awareness of services and supports; accessibility to services and supports at different times and in different areas; and alignment of services and supports across different providers (public organisations, private organisations, community organisations, voluntary organisations, etc.).</p>  <p>  The Taskforce is a small, diverse group of 18 leading national figures that represent a number of different sectors.It is an action-focused group, has met monthly since September 2016 and will work for 12-18 months.  It has visited frontline services, and met with service users, parents and staff.  As part of my commitment to ensuring that the voices of children and young people are at the core of the work of the Taskforce, a series of consultations with young people has commenced.</p></reply>

The granting of such a licence must, however, be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health by a Consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who makes the clinical decision to prescribe the treatment and monitor its effects over time.</p><p>I have been advised that the granting of an individual licence for the use of cannabis for medical purposes by the Department of Health sets aside the usual regulatory processes which are in place to protect the public.  These processes are in place in order to ensure that only those medications which have been found to be both effective and safe are made available to the public.  Therefore, it is crucial that the granting of any such licence takes due care and consideration of the potential unintended consequences associated with the prescription of cannabis for medical purposes, and that its use is endorsed by a Consultant who is familiar with and responsible for the care of the individual for whom the licence application is being made.</p><p>As I noted in the D&aacute;il on the 31 January, the appropriateness of any particular treatment is a matter between the patient and their doctor.  I, as Minister for Health, can have no role in the patient-doctor relationship and any involvement or interference in that regard by myself or my Department would be wholly inappropriate. </p><p>The professional role of doctors and pharmacists is integral to the safe and effective use of all drugs which are prescribed.  In establishing an access programme for medical cannabis, it is therefore critical that the expert views of these professionals, through their professional bodies, are considered.  Efforts are underway to ensure that, prior to its establishment, the planned access programme reflects this expert input in order to assure clarity of the roles and responsibilities of doctors and pharmacists in prescribing and dispensing cannabis for medical purposes in the interests of safe and effective practice.</p></reply>

The Group has presented a report to the Department, which makes various recommendationsÂ for the strategic development of the laboratories.  ThisÂ includes options for the future development of the Department's Regional Laboratories &ndash; with a view to improving disease investigative and surveillance capability but with the over-riding imperative of maintaining and enhancing services to farmers.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently consulting with all relevant stakeholders.  An initial round of internal consultation with staff and their representative bodies concluded last week.Â Â Consultative meetingsÂ with local representatives of the main farming organisationsÂ were held to coincide with meetings with staff at each of the regional laboratories.Â  At national level, the Department hasÂ written toÂ each of the mainÂ farming organisations, other relevant representative bodies andÂ state agencies (who avail of the services and expertise provided by the Department's Laboratories)Â - providing each with copy of the Working Group Report, inviting comments and offering to meet to discuss their views.  It is hoped to convene these consultative meetings over the next few weeks.Â  </p>  <p>  AÂ decision on any of the recommendations will await the outcome of this consultative process.  In the case of the Regional Veterinary Laboratories, any decision will also be informed by a cost benefit analysis of the various options that have been proposed for their future development.</p></reply>

Therefore I was pleased to facilitate the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo;, which was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and makes &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%.  Distributed and administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, the Scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  The participating banks will report to the SBCI on a regular basis although no returns have been made as yet.  Very strong interest has been reported and it is anticipated that official figures will be available shortly. </p>  <p>  My Department is contributing &euro;25million in total, including &euro;11 million from the EU&rsquo;s &lsquo;exceptional adjustment aid for milk and other livestock farmers&rsquo; and &euro;14 million in national funding.  SBCI uses the &euro;25 million to leverage the fund, i.e. the other &euro;125 million is being provided by the &lsquo;finance providers&rsquo; (AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank).  SBCI are not providing funding but, along with the European Investment Fund&rsquo;s &lsquo;COSME&rsquo; (the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs), is providing the guarantee required to underpin the loan&rsquo;s flexibility and lower the cost of the loans. </p>  <p>  The public money is used primarily for two purposes, an interest rate subsidy and a guarantee.  Approximately an equal amount of money goes towards both.  The interest rate subsidy is paid to the finance providers and the guarantee amount is retained by the SBCI to be used in the event of defaults.  Defaults in the agriculture sector are traditionally low and any unused guarantee funds will be repaid to the Department.</p></reply>

My Department endeavours to have reactors removed from a holding as quickly as possible and, indeed, it provides a fully State funded reactor removal service to facilitate this.  However, there are many factors beyond the control of my Department which may delay the removal of reactors.  These include delays on the part of the herdowner in accepting a valuation, the need to comply with EU regulations prohibiting the transport of animals in late stages of pregnancy or having recently calved, the medication of animals shortly before the skin test etc.Â  My Department does not believe that such delays constitute a risk to other animals in the herds because farmers are required by law to segregate reactors from the rest of the herd and to take other biosecurity precautions thereby mitigating the risk of the spread of disease. </p></reply>

Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p>  <p>  If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy believed that ambitious growth projections were achievable by 2025; including </p>  <p>  - increasing the value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; and </p>  <p>  - the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agri-food sector, all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Oireachtas Committee&rsquo;s recommendation to review the strategy in the light of Brexit, it is important to understand that Food Wise 2025 is a living and evolving strategy.

I am very conscious of the positive effect that the programme is having on the Irish suckler herd. It will help to improve productivity, profitability and carbon efficiency in the national herd. </p>  <p>  The BDGP was introduced under Article 28 (Agri-Environment Climate measures) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development. Any actions paid under this measure can only be paid, in accordance with the regulation, on agri-environment climate commitments. Furthermore payments may only be paid on the basis of income foregone or costs Â incurred. </p>  <p>  Â As can be seen from the foregoing it is not simply a matter of saying that farmers would have to complete action X or action Y if the current funding levels for the BDGP were increased over the amount which has been ringfenced for the 2014-2020 RDP window under the BDGP to increase payment rates. Â Any additional actions which participants would be required to undertake would have to be designed taking intoÂ account both their environmental impact the costs incurred or income foregone as a result of carrying out those actions.</p>  <p>  In relation to any possible reopening of the scheme, this is currently being considered in the context of an assessment of budgetary priorities, the operation of the RDP and the potential impact upon the scheme itself and other schemes. Even if it were possible to reallocate resources from within the RDP, any increase in the level of payment to scheme participants would require the Department to submit an amendment of the RDP to the Commission, and an evaluation and approval by the relevant Directorates General. </p>  <p>  The Department will continue to keep expenditure under the RDP under review on an ongoing basis. As with all such programmes, there are inevitably issues of timing around the scheduling of payments. Savings in one year do not necessarily imply savings over the lifetime of the programme. </p>  <p>  The suckler sector is a vital component of Ireland&rsquo;s rural economy and theÂ provision of support for the suckler sector is critically important.Â The range of supports as currentlyÂ configured represents a balance between direct income support for the sector and rural development measures designed to improve its competitiveness and sustainability. I believe that it is entirely appropriate to maintain this balance of developmental and income supportsÂ into the future.</p></reply>

In cases where a Member StateÂ does not introduce this new system for payment, the old scheme remains in place but payments must phase out on a digressive basis. </p><p>Under the new system of designation which as I have said must be introduced in 2018, eligible areas will have to be designated on the basis of biophysical criteria.Â  The criteria set out in the legislation are: </p><p>- Low temperatureÂ  </p><p>- Dryness</p><p>- Excess soil moisture</p><p>- Limited soil drainage</p><p>- Unfavourable texture and stoniness</p><p>- Shallow rooting depth</p><p>- Poor chemical properties</p><p>- Steep slope.</p><p>My Department has commenced work on this project, and relevant technical experts are currently working on sourcing and analysing the data in relation to the new criteria.

On foot of this recommendation and in conjunction with the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, my Department is currently co-funding a limited density reduction programme in this area. The project is being organised by a Steering Group comprised of representatives of local farmers, the Irish Deer Management Forum (IDMF), the Wicklow Deer Management Partnership (WDMP), Coillte and both Government Departments.</p><p>Whilst there is as yet no conclusive evidence that the strain of TB in cattle and deer in Co. Wicklow are one and the same, my officials are of the view that this is highly likely. To investigate this view, the results of an analysis (known as &ldquo;strain typing&rdquo;) of samples known taken from deer infected with TB and culled in the Calary area of Co. Wicklow in 2015 are currently awaited.Â  Previous studies have shown that some strains of TB are common to both species and indeed badgers in the area. While it is the case that deer do not normally spread TB to cattle, my Department accepts that the relativelyÂ  highÂ  density of deer and the high incidence of TB in the deer in the area poses a risk to cattle, as well as, indeed to pasture and forestry.</p><p>I do not accept that, as alleged, there was bias in the Calary project. It is the case that theÂ testing methodology used in Co Wicklow for testing TB levels in wild deer was more detailed than that used for cattle generally but a similar methodology was used in the past in the case of badgers with a view to establishing the true incidence of the disease in the species.</p><p>I should point out, however, that<b>c</b>attle that react to the bovine TB test on farms are examined in abattoirs as part of the normal post mortem examination procedures carried out on all cattle that are processed in meat factories.Â  I would add that my Department is undertaking a wider study to commence in 2017 of Co. Wicklow as a whole to determine the strains of TB in deerÂ with a view to identifying the direction of transmission between cattle, deer and other wildlife species.</p><p>Finally, I should explain that any decision on culling deer in the Wicklow area will have regard to the need to conserve deer in the area as well as the need to minimise the damage done by wild deer to farming in the area.</p></reply>

The Bill is available on the Oireachtas website.</p>  <p>  The Supreme Court judgment found that fishing by Northern Ireland vessels within the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State under the Voisinage arrangements is not currently provided for in domestic law. The voisinage arrangements are long-standing reciprocal arrangements which allow fishing boats from Northern Ireland access to fish within the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State and vice versa.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Supreme Court upheld the High Court finding that the voisinage arrangements are not invalid but that, as it stands, there is insufficient provision in domestic law for them. The Supreme Court in fact noted that the arrangements were a sensible recognition at official level of practice and tradition, where fishing boats traditionally fished neighbouring waters.Â </p>  <p>  Voisinage arrangements were in place prior to the London Fisheries Convention 1964 and were continued under the terms of the Convention.Â  The arrangements are compliant with the Common Fisheries Policy, as Article 5 of EU Regulation 1380/2013 recognises and permits neighbourhood arrangements (such as the voisinage arrangements) which existed beforeÂ the Common Fisheries Policy came into force.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill is not to change long-standing fishing access arrangements but to take account of the Court&rsquo;s judgment and provide for arrangements that existed prior to 27 October to be reinstated within a legislative framework. Access continues to be accommodated for Irish sea-fishing boats to fish within the Northern Ireland 0 to 6 nautical mile zone. The Bill will fulfill Ireland&rsquo;s obligations and give the voisinage arrangements a proper legal footing.</p></reply>

These schemes were designed to provide financial support to young farmers and new entrants to farming during the crucial early years immediately following the setting up of a farming enterprise.</p>  <p>  The National Reserve provides for an allocation of entitlements at the national average level or a top-up on existing entitlements that are below the national average to two mandatory categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo;. The Young Farmers Scheme is a separate scheme that provides for an additional payment to young farmers based on activated entitlements. Successful applicants under both schemes are required to meet agricultural educational qualification standard at FETAC Level 6 or equivalent.</p>  <p>  The Young Farmer&rsquo;s Scheme will operate from 2015 to 2019. EU Regulations set down the definition of a &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; for the purposes of eligibility for the National Reserve and the Young Farmers Scheme as follows:</p>  <p>  - S/he is participating in the Basic Payment Scheme in the year in which s/he submits an application;</p>  <p>  - S/he is no more than 40 years of age at any time during the calendar year in which s/he first submits and applicationÂ under the Basic Payment Scheme;</p>  <p>  - S/he is setting upÂ  an agricultural holding for the first time or has set upÂ such a holding during the fiveÂ years preceding the first submission of the the Basic Payment Scheme application.</p>  <p>  In 2015 the National Reserve fund was based on a 3% cut to the Basic Payment Scheme financial ceiling and provided some &euro;24 million. Some 6,260 applicants were allocated entitlements under the 2015 National Reserve. I recently announced that funding of just over &euro;5 million will be made available to fund a National Reserve in 2017. Full details in relation to the application process for the National Reserve and the Young Farmer&rsquo;s Scheme in 2017 will be available in the coming weeks and will be widely advertised in the farming media and on my Department&rsquo;s website.Â  The closing date for applications under both schemes will be 15th May 2017.</p>  <p>  The Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme of TAMS II provides grant aid for a range of investments aimed at facilitating the entry of farmers and generational renewal. The TAMS Scheme specifically targets support at young farmers by offering them a greater rate of aid intensity at 60% compared to the standard grant aid rate of 40%. In addition, support is being provided for grant aid for dairy buildings specifically for qualifying young farmers.</p>  <p>  There are a number of tax measures specifically aimed at young farmers, specifically &lsquo;100% Stock Relief on Income Tax for Certain Young Trained Farmers&rsquo; and &lsquo;Stamp Duty Exemption on Transfers of Land to Young Trained Farmers&rsquo;.

The current standards are contained in the 2008 Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) Directive (Directive 2008/50/EC) and the Fourth Daughter Directive (Directive 2004/107/EC of 15 December 2004). These Directives also include rules on how Member States should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with co-ordinating and managing the monitoring programme.   Under the Directives, EU Member States must designate "Zones" for the purpose of managing air quality.Â  For Ireland, four zones were defined in the Air Quality Standards Regulations, 2011. The zones in place in Ireland in 2017 are Zone A: the Dublin conurbation, Zone B: the Cork conurbation, Zone C: comprising 23 large towns in Ireland with a population of more than 15,000 and Zone D: the remaining area of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Ireland currently has a nationwide network of 31 monitoring stations which measure levels of air pollutants in the four zones. This information is delivered to the public in near real-time at www.airquality.epa.ie. The numbers and locations of the monitoring equipment for each pollutant are determined by the requirements of the Directives for ambient air monitoring in each zone. Â There is one monitoring station in County Limerick, located on the Shannon Estuary near Askeaton.</p>  <p>  Following a comprehensive review of the current status of ambient air quality monitoring in Ireland, the EPA is developing a new national ambient air quality monitoring programme under Section 65 of the EPA Act.Â My Department willÂ provide the required funding to the Agency for this development which will strengthen the capacity and capability of the monitoring network to provide more comprehensive, localised air quality information linked to public health advice. The development of the expanded national ambient air monitoring network has included a review of the adequacy of the current network for both determining compliance with European and national standards for air quality, and for the provision of information to the public about local air quality. Â I note that the programme proposes an additional monitoring site in Limerick City, and an indicative monitoring site in Abbeyfeale. I welcome the proposed expansion of the network and look forward to working with the EPA to develop its capacity to meet the future air quality needs of Irish citizens.</p></reply>

Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband roll out so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premisesÂ in Ireland canÂ get high speed broadband ofÂ a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouragingÂ investment by the telecoms sector, which isÂ continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:Â </p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services;</p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. It is intended that premises within this area willÂ have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the networkÂ rolled out.Â  </p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis.Â  It also provides an analysis of county coverage Â with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county in Ireland.Â  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area byÂ accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.</p><p>My Department is actively monitoring commercial deployment plans in the BLUE areas to ensure that allÂ households and businesses can get access to the services.Â  My Department is also actively monitoring developments of commercial operators that might impact the Intervention Area.Â  This is being done in accordance with procedures set out by my Department in December 2015. </p><p>I should add, however, that the provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, isÂ a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).Â  I do not have a statutory authority to requireÂ commercial companies to roll out services to particular locations.</p><p>A formal procurement process is now in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. The Department will also shortly update the High Speed Broadband map and finalise this Intervention Area for bidders, taking into account any industry investments that have not materialised and potential other new investments. </p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.Â This provides for a future proofed solution for theÂ  25 years of the contract and beyond.Â  A fibre-to-the-homeÂ solutionÂ means that householders and businesses mayÂ get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.Â Â </p><p>The timeframe forÂ the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timelineÂ to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll out plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll out of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July,Â IÂ established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleagueÂ Minister HumphreysÂ to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage. The Taskforce report is available at the following link:.</p><p>I have signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band,Â to provide an 86% increase in totalÂ spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, toÂ provideÂ enhanced mobile services. Â </p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks. </p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p></reply>

It is estimated that in excess of 600,000 business users and individuals are benefitting from the MANs, including industrial estates, multinationals, SMEs, State entities, educational institutions, together with fixed and mobile customers outside Dublin.Â Â It is not possible to provide information relating to the percentage of commercial customers, since data relating to end customers is a matter for each individual service provider.</p>  <p>  With reference to the Action Plan for Rural Development, the MSE continues to actively encourage licensed operators to utilise the MANs infrastructure. My Department is currently making arrangements to carry out an independentÂ evaluation of the operations of the MANs, including pricing of the MANs products and services to ensure that they are within market norms. Recommendations are also being sought as to proposals to boost further uptake of the MANs.</p></reply>

Emissions Trading is a &quot;cap and trade&quot; scheme, whereby an EU wide cap or limit is set for participating installations.  This cap is reduced over time so that total emissions are reduced.  Within this cap, &quot;allowances&quot; for emissions are auctioned or allocated for free.  Individual installations must report on their emissions on an annual basis and surrender sufficient allowances to cover their emissions, purchasing additional allowances if necessary.  The ETS includes 11,000 installations (98 in Ireland) and accounts for roughly 45% of EU emissions (25% of Irish emissions).  The ETS was launched in 2005 and is currently in its third phase, covering the period 2013 to 2020. </p><p>  Negotiations are currently under way regarding the design of the ETS for the post-2020 (Phase IV) period.  On the basis of European Commission proposals, Member States in the Council, including Ireland, have been engaged in negotiations to ensure that the reformed ETS is able to meet its GHG reduction objectives in a cost-effective manner.</p><p>  At a meeting of the Environment Council on 28 February, which I attended, agreement was reached on a general approach on the revised ETS proposal, a position Ireland was able to support.  This will now enable the Council to begin negotiations with the European Parliament on the proposal.  It is currently anticipated that this process will reach a conclusion later this year.</p></reply>

The Agreement is designed to meet this objective through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by all parties to the agreement.  In this regard, the European Union submitted an NDC committing to a reduction of at least 40% in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, which will be met through reductions of 43% in the Emission Trading System (ETS) and 30% in the non-ETS sector compared with 2005 levels.  A proposal on the non-ETS targets for individual Member States, the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), was published by the European Commission in July 2016.  Targets have been proposed for Member States based on GDP per capita and the cost-effectiveness of domestic emissions reductions within individual Member States. </p>  <p>  In the case of Ireland a target of 39% has been proposed, which has been adjusted downwards to 30% to reflect cost-effectiveness of measures within the Irish economy.  The European Commission proposals are the subject of ongoing negotiations in the Council of Ministers and in the European Parliament.  The outcome of these negotiations will determine Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the overall EU 2030 effort.  It is, nevertheless, already clear that meeting the proposed targets for Ireland will present an enormous challenge, requiring very substantial public and private investment in addition to a board suite of non-financial policy interventions.</p>  <p>  I will shortly be publishing a draft of Ireland&rsquo;s first National Mitigation Plan for public consultation which will set out a series of options for additional measures towards meeting the proposed targets for Ireland for 2030 as well as to put Ireland on a pathway towards transitioning to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State Intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5 bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,</p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p><p>The maps shows that 100% of the townland of Srah, including Shraigh, and 64% of the townland of Bunnahowen falls within the AMBER area andÂ will therefore be included in the State intervention procurement process.  The remaining 36% of the townland of Bunnahowen is included in the BLUE area where commercial providers are either currently delivering or previously indicated that they have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.  Individuals can also check whether their area is in a BLUE or AMBER area by accessing the county and townlandÂ information at .</p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  My Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.</p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.</p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.</p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.</p><p>In this regard, I and Minister HumphreysÂ established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce in July 2016.  The findings of this Taskforce recommends practical actions that can be takenÂ to remove barriers to and improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland.  The Taskforce report is available at the following link:.</p><p>Minister Humphreys has establishedÂ two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to unlockÂ barriersÂ to investment in mobile and broadband services.  Since July, there has been significantÂ progress made in discussions withÂ the key stakeholders including local authority management representation, Government Departments and State agencies, as well as interaction with ComReg and telecoms operators.</p><p>I haveÂ signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed withÂ the allocation ofÂ spectrum in the 3.6GHz band, in early 2017.  This will provide an 86% increase in totalÂ spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I haveÂ also secured &euro;8 million for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, toÂ provideÂ enhanced mobile services.</p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country including County Mayo.</p></reply>

During 2016, my Department undertook a detailed economic assessment on the design and cost of the RHI for heat users the industrial and commercial sector.  This assessment included a range of renewable energy technologies and focused on the approximately 3,000 large commercial and industrial heat users in the non-Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In order to support on-going investment in the renewable heating sector, my Department is seeking clearance from the European Commission that RHI support can apply to RHI applicants who meet the criteria of the scheme and were completed and first commissioned between the Government announcement on the RHI in July 2014 and the start date of the RHI. </p>  <p>  If permission is granted for this grandfathering decision by the European Commission the successful applicants will be eligible to apply for support but will have to meet all the terms and condition of the new scheme.

The decision concluded a lengthy planning process whichÂ included an Oral Hearing completed overÂ eleven weeks from March to May last year.  The planning process in Northern Ireland is ongoing, with the planning inquiry concluding on 27 February 2017.  The North-South Interconnector is importantÂ to the efficient operation of the Single Electricity Market and the increased security of electricity supply across the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  I am well aware of views that have been raised by communities across Cavan, Meath and Monaghan that the transmission lines should be laid underground, rather than built overhead.  However, all evidence available to me indicates that developing the project undergroundÂ would cost substantially more and deliver less.  In particular I would highlight the Independent Expert Commission report of 2012 that estimated the cost of building the project underground would be three times the cost of the overhead solution. </p>  <p>  In light of the motions passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I have requested officials in my Department to prepare a proposal for an updatedÂ independent report that would consider any changes in cost and technology in the five years since the 2012 report by the Independent Expert Commission.  I intend that such a report would be completedÂ this yearÂ in advance of the scheduled commencement of construction of the North-South Interconnector in 2018.</p>  <p>  I would like to reemphasiseÂ the Government'sÂ continued strong support for this project.</p></reply>

A sum of &euro;35m in seed capital was provided by the Government with a view to the establishment of a leveraged fund of &euro;70m.  That target has been exceeded with commitments by private sector institutional investors bringing the fund to its present total of &euro;78.8m.  The Government remains a minority shareholder.</p>  <p>  As a commercial, regulated, entity the fund is subject to full regulatory scrutiny by the Central Bank.  The fund is authorised and regulated by the Central Bank as a qualifying investor fund (&ldquo;QIF&rdquo;) in accordance with the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (Directive 2011/61/EU) (&ldquo;AIFMD&rdquo;).

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State Intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband roll-out so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:Â </p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,</p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p><p>The maps shows that 9% of the townland of Doohamlat, Co MonaghanÂ falls within the AMBER area andÂ will therefore be included in the State intervention procurement process.  The remaining 91% ofÂ  Doohamlat is included in the BLUE area where commercial providers are either currently delivering or previously indicated that they have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.  Individuals can also check whether their area is in a BLUE or AMBER area by accessing the county and townlandÂ information at .</p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  My Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.</p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1,000 Megabits per second.</p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline from contract award to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.</p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded.</p><p>In this regard, I and Minister HumphreysÂ established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce in July 2016.  The findings of this Taskforce recommends practical actions that can be takenÂ to remove barriers to and improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland.  The Taskforce report is available at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>Minister Humphreys has establishedÂ two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to unlockÂ barriersÂ to investment in mobile and broadband services.  Since July, there has been significantÂ progress made in discussions withÂ the key stakeholders including local authority management representation, Government Departments and State agencies, as well as interaction with ComReg and telecoms operators.</p><p>I haveÂ signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed withÂ the allocation ofÂ spectrum in the 3.6GHz band, in early 2017.  This will provide an 86% increase in totalÂ spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I haveÂ also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, toÂ provideÂ enhanced mobile services.</p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country including County Monaghan.</p></reply>

My DepartmentÂ recently developed a draft national policy framework for alternative fuels infrastructure - in line with the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive (2014/94/EU) - and carried out a public consultation from 27 October to 23 November 2016 on this draft framework toÂ support the deployment of alternative fuels in Ireland.  Following consideration of submissions received from the consultation process, I expect to finalise and publish the National Policy Framework in the coming weeks.  As the draft Framework indicates, there is no hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in operation in Ireland with few commercial organisations capable of constructing or bearing the cost of a stand-alone hydrogen project.  Coupled with the lack of right-hand drive hydrogen vehicles currently available for use on the Irish market, the rate of infrastructure development is expected to remain low.  There are no immediate plans to establish a hydrogen refuelling network.  Hydrogen is not expected to deliver mass-market uptake before 2030 as the costs of the refuelling infrastructure and associated vehicles are likely to remain prohibitive until the middle of the next decade.  Consequently, the cost of the infrastructure is greatly disproportionate to current demand.</p>  <p>  However, the feasibility of establishing a hydrogen refuelling network will be regularly assessed to take account of changes in technological development and market uptake.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that work is very advanced on the development of theÂ National Climate Change Mitigation Plan which is being prepared by theÂ Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (DCCAE), working in close co-operation withÂ other Departments including my ownÂ and the Department of Agriculture.  Transport has an important role to play in helping to achieve our national emission and decarbonisation targets.  The mitigation measures under consideration for transport will be wide-ranging and the movement to alternative fuels will form part of this plan.  The draft Mitigation Plan will be available for extensive public consultation shortly before it is finalised and put toÂ Government for approval.</p></reply>

In that regard the previously announced date for implementation of this limit of 1stÂ March 2017 has now been suspended until 1stÂ October 2017.  Individuals engaged in the supply of mechanically propelled vehicles have a legal responsibility to ensure that vehicles and their components comply with all applicable requirements set out in Road Traffic legislation, which includes the fitment of a weights and dimensions plate specifying the maximum permitted laden weight for the vehicle and individual axles. Therefore the plating of five (or more) axle rigid vehicles must be completed in accordance with the aforementioned limits whilst also taking into consideration the design specifications for the vehicle in question.</p>  <p>  It is an offence to carry a load on a vehicle which would cause the manufacturer's design weights or the limits specified in our national legislation (i.e. the plated weights) to be exceeded.

In JulyÂ 2009Â a request for tenders was issued for the provision of Search and Rescue Helicopter services for the Irish Coast Guard. OnÂ  22nd July 2010 an agreement was signed between the Minister for Transport and CHC Ireland Ltd for theÂ supply of helicopters and fullyÂ qualified Â crews and personnel.Â Â CHCI provideÂ five helicoptersÂ at four basesÂ Â located in Dublin, Waterford, Shannon and Sligo. These Helicopters respond toÂ emergenciesÂ at sea, inland waterways, offshore islands and mountains.</p>  <p>  The helicopter service contract commenced on 1st July 2012 for a period of 10 years. The annual total cost for these services is in the region of &euro;65m meaning a total for the duration of the contract of approx. &euro;650m. An exact figure is not available as there are yearly varying factors including the number of flying hours and the cost of fuel.</p>  <p>  The Irish Coast Guard has also contracted external aviation expertise to advise on certain aspects of the managementÂ of the helicopter contract. Following a Request for Tender process in October 2011, an agreement was signed withÂ aviation consultancy firm Consultavia. The average cost of this contract has been approx &euro;33k per year over the past five years. This contract expiredÂ inÂ December 2016 and a new Request for Tender process is currently underway with a deadline for applications of 24 March 2017.</p></reply>

The overall annual funding for the Regional Airports Programme in recent years has been in the region &euro;12-&euro;13 million. Of this, the current PSO contract governing air services between Dublin and the airports in Donegal and Kerry requires approximately &euro;7.6 million.</p><p>Support for safety and security related capital and operating costs at the four regional airports is also funded from the Programme. The airports are invited to submit their applications for capital support at the beginning of each year and these are assessed, against the criteria set out in the Programme by an Assessment Panel comprising officials of my Department and the Irish Aviation Authority. While the Department would have a reasonably good, high level, understanding of the overall scope of the airports' requirements, the actual amount of capital support required in any year only crystallises once we receive these applications from each of the airports. In the past couple of years, there has been more than sufficient provision in the capital allocation of the Regional Airports Programme to meet the airports' requirements in that area. Any unused amounts were used to supplement the non-capital provision to the airports for operational supports for safety and security activities.</p><p>My Department is, however, taking the opportunity to reflect on likely future capital requirements in the areas of safety and security at the regional airports in the context of the mid-term review of the Capital Plan which was commenced recently by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

The aim of REACH is to protect both human health and the environment.</p>  <p>  The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) ensures the consistent implementation of the &ldquo;REACH&rdquo; and &ldquo;CLP&rdquo; Regulations (together with EU Regulations governing biocides and the export/import of hazardous chemicals) across the European Union and the countries in the European Economic Area. </p>  <p>  There are a number of Government Departments and Agencies involved in the regulation of chemicals in Ireland.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has the lead responsibility for chemicals policy and for developing the enforcement regime associated with REACH.  An agency of my Department, the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), is the principal competent authority under the Chemicals Acts 2008 and 2010.  In addition, other bodies have also been designated as competent authorities with responsibility under these Acts for particular aspects of REACH, including the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). </p>  <p>  The UK Government has not yet indicated how it envisages the future of chemicals regulation in the UK after the Referendum result.  In the United Kingdom, the Minister responsible for chemicals policy is the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.  I am not aware that the topic of the future status of the UK as a member of the European Chemicals Agency has arisen at any of the series of regular contacts that have taken place between the UK Minister and her Irish and other EU counterparts.</p>  <p>  My Department is monitoring developments closely in conjunction with the other relevant Government Departments and Agencies, including the HSA, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; and the EPA.  My Department is also following work being undertaken by the UK House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee which is conducting an inquiry into the future of environmental law and policy following the result of the EU Referendum.  That parliamentary inquiry will focus on the future of REACH and will consider, for instance, whether administrative and enforcement responsibilities, which are currently discharged by the European Commission or ECHA, will need to be transferred to national authorities in the UK. </p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union will impact significantly on policy fields across all Government Departments.  However as negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s exit have not yet commenced it is not possible to pre-empt the outcome at this stage.  That said, the Government&rsquo;s preparation remains extensive and ongoing across all key issues and sectors.  Both risks and opportunities arising from Brexit are being analysed and considered.</p></reply>

These indicate an average cost of &euro;10,553 per position. </p>  <p>  I understand, from the IDA, that the Succeed-in-Ireland initiative has created 527 jobs on the ground.  IDA Ireland has paid &euro;2,069,000 to Connect Ireland as a financial reward for those 527 positions.

It is self-evident that men and women on the National Minimum Wage receive the same remuneration per hour - &euro;9.25 per hour.  However, 64.7% of employees on the National Minimum Wage are women.  Reasons suggested by the report for this are: women tend to work part-time more often than men because of caring responsibilities, the cost of childcare and women are over-represented in the Accommodation and FoodÂ sector, which carries the greatest risk factor of being on the National Minimum Wage.

No. 27 of 1995).  Gift vouchers that are not financial services products are covered also by the provisions of the European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 484 of 2013).  Gift cards that come within the definition of &ldquo;electronic money&rdquo; in the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011 are subject to the provisions of these Regulations unless the card can be used only to acquire goods or services in the premises of the card issuer or within a limited network of service providers or for a limited range of goods and services.  The issuer of a gift card which comes within the definition of electronic money must, at the request of the electronic money holder, redeem the monetary value of the electronic money at par value at any time.  Redemption may be subject to a fee in specified circumstances and any such fee must be proportionate and commensurate with the costs actually incurred by the issuer of the electronic money. </p>  <p>  My Department published the draft Scheme of a comprehensive Consumer Rights Bill for public consultation on 25 May 2015.  In addition to Parts dealing with the consolidation and updating of the law on the supply of goods, digital content and services and on unfair contract terms, the draft Scheme contains a number of provisions for the regulation of gift vouchers, including a proposed ban on expiry dates in contracts for the supply of gift vouchers.  The responses to the gift card provisions raised a substantial number of issues, including concerns expressed by businesses about the impact of a complete prohibition on expiry dates and the need forÂ  clarity and certainty in respect of the regulation of gift cards that come within the scope of the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011.  While the present proposal is for a ban on expiry dates for gift cards that do not come within the scope of the Electronic Money Regulations, I am willing to listen to other views and possible approaches, such as a requirement that gift cards remain valid for a set period such as five years.</p>  <p>  While I am anxious to progress the Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill, I have to take account of current European Union legislative proposals for Directives on consumer contracts for the supply of digital content and consumer contracts for the online and other distance sale of goods.  These proposals which were announced in May 2015 and published in December 2015 overlap very substantially with two of the main parts of the draft Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill.  Discussions on the digital content proposal at working party level have proceeded rapidly with a first reading of the proposal completed by April 2016 and agreement reached at the June Justice and Home Affairs Council on the basic principles of the proposal and on political guidelines for future work on it.  Discussions in the second half of 2016 under the Slovak Presidency made further progress and provided the basis for a policy debate on a number of aspects of the proposal at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 8-9 December.  The currentÂ Maltese Presidency has indicated that it aims to achieve agreement on a general approach to the digital content proposal in the first half of 2017.  In this situation, I have to consider the advisability of bringing forward a legislative proposal to the Oireachtas when a directly related and fully harmonised legislative proposal may be at an advanced stage of the European Union legislative process.  The wisdom of introducing legislation in the Oireachtas in 2017 if large parts of that legislation would have to be repealed or substantially amended within a relatively short space of time is obviously open to question.  I will continue to review the progress of the two European Union proposalsÂ  with a view to deciding the best course of action to take with regard to the Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill.</p></reply>

Cyber bullying was one such concern, but discussions also took place around issues such as excessive time spent online, sexting, &ldquo;sextortion&rdquo; and blackmail, access to inappropriate content and cyber identity.  These are all complex issues, exacerbated by the rate at which technological developments continue to happen.</p><p>A number of very valid concerns were also raised around grooming and the dangers inherent in engaging with strangers online.  Combatting online child grooming is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, and is addressed as part of a wide-ranging package of measures aimed at the reform of Ireland&rsquo;s criminal law on sexual offences, set out in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>Education emerged in the discussions as a fundamental issue for parents and young people, with parental guidance, supervision, and the setting of boundaries considered critical to ensuring children&rsquo;s safety online.  The <i>saferinternetireland.ie </i>website has a range of resources aimed at parents and their children, including a recent &lsquo;Family e-Safety Kit&rsquo; activity pack aimed at six to twelve-year-olds.  The ISPCC itself has developed guidelines and supports for parents.</p><p>The Office for Internet Safety, an executive office of the Department of Justice and Equality, was established by the Government to take a lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children.  That Office has previously published guidance related to cyber bullying and filtering technologies for parents.  As part of its work it holds an annual Safer Internet Day, whose theme this year was &lsquo;Be the change: Unite for a better internet&rsquo;.  It also supports the <i>&lsquo;Hotline.ie</i>&rsquo; service.  In addition to<i>Hotline.ie</i>, there are a number of other websites, such as Childline and webwise, that have the capacity to facilitate anyone to report suspicious behaviour encountered online. </p><p>My Department supports the National Youth Health Programme which is in partnership with the HSE and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  The programme's aims are to provide a broad based, flexible health promotion / education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings.  The &lsquo;Web Safety in Youth Work&rsquo; resource, available on the National Youth Council&rsquo;s website, provides valuable advice to young people on reporting online behaviour and on passing on concerns about the protection and welfare of a child or young person.</p><p>In seeking to address the problem of bullying we must tackle the root causes of bullying.  This includes a focus on tackling prejudice, including homophobia, where it exists in our schools and wider society.  The implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying, which is being led by the Department of Education and Skills, provides the framework for the Government&rsquo;s absolute commitment to working with a broad base of interests to protect children from bullying and the often devastating consequences that it can have.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-07a.2257.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017030700111#WRDDD02700"><p>I wish to inform the Deputy that consideration has been given to how the new Affordable Childcare Scheme will benefit the children of parents that are unemployed.</p>  <p>  The benefits of moving to an income-basis for eligibility under the new scheme include: </p>  <p>  - Clarity, with a move away from a complex array of eligibility criteria to a single, clear basis. </p>  <p>  - Reduction of welfare traps and increased support for progression into employment and retention in employment. </p>  <p>  - Equity, in ensuring that low-income working families are not excluded from benefitting from subsidised childcare.</p>  <p>  The base income threshold guarantees that the maximum rate of subsidy is available to all families below the relative income poverty line, while ensuring that the taper rate between the base and maximum thresholds does not generate strong disincentive effects with regard to taking up or increasing employment.  It also ensures that the majority of current scheme beneficiaries will receive the maximum subsidy rate under the new scheme. </p>  <p>  While the new scheme will target subsidies predominately based on income, it was considered whether other criteria such as a work/training requirement should also apply, i.e. whether the family needs childcare because both parents, or, one parent in the case of a one-parent family, are working or in training.</p>  <p>  Incorporating a work/training test into the eligibility criteria ties the scheme more clearly to its labour market participation objective.  The labour market objective also has implications in terms of hours of availability, given parents&rsquo; need for childcare availability to match hours of work. </p>  <p>  Given that both a child development objective and a labour market objective are relevant to this scheme, it was determined that there should be a balanced approach to eligibility: while people would qualify for a subsidy based purely on income, parents&rsquo; participation in work/training would determine whether that eligibility is for a subsidy towards enhanced hours of childcare (up to 40 hours per week) or towards standard hours childcare (up to 15 hours per week) </p>  <p>  When parents are not in work or training, childcare will be subsidised on a standard hours basis (except in cases where sponsors support a childcare subsidy for families with high levels of need).  This approach will mean that this scheme is open &ndash; albeit for standard hours rather than enhanced hours &ndash; to parents who stay at home to care for their children, and are not taking part in work or training, but who choose to avail of up to 15 hours of childcare per week.  In the case of school going children it is considered that the child development objectives are met through school going hours and, as such, the 15 standard hours childcare applies to non-term time. </p>  <p>  Under the existing CCS programme, to be replaced by this new scheme, beneficiaries qualify for full-time childcare subsidies even if they are not in work or training.  As such, existing affected beneficiaries will enjoy a &ldquo;saver&rdquo; status, whereby they will retain their existing benefits for one year following the introduction of the new scheme.  However, thereafter they, and any similar new entrants to the scheme, who are not in employment, will qualify for the standard hours only.</p></reply>

They are of a similar nature and so, for the Deputy&rsquo;s ease of reference, will be answered together in tabular form.  An increase in staff wages to the &ldquo;Living Wage&rdquo; of &euro;11.50 per hour, with managers&rsquo; wages rising proportionately to &euro;14.78, would increase the average unit cost of provision for childcare providers.  What impact this would have on the cost of the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) would depend on whether and to what extent the ACS subsidy rates were amended to reflect the change in the cost of provision.  There is no automatic link between the cost of provision and the overall cost of the ACS.  Any change in the ACS subsidy rates would need to be carefully considered in the light of fee levels and the potential impact on the demand for childcare.  However, if it is assumed that the ACS subsidy rates were changed on a proportionate basis in response to a change in the average unit cost of provision, and if there were no change in fee levels and no other change in the ACS, then, on the assumption that the full-year cost of the ACS will be approximately &euro;150 million per year, the table below sets out estimates of how the full-year cost of the ACS would change as a result of the change in ACS subsidy rates.<table><tr><th>-</th><th>Staff wage(per hour)</th><th>Manager&rsquo;s wage (per hour), if it increased proportionately</th><th>Increase in full year cost of the Affordable Childcare Scheme (assuming subsidy rates are increased in proportion to changes in unit costs)</th></tr><tr><td>Current wages</td><td>&euro; 10.79</td><td>&euro; 13.87</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>12030/17</td><td>&euro; 11.00</td><td>&euro; 14.14</td><td>&euro; 3m</td></tr><tr><td>12031/17</td><td>&euro; 11.50</td><td>&euro; 14.78</td><td>&euro; 9m</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In reference to enquiries conducted in Australia, I am informed by the military authorities that there are a number of published reports and ongoing studies in relation to Australian personnel who were exposed to chemicals while conducting a particular maintenance task on a specific aircraft programme.  As such, the military authorities have advised that it would be difficult to draw a direct comparison between the Irish Air Corps and that of the Australian Air Force.</p>  <p>  There are a number of processes already in train relating to reviewing health and safety procedures in the Air Corps.  As you know, following a number of inspections at the Air Corps premises at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, in 2016, the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) issued a report of inspection with a number of general improvements and recommendations for follow up.  The Air Corps committed to addressing these recommendations as part of an eight phase implementation plan.  I am advised that seven out of the eight phases areÂ plannedÂ to beÂ completedÂ by May 2017.  You will also be aware that in September 2016 I appointed an independent third party to review allegations made in a number of protected disclosures relating to health and safety issues in the Air Corps which were received in late 2015 and early 2016.  I await that reviewer&rsquo;s report.  I can assure the Deputy that I will ensure that all recommendations, whether arising from the work of the Health and Safety Authority or the ongoing protected disclosure review, will be acted upon to ensure the safety of the men and women of the Air Corps.  In the circumstances and pending the completion of the ongoing processes, I have no plans to commission another review on this matter.</p></reply>

The MCC takes account of the particular injury or disability and, depending on the circumstances, may be associated with operational restrictions.  Such restrictions arise due to the individual's condition not allowing him or her to safely participate in the full range of duties, or because participation in the full range of military duties could aggravate his/her condition.  Alternatively, the ultimate declaration is that the individual is below Defence Forces medical standards.</p>  <p>  There is a mechanism that personnel in this category can, at the discretion of the Minister on the recommendation of the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support) remain on in service.
