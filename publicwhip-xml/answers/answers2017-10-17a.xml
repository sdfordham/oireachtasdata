    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-17a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101700058#WRB00400"><p>The cost of childcare continues to be a major issue facing parents in Ireland.  We remain the most expensive in the OECD.  To alleviate some of this financial burden, I introduced a range of supports in September to make childcare more affordable for families, including a new universal subsidy for all children aged between 6 months and 3 years of age, or until they are eligible for ECCE.  This amounts to as much as &euro;80 a month or &euro;1,040 per year for children in full time childcare.  In addition, subsidies provided under existing childcare schemes, specifically the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Schemes have been increased significantly, in some cases by as much as 50%.  Eligible parents can access as much as &euro;7,500 per child per year under the CCS.  The full second year of ECCE will also assist parents somewhat from September 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition to measures aimed at affordability I am also seeking to address issues relating to quality service provision.  I increased ECCE capitation by 7%, the first increase since ECCE was introduced in 2010.  I also secured a total of &euro;18 million for 'programme support payments' for service providers to assist them with the administrative burden of delivering the various childcare schemes. </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware that pay and conditions for the Early Years workforce are highly inadequate.  In this regard I am conscious of the fact that while my Department is not the employer of Childcare professionals, it is a major funder and I will be supportive of efforts made by the sector to move this issue forward possibly by a Sectoral Employment Order with the Labour Court.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that the 'Independent Review of the Cost of Delivering Quality Childcare' has been commissioned by my Department, Crowe Howarth will soon begin to examine the costs faced by childcare providers in delivering quality childcare.  This will include a survey of childcare providers.  Following completion, the review is intended to be used to strengthen the evidence base underpinning future policy development and investment in early years.  It will feed into future policy development that will address both the cost of childcare for parents and the quality of service delivery which is greatly affected by the terms and conditions of the workforce.</p></reply>

Following Tusla's initial review of each referral, just over 19,000 were deemed to be a concern about abuse.  These referrals relate to physical, emotional, sexual abuse and neglect, and multiple referrals can relate to the same child.  </p><p>Last year, thirty-six per cent of referrals were for emotional abuse, sixteen per cent for sexual abuse, twenty-three per cent for physical abuse and twenty-five per cent related to neglect.  The Table of referrals for 2011-2016 is  included for circulation in the text of my answer.  This shows an increase in total referrals from 2011 to  2016 of 50% </p><p>Once Tusla confirms a referral relates to a concern about abuse, the first consideration is always the immediate safety of the child, and emergency action is taken if it is necessary to protect the child.  </p><p>Where abuse is suspected, all matters are referred to the Garda&iacute; in line with Children First: National Guidance.  If children are believed to have been abused and to be at ongoing risk of significant harm, a Child Protection Conference can take place.  The aim of this is to develop a plan with the child, their parents, and the professional network that helps keep the child safe from future harm.  </p><p>If the Conference finds that the child is at ongoing risk of significant harm, they are placed on the Child Protection Notification System.  This is an active national record of every child about whom there are ongoing child protection concerns.</p><p>The additional &euro;40m funding I have secured for Tusla in the 2018 Budget will support the continued implementation of  child protection services.  Tusla aims to provide a proportionate and timely response to children at risk or in need.  Where appropriate, responsibility and control will be shared with families and communities by developing joint solutions and through interagency collaboration.</p><p>Child Protection referrals made to Tusla by category 2011 - 2016<table><tr><th></th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th></tr><tr><td>All Referrals</td><td>31,626</td><td>40,187</td><td>41,599</td><td>43,630</td><td>43,596</td><td>47,399</td></tr><tr><td>Child Protection Referrals</td><td>15,818</td><td>19,044</td><td>19,407</td><td>18,676</td><td>18,235</td><td>19,087</td></tr><tr><td>By Category:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Physical Abuse</td><td>3,033</td><td></td><td>4,330</td><td>4,066</td><td>3,991</td><td>4,450</td></tr><tr><td>Emotional Abuse</td><td>4,001</td><td></td><td>5,271</td><td>6,233</td><td>6,535</td><td>6,870</td></tr><tr><td>Sexual Abuse</td><td>3,326</td><td></td><td>3,385</td><td>3,114</td><td>2,940</td><td>3,042</td></tr><tr><td>Neglect</td><td>5,458</td><td></td><td>6,421</td><td>5,263</td><td>4,769</td><td>4,724</td></tr></table></p><p>Please note that the breakdown by category is not available for 2012.</p></reply>

Approximately 60% of all referrals to Tusla require this type of support. </p>  <p>  Tusla has made real progress in dealing with cases where children, identified as needing a social worker are waiting for a specific social worker to be allocated to them.  This will remain a top priority for the Child and Family Agency.  My Department and I will continue to support them in their efforts.  I am very pleased to have been able to secure an additional &euro;40m for Tusla in Budget 2018.  The use of this extra funding will include the recruitment of 300 additional staff. </p>  <p>  I have been reassured to know that all urgent cases are dealt with immediately, and that Tusla ensures that the children in most need of a social work service receive one.  The duty team social work system actively reviews the risk to these children, and new information informs the waiting time for allocation. </p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s Child Protection Notification System holds the names of children deemed to be at current risk.  All these cases have a dedicated social worker, a Child Protection Plan and regular multi-disciplinary Child Protection Case Conferences.  If sufficient progress is not being made, a child may be received into care, on a voluntary basis or by applying to the courts for a care order.  An Garda Siochana, out of hours GPs, Maternity Hospitals and Accident and Emergency Departments have 24 hour access to this list.  This information helps them determine if a child that comes to their attention is already considered at risk. </p>  <p>  I am most conscious of the need to enhance early intervention services and I glad to say that this budget has also provided for the establishment of an additional 11 Family Resource Centres.</p></reply>

A small number of areas have problems in recruiting enough local foster carers.  Other areas have good availability, but not all foster carers will have the skills needed for children with more complex needs. </p>  <p>  Foster carers are acknowledged as the backbone of our child care services, looking after 92% of children in care.  This compares with 74% in the UK.  We have an extensive foster care service which provides care to a range of children, including children with emotional and behavioural issues and with disabilities.  Foster care is also the placement of choice for older children and those in need of emergency placements, sibling groups and separated children seeking asylum. </p>  <p>  Ensuring that we can recruit  sufficient  numbers of foster carers and the ethnic diversity needed to provide this variety of placements is challenging, but required for good matching between child and foster carer.    </p>  <p>  I please to say that I have secured an additional &euro;40m for Tusla in the Budget for 2018, which will be used to target areas of identified need.  Specific to the foster care service is the recruitment of social workers to recruit and support foster carers.  Tusla are also receiving additional funding to establish a dedicated telephone service to provide out of hours social work support to foster carers for the first time.  </p>  <p>  International research tells us that the recruitment of foster carers requires a number of focussed strategies.  Tusla employs a variety of methods in ongoing campaigns to attract potential foster carers.  Examples include online and newspaper campaigns, information evenings, and, most successfully, focussed local recruitment drives involving local foster carers.</p>  <p>  The outcomes for children in foster care in Ireland are much praised by professional colleagues abroad, especially in terms of school completion, stability, family centred care and progress in third level education. </p>  <p>  I am proud of this record and I want this good work to continue.  </p>  <p>  I appeal to anyone with an interest in fostering a child to visit the Tusla website for answers to a range of questions a potential carer might have, including how to apply to become a foster carer.</p></reply>

While statutory responsibility for the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, and responsibility for the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding rests with the Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government, my Department has undertaken a number of actions as part of <i>Rebuilding Ireland: the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>.</p><p>These include the introduction of free childcare for the children of families experiencing homelessness.  This has been done under the existing Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Programme, which provides a subvention of &euro;160 per week for part-time childcare (three-and-a-half hours to five hours per day) over five days per week for all pre-school children aged 0 to 5 years inclusive.  From 26 June last the scheme has been expanded to include a second option covering child care for a shorter period of two-and-a-quarter hours to three-and-a-half hours each day over five days per week.  As part of the scheme a daily meal is provided for each child, the cost of which is included in the subvention rate.  Currently 83 children have been approved for this scheme for 2017/2018 and a further 18 applications are awaiting decision.  The scheme is also designed to help those transitioning from homelessness to permanent accommodation.</p><p>It is very likely that other children in emergency accommodation are also registered under other strands of the child care programmes supported by my Department, though it is not possible to identify the exact number in each case.</p><p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, works together with other statutory and voluntary agencies to provide services and supports to children, young people and families experiencing homelessness.  Actions taken by Tusla include the provision of funding for child support workers and the appointment of a Homelessness Liaison Officer.</p><p>Family Resource Centres, part funded by Tusla, are working with people who are experiencing homelessness and many have developed local responses to the needs of families in emergency accommodation.  These include, by way of example, family fun days, homework support, after school programmes, play therapy and transport services. </p><p>In recognition of the difficulties associated with homelessness and school attendance, Tusla&rsquo;s Educational Welfare Service offers a number of supports to children (and families) experiencing homelessness.</p><p>Tusla&rsquo;s joint protocol with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) covers child welfare and protection matters for children in emergency accommodation.  It is fully operational in the DRHE areas and it is intended to replicate this protocol across the State.  A Joint Working Protocol between Tusla and Galway City Council and their contracted services providers was co-signed by Tusla and the City Council in July.  Galway County Council has agreed to meet with Tusla in the coming weeks to discuss a similar protocol.</p><p>Finally, the DRHE is coordinating the development of a comprehensive National Quality Standards Framework for homeless services on behalf of all housing authorities.  Consultation with service users and key stakeholders, including Tusla, has been undertaken and the draft standards have been piloted in selected services.  These standards, including a child safety element which will provide homeless services with a framework for continuous quality improvement, will be implemented nationally.</p><p>Ultimately, my concern is that we minimise and then eliminate the problem of homelessness.  In the meantime, I will continue to support measures to help those affected, to the greatest degree possible within my area of responsibility.</p></reply>

Previous provisions for maternity benefit, parental leave and the recently introduced paternity leave also demonstrate the Government's commitment to support parents.  It should be noted that the Programme for Government commits to extending paid leave for parents in the first year of a child's life, which will be a key financial support enabling parents to care for their children at home in the critical first year.  I will be happy to support my Government colleagues in progressing these as funding allows.</p><p>My Department provides a number of childcare schemes which are available to all families, both working parents and those who choose to stay at home to care for their children.  From September 2018, the ECCE scheme will be available to all children over the age of two years and eight months for two full programme years.  114,000 children are expected to participate in ECCE from September 2018 and many of these will be children of stay at home parents.</p><p>Other initiatives will also help.  The additional affordability measures, which are now being rolled out across the country, are an important first step in making childcare more accessible for parents who choose to return to training or employment.  However, it is important to recognise that these measures, and those that will commence once the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) is introduced, are only one element of a broader set of commitments and supports aimed at parents and children.  The provision of improved services for centre-based care is very important, but I will not lose sight of the needs of children who do not attend them.  In this regard, <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People </i>contains a commitment to produce Ireland&rsquo;s first-ever National Early Years Strategy.  The intention is to deliver a cross-cutting strategy which will take a joined-up, whole of Government approach to the issue of supporting children and their families during the early years (0-6 years).  The drafting of the National Early Years Strategy is being advanced.  An Open Policy Debate was held with key stakeholders last December and this has informed the strategy development greatly.  Bilateral meetings with key government departments have taken place.  Development of the Strategy remains a priority for me and for my Department, and I will move to publish the Strategy as soon as possible after it is completed.</p></reply>

Such persons can currently seek information and assistance from the Adoption Authority of Ireland, Tusla and a number of accredited bodies.  The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 will for the first time, provide a statutory basis for the provision of information related to both past and future adoptions.  It provides for structured and regulated access to information and tracing services.  Persons whose births have been incorrectly registered and their birth parents, will be entitled to an information and tracing service in the same manner as an adopted person or a birth parent of an adopted person.  </p>  <p>  In 2010 the Adoption Authority of Ireland undertook a review of information regarding alleged incorrect birth registrations held by the former Adoption Board.  There were approximately 100 National Adoption Contact Preference Register (NACPR) applications which appeared to be related to incorrect birth registrations.  The 100 applications were roughly 50:50 pre and post 1953 (adoption legislation was introduced in to Ireland in 1952).  In 2013 staff from the Authority visited the General Register Office Research Room to confirm that there were in fact entries in the Register of Births that corresponded to the details given on approximately 120 (the original 100 + 20 received since 2010) of these NACPR applications.  The outcome of that was:  </p>  <p>  - 75 cases of people whose births were registered in the name of their "adopted" parents though no adoption took place and  </p>  <p>  - 40 cases where persons assumed the identity of their "adopted" parents but there is no record of an adoption or birth registration. </p>  <p>  Other than this limited  information, any attempts to quantify the numbers of incorrect birth registrations can never be any more than highly speculative given that it is impossible to quantify how many people are currently unaware that they are in fact &ldquo;incorrectly registered&rdquo;.  Searching for these people would be very difficult if not impossible.  Incorrect birth registrations operated in conditions of great secrecy and there were rarely any contemporary written records of these events.  The few such records that do still exist are generally papers of a personal nature and are extremely difficult to locate.</p></reply>

I have no current plan to conduct a review into the operations of Tusla with regard to its child protection policy.</p><p>I recently announced that all remaining provisions of the Children First Act 2015 will be commenced on 11 December 2017.  These include the provisions in relation to mandatory reporting of child abuse and in relation to placing a legal obligation on organisations providing services to children to prepare and publish a Child Safeguarding Statement.  Tusla is central to the implementation of these important measures.</p><p>I recently launched the <i>Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children [2017].</i>At the same launch, Tusla published an accompanying suite of Children First resource documents for those individuals and organisations who will acquire legal obligations under the Children First Act 2015.

The extra funding will be used to progress a number of key priorities including the introduction of mandatory reporting under <i>Children First</i>, addressing gaps in out-of-hours services and further investing in Family Resource Centres.  It will allow Tusla to recruit over 300 staff to respond to areas of identified risk and to meet increased demand for services.  This includes resources for responding to expected increases in referrals following the introduction of mandatory reporting and management of unallocated cases.  It will also allow for improvements in Tusla&rsquo;s ICT systems and overall organisational structures, including governance.</p><p>We must continually do our utmost to protect children and young people from harm and assist them in achieving their full potential and I want to encourage and support people who work with children to continue to do so.</p></reply>

I continue to work with my officials to deliver the new Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS). Strong progress is being made in this regard with all the elements of the scheme, including the IT system and an ACS Bill.</p><p>The increase in supports I have provided for the 2017/2018 programme year represents a major step towards accessible, affordable, quality childcare after decades of under-investment.  Two supports were introduced last month.  The first was a universal (non-means tested) support of up to &euro;1,040 per year for children under 3.  The second was an enhanced support of up to &euro;7,500 per year targeted to assist low income families to return to work and training. </p><p>So far in 2017/2018  the number of registrations for these new measures is as follows:  </p><p>-  Targeted schemes (CCS, CCSP and TEC): 25,775 children </p><p>-  The universal scheme: 25,339 children</p><p>It should be noted that for most of the programmes, providers can continue to register children throughout the year and children may enter the programmes at different times.  Therefore, I expect to see the number of registrations increase further over the coming weeks and months.</p><p>86% of service providers have signed up to deliver these measures.</p><p>As the expanded schemes only commenced in their current form from Sept 2017, I am providing the estimated cost for September to December 2017 and also for the full fiscal year 2018.  These are</p><p>- &euro;32.9m for the targeted childcare schemes in 2017 and &euro;75.2m in 2018</p><p>- &euro;7.4m for the universal scheme in 2017 and &euro;16.8 in 2018</p><p>This represents an investment of &euro;40.3m from September to December 2017 and &euro;92m for the full year 2018.</p><p>I would also note that 86,711 children have signed up so far to ECCE for this programme year.  There are three cumulative registration cycles for ECCE and this intake is only the first cycle.  In 2016/2017 over 120,000 children registered for ECCE.</p></reply>

The extension into 2018 will allow for consideration of the findings from the evaluation to inform plans for the design of future community based prevention and early intervention initiatives that comprehend the Programme for Government commitments in this area.</p></reply>

I have enhanced this by a further &euro;1.5m in 2018.  Laois Youth Services received &euro;86,803 funding in 2017 under the Special Projects for Youth scheme.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I approved funding of &euro;800,000 for the establishment of new youth projects and for the augmentation of a small number of existing youth services to meet new challenges arising from population increases.  This additional investment is being provided in regions of the country where there is a pressing need for services to meet the needs of young people. </p>  <p>  Each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards, including Laois and Offaly ETB, was invited to nominate locations within their catchment areas for the establishment of new services and to nominate a project or service to be considered for augmentation.  In total twenty-eight applications for new services were received, including an application for a new service for Laois.</p>  <p>  Based on the recommendations of a specially convened appraisal committee, and given the very limited resources available for the scheme, I approved the establishment of nine new targeted youth services and the expansion of a further seven to respond to new demand.  The application in respect of Laois was, unfortunately, not successful on this occasion. </p>  <p>  The Department has worked with Pobal and each Education and Training Board (ETB) Youth Officer, to map youth service provision across the State.  This mapping exercise will assist the Department and the relevant ETB in developing a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.  This exercise is due to be published soon and will inform future development and investment in youth services.  My Department is committed to working with Laois and Offaly ETB to identify need and explore ways to address this need where it emerges.</p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that my Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  The funding schemes support national and local youth work involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff  working in youth services and communities throughout the country.</p></reply>

I am very pleased that the &euro;73m package announced in Budget 2018 enables us to continue investing in our children and young people and secures much- needed additional resources for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency and provides a full second year of the ECCE free pre-school scheme, with a heavy emphasis on quality.</p><p>Tusla receives a 5.7% increase of &euro;40.6m for 2018, higher than the &euro;37m increase provided in 2017.  The extra funding will be used to progress a number of key priorities including the introduction of mandatory reporting under <i>Children First</i>, addressing gaps in out of hours services and further investing in Family Resource Centres that deliver services to families in disadvantaged areas across the country.  The additional investment will allow Tusla to recruit over 300 staff to respond to areas of identified risk and to meet increased demand for services.  This includes resources for responding to expected increases in referrals following the introduction of mandatory reporting; management of unallocated cases and developing aftercare services.  It will also allow for improvements in Tusla&rsquo;s ICT systems and overall organisational structures, including governance. </p><p>Budget 2018 represents another significant step in ensuring access to high quality, affordable early years care and education.  From September 2018 all children will be entitled to a full two years of the ECCE scheme or free preschool, as it has become known.  This further enhancement delivers fully on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers.  I also announced investment to continue the childcare affordability measures introduced last month that are already benefitting 45,000 children, with 24,000 of these registered so far for the universal under-3 scheme, and 21,000 registered for the targeted schemes.  The additional funding will ensure that the door remains open for further children and families to register and benefit from these subsidies throughout 2018.</p></reply>

The facility provides a base for young people from the area who can&rsquo;t afford a private stable to care for their animals.  It also provides an opportunity for young people to develop good animal welfare practice and equine education.  Any further development of this initiative would be a matter for the Department of Agriculture in conjunction with the relevant local authority.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I greatly value such initiatives.</p>  <p>  My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  The funding schemes support national and local youth work involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff working in youth services and communities throughout the country. </p>  <p>  In 2017, &euro;57.4 m has been allocated in current funding to support the provision of youth services.  Budget 2017 and 2018  provided a total of &euro;7m extra funding for youth services.  Additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.  Youth Officers are employed by the Education and Training Boards around the country to administer and co-ordinate youth services at a local level through engagement with the local services.</p></reply>

Tusla had advocated for this important change to assist young people in making the transition from a young person in care to adult life, and to ensure consistency of support to these young people/ young adults in aftercare from 18 years and up to 21 years of age.  This may be extended to 23 if a young adult is in full time education or accredited training.</p>  <p>  Planning a young person&rsquo;s new independent living needs to begin years prior to leaving care and continue as part of the care planning process.  This preparatory work is facilitated by a social worker in Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and is based on collaboration with the young person, their carers and partner agencies.  Resources, including aftercare workers, have been put in place to ensure this happens before a child leaves care. </p>  <p>  Arising from Budget 2018, Tusla will receive an additional &euro;40.6 million euro in funding that  will bring its allocation to over &euro;753 million euro in 2018.  </p>  <p>  I will shortly be issuing Tusla with its 2018 Performance Statement in line with the provisions of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013.

The precise level of funding to be allocated to support aftercare plans will be considered by Tusla, in preparing its Business Plan, having regard to the overall level of funding available in 2018, which will exceed &euro;753 million euro.</p>  <p>  It is not my intention to prescribe the overall level of funding to be allocated by Tusla to support aftercare plans.  It is more appropriate, in my view, that Tusla first sets out its proposals for this important service area, having regard to its statutory remit and taking account of the totality of funding available next year.</p></reply>

The new measures announced in Budget 2018 form part of a trend of continued growth and investment.  In Budget 2017 I secured a 35% increase in childcare funding, which followed from a similar 35% increase in Budget 2016.  Cumulatively the last three budgets have seen an increase of 87% in investment after decades of under-investment.  However, I have said on many occasions that we will need significant investment in every budget for many years to catch up with our OECD counterparts.</p>  <p>  The increase in supports now being implemented for the 2017/18 programme year represents a major step towards accessible affordable quality childcare.  These increases reflect my ambition to support the provision of quality childcare services with appropriately supported and qualified staff. </p>  <p>  These increases are considerable, up to 50% in the targeted subsidies, which significantly decreases the amount of co-payment required of low income families or parents in education or training.  Parents can benefit by as much as &euro;7,500 per child per year under the new measures.  I also introduced a universal subsidy worth up to &euro;1,040 per year; this subsidy is aimed at children not yet in the free pre-school scheme.</p>  <p>  These changes are way-points towards our goal to deliver genuine affordable, accessible, quality childcare.  My Department is also progressing the development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme which will ultimately replace all existing targeted schemes.  This requires robust IT systems and an appropriate legislative grounding.  We must ensure that the new system is absolutely fit for purpose as it will be with us for many years. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, I recognise the pressures on childcare providers.  Before the end of this year, I will be providing a further amount of  &euro;3.5m towards &ldquo;programme support payments&rdquo; for all childcare providers who register for the scheme mentioned above.  This amount is in addition to the &euro;14.5m that has been already paid to childcare services so far in 2017.</p>  <p>  The increase of 7% in ECCE capitation I just announced should be of significance to all providers as ECCE has become a corner-stone of most childcare services.</p>  <p>  Further, my Department has also provided capital investment of over &euro;12m in 2017 with dedicated schemes for both Early Years and School Age Childcare.  Investment will continue in 2018 with the detailed specifications currently being finalised by my officials. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issue raised around sustainability, officials from Pobal and my Department identify and work with providers with serious concerns around their viability. &euro;1m was provided in Budget 2017 for &lsquo;Sustainability efforts&rsquo; and my Department is currently engaging with those providers to ensure that these vital services are provided with the necessary financial assistance.  An additional &euro;700,000 has been secured in 2018, for the purpose of assisting services enduring sustainability issues.  This increased funding will allow my Department to increase the scope of the current sustainability assessment model so that any service undergoing issues affecting their sustainability will have the ability to apply for additional funding under this stream.</p></reply>

This Government recognises that homelessness is an extremely distressing situation for any family, and living in emergency accommodation is not conducive to normal family life.  While my Department has no role in providing housing for families, we are working closely with Tusla to provide supports for families in emergency accommodation in order to mitigate the challenges faced by parents and children in this situation.</p><p>My Department has undertaken a number of actions as part of <i>Rebuilding Ireland: the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>.  These include co-funding a study on food access and nutritional health among families residing in hotel accommodation in the Dublin Region.  Free childcare has been introduced for the children of families experiencing homelessness.  As part of this scheme a daily meal is provided for each child, the cost of which is included in the subvention rate.  </p><p>Family Resource Centres, part funded by Tusla, are working with people who are experiencing homelessness.  Many have developed local responses based on their own analysis of the needs of families in emergency accommodation.  Actions taken by Tusla include the provision of funding for child support workers and the appointment of a Homelessness Liaison Officer.  In recognition of the difficulties associated with homelessness and school attendance, Tusla&rsquo;s Educational Welfare Service offers a number of supports to children and families experiencing homelessness.  Tusla works together with other statutory and voluntary agencies to provide services and supports to children, young people and families experiencing homelessness. </p><p>Tusla&rsquo;s joint protocol with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) covers child welfare and protection matters for children in emergency accommodation.  It is fully operational in the DRHE areas and it is intended to replicate this protocol across the State.  A Joint Working Protocol between Tusla and Galway City Council and their contracted services providers was co-signed by Tusla and the City Council in July. Galway County Council has agreed to meet with Tusla in the coming weeks to discuss a similar protocol.</p><p>The DRHE is coordinating the development of a comprehensive National Quality Standards Framework for homeless services on behalf of all housing authorities.  Consultation with service users and key stakeholders, including Tusla, has been undertaken and the draft standards have been piloted in selected services.  These standards, including a child safety element which will provide homeless services with a framework for continuous quality improvement, will be implemented nationally.</p><p>Ultimately, my concern is that we minimise and then eliminate the problem of homelessness.  In the meantime, I will continue to support measures to help those affected, to the greatest degree possible within my area of responsibility.</p></reply>

In early June I appointed a multi disciplinary team of experts headed by Forensic Archaeologist Niamh Mc Cullagh to provide technical advices to Government in this highly specialised area.</p><p>This was done to ensure that the approach adopted is informed by technical input that accords with international best practice in this specialised area.  The Terms of Reference of the Expert Group's work are available on my Department's website at <i>www.dcya.gov.ie</i>.  On 7 July 2017 the Expert Team submitted a preliminary first stage document which outlines the potential range of options which could be considered as next steps on this site.  Again, this report was published on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>at www.dcya.gov.ie. </i></p><p>In July the Expert Team conducted an extensive non-invasive geophysical survey on site at Tuam.  This consisted of data collection through a variety of non-invasive techniques, over the course of 5 days.  Department officials are currently liaising with the Expert Team, who are due to submit their final report shortly.  I have asked the expert team to provide its technical advice in easy to understand language, so that we can all appreciate the options for the site and what each option would entail.  This information will help us have a much better-informed consultation on the future of the site.  Once I have received the report a course of action can then be agreed upon to build towards a consensus on the next steps to be taken.</p></reply>

I would therefore be glad to discuss the issues you have identified with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, should this prove to be necessary. </p>  <p>  In relation to the staff recruitment difficulties you have specified, the majority of community childcare services are operating successfully and have been able to manage issues that they face within existing structures.  Notwithstanding this, it is recognised that a small number of services have faced financial challenges due to the requirement to replace unpaid CE Workers with staff qualified  to the standard specified within the 2016 Regulations.  &euro;1m in funding has therefore been made available to services that identify themselves as being impacted in this way.  To date, my Department has authorised the transfer of &euro;0.52m across 60 applicant services from this stream of funding.  Furthermore, an additional &euro;0.7m has been allocated to this stream of funding for the coming year. </p>  <p>  My Department, and the 30 City and County Childcare Committees across the country, are available to work intensively with any service experiencing difficulties.</p>  <p>  Deputies may also be interested to note that centres who register for the enhanced childcare measures introduced last month will gain access to the Programme Support Payment (formerly Non-Contact Time payment).  This programme will aid community child care services with the administrative demands placed on them.  A total of &euro;18m has been made available in 2017 and has been secured again for 2018 and onwards.</p>  <p>  Community services are also expected to benefit from the 'September more affordable childcare measures' given the increase in subsidies paid to parents, in some instances by as much as 50%.  </p></reply>

I appointed an experienced facilitator with an international reputation to assist in the design and running of these consultations and in early June I issued public invitations to former residents and their supporters seeking expressions of interest in participating in the facilitated process.  </p>  <p>  The first session was held at the Westin Hotel, Dublin on the 30th of June 2017.  Over 100 people from around the country, the UK and the USA participated in the event reflecting the high level of interest in engaging with this process.  Following on from the event a Facilitators Report was drafted and shared with attendees for their observations.  A second session was held at the Silver Springs Hotel in Cork City on the 6th of October 2017 to ensure that more people had an opportunity to have their say on issues of concern to them.  This second event mirrored the first and again a Facilitators Report will be circulated to attendees. </p>  <p>  I attended both events and had an opportunity to meet many of the participants and acknowledge the generosity and courage of all participants in contributing to the dialogue.  When completed, the Facilitators Reports produced from both events will inform my proposals to Government so that appropriate supports can be put in place as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

The Civil Service Management Board (CSMB) has decided to establish a sub group of the CSMB which will act as a high-level working group.  It will be chaired by the Secretary General to the Government and the membership will be finalised shortly. </p>  <p>  In addition, responsibility for communications will be assigned to an Assistant Secretary in every Government Department, who will work collectively to ensure cross Government cooperation.</p>  <p>  This initiative will be progressed as part of the Civil Service renewal programme.  </p>  <p>  This oversight is in line with my Department's Strategy Statement, its core values being: A deep-rooted public service ethos of independence, integrity, impartiality, equality, fairness and respect and a culture of accountability, efficiency and value for money.</p>  <p>  These core principles will inform how the Unit will conduct its business.  Its task will be to simplify Government communications and to increase efficiencies across the public sector when dealing with the Irish public.</p>  <p>  The Director of the Unit accompanied, by staff from the Strategic Communications Unit have been attending a series of meetings with Ministers, Secretary Generals and officials in Departments.  The purpose of these meetings is to help improve effectiveness, efficiency and cross-Government collaboration in order to foster and develop a whole of Government approach to communications. s part of this work, a network of communications officials across Government will be developed to share best practice.  This network of communications professionals will comprise the communications personnel within the civil and public service and will not include politically appointed personnel. </p>  <p>  The Government Press Secretary has not attended these meetings.  The staff of the SCU have been instructed not to attend meetings of political advisors.  All meetings must include civil servants.</p>  <p>  The Government wants to make it easier for members of the public to understand its work and the services it provides.  Two projects are underway to improve this as part of the work of the Strategic Communications Unit, an audit of current Government communications and a survey to help us learn more about public awareness and understanding of Government services. </p>  <p>  Working with the Office of Government Procurement, a request for the services of a company to complete this survey has been issued.  This work will inform the future output of the Unit.  The findings of this survey and the audit of Government communications will be published on completion. </p>  <p>  No advice from outside agencies or consultancies has been sought by the Strategic Communications Unit to date.  My Department has issued requests for tender for other creative services.  These are being procured in accordance with standard procurement rules.</p>  <p>  The Strategic Communications Unit has no role in setting a positive news agenda, its remit is to inform the public of the work of Government in a factual and non partisan manner.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Budget a total of &euro;5 million was allocated to the Strategic Communications Unit for 2018, which will be funded through the Department of the Taoiseach Vote which actually saw a slight decrease overall in Budget 2018.  The Strategic Communications Unit intends to leverage opportunities for building the effectiveness of existing communications capacity across Government, as well as rationalisation.  A key part of the modernisation of Government communications will be greater use of digital media.  For example, recent initiatives such as the promotion of the whereyourmoneygoes.gov.ie website and promotion of online videos relating to Ireland's Rugby World Cup Bid, information about going back to school and the Budget and Capital Plan cost a total of approximately &euro;19,000.</p>  <p>  There has been no change to the practice of publishing speeches to the Department's websites, which are up to date.  There are currently no plans for changes to Merrionstreet.ie.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's weekly messages on social media are generally recorded by a member of his political staff.</p></reply>

This means that Irish companies may now take advantage of the all-important provisions of CETA including the elimination of tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, the easing of regulatory barriers and more transparent rules for market access.</p>  <p>  Under the Agreement, the CETA Joint Committee and the specialised committees established under its auspices are bilateral bodies representative of the European Union and Canada.  The European Commission will represent the EU, at the appropriate level, in these committees in accordance with the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union.  In line with this principle, the selection of experts will be a matter for the European Commission to appoint on behalf of the EU, and Canada in respect of themselves.  It would be a matter for individuals with the requisite expertise appropriate in the particular matter (economic, trade, employment law, environment), to express their interest in serving as panellists direct to the Commission.  Member States have the right to be present and participate at the specialised committees in cases involving the adoption of decisions falling within the competence of Member States.  The powers of the CETA committees are strictly limited to the matters provided for in the Agreement.  Any changes to the text of the Agreement or EU regulations can only be made in compliance with the ordinary legislative procedure of the European Union.   </p>  <p>  The Agreement also provides for the establishment of civil society advisory groups that may submit opinions or make recommendations in relation to labour, the environment and trade sustainable development related concerns.  These advisory groups shall promote a balanced representation of relevant interests, including independent representative employers, unions, labour and business organisations, environmental groups, as well as other relevant civil society organisations as appropriate.</p>  <p>  It is important to note, that the provisions relating to investment protection and the Investment Court System (ICS) are excluded from provisional application.  Member States will not be bound by these provisions until they are ratified by all Member States in accordance with their national procedures.  In this regard, I have no immediate plans to ratify the Agreement given the Opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the EU-Singapore case and the recent request by Belgium for an opinion from that Court on the compatibility of the Investment Court System with the European Treaties. </p>  <p>  The potential costs for Ireland supporting the administration and operation of the Investment Court System in the Agreement would be very low.  It is impossible to anticipate the nature of any alleged discriminatory actions that would provide the basis for a successful case against the State given Ireland&rsquo;s adherence to the rule of law and the property protections of our Constitution.  In light of these considerations, an analysis of the potential costs of the Investment Court System would not be feasible or meaningful.</p></reply>

This is mainly because the requirements of the Dangerous Substances Act have been superseded by newer legislation. All large containers / drums will have ADR (Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road) marking and may also have CLP (Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures) marking. Small 5 litre containers are typically UN approved and are also embossed or labelled with a flammable warning. </p>  <p>  Inspections carried out by the HSA have focused on petrol stations rather than private stores or maintenance activities where such small containers might be used. The marking of containers is specifically addressed in an Information Note on &ldquo;Handling Petrol Safely&rdquo; available from the HSA.</p>  <p>  Any specific queries or concerns can of course be raised directly with the HSA who will be happy to advice on such matters.</p></reply>

Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA, an employment permit may be sought in respect of a non-EEA national who possesses those skills.

Where such an order is made it will be known as a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO), will be binding across the sector to which it relates, and will be enforceable by the Workplace Relations Commission. </p>  <p>  To-date five applications for SEOs have been made to the Labour Court under the new legislation.

On the recommendation of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine I also extended consanguinity relief for another 3 years and provided that the stamp duty rate applying under that scheme will be fixed at 1%.  Consanguinity relief is availed of in transferring farms to younger family members.  It encourages the early transfer of farms to younger generations and is mostly relevant where the transferee does not qualify for an alternative relief such as the Young Trained Farmer stamp duty exemption. </p>  <p>  Details of these measures will be contained in the Finance Bill.</p></reply>

The relief takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable value of gifted or inherited agricultural property. </p>  <p>  To qualify for the relief, the person taking the gift or inheritance (the 'beneficiary') of the agricultural property must first qualify as a 'farmer' for the purpose of section 89 CATCA 2003.  This means that a beneficiary's agricultural property must comprise at least 80% by gross market value of the beneficiary's total property at a particular date. </p>  <p>  In addition, for gifts and inheritances taken on or after 1 January 2015, a beneficiary, or a lessee where the beneficiary leases the agricultural land, must actually farm the land on a commercial basis for at least half of his or her normal working time for a period of at least 6 years after receiving the gift or inheritance.  There are no restrictions with regard to the relationship between a beneficiary and a lessee where the agricultural land is leased. </p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that while the general position is as set out above, it is not their practice to give a definitive answer in respect of a hypothetical scenario such as that set out in the question.  The correct tax treatment of the transfer of land between parties can be complex and varies according to the circumstances of the parties involved.  The parties involved should either present full details of the proposed transaction to Revenue or seek independent professional advice if they wish to have certainty in his matter.</p></reply>

Up to &euro;750 million of ISIF funds will be allocated to HBFI to provide funding on market terms.  This fund could have capacity to finance about 6,000 homes in the coming years.</p>  <p>  HBFI will not be directly involved in development &ndash; its role would be solely as a commercial lender and therefore will not have any role in designing the housing mix contained in the schemes it funds.  HBFI will provide lending on commercial, market-equivalent terms and conditions.  This approach would be akin to a bank or private equity investor.  As such HBFI will not have targets in relation to social or affordable housing but will provide a significant contribution to supporting the delivery of additional supply of all types of residential housing in the coming years. </p>  <p>  Increasing the level of housing output will increase the affordability of housing more generally, which in turn also will have a positive effect on our ability to provide social housing.  For example, any residential developments funded by HBFI will be subject to the same planning and regulatory requirements as all other developments.  This includes policies relating to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and as such, it is expected that a minimum of 10% of the anticipated output of this investment by HBFI will become available for social housing through this statutory mechanism over this period.</p>  <p>  The current estimated shortfall in residential supply is 15,000 - 20,000 units per annum and, accordingly, the HBFI, with an annual average delivery of 2,000 homes, would reduce this shortfall by about 10% (assuming a three year horizon).  This would be a significant contribution but it would not make HBFI a dominant player in the residential funding market and it would clearly leave room for banks and other finance providers to increase their contribution to funding much-needed residential development.  The 2,000 units per year figure is a simple average of the expected output and not a defined annual target. </p>  <p>  Though HBFI is intended to be a debt funder for private residential projects, I can assure the Deputy that this Government is equally determined to increase social housing output over the coming years.  For example, an increase of &euro;31 million has been allocated to the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme bringing the total to &euro;115 million.  This is expected to deliver an extra 4,000 social housing homes in 2018.  In my Budget speech on 10 October 2017, I also announced an additional commitment to further accelerate the delivery of social housing from 2019.  I am providing an extra &euro;500 million for the direct building programme which will see an additional 3,000 new build social houses by 2021, increasing the existing Rebuilding Ireland target of social housing homes to 50,000, of which 33,500 will be delivered through construction. </p></reply>

The IREF regime, which was introduced by section 23 Finance Act 2016, took effect from 1 January 2017. IREFs must operate a 20% IREF withholding tax on the happening of certain taxable events (such as a distribution of profits or a redemption of units).  Any withholding tax deducted in respect of distributions made during 2017 must be returned to Revenue by the end of July 2018.  Therefore, I am advised by Revenue that they are not yet in a position to identify the amount of withholding tax relating to IREF taxable events that have happened so far in 2017.</p>  <p>   As the measures were implemented in Finance Act 2016, it is still too early for the Department or Revenue to assess the impact of the changes and would be impracticable to review the impact of the changes at this time.  </p>  <p>   In relation to the two measures, a yield of &euro;50 million was included in Budget 2017.  This estimate was both conservative and prudent. Regarding the estimates for 2018, my Department forecasts overall Corporation Tax receipts for a particular year and these forecasts do not include separate component elements for section 110 companies or IREFs.</p></reply>

My Department does not have any plans to conduct an investigation into unpaid work.  However, broader labour market measures and studies are used by my Department to gain a deeper understanding of the potential labour supply and the barriers to employment. </p>  <p>  The CSO publishes comprehensive labour market data in its Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS).  This includes information on people&rsquo;s self-assessed employment and unemployment status and measures of the potential labour supply.  The unemployment rate was 6.4% in the second quarter of 2017.  The QNHS assessments of potential labour supply ranged from 6.9% to 13.3% depending on the broader groups of people included (i.e. unemployed persons, discouraged workers, passive jobseekers, part-time underemployed persons). </p>  <p>  A recent Central Bank staff paper set out a proposed non-employment index that includes the potential additional labour supply, factoring in how likely each group is to transition to employment.  This paper estimated that potential labour supply in quarter 4 2016 ranged from 7.9% to 9.4% when part-time underemployed persons are included. </p>  <p>  There are a range of initiatives across Government which address employment, including issues around barriers to entering the workforce.  These include the Action Plan for Jobs, Pathways to Work, the National Skills Strategy, the re-organisation of the further education and training sector and the Housing Assistance Payment.  These various initiatives are the responsibility of my colleagues the Minister for Business Enterprise and Innovation, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work Strategy set out the strategic framework to create jobs, increase employment and reduce unemployment.  Reforms to date include the establishment of &lsquo;one-stop shop&rsquo; Intreo centres; the transformation of jobseeker services through Intreo; new activation, income and employment supports; and reforms to provide lone parents with enhanced access to education, training, and employment support services.</p>  <p>  There has also been a re-organisation of the further education and training sector with the result that Education and Training Boards are now better positioned to respond to individual and national skill needs across a wide range of areas and of the local and regional economy.  The National Skills Strategy 2025 provides a framework to ensure the development of a well-educated, well-skilled and adaptable labour force, and supports an inclusive approach to participation in education, training and the labour market across all groups and skill levels. </p>  <p>  Recent reforms &ndash; particularly the introduction of the Back to Work Family Dividend and the roll-out of the Housing assistance Payment scheme &ndash; have addressed concerns about work incentives for families with children. </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has been made in implementing reforms to encourage employment, remove barriers to entering the labour market and to remove inactivity traps.  The Government will continue to put in place the framework conditions for continued employment growth.</p></reply>

As it was a Maltese incorporated company, the liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.</p>  <p>  As you are aware, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment on 25 May 2017 and overturned the previous decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal that the Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is liable in respect of third party motor insurance claims made against the policyholders of Setanta Insurance.  The consequence of this is that the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) has been deemed responsible for the payment of such third party claims.</p>  <p>  As the judgment has been delivered, the process of making payments in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1964, as amended, has commenced.  Under the current legislation payments can only be made out of the ICF, with the approval of the High Court and only if it appears to the High Court that it is unlikely that the claim can be met otherwise than from the ICF.  If satisfied, the High Court can order payments out of the ICF up to 65% (or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser) due to relevant claimants. </p>  <p>  Over and above the 65% ICF payment, it is expected that a proportion of the balance of money due to third-party claimants will be met from the proceeds of the distribution of Setanta's assets on completion of the liquidation process.  The liquidator commissioned actuarial consultants, Willis Towers Watson, to carry out an analysis of Setanta Insurance's claims reserves as at 30 June 2017 and this has now been completed.  The report estimates the claims reserves at between &euro;105.9 million and &euro;112.9 million.  This is an increase from the first report in 2014, which estimated the claims reserves at between &euro;87.7 million and &euro;95.2 million.</p>  <p>  A consequence of this is that based on this actuarial report, the liquidator now estimates that he will not be in a position to meet more than 22% of the claims out of the assets of the liquidation once all matters in the liquidation have been concluded, rather than the not more  than 30% of claims figure previously indicated. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently considering the implications of this actuarial report.  In addition, you should note that there is also a legal concern that any Government intervention could undermine the priority status of claimants in the liquidation.  The Department of Finance is therefore seeking legal advice on the impact on the State's ability to recover from the liquidated company if it were to compensate third party claimants.</p>  <p>  Once this legal concern is clarified, the Government will be in a better position to consider its response to this issue including the implications this may have for all connected persons.</p></reply>

This section provides for the taxation under Schedule E of employment income arising to any member of a flight crew in circumstances where the duties are exercised on aircraft operated in international traffic and where the place of effective management of the aircraft operator is in the State.  The provision applies irrespective of the place of residence of the crew member. </p>  <p>  Part 42 Chapter 4 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 imposes an obligation on employers to make deductions at source under the PAYE system from the payment of emoluments to an employee (i.e. an individual operating under a contract of service) where those emoluments are taxable under Schedule E.</p>  <p>  Thus, where the provisions of Section 127B apply, flight crew will pay tax on their employment income under Schedule E and will be subject to deductions at source under the PAYE system.  In the case of a non Irish resident individual, whether this charge is relieved from Irish tax will depend on whether a Double Taxation Agreement is in place between the State and the jurisdiction in which the employee resides.</p>  <p>  Section 127B only applies where the individual is an employee and does not apply in the case of an individual operating under a contract for service (i.e. self employed).  Where an individual is operating under a contract for service the individual is required to account for the correct tax due under self-assessment rules.  Any such individual is required to file an annual income tax return.</p>  <p>  Pursuant to Section 851A of the Act, which provides for taxpayer confidentiality, Revenue cannot disclose information relating to a particular taxpayer or a narrowly defined group of taxpayers.</p></reply>

The Act, which was commenced on 21st March 2016, inter alia provides for the establishment of the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) which was established on the same date.  A key feature of the legislation is that taxpayers now make their appeals against Revenue decisions directly to the TAC and not through Revenue.</p>  <p>  The TAC has recently undertaken a consultative process related to the operation of its rules of procedure involving all stakeholders.  This was a listening exercise providing an opportunity to raise issues about the operation of the reformed tax appeals system.  I have recently received a report from the Tax Appeal Commissioners in relation to their consultation exercise which is under consideration in my Department.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issues raised in the details supplied with the Deputy&rsquo;s question, Revenue has a statutory obligation to collect tax, pursue recovery of tax debt and ensure that the tax system is administered in a fair and equitable manner.  While tax write out features in the overall approach to tax debt management in all modern tax administrations, in the overall context of the collection and enforcement effort, the extent of recourse to write out by Revenue is very infrequent.  The only circumstance where tax is written out is where a business/taxpayer is adjudicated insolvent, has ceased to trade with no assets, where collection is uneconomic to pursue, or where collection would cause undue hardship.  Where a decision not to pursue a debt is made, the debt effectively becomes dormant.  Tax write out only reflects a decision not to pursue the debt for a period of time and in certain cases, the write out can be reversed if and when Revenue considers that the taxpayer&rsquo;s circumstances have changed.  </p>  <p>  All write-out cases are closely monitored by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Chapter 21 of the recent Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General &lsquo;Accounts of the Public Services&rsquo; report sets out the broad principles underlying Revenue&rsquo;s approach to tax debt collection and reviews Revenue&rsquo;s processes for &lsquo;writing out&rsquo; debt deemed to be uncollectible, the reasons underlying the write outs and the amounts of debt written out by category of tax.</p>  <p>  In relation to Revenue&rsquo;s use of counsel and appeals to the Courts I am advised by Revenue that it does not always engage counsel irrespective of the size of the case.  Revenue has robust internal procedures concerning the use of counsel, both junior and senior.  The decision to engage counsel in an appeal is dealt with on a case by case basis.  There are appeals where Revenue officers present Revenue&rsquo;s case and there are appeals, particularly cases in which a point of law, rather than the quantum of a tax liability, is being disputed, where counsel (whether junior or senior) is more likely to be engaged. </p>  <p>  Revenue also advises that any decision to pursue an appeal case to the Courts following a determination of Appeal Commissioners follows an analysis of the both the quantum of tax at stake and the precedential nature of the point of law in question.  I am advised that certain cases where a relatively small quantum of tax is a stake could result in a significant loss to the Exchequer if an incorrect interpretation of law is accepted and applied generally, and that it is Revenue&rsquo;s duty to pursue cases where doubt exists as to the correct position.</p>  <p>  In relation to an opportunity to settle I am advised by Revenue that all taxpayers with an appeal have had, and continue to have, the opportunity to settle the appeal by agreement with Revenue.  On 21 March 2016, the date on which the Finance (Tax Appeals) Act 2015 came into operation Revenue was still dealing with appeals that were made before this date but that had not yet been referred to the Appeal Commissioners.  Revenue was obliged under Section 31 of the 2015 Act to refer such appeals to the TAC as soon as practicable after 21 March 2016.  However, before doing so, Revenue was required to notify the appellant of this statutory requirement and to request that the appellant indicate whether he or she wished to settle the appeal by agreement with Revenue or to have the appeal referred to the TAC for hearing.  Where the appellant indicated a wish to settle the appeal by agreement but agreement was not then reached, Revenue was required to refer the appeal to the TAC. </p>  <p>  In addition to this express statutory provision, Revenue advise that they are always willing to engage in discussion with taxpayers and their agents with a view to settling appeals prior to any hearing before the TAC and also prior to any hearing by the Courts where a case proceeds to that level. </p>  <p>  As regards opportunities to address backlog I am advised that of the backlog of appeal cases on hands there is a significant volume of cases that may potentially by addressed in groups where the matter in dispute is common across a number of taxpayers.  While the authority to consider appeal cases in this manner is statutorily vested in the TAC,  Revenue advises that it is very supportive of this approach and will provide any assistance necessary to the TAC to enable it to address the backlog of cases by considering appeals in groups where this is an appropriate approach.</p></reply>

It is clear that such working papers are necessary to support the deliberative process.</p><p>However, it is important to note that matters have moved on significantly since September 2016 and in particular since Article 50 was triggered in March 2017.  As such, I note that this document remains in draft format and was not finalised as it was overtaken by consequent major developments and policy statements.  I am informed that it does not reflect Revenue&rsquo;s current view on Brexit. </p><p>Like all Government agencies, the Revenue Commissioners are actively engaged in examining a range of scenarios in order to support Ireland's objectives.  This work is being undertaken within the whole-of-Government framework previously coordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach and now led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The precise customs arrangements that will apply after Brexit will depend on the outcome of negotiations between the EU and UK however it is clear that political solutions must be found before technical resolutions can be applied.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s priorities in relation to the unique concerns that arise for Ireland in the context of Brexit are very clear - to maintain the Common Travel Area and to protect the gains of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, including avoiding a hard border. </p><p>Evidently the closest trading relationship between the UK and EU is best for Ireland.  The Taoiseach has reiterated this position on many occasions, most recently in the D&aacute;il last week.</p><p>The Government welcomes that these priorities have been reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position and further welcomes and supports the Taskforce&rsquo;s paper on the &ldquo;Guiding Principles for the dialogue on Ireland/Northern Ireland&rdquo;, which was published on 7 September.  The paper builds on the European Council Guidelines and reflects the priority Irish issues identified by the Government, including that, in view of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, flexible and imaginative solutions will be required to avoid a hard border, including any physical border infrastructure.  This must be achieved in a way which ensures that Ireland's place within the Internal Market and Customs Union is unaffected.  The paper also makes it clear that it is the UK&rsquo;s responsibility to propose workable solutions in this regard.  It is the Government&rsquo;s view that the UK staying in the customs union and single market, or as close as possible to that, would be the best solution.</p><p>However, it is important that internal analysis continues in the meantime.  Several helpful reports and working papers have been published by the ESRI, Intertrade Ireland, and business representative bodies.

Relief in respect of health expenses, granted in accordance with section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, is used to reduce the Irish tax liability of an individual in respect of the year of assessment in which the expenses are incurred.  In general, if an individual is tax resident in Ireland, their world-wide income is taxable in Ireland and relief can be claimed for medical expenses.  However, where an individual&rsquo;s sole income for a year of assessment is not taxable in Ireland, for example where that income is a UK Government pension, then it is not possible to claim relief as no tax liability arises against which to claim the relief. </p></reply>

Such an appeal takes the form of an application to the General Court of the European Union (GCEU), asking it to annul the Commission&rsquo;s Final Decision. </p>  <p>  The Attorney General prepared the legal grounds in support of the annulment proceedings and the application was lodged in the GCEU in 2016.  As is normal practice, a summary of these have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union.  They were also published on the Department of Finance&rsquo;s website in December 2016. </p>  <p>  The case has been granted priority status and is progressing through the various stages of private written proceedings before the GCEU.  It is at the discretion of the court to determine if there will be oral proceedings, either in public or in private.  It will likely be several years before the matter is ultimately settled by the European Courts.  </p>  <p>  As this is the subject of open legal proceedings, it will not be possible to comment further, in particular on any of the individual elements of the State&rsquo;s legal case in defence of our position.  This is important to ensure that we do not prejudice our own legal case. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the appeal, Ireland is obliged to comply with binding Articles of the Commission&rsquo;s Decision regarding recovery.  Officials and experts from across the State have been engaged in intensive work to ensure that Ireland complies with all its recovery obligations as soon as possible.</p></reply>

However any lending provided in due course will be provided by HBFI which will be fully separate and will not impact NAMA's existing objectives or its Board&rsquo;s strategic wind down plans.  The exact staffing and servicing arrangements are currently being devised by my officials and NAMA and will be confirmed in due course.</p>  <p>  In relation to the products that will be offered by HBFI, the fund will be designed to focus on the provision of debt funding to viable residential development projects.  As the Deputy will be aware, the State is already providing a number of alternative supports into this market, including equity finance, through the ISIF&rsquo;s existing residential development funding platforms.  </p>  <p>  I am not in a position to confirm the specific product terms and conditions requested by the Deputy, as these will be set by the board of HBFI in due course.  I can confirm that HBFI will be lending on commercial, market-equivalent terms and conditions, which would depend on the risk profile of each individual project, the quality of collateral and the creditworthiness of the borrower.  This approach would be akin to a bank or private equity investor, in that HBFI would not be directly involved in development &ndash; its role would be solely as a commercial lender. Commercial viability testing will also ensure returns are the same as market norms.</p>  <p>  With a proposed allocation of up to &euro;750 million, the HBFI could have capacity to fund about 6,000 homes in the coming years.  The current estimated shortfall in residential supply is 15,000 &ndash; 20,000 units per annum and, accordingly, the HBFI, with an annual average delivery of 2,000 homes, would reduce this shortfall by about 10% (assuming a three year horizon).  This would be a significant contribution but it would not make HBFI a dominant player in the residential funding market and it would clearly leave room for banks and other finance providers to increase their contribution to funding much-needed residential development. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that the delivery estimate included in the Budget documentation was based on an assumed delivery cost of &euro;250,000 per unit and an assumption that HBFI would recycle the allocated funding once over an estimated three year time horizon.</p>  <p>  In relation to State aid issues, the proposal has been designed to provide lending to the market at commercial rates.  The establishment of the fund will be discussed with the European Commission over the coming months and my officials have already had preliminary discussions with the European Commission in relation to the initiative.  As advised, there is clear legal separation between HBFI and NAMA and the proposal will not impact NAMA&rsquo;s mandate or wind down plans.  As a result, I do not envisage any impact from this proposal on the existing State aid complaint in relation to NAMA currently under consideration by the European Commission.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would be hopeful of bringing the establishing legislation to the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in late 2017 or early 2018, with a view to HBFI commencing operations in Q2 2018.  It is not expected that HBFI will have an indefinite lifespan but it is too early to speculate on how long it may operate as this will depend on the availability of funding in the market to meet demand for homes in the coming years.</p></reply>

However, what is clear is that Brexit is likely to affect Ireland&rsquo;s trade patterns and SMEs.  To meet the working capital needs of Irish SMEs and to assist them with adapting and innovating in response to the challenges, and opportunities, posed by Brexit I announced a &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Guarantee in my speech for Budget 2018.  This Scheme forms part of the wider Government Brexit Strategy and was developed by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. </p><p>It is intended that the Scheme will operate under the <i>de minimis</i>State aid rules and be supported by both State and European guarantees.  Loans at competitive interest rates will be available to all viable but vulnerable Irish SMEs and small MidCaps, businesses with less than 499 employees, who are exposed to the impact of Brexit.  As part of the application process, businesses will be required to produce a business plan that demonstrates how they intend to adjust to the challenges they face because of Brexit.  All applications will be assessed for eligibility by the SBCI and then subject to the normal lending assessment criteria of the commercial finance providers involved in the Scheme.  Due to State aid rules, the Scheme will not be available to primary producers in the agriculture sector or to the fishing sector. </p><p>I expect the Scheme will launched in March of next year.  Further details of the Scheme will be provided shortly by my colleagues, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></reply>

I would point out that Section 21 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 requires the Bureau, through the Garda Commissioner, to provide an annual report of its activities to the Minister for Justice and Equality who is then required to lay copies of the report before each House of the Oireachtas.  The Annual Reports, including the most recent one for 2016 which was published last July, are available in the Oireachtas library and on the website of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They also published on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality. </p>  <p>  In Part 3 of the 2016 Report for instance, detailed information is provided in relation to the number of cases brought before the High Court under the various provisions of the Act; the number and types of assets broken down by reference to categories such as jewellery, property, vehicles and cash/financial and their respective valuations; and the value of assets transferred to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform following the making of a disposal order by the High Court under Section 4 of the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 (as amended).  Comparative data relating to the actions of the Bureau under the Revenue Acts and the Social Welfare Consolidation Act are also provided in these annual reports.</p>  <p>  In order to mitigate any risk of harm, the Deputy will understand that it would not be appropriate to be specific about individual properties or individual lands which could be currently in the process of sale on behalf of the Bureau, or which have been purchased.</p></reply>

In this case, because the individual concerned left the Civil Service in 1998, they are not eligible to avail of CNER.

The Report sets out a number of proposals to develop a long term sustainable funding mode.  I look forward to receiving the Committee's recommendations.  This will assist in facilitating informed decision-making for the future direction of funding for higher education.</p>  <p>  While the Committee are undertaking this important work, I have been working in the interim to secure additional funding for higher education.  This commitment is reflected in last week's Budget 2018 announcement in which the higher education sector will benefit from a total investment package of &euro;60m in additional funding in 2018.  This funding is on top of the &euro;36.5m that I secured for 2017 and which is being provided again in 2018.  In total, we will be investing &euro;100m more in higher and further education in 2018 than in 2016.</p>  <p>  This additional funding will allow for targeted initiatives in higher education including skills programmes, performance and innovation funding, technological university development and apprenticeship costs in the sector.  It will also allow for places to be provided for 2,100 additional students in 2018. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that an independent Expert Panel appointed by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) have reviewed the Recurrent Grant Allocation Model (RGAM) with a view to making recommendations on the most appropriate model for the future.  A Report on the review has been finalized by the Expert Panel and has been submitted to my Department for consideration. </p>  <p>  As set out in the Programme for Government, this comprehensive approach is being taken in order to achieve a sustainable funding model for the higher education sector going forward.  It will be important to build broad political and societal consensus in realising this goal and my Department and I continue to work towards that end.</p></reply>

These supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs continue to operate under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 - 2020, and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to that agreement.  As set out in the LRC proposals, the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant.  Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school/ETB.  When an employer has an SNA vacancy to fill, they must undertake the recruitment process in accordance with the provisions outlined in Circular 0042/2017 &ldquo;Recruitment of Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) &ndash;Supplementary Assignment Arrangements for the 2017/18 School Year&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  In addition, under the provisions of Circular 0042/2017, where a school/ETB has an additional allocation of SNA hours/posts, then that additional allocation of hours/posts must be offered to any existing part-time SNAs in that employment, in order of seniority, before the employer has recourse to recruitment. </p>  <p>  These arrangements give SNAs the alternative of redeployment instead of redundancy and give SNAs greater stability and a better chance of a full-hours contract, while at the same time ensuring that schools can continue to recruit SNAs with the right skills and experience to meet the needs of the children in their care.</p>  <p>  The arrangements are reviewed annually by the unions, school management bodies and the Department, with the assistance of an independent chairperson, and this annual review enables the parties to examine and resolve issues arising in the operation of the arrangements.</p>  <p>  On 5 July 2017, I announced that 975 additional Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) were to be allocated to schools over the period September to December 2017, a 7.5% increase in SNA numbers in order to meet the level of assessed demand.  This announcement brings the total number of SNAs to 13,990, representing an increase in the total numbers of SNAs of 32%, from 10,575 to 13,990 since 2011.   </p>  <p>  In addition, and as announced as part of Budget 2018, funding is being allocated for the recruitment of over 1,090 new Special Needs Assistants in 2018 (based on current forecasts), including some 130 posts which will be filled in the period between January and June next year, with the remainder being appointed from September 2018.  This brings the total number of SNAs to over 15,000.</p>  <p>  It is inevitable that redundancies will occur in individual schools, due to circumstances such as a special educational needs pupil moving to another school, moving from first to second level, or second to third level, etc.  However, overall and due to the significant increase in SNA numbers since 2011 and the introduction of the Supplementary Assignment Panel Arrangements, SNAs have benefited from greater stability in their employment.  I have no plans to amend the workings of the SNA supplementary panel to bring it into line with the panel which operates for primary school teachers. </p></reply>

My Department is not aware of the specific case of the school to which the Deputy refers.</p>  <p>  I might draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the final report of the Technical Working Group on teacher supply, &lsquo;Striking the Balance&rsquo;, which was published on 9 June 2017.  The report focusses on the development of a model of primary teacher supply, while outlining the work which will be required to establish a sustainable long term model of post primary teacher supply.  The report sets out an approach to planning the work necessary to develop a model for achieving a better balance between teacher supply and demand in the medium to long term. </p>  <p>  Officials of my Department are now considering how the development of a model can be progressed, from within available resources.  The necessary actions will include engagement with the HEA in order to ensure that the supply of teachers meets demand and there is the correct balance of teachers in each of the various subject areas at post primary level, including for modern languages, as well as measures to address data requirements, particularly at post primary level.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that a key commitment in my Department's Action Plan for Education is the publication of a Foreign Languages in Education Strategy.  This is a priority issue for me in the context of my goal of making Ireland&rsquo;s education system the best in Europe.  The Strategy recognises that to ensure a supply of graduates with foreign language competences for the education sector, there will need to be a greater uptake of foreign languages in higher education.  My Department is currently finalising the strategy, which, it is intended, will be published shortly.</p></reply>

In 2016 my Department assisted in 250 such cases.  Sadly, this number looks likely to increase in 2017 and could be around 300.</p>  <p>  My Department and its staff are well trained and experienced in the provision of such consular assistance, and the quality of the work carried out by officials in this area is highly regarded.  I am very proud of the achievement of my Department&rsquo;s Consular Directorate in being awarded the 2016 Public Service Excellence and Innovation Award in the Customer Service Excellence category.</p>  <p>  In cases involving the death of an Irish citizen abroad, my Department, and our Embassies and Consulates, provide assistance to families in a range of areas which can include liaising with local authorities on issues such as formal identification of the deceased and post-mortem examinations; assisting families to obtain death certificates and navigating local systems and processes; liaising with local police where the death is sudden or suspicious and an investigation is required; providing lists of reputable local English-speaking undertakers; assisting with the completion and filing of documentation required for the repatriation of remains; assisting families in contacts with insurance agents; and arranging for the storage and repatriation of personal effects of deceased persons.</p>  <p>  My Department does not provide financial assistance in such cases and has no budget provision for such assistance.  I am not aware of any country where the Government operates a scheme providing direct financial assistance to families who suffer a bereavement overseas, and there are no plans for the introduction of any such scheme here.  </p>  <p>  In many cases where a death occur abroad and the family wish to bring the remains home to Ireland, costs associated with repatriation of remains are covered by insurance policies. </p>  <p>  The importance of taking out comprehensive travel insurance is a message which my Department seeks to convey to Irish citizens at every opportunity, and we also ask all public representatives to share that message with their constituents where possible.</p>  <p>  In exceptional circumstances, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection can make an exceptional needs payment to a family to assist with funeral costs in Ireland, but this does not cover repatriation of remains from overseas. </p>  <p>  The Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust Fund (KBRTF), a private organisation which raises funds from the public, provides assistance with repatriation of remains, and my Department and the Trust often work together on specific cases as appropriate.</p></reply>

Decisions on the locations of the new missions were informed by the trade and investment strategy, &ldquo;Ireland Connected&rdquo; and consistent with forthcoming Asia-Pacific and Americas Strategies across government.  The locations for the new missions were identified on the basis of likely impact.</p>  <p>  Given the wide variety of local circumstances involved in establishing each new Mission and the need to consult with the host country Governments, it is not possible to provide further detail on the timetable for openings at this stage.</p>  <p>  The estimated cost of each mission will depend on a range of factors including staffing and accommodation.  The new missions will likely have from one to three staff from HQ with local support staff.  The &euro;2 million allocated in Budget 2018 will cover initial outlays incurred next year.  My Department will also need to ensure that the vital services infrastructure and policy support capacity at headquarters is adequate.  However, I anticipate that all necessary arrangements will be completed in a timely way.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will need to grow its presence in fast-growing emerging countries as well as deepen our market penetration in more developed markets and our diplomatic missions overseas will continue to be crucial in this.  The priority of my Department, as across government and state agencies, will be to support the growth of Ireland&rsquo;s share of international trade, employment and investment and the diversification of our markets where needed. </p>  <p>  Brexit is undoubtedly one of the most significant challenges the country will face in the coming years.  The Government has been clear that our priorities are to minimise the impact on our trade and economy; to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process; to maintain the Common Travel Area and to help shape the future direction of Europe.  The resources allocated to the expansion of our mission network internationally are an important strand in helping to mitigate the risks posed by Brexit to our economy including through diversification of trade with emerging markets and foreign direct investment flows.  At the same time, protecting our economic interests in terms of trade and investment with the UK will be a key priority. </p>  <p>  Our objectives also need to be pursued through seeking the best possible outcome for Ireland from the ongoing EU-UK negotiations on the UK's withdrawal from the EU.  To this end, the additional funding allocated in budget 2018 allocated to my Department for the Article 50 negotiations will support ongoing work by Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit teams in Dublin, Brussels, Berlin, Paris and London and at Ireland&rsquo;s missions across the EU, including through additional staff resources in due course.  These increased resources will also help to ensure our strong influence on the debate underway on the future of Europe where we will be seeking to ensure that the EU continues to deliver for our citizens as we address the many challenges of growing threats to the rules-based trading order in a globalised world.</p></reply>

This represents an increase of some &euro;26 million on the current year, and is the third consecutive year the Government has increased budget allocations to Ireland&rsquo;s Aid programme.</p><p>Just over &euro;500 million of the total ODA allocation for 2018 will be managed by my Department through Vote 27 International Cooperation, publically known as Irish Aid.  This represents a welcome increase of over &euro;13 million on the 2017 allocation to Irish Aid.  The further &euro;207 million is comprised of funding made by other Government Departments to multilateral organisations, such as that provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the World Food Programme, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development Cooperation budget.  </p><p>This significant investment in Ireland&rsquo;s development aid programme is a clear demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to making sustainable and manageable increases to the aid budget as resources allow. </p><p>On current projections for Gross Domestic Product (GNP), the 2017 ODA/GNP percentage will be approximately 0.3%. Using the GNP forecast for next year, it is expected that the 2018 ODA/GNP percentage should again be 0.3% - in effect maintaining the target at the expected 2017 outturn level.  </p><p>I am committed to a clear roadmap towards the achievement of the UN target of an ODA contribution of 0.7% of GNP.  Working with Minister Coveney and colleagues across Government, I would anticipate proposals in this regard in the first half of next year. </p><p>Our priority is to now use those additional resources to meet our commitment in the fight against poverty and hunger, continue to bring real and sustainable improvements some of the world&rsquo;s poorest communities and increase our response to the unprecedented level of humanitarian needs worldwide. </p><p>A summary of the percentage of GNP spent on ODA for the years 2007 through to 2017 are set out as follows:</p><p>ODA as  a Percentage of GNP 2007 - 2017 (Figures in &euro; Millions)<table><tr><th></th><th>Year </th><th>ODA as a % of Revised GNP </th></tr><tr><td>Estimate </td><td>2017</td><td>0.30%</td></tr><tr><td>Outturn </td><td>2016</td><td>0.33%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2015</td><td>0.32%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2014</td><td>0.38%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2013</td><td>0.43%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2012</td><td>0.47%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2011</td><td>0.50%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2010</td><td>0.51%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2009</td><td>0.54%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2008</td><td>0.59%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2007</td><td>0.53%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

It gave me the opportunity to hear from those working at the coalface with the undocumented Irish as to the current situation and the problems they are encountering on the ground. </p>  <p>  In addition, I met with a senior State Department official and used that opportunity to once again impress on the US administration the importance which the Irish Government attaches to a resolution of the plight of the undocumented Irish.</p>  <p>  I was able to further emphasise the Government&rsquo;s commitment to this issue when I travelled to Washington DC from 3 to 5 October and met with senior members of President Trump&rsquo;s administration and with members of Congress.</p>  <p>  I was pleased that Deputy John Deasy, the Government&rsquo;s Special Envoy to the US Congress on the Undocumented, who was appointed by the Taoiseach to that position last June, was able to accompany me to those meetings.  His appointment was another important statement of our intent and seriousness on this issue.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Taoiseach raised the issue when he spoke with President Trump by phone shortly after taking office and I know that the Taoiseach looks forward to having an opportunity to discuss this important issue with President Trump in more detail in due course. </p>  <p>  There can be no doubt, then, that the Government remains wholly committed to working with the US authorities to resolve the plight of the undocumented Irish.  The Government will continue to articulate to the US authorities our keen interest in this area while respecting the right of the United States to set its own immigration policies.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy of the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to pursuing these matters on behalf of our affected citizens in the U.S.</p></reply>

All health matters are private between a patient and his or her medical advisor and records in relation to any illness, including mental illness are, properly, not available to Departmental staff.  Similarly, when persons in the protection process die, their deaths are treated by medical personnel and/or the coroner in exactly the same way as any other person who passes away within the jurisdiction of the State.  The same procedures apply to protection applicants as to other persons who are not protection applicants.   </p>  <p>  While my Department collates some statistics on deaths of persons in the protection process, this is usually by way of a general knowledge of the cause of death, such as by way of information arising from the specified medical needs of the resident concerned.  In most cases, the deaths would have occurred outside of State-provided accommodation e.g. in hospitals or hospices.  While the HSE do issue death certificates, official records in relation to deaths are maintained by the Register of Births Marriages and Deaths, which is now under the aegis the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The Department has no access to death certificates, nor would it be appropriate under data protection safeguards for it to seek such access, and it is therefore not possible to provide the information sought by the Deputy.</p></reply>

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.  </p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.  Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification. </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  </p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015. </p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains a very high priority for me as Minister.</p></reply>

The review concluded that a revised District and station network commensurate with the organisation&rsquo;s resource base would best meet public demand.  In the case of certain stations, many of which were only open part-time and manned by a single Garda, the review determined that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.   </p>  <p>  As a result, the Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme was implemented, which resulted in the closure of some 139 Garda stations, including 9 in Clare and 8 in Limerick, and the amalgamation of 28 Garda Districts into 14 enlarged Districts.  In reaching these conclusions, I understand that Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  </p>  <p>  As a result of the Programme, communities have benefited from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which has enabled An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an improved policing service to the public.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.</p>  <p>  I recently published the second interim report of the Garda Commissioner, which recommended that the former Stepaside station in Co. Dublin be reopened on a pilot basis and indicated that, subject to further analysis, the Commissioner is likely to recommend in the final report the inclusion of the former stations at Leighlinbridge, Co. Carlow and Donard, Co. Wicklow in the pilot scheme.  If a second station is to be reopened in Dublin, the Report indicates that the Commissioner is likely, subject to further analysis, to recommend that the former station at Rush, Co. Dublin be included in the pilot scheme. </p>  <p>  I understand that work is ongoing in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to finalise the report and that it is expected to be received shortly, at which point it will be brought to Government.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government's focus is on increasing Garda numbers and ensuring that Garda&iacute; are appropriately resourced to protect and serve the community.  In this context, among the range of justice measures announced in the Budget, the Government committed to recruiting 800 additional Garda&iacute; and a further 500 civilians in 2018 together with continued investment of some &euro;6 million in new Garda vehicles in 2018 to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern and fit for purpose fleet.</p>  <p>  I am informed that in comparison to similar jurisdictions, Ireland is served very well by its ratio of police stations to population: </p>  <p>  - Ireland has 564 Garda stations (for approximately 4.7 million people); </p>  <p>  - Northern Ireland (2012) had 86 police stations for a population of 1.5 million people; </p>  <p>  - Scotland has 340 stations for 5.2 million people.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 2,400 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next three years in addition to the 2,000 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that there are currently 431 trainee Garda&iacute; undertaking training in the Garda College. </p>  <p>  The workforce plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014 that close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 39 were allocated to the Limerick Division.  I am also informed that another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  In addition to this, a further 800 Garda trainees are expected to attest in 2018. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Limerick Division in the coming years. </p>  <p>  In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p></reply>

The welfare response is delivered by the Garda Employee Assistance Service, Occupational Health Department, Human Resource Management and Local Management.  It includes various interventions including Critical Incident Stress Debriefing, Peer Support, Bereavement and Self Care Education.   </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner that the Garda Employee Assistance Service is available to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and supports them in managing and resolving personal and work-related difficulties.  In addition, there is an independent confidential help line and counselling service available to all staff within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This service provides all employees with immediate support from accredited counsellors, over the telephone and then, if needed, up to eight face-to-face counselling sessions.  These sessions take place in a location within one hour of the employee&rsquo;s home or place of work.  Counselling is provided on a wide range of work and personal issues including critical incidents, trauma, financial issues, relationships, bereavement, stress, conflict, and health.  The service is available on a twenty-four hour basis, every day.</p>  <p>  I also understand that there is a Peer Supporter Programme operating in each Garda District and that following a traumatic incident a peer supporter who has received appropriate training in helping colleagues cope with the effect of a traumatic incident in the workplace will contact the member(s) who were involved in the incident and  offer support.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Connecting for Life is Ireland&rsquo;s national strategy to reduce suicide 2015-2020.  Connecting for Life sets out a vision of an Ireland where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and wellbeing.</p>  <p>  A Cross-Sectoral Group comprising high-level representatives from Government Departments and key State agencies including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been established to support the implementation of Connecting for Life.</p></reply>

The least hazardous is Category F1 (party poppers and sparklers) and the most hazardous is Category F4. </p>  <p>  It is Government policy therefore, in the interests of safety and security, to restrict the availability of the more hazardous fireworks (i.e. categories F2, F3 and F4) to the general public.  These can only be imported, by way of licence, for use in organised displays  and conducted by  professional/competent operators.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Criminal Justice Act 2006 introduced new offences and penalties relating to illegal possession, sale and misuse of fireworks:</p>  <p>  - It is  an offence for any person to possess a firework with intent to sell or supply, without a licence,</p>  <p>  - It is an offence to throw an ignited firework at any person or property, and </p>  <p>  - It is an offence to light unlicensed fireworks in a public place.</p>  <p>  Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 amended the Explosives Act 1875 to give Garda&iacute; the power to make arrests in relation to the possession of unlicensed fireworks.  The penalties for these offences are very severe.  Having unlicensed fireworks in your possession with intent to sell or supply can result in a fine of up to &euro;10,000 and up to five years imprisonment.  Igniting the fireworks or throwing an ignited firework at a person or property is also liable to the same severe penalties.</p>  <p>  I believe that these offences and penalties are serving both as a deterrent and as an aid to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Leading up to Halloween every year, special efforts are made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.  I have asked the Garda Commissioner for a report on the measures being taken this year and I will write to the Deputy when it becomes available.  </p>  <p>  My Department also puts in place an annual public information  campaign in the days leading up to Halloween in the national newspapers to remind the public of the dangers of fireworks and the significant  penalties for their illegal use.</p>  <p>  Along with the placement of the notice in the national print media (this year from the 22 October to 31 October 2017 inclusive), general information and the notice itself will also be on the homepage of the Department&rsquo;s website, and the notice is being communicated using the Department&rsquo;s social media accounts.  </p>  <p>  The Department also liaises with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) who facilitate the Department by uploading a link to the notice to its website.  Scoilnet (a Department of Education and Skill&rsquo;s portal for Irish education) is facilitating the Department by uploading the notice to its website and placing it in their newsletter.  The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) has arranged to circulate a Link from my Departments website to all Local Authorities in the State to help publicise the dangers and illegality of fireworks with the general public.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>This plan is progressing apace.  This year, funding was provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding was been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. </p><p>I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the three strands of the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.</p><p>The area referred to by the Deputy is covered by the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Division.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the DMR North Division, on 31 August 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 666.  There are also<b></b>46 Garda Reserves and 38 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 105 of whom have been assigned to the DMR North Division, as outlined in the following table.  I am also informed that another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the DMR North Division in the coming years. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>The number of newly attested Garda&iacute; allocated to the DMR North Division since the Garda College reopened in 2014 is as set out in the table.<table><tr><th>Division</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>DMR North</td><td>19</td><td>34</td><td>52</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.  </p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.  Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification. </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  </p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015. </p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains a very high priority for me as Minister.</p></reply>

The carrying out of a valuation of a public utility undertaking (i.e. a global valuation') is the Commissioner's sole prerogative and I as Minister for Justice and Equality do not have any function in this regard.</p>  <p>  Global valuations of public utilities are carried out on a five-yearly cycle as provided for in the Valuation Acts, 2001 to 2015.  The initial round of global valuations was carried out in the period 2004 to 2006 following the passage of the Valuation Act 2001.  The next round of global valuations was carried out in the period 2009 to 2011 and the latest round commenced in 2014 and was completed in 2016.  I am advised that the global valuation process is also deployed in other common law jurisdictions and is an efficient mechanism for valuing public utilities with a national or regional network on a five year cycle.</p>  <p>  In the most recent round of global valuations, the Commissioner carried out a valuation of two public utilities in 2014 and seven public utilities in 2015.  The utilities, with their respective valuations, were: the Electricity Supply Board - valuation &euro;389,000,000; and Eirgrid - valuation &euro;774,000; in 2014.  In 2015 the seven utilities were: Gas Networks Ireland - valuation &euro;110,570,000; Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann - valuation &euro;8,930,000; Eircom - valuation &euro;84,700,000; Three Ireland - valuation &euro;27,750,000; Meteor Mobile Communications Ltd - valuation &euro;20,720,000; Vodafone Ireland - valuation &euro;41,000,000; and BT Communications (Ireland) Ltd - valuation &euro;7,240,000.  Two further communications utilities were valued in 2016 - RTE Transmission Network Ltd - valuation &euro;4,200,000 and Virgin Media Ltd - valuation &euro;28,000,000.  The changes reflected in these 2014, 2015 and 2016 valuations arise from changes in the rateable value of each of the respective undertakings since last valued in 2009, 2010 and 2011 respectively.</p>  <p>  The global valuation process relates solely to the network occupied by the particular public utility and used by it for its principal object or purpose, such as the supply of electricity or gas or the provision of telecommunications or public transport.  These global valuations cover all of the pipeline networks and systems of lines, cables, masts, posts, pylons, wires and other ancillary constructions which pertain to the use or development of the utility and which are necessary to get its products to the consumer.  It should be noted that the global valuation does not include the valuation of other properties such as retail units or offices or industrial space occupied by the public utility but not used by it for its principal object or purpose.  These other properties occupied by the utility are valued outside of the global valuation framework and in the same manner as properties occupied by other businesses. </p>  <p>  The basis of valuation of all rateable property throughout the State is 'Net Annual Value' (NAV), as defined in Section 48 of the Valuation Act.  This applies to both public utility undertakings valued on a global basis and conventional rateable properties such as shops, offices and industrial facilities operated by other businesses.</p>  <p>  The most recent global valuations issued by the Commissioner were in respect of the communications utilities RTE Transmission Network Ltd and Virgin Media Ltd on 5 September 2016.  Sections 53 and 56 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 require the NAV determined by a global valuation to be apportioned amongst rating authorities and the apportioned valuation to be reduced to rateable valuation ('RV') in the rating areas yet to be revalued.  This is a standard practice once a global valuation has been finalised. </p>  <p>  The Valuation Act 2001 provides for the application of a Discount Factor, which is a technical mechanism to be considered when the global valuation is being apportioned between the various rating authority areas in which the network's property is located.  Its application, if and where appropriate, is to take account of global valuations made and placed on an existing valuation list of a particular rating authority area before a revaluation has been carried out in that area (under Section 19 of the 2001 Act).  This is a transitional provision provided for in the legislation to ensure equity and uniformity across all valuation lists.  It is not arbitrary and is intended to reflect the relativity of the values on an existing valuation list to the NAV of the utility.</p>  <p>  Statutory Instruments were prescribed to apportion the valuations and to reduce them to make relative as required by Section 53 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015.  As part of the process, and as required by Section 53(8), consultation was carried out with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Following detailed consideration of an appropriate reducing factor, a factor of 0.002343 was adopted for the global valuations published in both 2015 and 2016.  The reducing factor only applied in non-revalued areas and thus excludes the City and County Council areas of Dublin, Limerick and Waterford which have been the subject of revaluation.  I am advised that it was considered that, outside of the Dublin area, there had been no movement in the commercial rental market between the global valuation dates of 2014 and 2015.  Therefore the reducing factor of 0.002343 was retained for the global valuations of RTE Transmission Network Ltd and Virgin Media Ltd, both of which had a valuation date of 2015 and which were published on 5 September 2016.</p>  <p>  The global valuation is apportioned pursuant to Section 53(6)(a) of the 2001 Act, between each of the rating authorities in whose areas property comprised in the global valuation is situate.  The apportionment is in the proportion, expressed as a percentage of the total population taken under the last published census of population.</p>  <p>  As regards the collection of the rates, under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates.  The amount of rates payable by a particular ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation ('ARV') decided annually by the elected members of each local authority.  Whereas the setting of valuations is the responsibility of the Commissioner, the annual setting of the ARV is a reserved function of the elected members of each local authority and the Commissioner has no function in that regard.</p></reply>

A number of scientific studies have looked at the specific issue of human disease and gulls (from the early 1980s on; the most recent in 2005).  While there is some evidence that wild birds (including gulls) may transmit salmonella to animal feed and drinking water and by this mechanism potentially lead to human infection, the evidence for this in each instance was considered weak.  Studies that have looked at the likelihood of direct spread of salmonella from gulls to humans conclude that gulls as carriers of Salmonella constitute little health hazard to human health concluding that there is only a low risk of transmitting Salmonella from either gulls or feed factories they may contaminate to humans or domestic animals.  </p>  <p>  The HPSC gathers information on the causes of outbreaks of infectious disease and for individual cases of infectious disease it collects information on individual risk factors (i.e. those factors known to contribute to disease development but not necessarily proven in the particular case being examined).  A look back for the last ten years by the HPSC, indicates that out of 25,000 reported cases of campylobacter and 3,500 cases of salmonella there have been three cases of salmonellosis that could be explained by bird contact (two of these were pet birds) and two cases of campylobacter, one of which mentioned proximity to gulls.  This means an association but does not mean that birds caused the disease.  </p>  <p>  In recognition of the serious and increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the requirement for a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to health issues, the Department of Health&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) established a high level National Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee to address this issue.  The Committee meets Ireland&rsquo;s requirements to have an intersectoral co-ordination mechanism for addressing AMR at the European level.  </p>  <p>  As well as work on enhancing surveillance between the health and agriculture sectors, the Committee&rsquo;s work in 2017 has overseen the development of Ireland&rsquo;s first National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2020.  This ambitious 3-year Plan has been jointly prepared by the two Departments in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders and covers the use of antimicrobial medicines in animal health and agriculture, as well as human health.  Following the World Health Organisation's Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (2015), which requires all countries to have a national action plan in place by mid-2017, Ireland's draft Plan lists Strategic Interventions and Activities, responsible bodies and priority rankings of timelines for implementation.  </p>  <p>  Ireland's National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2020 (iNAP) will be launched on Wednesday 25th October next.  The Plan will be launched by Minister Simon Harris TD and Minister Michael Creed TD, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine as the development of iNAP has been a cross-Departmental initiative, requiring a cross sectoral and whole of Government approach to addressing the world wide threat of AMR.  </p>  <p>  This ambitious 3-year Plan covers the use of antimicrobial medicines in animal health and agriculture, as well as human health - taking a 'One Health'  approach to tackling AMR, encompassing all sectors.  The Plan lists Strategic Interventions and Activities, responsible bodies and priority ranking of timelines for implementation.  An implementation plan will be developed separately which will address means of tackling AMR as appropriate to each sector.  </p></reply>

This evidence review examines the associated costs and benefits for the funder, provider and patient, the criteria for accessing the public funded service and the basis for these criteria in different jurisdictions.  </p>  <p>  An analysis of the HRB evidence review will feed into the development of policy options for a potential public funding model for AHR treatment by my officials.  This policy options paper will be presented to me by the end of this year and I will then submit these proposals to Government.  It is important to note that any funding model that may ultimately be introduced would need to operate within the broader regulatory framework set out in the AHR Bill.  </p></reply>

For specific travel advice, including information on vaccinations you should contact your G.P. or travel clinic as the HSE does not offer private vaccinations for travellers.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which is responsible for the regulation of medicinal products in Ireland, is aware of supply issues in relation to Hepatitis A vaccines.  These shortages are not specific to the Irish market and there are ongoing discussions at European level in relation to management of the shortages which have affected supply in a number of countries.  </p>  <p>  Based on the current information available to the HPRA, the current supply situation for the two vaccines is as follows:</p>  <p>  - Viatim (Typhoid Vaccine, Hepatitis A Vaccine, Purified Inactivated, for Adults) - Sanofi Pasteur Europe.  The company responsible for marketing the product (Sanofi) has advised that while the vaccine was recently out of stock in Ireland, it received a shipment of 10,000 units which was made available for sale in Ireland on the 10th October 2017.  The company has also confirmed that at present no further shortages or supply constraints for Viatim are expected for the remainder of 2017 or in 2018.  </p>  <p>  - Hepatyrix (Hepatitis A (inactivated) and Typhoid Polysaccharide vaccine (adsorbed) - GlaxoSmithKline (Ireland) Ltd.  This product has not been available in Ireland since approximately September 2016.  It is also out of stock in other markets.  The reason for the shortage is a combination of the company (GlaxoSmithKline) having insufficient manufacturing capacity to meet the increased global demand for Hepatitis A vaccine and also some manufacturing difficulties with the typhoid component of the vaccine.  At this time, the company is unable to confirm when supply will be restored.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-17a.758.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101700071#WRP02800"><p>The National Clinical Programme for Stroke (NCPS) has been in place since early 2010.  The vision of the programme is to design standardised models of integrated care pathways for the delivery of clinical care to ensure sustained quality clinical operational management.  Overall, the NCPS aims to improve quality, access and cost-effectiveness of stroke services in Ireland. </p><p>Some of the achievements of this programme in improving access to services to date include:</p><p><b>National 24/7 access to safe stroke thrombolysis </b></p><p>Emergency thrombolysis is provided to patients in all parts of the country, via improved hospital and ambulance protocols, health professional training and the appointment of new stroke physicians.  The national stroke thrombolysis rate has increased from 1% in 2006 to a rate of 12% (2016). </p><p>The NCPS has developed a number of initiatives including a telemedicine programme to allow delivery of expert thrombolysis therapy in smaller level three hospitals.  It has been involved in the training of over 250 doctors nationally to deliver thrombolysis therapy and has participated in a training programme for Stroke in the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. </p><p><b>Improved access to stroke unit care </b></p><p>Access to stroke unit care has been shown to improve stroke patient outcomes through reduced mortality rates, reduced dependency and shorter lengths of stay in hospital by patients.  Since the commencement of the NCPS, nine new stroke units have been opened, bringing the total number of stroke units in acute hospitals to twenty-two.  Two further stroke units are currently in development with a third at planning stages. </p><p>This is a major improvement from the first national stroke care audit report in 2006 which reported one stroke unit in the country.  However stroke units are typically too small and the recent national Audit showed that only half of stroke patients admitted spent any time in a stroke unit. </p><p>Admission to a stroke unit is a National Key Performance Indicator.  In 2016, 65.6% of Stroke patients were admitted to a Stroke Unit. </p><p>The HSE are considering the further development of Stroke Units in the context of the 2018 Service Plan.</p><p><b>Early Discharge of Stroke Patients</b></p><p>It has been recognised internationally that Early Supported Discharge of stroke patients from hospital improves outcomes, reduces need for long term care and increases acute hospital capacity by freeing up beds.  It is estimated the 10-25% of patients could benefit from an ESD service. </p><p>The programme has helped establish 3 small but effective ESD teams in Dublin and Galway.  In 2016, 137 patients were discharged to ESD services representing 15.6% of total stroke discharges. It is estimated that there was an average reduction in length of stay of 10.4 days per ESD patient. </p><p>Funding for increasing capacity in the three operational sites has been secured for 2017 with further funding secured to support the establishment of two further teams in University Hospital Limerick and Cork University Hospital.  Recruitment of these ESD staff is ongoing.  University Hospital Limerick is due to commence its ESD Service in the latter part of 2017. </p><p>As part of the phased introduction of ESD, the NSP has recommended a further 9 teams, to be established over a three year period and is under consideration in the context of the 2018 National Service Plan.</p><p><b>Emergency Endovascular Therapy &ndash; Thrombectomy </b></p><p>Thrombectomy is an emergency endovascular procedure that permits patients with severe strokes caused by clots occluding the major vessels of the brain and neck to have these clots removed using specialist devices.  HIQA has completed a Health Technology Assessment which found that this intervention is value for money. </p><p>Provision of emergency endovascular thrombectomy is available in Beaumont Hospital and Cork University Hospital. </p><p>To date, the number of patients undergoing this procedure has risen annually, on average almost 50% increase each year: 2015 = one hundred and twenty two cases, 2016 = one hundred and seventy two cases, 2017 &ndash; end of August = one hundred and fifty four cases.  These patients have been referred from 20 different hospitals around the country.</p><p>The expansion of thrombectomy is under consideration in the context of NSP 2018.</p><p>The Stroke Manifesto published by the Irish Heart Foundation has been noted and it will be one of the factors that will contribute to the ongoing policy development in this area.</p></reply>

Meetings with NHI have discussed a wide range of issues including the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, funding of Long Term Care, residential care standards, recruitment and workforce planning.  NHI was also represented on previous Working Groups chaired by the Department which considered the Care and Welfare Regulations and Towards a Restraint Free Environment in Nursing Homes.  In November 2016 NHI presented to the Interdepartmental Working Group established to oversee certain recommendations contained in the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I have had three meetings with the NHI, the most recent of which took place in September 2017.  A number of different issues were discussed, including nursing home charges, cost pressures, the recruitment and retention of health care assistants in the nursing home care sector and workforce planning and the implementation of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme review. </p>  <p>  The NHSS is a system of financial support for those assessed as needing long-term nursing home care.  Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  Under law each private and voluntary nursing home must negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  The process of setting prices with individual private nursing homes is commonly referred to as the NTPF pricing mechanism.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis. </p>  <p>  A Steering Committee was established to oversee and manage the pricing review.  The Steering Committee is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) and the NTPF.  External consultants Deloitte and Prospectus were engaged by the NTPF in June 2016 to assist in its review of the pricing mechanism.  Numerous stakeholders were engaged in this process, including NHI.  Work in this area is ongoing and well advanced. </p></reply>

The Deputy will be familiar with the background to the closure of both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes in February 2013.  Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,700 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.</p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Government's legislative programme for 2017 includes the Health (Transport Support) Bill.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that:</p><p>- There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p><p>- There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p><p>- Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and</p><p>- The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill were circulated to other government Departments and have been the subject of consultation between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  When the consultation with other relevant Departments has been completed, the next step will be to seek Government approval to the drafting of a Bill for the new Scheme.</p><p>It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.</p><p>Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.</p></reply>

Plans by the Department to establish an Obesity Policy Implementation Group for the National Policy and Action Plan are well advanced.  The first meeting of this cross-sectoral group is expected to take place this month. </p><p>A number of working groups will be established within this overall national oversight structure - including a technical one on food reformulation, which will also explore approaches to food portion sizes.  The establishment of this working group and its attributes (membership, Terms of Reference, date of first meeting, etc) shall be a function of the decision making process of the national Obesity Policy Implementation Group.</p><p>Ireland is actively involved in the EU Food Reformulation Project and is represented by my Department on the EU High Level Group on Nutrition and Physical Activity.  The EU High Level Group is agreeing EU targets for reformulation of foods and beverages with Member States across Europe. </p><p>In relation to FSAI's work in this area, it continues to sample a range of foods testing for salt, independently of the food industry, and post the information on its website . </p><p>It has analysed declared sugar and fat levels on labels of yogurt and breakfast cereal and presented these findings at the summer meeting of the Irish Nutrition Society.  A full report on this is due for publication in the coming weeks.  Independent testing of foods for fat and sugar content has not yet started as it requires the use of external laboratories and will be looked at in 2018 depending on resources. </p><p>FSAI has had periodic meetings with the FDI regarding reformulation in 2017.</p><p>In October 2016, the Department published a Health Rationale on the introduction of a tax on sugar sweetened drinks.  This document explored options for measuring and evaluating the impact of such a tax. </p><p>It specified that a high quality evaluation should seek to examine the impact of the tax on purchasing, consumption and associated health outcomes such as BMI; a review of sales data on all SSD classified products would inform how the tax would be shaped in future years; a review of ongoing population-based nutrition surveillance data, building on the Healthy Ireland survey, where additional data relating to SSD consumption and consumption of other food and beverage items would be included, along with other nutrition surveillance datasets; and a review and report on the levels and trends in the population would be important. </p><p>Furthermore, the report added that further research tracking public reaction and acceptability would be helpful.  This approach will be considered over the coming months to develop an effective methodology to monitor and evaluate the impact of the SSD tax, including its impact on reformulation.</p></reply>

The Council's submission and those of the respondents to the public consultation are available on my Department's website, www.health.gov.ie.  On foot of these consultations, I decided to proceed with the designation of two distinct professions under the Act, that of counsellor and psychotherapist.  Each will have its own register under one registration board.  This decision was communicated to the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, the relevant professional bodies and all the respondents to the public consultation process.</p><p>  I expect that the draft regulations to designate the professions and to establish the registration board will be ready for submission to the Houses of the Oireachtas in the coming weeks.  Subject to the approval of the Houses, the next step will be the appointment of the 13 members of the registration board following the submission of suitable candidates for my consideration by the Public Appointments Service.  I hope that the registration board will be in a position early next year to begin the task of drafting the various by-laws to allow it to establish its registers.</p></reply>

The report recommends the phased increased access to buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) for groups of patients in specific circumstances, subject to resourcing and the required legislation being enacted.</p>  <p>  Approximately 80 people currently receive suboxone for opioid dependence and are registered on the Central Treatment List (CTL) on an informal basis.  For the feasibility study, the CTL was required to set up, manage and maintain a separate national database for all clients in receipt of buprenorphine/naloxone treatment.  However unlike the CTL for Methadone this does not yet have a statutory footing. </p>  <p>  Drafting of new regulations to provide the same restrictions to the prescribing and dispensing of buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine only for opioid dependence as apply to methadone is at an advanced stage.  As buprenorphine has more &ldquo;every day&rdquo; uses than methadone (it is widely used as a painkiller both in the community and hospital settings) and is available in a wide variety of forms, the Regulations will need to ensure that the additional controls which apply to methadone do not interfere with the current use of buprenorphine for other clinical indications and avoid any unintended consequences. </p>  <p>  It is expected that the regulations will be finalised in the coming weeks.  The regulations will then be subject to the 3-month EU notification under the Technical Standards and Regulations Directive 2015/1535/EU.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;750,000 has been allocated to the HSE to facilitate the phased increase in the use of Suboxone this year.</p></reply>

I have also written to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in relation to this matter and to update on the procedure outlined above, given their support for the INHFA membership of RDP Monitoring Committee.</p></reply>

The European Commission indicated at the time, that it would need to conduct an impact assessment so as to ensure that any such increase would not cause any risk of distortion of competition and trade.  Minister of State Doyle also raised the issue of state aids flexibility, against the background of Brexit, at the recent Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in Luxembourg. </p><p>The European Commission launched an impact assessment on agricultural de minimis aid in July of this year.  As part of its assessment, the Commission is looking at a number of options including:</p><p>-  increasing the individual threshold limit of &euro;15,000, ranging from &euro;20,000 to &euro;30,000; and</p><p>-  increasing the national threshold limit, currently 1% of the annual agricultural output, by anything up to 2%. </p><p>The assessment will also examine whether the aid should be concentrated to just one or a few agricultural sectors; or, whether the aid should be spread evenly between all agricultural sectors. The baseline scenario is to maintain the ceilings currently fixed within Commission Regulation 1408/2013. </p><p>The Commission has set a target adoption date of April 2018 and I look forward to seeing the outcome of its assessment in due course.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-17a.1059.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101700077#WRV01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 434 and 435 together.</p><p>The introduction of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 provided for increased levels of penalties for animal welfare offences committed.  For major cases taken on indictment, the maximum penalty was increased from &euro;100,000 to &euro;250,000, with a maximum custodial sentence of five years imprisonment.  These penalties are in keeping with Irish jurisprudence and therefore I do not envisage further changes at this time.</p><p>Penalties imposed upon successful conviction vary at the discretion of the court, with the Act containing provisions that where an individual convicted of serious animal welfare offences may be banned by the courts from keeping animals, or indeed have the numbers of animals they may keep restricted. </p><p>The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 however has importantly changed the basis upon which animal owners must treat their animals and is specifically designed to allow early intervention in a much wider range of cases than the previous legislation allowed for.  Thus minor cases can be tackled before they escalate and the Act is a vehicle to encourage and educate animal keepers.  This new approach means that Authorised officers are addressing problems while they are relatively minor, reducing the risk of escalation.</p><p>Enforcement is a complex issue, so a progressive aspect of the Act is that it does not just focus on prosecution, which is only appropriate in cases where there have been serious welfare issues that can be clearly demonstrated to the courts.  The new enforcement approach reflects the need to intervene as early as possible in animal welfare situations.  This approach is aided by The Early Warning/Intervention System (EWS) initiative introduced by the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council involving, amongst others, my Department, the Irish Farmers' Association and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals which provides a framework within which farm animal welfare problems can be identified before they become critical or overwhelming.</p><p>The Act provides for Animal Health &amp;amp; Welfare Notices to be issued by Authorised Officers.  This means that minor situations can be addressed at an early stage and that encouragement, guidance and best practice are introduced rather than just punishment.  It also provides for Fixed Penalty Notices to be issued in minor cases and allows authorised officers to seize and re-home animals where the owner&rsquo;s capacity to care for their animals is being overwhelmed. </p><p>The provisions of the Act are enforced by Authorised officers of my Department, An Garda Siochana, officers of Customs &amp;amp; Excise and authorised officers of ISPCA and DSPCA, along with individual officers of the Turf Club.  This approach provides a large cross section of experienced officials whom are aware of welfare issues and can flag them up as and when they arise.</p><p>Cases Taken From 2013 - 2017<b>*</b></p><p>Taken  -  105</p><p>Current  -  29</p><p>Prosecuted  -  42</p><p><b>*</b>As the Deputy has requested figures covering the last five years, it should be noted that the Animal Health and Welfare Act commenced in March 2014 so some of the information in this reply pre-dates the Act.  The maximum ban on keeping animals handed down by the courts since 2013 is two years while the maximum fine incurred was &euro;6,000 plus costs.  The Deputy should also be aware An Garda Sioch&aacute;na may initiate cases independently of my Department.</p></reply>

The sample based on the Census of Population 2011 was introduced incrementally from Q4 2012 to Q4 2013.  The CSO's Employment in Agriculture Information Notice (June 2016) stressed that such changes in sample can lead to some level of variability in estimates, particularly at more detailed levels such as the above.  Therefore, the CSO says caution is warranted in the interpretation of trends over the period of new samples being introduced and particularly so for the Agriculture sector figures.</p><p>Food Wise 2025, the new ten year strategy for the agri-food sector published in July 2015 identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper.  Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p><p>If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy believes that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025: increasing the value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increasing value added in the sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion; and increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion. With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agri-food sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development.</p></reply>

There are some restrictions on planting land in designated areas and other environmentally sensitive areas.  There is also a restriction on the proportion of unenclosed land, Grant Premium Category 1(GPC1) planted, capped at 20% in any one application.  </p>  <p>  Our analysis, based on previous planting figures, is that by lifting this 20% rule there will only be a modest increase in overall level of planting.  This is also because  the definition of GPC 1 land has narrowed, reducing the amount of land in this category.  Also, the establishment grants do not cover the establishment costs for this GPC and annual premiums are much lower for the applicant.  It follows therefore that removing the restrictions on planting this category of land will not lead to a significantly greater regional spread.  However, my Department has held discussions with European Commission with the aim of  removing the 20% rule and a final position has yet to be reached by the Commission.  A further high level meeting between my Department and the Commission is scheduled for November 2017.</p></reply>

It is important to note that the non-farmer category also includes recently retired farmers and the family members of existing farmers and on that basis I am satisfied that the vast bulk of forestry payments remain in rural Ireland.  Reinstating the farmer/non-farmer forest premium differential is not an option being considered by the Department.</p>  <p>  The reintroduction of such a differential could only be achieved either by an increase in the farmer rate or a reduction in the non-farmer rate.  An increase in the premium rate for farmers is no guarantee of increased planting levels by farmers.  The other option of reducing the non-farmer rate to create the differential could impact significantly on overall planting levels.  This is borne out by planting figures in 2016 where the proportion of land planted by landowners classifying themselves as non-farmers was 36%. </p>  <p>  The Forestry Programme 2014-2020 will continue to pay the same premium to all landowners to ensure that the maximum amount of land is available for afforestation.  All lands proposed for afforestation are assessed to the same silvicultural and environmental criteria irrespective of who owns the lands.</p></reply>

I believe the existing provisions to pay landowners for areas left unplanted for environmental reasons are proportionate and adequate.</p>  <p>  Under the current Environmental Requirements for Afforestation, between 10-15% of the afforestation site must be treated with particular regard to biodiversity, comprising a combination of open spaces and retained habitats and this includes setbacks beside habitats, watercourses, setbacks beside public roads and archaeological monuments that are not planted. </p>  <p>  Up to 15% of this land set aside as Areas for Biodiversity Enhancement or ABE&rsquo;s as they are known are fully eligible for grant and premium payments.  </p>  <p>  Where the area within an application has many areas not planted for environmental reasons, the Department under the afforestation scheme is limited to only paying on that amount of the unplanted area that amounts to 15% of the total project area.  Situations do exist where, due to multiple sensitivities, the amount of area eligible for payment may exceed the 15% eligible area threshold, resulting in a landowner receiving a payment based on an area less than the gross area of the project.  However, these represent a minority of cases and often, with good design, these ineligible areas can be excluded from the afforestation application and left as part of the open farm enterprise. </p></reply>

The scheme which grant aids farmers to build private forest roads on their holding is important to enable the sector to fully mobilise the volume of timber in private hands.  </p>  <p>  Currently consent is required from my Department to build a forest road and in addition if the forest road requires a new entrance onto a public road planning permission from the Local Authority is also required.  Following some negotiation with the relevant Departments there is consensus to have a single consent system operated by my Department.  Following the commencement of the Forestry Act 2014 in May this year, my Department has been able to put in place an independent appeals mechanism which is an important step on the way to establishing a single consent system for forest roads.  In order for the single consent system to take effect, a legislative change is required to the Planning and Development Act and this is expected to take place in 2017.  This change in the regulations will facilitate the transfer of responsibility for granting permission for forest entrances from local authorities to the Deaprtment under the Forest Consent System.  It is expected that these changes will reduce the administrative burden on applicants and foresters alike when it comes to submitting an application under the forest roads scheme.</p></reply>

In the case of pigs and poultry, virtually all their nutrition is derived from compound feeds.  Ireland imports approx 2.8 million tonnes (2016 figures) of animal feed materials per annum and the total annual usage of feed materials is approx. 4.9 million tonnes.  Given our dependence on imported sources and the predominance of GM crops internationally, this has impacted on the volume of GM feed used on Irish Farms.  However, significant quantities of non-GM maize and oilseed rape meal are also imported from continental Europe, including Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Ireland, due to its high proportion of livestock production compared to tillage area, is especially dependent on feed imports relative to other EU Member States.  The pig, poultry and dairy sectors are particularly dependent on imports of GM soybean and GM maize by-products as these are essential ingredients in the formulation of these feed rations. </p>  <p>  The European Union is itself only 35% self-sufficient in high-protein supplement supplies for animal feed.  Soybean is the most favoured vegetable protein because of its nutritional efficacy and competitive cost.  A significant quantity of soybean and maize from North and South America, where GMO cultivation is widespread, is essential therefore to satisfy the protein requirements in animal nutrition within the EU. </p>  <p>  My Department supports increased domestic production of native protein crops primarily through the national coupled protein support payment.  Since its introduction in 2015, the area of protein crops, mainly beans, has increased from an average of 4,000 ha to 11,000 ha. </p>  <p>  Supporting the tillage sector is an important strategic objective of my Department.  Through a range of measures including access to low cost finance (SBCI loans), support for investment in efficient mechanisation (TAMS) and favourable tax incentives for land leasing upon which the sector is particularly dependent, have all been introduced to support the sector.</p></reply>

This will be Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the overall EU objective to reduce its emissions by the order of 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.

Using our banked emissions from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emission reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2018.  However, our cumulative emissions are expected to exceed targets for 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances.  While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis will be required to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required.

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005.

While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis will be required to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required.</p><p>In relation to Ireland's 2030 obligations, negotiations on a proposal to determine individual EU Member State targets to contribute to the overall EU commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% on 1990 levels by 2030 are ongoing.  The EU Council of Ministers agreed its General Approach on this proposal on 13 October.  I am satisfied that the Council's General Approach provides appropriate recognition of different Member State circumstances and the need to provide flexibility to reduce emissions as cost-effectively as possible in the context of the overall EU target.</p><p>With regard to Ireland's renewable energy targets, the EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demand from renewable sources by 2020.  Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter transport target also being legally binding.</p><p>While good progress has been made to date, with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) advising that 9.1% of Ireland's overall energy requirements in 2015 were met from renewable sources, meeting the 16% target remains challenging.  The SEAI has recently estimated that Ireland could fall short of our renewable energy target by between 1% and 3%.  Moreover, in a document entitled <i>Ireland's Energy Targets - Progress, Ambition and Impacts</i>(published in April 2016), the SEAI estimated that the cost to Ireland of not meeting our overall renewable energy targets may be in the range of &euro;65 million to &euro;130 million for each percentage point Ireland falls short of the overall 16% renewable energy target.</p><p>The Renewable Energy Directive provides a comprehensive framework for Member States to work towards achieving individual and EU renewable energy targets, including mechanisms for countries to work together such as statistical transfers, which allow Member States to meet their targets by purchasing credits from Member States that overachieve on their renewable targets.</p><p>The focus remains firmly on meeting our 2020 target and a number of interventions have been taken to support renewable energy, including the Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff supports.  New measures are also in development, including a Renewable Electricity Support Scheme and a Renewable Heat Incentive.  In any event, the cost of purchasing statistical transfers should any potential shortfall in Ireland's target arise has yet to be established and will depend on a number of factors, particularly the available supply and market costs.</p></reply>

Plastics feature across a wide range of applications and products, such as packaging, construction, electrics and electronics, agriculture, medical and health.  The last waste characterisation study carried out by the EPA showed that 12.4% of our household waste, by weight, was plastic.</p>  <p>  The effects of plastic pollution, in particular, on the marine environment has been well publicised.  My colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is responsible for marine environmental policy, including marine litter policy in the first instance.  Both he and I recognise that the waste we create on land, and certain plastic waste items, in particular, can represent significant marine litter problems.  Accordingly we are working together to identify measures to address this with our European partners in the context of the forthcoming EU Plastics Strategy.</p>  <p>  Other initiatives to combat plastic pollution include the National Litter Pollution Monitoring System (NLPMS) Report, which is commissioned by my Department on an annual basis.  It can be downloaded at www.litter.ie.  The Reports, over the past decade, demonstrate a generally positive trend with regard to litter.  Plastic can rings are not recorded specifically in these local authority NLPMS surveys but they are included with other plastic packaging items.  As a percentage of litter monitored, plastic packaging items increased from 6.56% in 2015 to 7.73% in 2016.  These increases are of concern to me and in 2017 I have taken further action focussed on the litter issue and have significantly increased funding for the Protecting Upland and Rural Environments programme, the An Taisce National Spring Clean, and the Anti-Litter and Awareness Grant Scheme.  My Department also provides funding to the EPA for the commissioning of research and has provided &euro;8.75 million for this purpose in 2017.  A number of studies on plastics have been completed through this funding stream.</p></reply>

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that to date approximately 1.5m or 65% of the 2.3m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband and this footprint is expanding.</p>  <p>  In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie.  This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area.  The Map is searchable by eircode by individuals seeking information.</p>  <p>  -  The BLUE areas on the Map represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering, or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,</p>  <p>  -  The AMBER areas on the Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of a procurement process.</p>  <p>  The premises referenced is within the AMBER area and will be covered by the State led Intervention.

A significant milestone in that procurement process was reached in September with the submission of "Detailed Solutions" by two bidders.  This is the last stage of the procurement process before receipt of final tenders and ultimate progression to the appointment of a preferred bidder(s). </p>  <p>  To improve both mobile and broadband services in rural Ireland in advance of the rollout of the high speed broadband network to be built in the State intervention area, I established, in July 2016, a Taskforce to identify solutions which can be implemented in the short, medium and long term to alleviate mobile phone and broadband coverage deficits, to identify priority areas for rollout and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers.  These solutions will enhance the existing services prior to the full build and rollout of the network planned under the NBP State led intervention.</p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.

Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal of waste are liable to a maximum fine of &euro;5,000 on summary conviction and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &euro;15 million on conviction on indictment and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years.</p>  <p>  My role, as Minister, is to provide the legislative and policy framework under which both local authority and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforcement action against illegal dumping is initiated.  Enforcement action against illegal waste activity is a matter for the local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement (OEE) of the EPA as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this arrangement, my Department encourages a multi-faceted approach to tackling the problem, incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education and, as such, provides funding to support the activities of a network of local authority waste enforcement officers.  In this regard, since the introduction of the local authority waste enforcement grant in 2003, Wexford County Council has received approximately &euro;3.2M.</p>  <p>  My Department has also introduced an anti-dumping initiative to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations.  Wexford County Council received funding of &euro;47,000 under the initiative this year to support twelve clean up, monitoring and restorative projects throughout the County.  In response to the hugely positive reaction from local authorities and communities since I launched this measure, I will be making a further &euro;1.3M available nationally to support its further development in 2018.</p></reply>

Of these 64,000, over 10,000 form part of eir's planned deployment to deliver rural high speed broadband to 300,000 premises between now and the end of 2018.  The remaining 19,000 premises in County Meath fall within an AMBER area and will be part of the State led Intervention under the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>The position in relation to the particular Meath areas referred to by the Deputy is as follows:</p><p>-  The map shows that the townland of Culmullin, Co. Meath comprises 31 premises and broadband coverage will be realised through a mix of commercial investment and through the State Intervention under the NBP.  Of the 31 premises, 28 premises fall within the State Intervention area including Culmullin National School.  The remaining 3 premises are part of eir's planned rural deployment.</p><p>-  The map shows that the townland of Balgeeth Co. Meath comprises 36 premises.  Of the 36 premises, 25 premises fall within the State Intervention area.  The remaining 11 premises are part of eir's planned rural deployment.</p><p>Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available from eir at .  Individuals can access this website to determine the connectivity availability status for their premises using their eircode.  The website also provides a list of retail service providers who offer services using high speed fibre network in the area.</p><p>With regard to the State led Intervention, my Department is engaged in an on-going procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll out a new high speed broadband network.  A significant milestone in that procurement process was reached last month with the submission of &quot;Detailed Solutions&quot; by two bidders.  This is the last stage of the procurement process before receipt of final tenders and ultimate progression to the appointment of a preferred bidder(s).

The new RESS will provide pathways for delivering on the 2015 Energy White Paper commitment to ensure communities and citizens are at the centre of the future energy transition in Ireland.  Communities are effectively being designed into the fabric of the new scheme and a comprehensive assessment of polices and support measures to increase community ownership from renewable electricity projects has been undertaken.  The most effective policies to increase community ownership and participation in renewable electricity projects have been assessed and examined within an Irish context.</p><p>Examples of some of these policies include a mandatory requirement for all renewable electricity projects seeking financial support through the new scheme to offer investment and/or ownership opportunities to the local community; the facilitation of grid access for community-led projects; a ring fencing of capacity (MW) for community-led projects; and the establishment of a national community benefits register.  Opportunities for smaller scale projects under a variety of local ownership models to get support will also be provided.  Furthermore, the Scheme will establish a network of trusted intermediaries who will act as independent facilitators between communities and developers to support community participation in renewable energy projects.</p><p>Micro generation, which typically involves an element of self-consumption and the selling of excess electricity to the grid, was also appraised as part of the RESS economic assessment.  The analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a support scheme for micro generation can be developed.  These include amongst others, a reform of network charges, an assessment of the distributional impact of such a policy decision on the PSO (cost burden sharing), and development of a fair tariff for exported electricity taking the benefits of self-consumption into account.  This approach is in line with experience from other EU member states who have attempted to introduce supports for micro generation.</p><p>I am committed to further exploring opportunities for supporting micro generation, as I believe that micro-generation will have an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a carbon free economy, in assisting Ireland meet its renewable electricity targets, and increasing social acceptance of and promoting renewable energy projects right across the country.  I have asked the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), on behalf of my Department to facilitate a workshop on micro generation, and this will take place this week.  All relevant stakeholders have been invited to participate with the end goal being the development of a policy position on how best to support micro generation in Ireland.</p><p>A public consultation on the design principles of the proposed new RESS was launched on 4 September and submissions are invited from the public.  All submissions will be considered and following on from this final public consultation, a design proposal will be brought to Government for approval.  Full details of the consultation are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: .</p></reply>

This is the same criteria that applicants are required to have completed by their GP when applying for the first time for a permit.

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  In this context no funding application has been received by the Department in relation to Dale Road.</p>  <p>  The economic reality of recent years has meant significant reductions in roads budgets across the board and this has resulted in some grant programmes being curtailed, including the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes, in order to protect funding for road maintenance and repair and this remains the position.</p>  <p>  While the Capital Plan 2016-2021 does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network it will take some years yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network.  There is, therefore, limited scope at present for funding for projects under either the Specific or Strategic Grant Programmes.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, Kerry County Council has been allocated &euro;1.4m in 2017 towards 3 Specific Improvement projects.  It is important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement local authorities in their spending in this area and it is open to Kerry County Council to fund work on this road from its own resources.</p></reply>

The Committee had an advisory and consultative role to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in matters to do with youth work, including the coordination of youth work programmes and services.  In line with these provisions, a new National Youth Work Advisory Committee was appointed by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with a term of office of one year with effect from 28 January 2013.  The Committee had its final meeting on 26 November 2013.  The Committee continued to work with my Department and assisted with the development of the new National Youth Strategy, in particular in identifying in what ways the youth work sector can contribute to shared policy objectives for young people.</p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020 was published in, 2015.  The implementation structures established by my Department under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures (BOBF), the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People oversee the roll out of the National Youth Strategy.  There is no doubt that the youth work services have a significant contribution to make to realise the goals of the National Youth Strategy as part of a cross sectoral, whole of society approach to supporting young people in their everyday lives.  For this reason, the key youth sector interests are represented on the structures established by my Department to support the implementation of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures.  At national level, representatives of the voluntary youth services have been appointed to the Advisory Council of BOBF.  At local level, youth sector representatives participate in the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees.  Key Government departments and agencies that have an interest in children and young people and that had served on the National Youth Work Advisory Committee are represented on the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium and on the Sponsors Group that have been established under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures to drive the effective implementation of the policy framework.</p>  <p>  There have been other significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services and the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee since the 2001 Act was passed.  These include the introduction of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 which, inter alia, provides for a statutory function for Education and Training Boards in supporting the provision and assessment of youth work services at local level.  The National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making 2015-2020, which was published by my Department in June, 2015 is particularly relevant.  I am deeply committed to ensuring that young people are involved in the preparation, planning and implementation of policies that impact on their lives.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is fully committed to the reform of the many youth funding schemes.  The Deputy will be aware that a number of targeted funding schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review in 2014.  The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead.  Work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the review.  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has commenced a review of the Youth Service Grant Scheme.  This review is intended to enhance its accountability, transparency and outcome measurement.  It is also seeking to determine how best to meet the ever evolving needs of young people.</p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the youth work sector, the voluntary youth services, the Education and Training Boards, other government departments and agencies and consults with young people themselves in the development and delivery of policies and services for children and young people.</p>  <p>  For the above reasons, it is not my intention to reconvene the National Youth Work Advisory Committee while the reform process is ongoing.  However, officials from my Department intend to facilitate a meeting with representatives of the youth sector with a view to agreeing objectives and identifying opportunities where my Department can best engage with the youth sector to ensure the best possible outcomes for young people.  Given the seismic changes which have occurred over the past sixteen years, my Department will be revisiting the Youth Work Act, 2001 on the conclusion of the reform process, to ensure that it fully articulates the needs of young people in Ireland.</p></reply>

These include universal (non means tested supports) of up to &euro;1,040 per year, and enhanced supports of up to &euro;7,500 to assist families to return to work and training.  All of the supports are equally accessible between community and private providers.</p>  <p>  The specific rules around the CCS schemes including eligibility has been constructed and layered to ensure that those most in need receive the highest level of subvention.</p>  <p>  My Department received a high volume of calls from parents looking to know where they could access the new universal subsidy.  A list of services that have signed the CCSP contract (which enables access to the universal subsidy) was added to the website for the convenience of parents and support agencies.  It was decided that to include all of the schemes to the list would confuse matters when the majority of the traffic to the site and queries related to the universal subsidy.</p>  <p>  I recognise the pressures on childcare providers and I have provided &euro;3.5 million towards 'non contact time' for all childcare providers who register for the enhanced childcare measures.  This, in addition to the &euro;14.5 million that has been already paid to childcare services so far in 2017 in recognition of the administration associated with ECCE and other schemes.</p>  <p>  My Department has also worked to enhance access to the schemes by changing the former CCS Private Scheme to the expanded CCS Plus Scheme through which community providers can opt to register children for holiday periods and children for the universal scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department is also working to streamline the registration process in consultation with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that our childcare subvention schemes meet the needs of children, parents and providers.  My Department will continue to review the CCS scheme and ensure that the rules are clear and well communicated.  I will take on board the detailed comments set out in correspondence and my officials will consider the issues raised and will respond in more detail to each issue raised.</p></reply>

I take it from the Deputy's question that he is seeking further clarification relating to Tusla's communications practice and protocol, as it relates to contact with clients and other parties.  The Deputy recently tabled a similar question relating to Tusla's complaints handling mechanism, and I set out in some detail the approach which Tusla is taking in this area.</p><p>Tusla is committed to following the twelve principles of Quality Customer Service, adopted by Government in the Irish Public Service Modernisation Programme, by developing and implementing best practice models of customer care, and promoting service user involvement throughout the Agency.  This concept is used as a guide in Tusla's <i>&quot;Tell Us: You Say, We Listen&quot;</i>complaints policy.</p><p>All policies developed by Tusla contain key messages for staff on how to interact with children and young people, and their families, in line with Tusla&rsquo;s core values of respect, trust and empathy.  Policies also provide guidance on when communication needs to take place and, in some instances, specific time frames are set out.</p><p>Tusla has recently appointed a new Head of Communications with responsibility for Tusla's corporate communications strategy.  In the interim, a number of measures have been put in place to effect more proactive internal engagement and engagement with external stakeholders, such as foster parents.  The new strategy, when fully developed, will include an External Communications Plan and a Stakeholder Engagement Plan.</p><p>Tusla aims to provide all children and families with a timely, proportionate and appropriate response to their queries.  If the Deputy has a specific issue on which he would like clarification, I would be happy to take this up with Tusla on his behalf.</p></reply>

The additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.  My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  These schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, amounting to &euro;10.65m in 2017, under which funding is made available on an annual basis to thirty national and major regional youth organisations.  This funding is intended to ensure the emergence, promotion, growth and development of youth organisations with distinctive philosophies and programmes aimed at the social education of young people.</p>  <p>  Scouting Ireland receives grant aid on an annual basis under the Youth Service Grant Scheme.  In 2017, &euro;876,337 was allocated to the organisation under the Scheme, a 5% increase over the 2016 allocation.</p>  <p>Over the past few years, Scouting Ireland has received significant funding outside of the Youth Service Grant Scheme.  The organisation was allocated &euro;150,000 in current funding in 2015 and a further &euro;200,000  in Dormant Accounts  funding in 2016 to support the Operation Lelievlet youth employment initiative.  It received &euro;49,630 under the capital funding scheme for youth projects and services in 2016 to   fund the improvement of disability access and security at Scouting Ireland.

It is important to note that the most important stakeholders in putting agreed pay structures in place in any sector are recognised employers and employee groups.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that trade unions are active in seeking to achieve a critical mass of representation on the employee side and welcomes this move.  My Department would also be supportive of any move on the employer side to establish a recognised representative body.  In terms of improving pay and conditions I have suggested to the sector that they could apply to the Labour Court for a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO), asking the Court to make a recommendation in relation to pay for the whole early years' sector.  Under a SEO process, organisations substantially representative of employers and employees come together to agree a way forward and submissions are sought from key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  It should be highlighted that my Department would have no role in relation to the SEO process, however, as a significant funder, and with policy responsibility for quality, my Department would be well placed to make a submission to the Court once it publishes its notice in relation to the matter of the application for a SEO for the sector.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff working in youth services and communities throughout the country.</p>  <p>  In 2017, &euro;57.4 million has been allocated in current funding to support the provision of youth services.  Budget 2017 and 2018  provided a total of &euro;7 million extra funding for youth services.  The additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.</p>  <p>  These schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, under which funding is made available on an annual basis to thirty national and major regional youth organisations.  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres.</p>  <p>  The Local Youth Club Grant Scheme supports youth work activities at a local level.  These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through the local Education and Training Boards.  Each year, in the region of 1700 local youth clubs are eligible to apply under the scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, I was pleased approve the establishment the Local Youth Club Equipment Scheme in 2017.  The primary focus of this scheme will be to assist volunteer led clubs and groups that work with young people in communities throughout the country.  The scheme will allow for the purchase of equipment for sport, arts, adventure and other much needed items. Some &euro;6.35 million has been made available nationally under this scheme.</p></reply>

I have forwarded the question to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and asked that they might correspond with you directly in this matter</p><p>-  To ensure the provision of a high quality service and to meet statutory requirements Tusla depends on having a sufficient number and appropriately trained workforce in place at national, regional and local levels.  Tusla Human Resources, through its Workforce and Recruitment work stream, addresses service delivery needs based on the job orders it receives. </p><p>Tusla employs approximately 3,615 whole time equivalent (WTE) staff and the vast majority of these are focused on responding to the needs of children and families at risk.  I wish to assure the Deputy that I am informed by Tusla that with the current available staff, all urgent and emergency cases are dealt with immediately.</p><p>More than 70% of Tusla's workforce are Social Work and Social Care staff.  Social Work staff must be professionally registered by CORU who independently verify qualifications and professional standing.  Tusla is engaging with key stakeholders to examine issues related to the supply and demand for these key grades and in addition is working to deploy multidisciplinary teams to overcome any difficulties in securing qualified staff while ensure a high quality service is delivered in line with statutory requirements.</p><p>I am also informed by Tusla that it is its policy to ensure that all staff are trained in child protection and Children First guidelines and staff attend a broad range of child protection training.  Tusla's<i>Continual Professional Development (CPD) Strategy</i>also aims to ensure that Tusla staff maintain up-to-date knowledge and skills as a foundation for professional practice.  The Strategy supports all Tusla staff, regardless of profession or grade, to engage in CPD activities in order to maintain their standards of proficiency and as a safeguard for service users and the general public, as required for professional registration.</p><p>-With regard to the Adoption Authority of Ireland, my Department works with the agency to sanction the recruitment of extra staff required by the Authority to meet its statutory requirements.</p><p>-With regard to Oberstown Children Detention Campus, my Department works closely with Oberstown and I am informed by them that there are sufficient and appropriately qualified staff for their areas of responsibility on campus at this time. </p><p>As additional streams of work emerge in the agencies, it is inevitable that, from time to time, temporary staffing shortfalls may occur.

Under the Child Care Act, 1991 and the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection.  The Agency is obliged to provide care for these children for as long as their welfare requires it.</p>  <p>  Children First National Guidance (2011) gives advice for notifying Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, of situations where abuse is suspected.  A range of professionals including teachers, nurses, early years educators, Garda&iacute; and other health professionals, who see children regularly, are in a good position to identify children at risk.  Where someone has reasonable grounds for suspecting a child is being, or has been, abused, they are expected to immediately contact Tusla.</p>  <p>  The Children First Act, 2015 places a statutory obligation on key professionals (mandated persons) to report concerns of harm above a defined threshold to Tusla without delay.  These provisions will be commenced on 11 December, this year.</p>  <p>  If a child is taken into care, their needs are given priority.  A social worker is assigned to a child placed in State care and has a duty to prepare and regularly review the care plan for the child.  Intrinsic to this process is ensuring that the wishes of the child are listened to, and if appropriate, Tusla may assist them in establishing residency.</p>  <p>  Unaccompanied asylum seeking children are placed in care and have their needs assessed, and are allocated a social worker.  </p>  <p>  As of the end of July, Tusla had received 20 young people under the Calais Special Project.  The young people were taken into the care of Tusla, and are receiving dedicated support and services, including medical and educational supports.  Before travelling to Ireland, these young people were screened by the Garda&iacute; and Department of Justice officials, and their residency status was approved.</p>  <p>  Children who, with their parents, live in Direct Provision, are provided with welfare supports as required.  Tusla have seconded an experienced social worker to the Department of Justice and Equality to liaise directly between Direct Provision and Tusla services.</p></reply>

The key principle of the Children Act 2001 is that detention of a child should only be imposed as a last resort.  When children come into contact with the criminal justice system there is an emphasis on the promotion of community based options in the first instance.  The Irish Youth Justice Service oversees a significant investment in community based programmes to divert young people from further involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  In 2017, approximately &euro;14 million was allocated by the Department of Justice and Equality to the Irish Youth Justice Service to administer Garda Youth Diversion Projects and a number of other youth diversion community-based projects.  These projects also benefit from support under the European Social Fund.</p>  <p>  My Department provides funding to the Irish Youth Justice Service for services relating to the Oberstown Children Detention Campus (Oberstown) and the Bail Supervision Scheme which has recently been established on a pilot basis.</p>  <p>  The Bail Supervision Scheme provides more therapeutic supports in the community for children who are subject to bail conditions.  The service provides a &lsquo;wraparound&rsquo; service to the young person and their family with a prescribed reporting system back to the courts through the appropriate statutory bodies; Probation Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Oberstown.  The scheme offers greater options to the courts in the knowledge that closer monitoring will take place through interaction with the young people, their families and communities.</p>  <p>  If a child is remanded or sentenced to a period of detention in Oberstown, a range of rehabilitative supports are offered to every child as part of an overall programme, which focuses on the child&rsquo;s individual needs and provides the framework for each child&rsquo;s individual journey through detention.  The focus is on developing supportive relationships with the main emphasis placed on education and rehabilitation.</p>  <p>  The wide range of rehabilitation, education and support services provided and supported by the Irish Youth Justice Service are detailed in the Tackling Youth Crime: Youth Justice Action Plan 2014 &ndash; 2018, and a progress report covering the period 2014 to 2015 has been published and is available on my Department's website.  A progress report covering the period of 2016 is currently being prepared.</p></reply>

These provide, inter alia, for the welfare of the child, the care practices, care records, accommodation and safety precautions.  Children, depending on their identified needs, may be placed by their social worker in foster care either with relatives or general foster carers, in residential care, high support or special care or other placement types.  The majority of children are placed in long term stable placements and currently over 92% of children are placed in foster care.  A key part of the social worker role is to ensure the quality and safety of the child's placement, and to meet with the child on a one to one basis on all visits.  There are safeguards surrounding each child care placement, whether foster or residential care and all placements are supervised by a professionally qualified social worker.</p>  <p>  All foster care services and statutory residential centres are subject to  inspection by the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA) and private and voluntary residential centres are inspected by Tusla against National Standards.  These inspection reports of children's residential centres, fostering services and child protection services are also reviewed and analysed by my officials.  The overview of these reports provides me with a level  of assurance on the overall capacity of Tusla to identify and provide services to families and children who are at risk.</p>  <p>  Within its national office, Tusla, has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team.  This team produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, including detailed reporting on child safety and protection services.  Tusla also provides me with information on children in care, their placement type, care status and allocation of social workers.  Within my Department there is a Unit which scrutinises these reports and briefs me and senior officials on issues of note.  The reports also provide statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlights challenges and areas where further improvement is required, such as the recruitment of additional social workers.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department meet Tusla management on a regular basis to review the level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement.

My Department provides funding to Kildare Youth Services under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme in respect of six local youth projects in Athy, Naas, Leixlip, Newbridge, the Curragh and Kildare town and a Youth Information Centre in Naas.</p>  <p>  In addition, I was pleased to approve the establishment the Local Youth Club Equipment Scheme in 2017.  The primary focus of this scheme will be to assist volunteer led clubs and groups that work with young people in communities throughout the country.  The scheme will allow for the purchase of equipment for sport, arts, adventure and other much needed items.  Some &euro;6.35 million has been made available nationally, of which more than &euro;230,000 has been allocated in respect of clubs and groups operating in Kildare and Wicklow.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by almost 80 private transport operators.  There are approximately 894,000 customers in receipt of free travel. </p>  <p>  Persons resident in Ireland who are over 66 and persons in receipt of certain social welfare payments are eligible for the scheme.  The social welfare payments that allow persons aged under 66 to a free travel pass include disability allowance, invalidity pension, carer&rsquo;s allowance and partial capacity benefit.  Disability allowance and invalidity pension are both long term illness payments, and so people in receipt of those payments will already have eligibility.</p>  <p>  People may claim illness benefit for up to 2 years.  People on illness benefit do not receive the free travel pass.  However, a person who has been in receipt of illness benefit for at least 12 months and who most likely will be incapable of work for at least another 12 months, or who may be permanently incapable of work, may apply for invalidity pension which is a qualifying payment for the free travel pass.</p>  <p>  The information sought by the Deputy on the estimated full year cost of providing all persons in receipt of long term illness payments with a free travel pass is not available to my Department.  Any such cost would manifest itself in the form of requests for increased funding by transport providers, based on increased numbers using the scheme on their service, and so would depend on a number of factors including the type of travel pass issued (e.g., single or companion pass), the number of journeys made using the free travel pass, the prevailing fares, and the type of journeys undertaken, i.e., rail, bus or Luas.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Government is very aware that communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen and participants have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing this valuable work in their local communities.  In recognition of this fact, an additional 250 RSS places were announced last week as part of Budget 2018.</p><p>To remain eligible to participate on the RSS, an individual must continue to maintain an underlying entitlement to Farm/Fish Assist.  This ensures that only those in need of income support for their farming/fishing enterprise benefit from the scheme.  Thus, the rate of payment made to a participant can be reviewed at any stage to ensure that they continue to be eligible and that they receive their correct entitlement.  This practice has been in place since the commencement of the scheme and applies to all participants on the scheme regardless of their location.</p><p>Table 1<b></b>gives a breakdown by county of the number of RSS participants at end September 2017 and a breakdown of the RSS reviews for the period Jan-end Sept 2017.  </p><p>This table clearly indicates that participants on the RSS in all counties have been subjected to review, where appropriate, to ensure continuing entitlement to the scheme in accordance with the rules underpinning it.  </p><p><b>Table 1</b><table><tr><th><b>County</b></th><th><b>No. RSS participants at end Sept 2017</b></th><th><b>No. of Reviews in 2017 </b><br /><br /><b>(Jan &ndash;30th Sept)</b></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>18</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>80</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>140</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>179</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>244</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>317</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>293</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>24</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>14</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>21</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>105</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>87</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>57</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>12</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>583</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>20</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>41</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>49</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>149</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>136</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>67</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>13</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>42</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>39</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>22</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><b>Grand Total</b></td><td><b>2752</b></td><td><b>169</b></td></tr></table></p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A person should have paid social insurance contributions before the age of 56 and, for a person reaching state pension age after 6 April 2012, should have a minimum of 520 paid contributions.</p>  <p>  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life, from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age, are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Contributions can be paid on income from insurable employment or self-employment.</p>  <p>  Employees who have gaps in their social insurance record where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods of unemployment or illness, may be awarded credits which are taken into account in assessing the level of entitlement to State pension.  Alternatively, where an individual is no longer paying PRSI as an employed or self-employed contributor, they can pay voluntary contributions, provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions of the scheme.  The payment of voluntary contributions helps to protect future entitlement to State pension as they are also taken into account in determining the level of pension entitlement.</p>  <p>  Where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative means-tested supports.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, a person may qualify for a means-tested increase for a qualified adult which is up to 90% of a full rate contributory pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p>  <p>  If a person has taken time out of the workforce on caring duties, they may have access to the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme.  Under the Homemaker's Scheme, any years that a person spent as a homemaker (since 6 April 1994) are disregarded when working out their yearly average contributions for a contributory State pension.  This may result in their qualifying for a higher rate of payment.</p></reply>

The programme aims to provide them with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement.  </p><p>YESS will be open to jobseekers and other eligible cohorts who are aged between 18 and 24 and have been out of work and in receipt of a qualifying payment for at least 12 months or, if unemployed for less than 12 months, are considered by a case worker to face a significant barrier to work.  </p><p>Candidates must be in receipt of one of the following qualifying payments: Jobseekers Allowance, Jobseekers Benefit, One Parent Family Payment, Jobseeker Transition Payment, Disability Allowance, Blind Person&rsquo;s Pension, Supplementary Welfare Allowance; or signing for Credits.</p><p>Although people will be encouraged and supported to avail of suitable placements, participation on YESS will be entirely voluntary &ndash; there will be no financial penalties for jobseekers who do not wish to participate or who do not complete a placement. </p><p>There will be clear eligibility requirements for host organisations wishing to participate in the programme.  They will be required to sign up to Terms and Conditions when they advertise a placement.</p><p>The standard duration of the work experience programme will be 3 months, with an option to extend the placement further to 6 or 9 months following a review of progress by a Departmental case worker.  The attendance requirement will be 30 hours per week.  Participants will receive a weekly payment equivalent to the net minimum wage which represents a very significant increase on their underlying payment. </p><p>A designated case worker will liaise with the participant and the host organisation throughout the period of the placement, to monitor how well it is progressing for both parties and to provide appropriate advice and support.  </p><p>Clearly defined learning and development outcomes for each placement will be identified, with a focus on &lsquo;soft&rsquo; (employability) skills as well as any specific &lsquo;hard&rsquo; skills that will be acquired and/or demonstrated during the placement.

First, that it should ensure that work pays, and second, that it should have a positive effect on reducing child poverty.  To advance the commitment contained in the Programme for Partnership Government, the Department established an internal working group and an Inter-Departmental Group of the relevant Government Departments to consider proposals. </p>  <p>  As part of this process the Department carried out an extensive analysis of its existing range of supports that are aimed at assisting individuals to take up employment.  The analysis showed the existing in-work supports are very effective, and work well in assisting individuals make the transition from unemployment into employment. </p>  <p>  These findings are confirmed by the ESRI&rsquo;s research into the Department&rsquo;s existing in-work measures, and Eurostat figures, which show that the parental in-work poverty rate in Ireland is 5.8%, significantly below the EU 28 average of 11.2%.  This is in large part due to the Department&rsquo;s in-work supports such as Family Income Supplement and the Back to Work Family Dividend.</p>  <p>  Consequently, the analysis carried out by the working group did not support the need for the establishment of a new scheme.  In the context of Budget 2018 it was decided to re-designate the Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme as the Working Family Payment (WFP), which will bring it more visibility as a payment aimed specifically at working families.  The new name better reflects the nature of the payment and the Department would encourage families to look into seeing if they are eligible for the payment.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the working hours requirement associated with qualification for payment of the WFP, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  This &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; eligibility criterion has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme in 1984, from 30 hours per week to 19 hours per week in 1996.  It is important, however, to ensure that the WFP does not inadvertently subsidise unsustainably low earnings or encourage employers to offer minimal hours of employment. </p>  <p>  For low-income workers with less than the minimum hours of employment for the WFP and working on a casual basis up to and including 3 days per week, the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme provide in-work income support through daily disregards and tapered withdrawal of payments.  Individuals on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit can also work up to 3 days per week.  For each day they work they lose a proportionate reduction in their jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment.</p>  <p>  If a person cannot meet the 19 hours WFP threshold the Department offers a number of other schemes, which can provide income support that can be combined with earnings from employment, subject to each individual&rsquo;s circumstances.  These include jobseekers allowance and benefit (which permit an element of casual work), disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance, the one-parent family payment, jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment and the part-time job incentive scheme.  Combined, the Department provides an extensive system of social welfare support, which facilitates recipients taking up some employment while maintaining their social welfare payment. </p>  <p>  Given all of the above there are no plans to reform the operation of the WFP in terms of the number of hours work required to qualify for payment.</p></reply>

It provides employers with two levels of payment - &euro;7,500 or &euro;10,000 - over two years, paid in monthly instalments, provided the employment is maintained.  The &euro;7,500 rate is paid to employers that recruit workers who have been on the Live Register for between 12 and 24 months.  The &euro;10,000 rate is paid to employers that recruit workers who have been on the Live Register for more than 24 months.</p><p>My Department recently conducted a Focused Policy Assessment of JobsPlus which  highlighted that workers over the age of 50 are under-represented on the scheme.  To address this, I have announced an enhancement to the scheme to encourage businesses to employ older workers.  From 1<sup></sup>of January 2018, employers that recruit workers who are on the Live Register for over 12 months and are over the age of 50 will be paid at the higher rate of &euro;10,000. </p><p>Currently, just over 10% of JobsPlus employees are over 50.  It is envisaged that this change will increase the percentage of employees in this age category to between 20% and 25% over the coming years.</p><p>The budget allocated to JobsPlus in 2018 will be &euro;30 million.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The company manages the website , develops packages and marketing material, prints brochures, collates visitors data and works with tourist trade operators to promote and package Inishowen as a 'must see' holiday destination.

Entitlement levels to the State Pension, contributory (SPC), which is financed by PRSI on a pay-as-you-go basis, are calculated by means of a &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life.  Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20 will qualify for a pension at 85% of the full rate.  The intention of this, as in the contributory pensions which exist in other European countries and elsewhere, is to incentivise and reward contributions into the fund which finance that pension, by means of higher pension entitlements.  Those with relatively lower contributions are more likely to be paid under alternative pensions, where they will attract a higher rate of payment.</p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of SPC easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension.  It is estimated that backdating it in respect of periods before its introduction in 1994 would cost some &euro;290 million per annum in 2017, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the overall rise in the cost of State pensions.</p>  <p>  Where people do not qualify for a maximum-rate SPC in their own right, the social protection system provides other ways of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Where their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  This is paid directly to them, and is subject to a personal means-test.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a State Pension (non-contributory), based on their household means, amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.  There are very significant income and capital disregards in the means tests for these payments, which result in the large majority of payees &ndash; most of whom are women &ndash; being paid at the maximum rate.  Where a person is a widow/widower, they will generally qualify for a full 100% rate pension, based on either their own PRSI or on that of their late spouse or civil partner.</p>  <p>  The average pension payments made by my Department to men and women over 66 years of age are within 1% of each other approximately, and this results in very similar outcomes for older men and women in avoiding poverty.  The most recent CSO figures for Consistent Poverty indicated that 2.6% of women over 65, and 2.9% of men over 65, are in consistent poverty, which is less than a third that of the general population.  Eurostat figures also show that men and women over 65 are less likely to be at risk of poverty and social exclusion in Ireland than in the EU as a whole, with the gap in outcomes between men and women being significantly narrower in Ireland than most countries.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) will replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of women who have gaps in their contribution records as a result of caring duties, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. </p>  <p>  Officials in the Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA proposal.  It is then intended to have a public consultation later this year, and this will provide an opportunity for people to submit their views on the priorities in the design of this proposal.  Following the consultation period, I will submit a proposal to Government seeking approval for the new approach, and then proceed to introduce legislation to give effect to this reform. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

Therefore, self-employed people are not eligible for the WFP. </p><p>The rationale for not extending eligibility for the WFP to include self-employed persons includes:-</p><p>- the practical difficulties in defining and controlling an alternative to the hours worked condition;</p><p>- the difficulty in establishing satisfactorily a self-employed person&rsquo;s hours of employment and certifying this on an ongoing basis;</p><p>- existing arrangements to provide income support to self-employed people on low incomes, such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and farm assist for low-income farmers; </p><p>- the cost of extending the scheme to the self-employed, which would be considerable. </p><p>Any extension of the WFP to other categories of persons, such as the self-employed, would have to be considered in a budgetary context.  There are no plans for such an extension in present circumstances.</p><p>However, I would bring the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the Back to Work Family Dividend, which helps families to move from social welfare into employment, including self-employment, by retaining their qualified child increase for up to two years.  There are currently 8,156 families in receipt of the dividend, of whom 124 are in self-employment.</p></reply>

The total employer debt to the SIF at 31 December 2016 stood at &euro;462 million. </p><p>A comprehensive analysis on the trading status of all companies and businesses with a debt to the Social Insurance Fund was completed in April 2017.  Approximately 13,400 individual employers owe a debt to the Social Insurance Fund.  </p><p>A total of 9,305 of Irish registered companies account for the vast majority of employer debt (91%).  The profile of these indebted companies indicates that the majority (63%) are either dissolved or are in the process of being wound up through receivership or liquidation.  These account for almost &euro;345 million of the total debt. </p><p>A third of indebted companies (c 3,450) has filed annual returns in recent years and are categorised as &ldquo;normal&rdquo; by the Companies Registration Office.  These companies account for c &euro;72 million of employer debt. While these companies continue to exist as a legal entity, it does not necessarily mean that they are trading.</p><p>A further 4,093 indebted employers are classified as sole traders and partnerships.  These account for just over &euro;41 million in employed debt (9% of the total). There is no central information source on the trading status of these non-registered businesses.</p><p>The Department has a dedicated debt management team in the redundancy and insolvency section which has responsibility for managing employer debt in line with the Department&rsquo;s debt management policy.  The team engages directly with employers who are categorised as normal, and with the non-registered sole traders and partnerships, with a view to recovering debt.  The team makes contact with these employers to establish their financial position and ability to repay the debt in full or as part of an agreed debt repayment plan.  In these cases the Department is mindful that an overly aggressive process in pursuing debt with employers that are still trading, but are nevertheless in a financially precarious position, might result in those companies being pushed into an insolvency situation which could result in further job losses.  Accordingly the unit engages with employers to establish the situation on a case by case basis and seeks to recover debt on a mutually agreed basis, including setting up repayment by instalment where appropriate.</p><p>A total of &euro;10.7 million in funds paid out of the SIF to cover redundancy related payments was recovered by the Department in 2016.  Approximately 400 employers are continuing to repay debt by instalment arrangements.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners have a Memorandum of Understanding which governs the exchange of all information between the two bodies, including all redundancy and insolvency scheme liaison and communication.  A copy of this Memorandum of Understanding, entitled &ldquo;Memorandum of Understanding on co-operation and mutual assistance between the Department of Social Protection and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo; will be forwarded to the Deputy.</p><p>The employer PAYE number provided by the Revenue Commissioners is primarily used to identify a company or business which is subject to redundancy or insolvency.  The Department&rsquo;s main source of information on the status of companies with debt is from the Companies Registration Office (CRO).  </p><p>The following tables give a breakdown of employer debt owed by &lsquo;normal&rsquo; companies and sole traders/partnerships.</p><p><b>Table 1-Breakdown of employer debt with trading status as &ldquo;normal&rdquo; per CRO</b><table><tr><th><div>Amount</div></th><th><div>Number of Employers</div></th><th><div>Total Debt</div></th></tr><tr><td>Less than &euro;10,000</td><td><div>1,818</div></td><td><div>&euro;8,267,096</div></td></tr><tr><td>&euro;10,000 - &euro;50,000</td><td><div>1,331</div></td><td><div>&euro;29,319,633</div></td></tr><tr><td>&euro;50,000 - &euro;100,000</td><td><div>192</div></td><td><div>&euro;13,169,947</div></td></tr><tr><td>&euro;100,000 - &euro;500,000</td><td><div>110</div></td><td><div>&euro;19,821,468</div></td></tr><tr><td>&euro;500,000 - &euro;1m</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>&euro;577,989</div></td></tr><tr><td>Greater than &euro;1m</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>&euro;1,079,418</div></td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td><div>3,453</div></td><td><div>&euro;72,235,552</div></td></tr></table><b>Table 2-Breakdown of employer debt of non-registered companies (eg sole traders)</b><table><tr><th><div>Amount</div></th><th><div>Number of Employers</div></th><th><div>Total Debt</div></th></tr><tr><td>Less than &euro;10,000</td><td><div>2,944</div></td><td><div>&euro;12,264,920</div></td></tr><tr><td>&euro;10,000 - &euro;50,000</td><td><div>1,047</div></td><td><div>&euro;20,772,037</div></td></tr><tr><td>&euro;50,000 - &euro;100,000</td><td><div>83</div></td><td><div>&euro;5,848,422</div></td></tr><tr><td>&euro;100,000 - &euro;500,000</td><td><div>19</div></td><td><div>&euro;2,664,881</div></td></tr><tr><td>&euro;500,000 - &euro;1m</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Greater than &euro;1m</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td><div>4,093</div></td><td><div>&euro;41,550,260</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

It is expected that the TCA will replace the yearly average approach for new pensioners from around 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation, which will take a number of years to complete.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of women who have gaps in their contribution records as a result of caring duties, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. </p>  <p>  Data from the independent actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund is currently being analysed to cost options for the new approach.  Following that analysis, a paper will be prepared, outlining and costing various alternatives, including, as promised, options regarding homemaker periods.  My Department will then conduct a period of consultation with relevant stakeholders, providing them with information and requesting that they outline what they consider should be the priorities in this reform.  After the consultation period, I will submit a proposal to Government seeking approval of the new approach.  Following a Government decision, legislation will be prepared for consideration by the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

YEI funding is reserved for use in those regions, including Ireland, where youth unemployment levels exceeded 25% during the reference year of 2012.  The specific YEI funding allocation for Ireland of &euro;68m is matched by equal amounts from our European Social Fund (ESF) allocation and from the Exchequer, giving an overall allocation of &euro;204m. </p>  <p>  The YEI is integrated into ESF programming and is being delivered in Ireland as a dedicated priority axis within the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020.  This programme is managed by the ESF Managing Authority, within the Department of Education and Skills.  Seven actions were originally selected for YEI funding, namely the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance; JobBridge; JobsPlus Incentive Scheme; T&uacute;s; Youthreach, Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme and Momentum.  These actions are underway and are being fully funded up-front by the Exchequer.  </p>  <p>  I am informed that while no application has been made to date to the EU Commission in respect of the YEI, it is expected that the European funding will be fully drawn down.  The ESF Managing Authority and the Operational Programme Monitoring Committee (PMC) maintain an ongoing overview of the funding allocations under the PEIL and re-allocate the available funding as required, in accordance with the EU Regulatory provisions.  In this regard, the PMC has agreed in principle to the further inclusion of the Community Training Centres, which are funded by the ETBs in consultation with SOLAS, as an approved activity under the YEI with effect from 1 January 2017.   </p>  <p>  The ESF Regulations provide for initial pre-financing/advances of EU support at 1% (or 1.5% for Member States under financial assistance in 2014 and 2015) of the full programme support, payable for each year from 2014 to 2016, together with annual pre-financing of between 2% and 3% payable from 2016 to 2023.  In May 2015 an amendment to the relevant EU Regulations resulted in an unprecedented increase in the YEI advances to be paid to Member States.  The Commission subsequently released pre-financing payments from the dedicated YEI budget line, worth 30% of the YEI budget, to provide additional financial liquidity to support YEI implementation.  However, the relevant Regulations specified that where a Member State did not submit an interim payment application by 23 May 2016 for at least 50% of the additional pre-financing amount, that the Member State must reimburse the Commission the total YEI pre-financing contribution.  As Ireland did not submit an interim YEI payment application, the &euro;19.8m additional pre-financing received was reimbursed to the Commission.  This reimbursement has not resulted in any loss of EU monies to the Exchequer.  Furthermore, as the YEI activities are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer there is no resulting reduction or delay in the funding available to them. </p>  <p>  I understand that the ESF Authorities in the Department of Education and Skills intend to submit a payment application to the European Commission in respect of the YEI following its designation in accordance with the EU Regulatory requirements in the coming months. </p>  <p>  My Department also obtained EU funding under the European Commission&rsquo;s call for proposals for preparatory actions under the Youth Guarantee Pilot, to pilot a Youth Guarantee Scheme in Ballymun which operated in 2014.  The total cost of the pilot was &euro;302,279 which included EU funding of &euro;250,000.</p></reply>

Public notification of beach closures is generally by way of beach notices, local authority communication networks and via the national bathing water website () operated by the EPA.</p><p>The EPA's Bathing Water Quality Report for 2016 identifies several bathing waters adjacent to urban areas as being prone to episodic pollution events and being of less than 'good' water quality status.  The requirement for bathing restrictions, either as an &lsquo;advice against bathing&rsquo; or a &lsquo;bathing prohibition&rsquo;, is determined and implemented by the relevant local authority, rather than the EPA. Such restrictions are generally put in place as a precautionary measure following elevated bacterial counts from routine sampling which indicates the potential for increased public health risk, or as a proactive warning of possible pollution e.g. in advance of predicted heavy rainfall events.  The choice of restriction is based on decision criteria agreed between the EPA and the HSE. </p><p>An assessment of bathing water incidents by the EPA shows that many, in particular those affecting major urban centres around Dublin Bay, are likely to be linked to discharges from sewage outfalls, often following rainfall events.  This is particularly so in the case of Loughshinny where existing wastewater infrastructure is under considerable pressure. In the cases of Merrion Strand and Sandymount Strand, investigations have shown pollution inputs from human waste contamination of surface water streams through misconnections as well as from avian and canine sources.  The presence of these multiple inputs has been confirmed by genetic studies of faecal bacteria carried out by researchers at UCD.  The relative proportions that each contributes is still under investigation.  While seabird impacts are known to be a factor in these locations, their more general contribution to water quality in other areas is unknown.</p><p>Bathing waters are sampled at regular intervals by local authorities during the bathing season from 1 June to 15 September, in accordance with the Bathing Waters Regulations 2008.  Data is reported to the EPA who coordinate its quality assessment and the communication of such assessments to the public, my Department, and the European Commission by means of the  national bathing water website and through its annual bathing water report.</p></reply>

There are currently over 28,000 households in receipt of HAP, including more than 8,000 households that were previously supported by Rent Supplement and some 20,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme.  Unlike Rent supplement, households in receipt of HAP support can work full-time without losing their housing support.</p><p>Under HAP, a tenant sources their own accommodation, the tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is covered by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended).  The Act provides that rents may not be greater than the open market rate and may only be reviewed upward or downward every 24 months unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation that warrants a review.  The requirement that the rent set is not above the market rents for similar properties applies in designated Rent Pressure Zone areas and in non-designated areas.  When undertaking a rent review, the landlord must provide three examples of rents for similar properties in a comparable area to demonstrate this.  Tenants must be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of new rent and can make an application for dispute resolution to the Residential Tenancies Board where they feel the rent increase is in excess of the market rent.</p><p>The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on the household size and the rental market within that area. HAP applicants are informed of the maximum rent limits for their local authority area; these elements of the scheme are stated in the HAP Tenant Information Booklet, on the dedicated HAP website, , and local authority staff are expected to explain them to each HAP applicant.  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  Greater enhanced support is also statutorily provided for in the Dublin Region for homeless households.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis. Local authorities must also be cognisant of the provisions  of the Residential Tenancies Act when approving increases in HAP payments and advise tenants accordingly.</p><p>My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf.  There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord. Where a qualified household sources accommodation outside the maximum rent limits, it is important to highlight the responsibility falling on the household as set out in their tenancy agreement.  From available data, at the end of Q.2 2017, and excluding the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region, 12.6% of HAP households nationally were benefitting from the flexibility to exceed the rent limits.  In the Kerry local authority area, 27 of the 194 households supported by HAP at that point, or 13.9% of households, were benefitting from the flexibility to exceed the rent limits. </p><p>The data available to my Department at this time indicates that the current rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits, provides local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

There are currently more than 28,000 households having their housing need met by HAP across the State and some 20,000 separate landlords and agents currently in receipt of monthly HAP payments.  The HAP scheme is funded through a combination of Exchequer monies and tenant differential rents collected in respect of HAP tenancies.  Exchequer funding for the scheme increased from &euro;57 million in 2016 to more than &euro;152 million in 2017.  This increase is in order to meet the continuing costs of existing HAP households, and the costs of supporting an additional 15,000 households this year.  Budget 2018 has made an additional &euro;149 million available for HAP next year, increasing the overall exchequer provision to more than &euro;301 million, when an additional 17,000 households are targeted for support.</p><p>Accommodation sourced by eligible households should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on the household size and the rental market within that area.  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  Additional discretion to exceed the rent limits by up to 50% is available to assist in housing homeless households in the Dublin Region.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis.  Local authorities must also be cognisant of the rent certainty and control provisions  of the Residential Tenancies Act when approving increases in HAP payments and advise tenants accordingly. </p><p>From available data, at the end of Q.2 2017, 17.8% of the total number of households  being supported by HAP were benefitting from the additional flexibility that was provided to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limits.  When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region is removed, 12.6% of households nationally were benefitting from the additional flexibility.  The data available to my Department at this time indicates that the current rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits, provides local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland. </p><p>HAP has been in operation in South Dublin County Council since 1st October 2014 and became operational in the remaining three Dublin Areas - Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council on 1st March 2017.  The Homeless Pilot of the HAP scheme has been operational since February 2015, across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region and is being implemented through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE).  HAP became operational in Kildare County Council in November 2015 and in Wicklow County Council in December 2016. </p><p>The average monthly rent paid to landlords under the HAP scheme in each of the years since the introduction of the scheme and the annualised cost of the average monthly rent paid to landlords under HAP for the local authorities in counties Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare are set out in the following table.</p><p><b>Dublin local authorities (South Dublin, Dublin City, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown and Fingal County Council, inclusive of Homeless HAP in each case) </b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total HAP tenancies set-up</th><th>Average monthly payment paid to landlords under the HAP scheme at year end </th><th>Annualised cost* of the average monthly payment paid to landlords under the HAP scheme</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>8</td><td>&euro;390 </td><td>&euro;3,511 </td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>626</td><td>&euro;916</td><td>&euro;10,992</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>1,791</td><td>&euro;1,192</td><td>&euro;14,304</td></tr><tr><td>2017 <br /><br />(end Q2)</td><td>1,687</td><td>&euro;1,269</td><td>&euro;15,228</td></tr></table><b>Kildare</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total HAP tenancies <br /><br />set-up</th><th>Average monthly payment paid to landlords under the HAP scheme at year end </th><th>Annualised cost* of the average monthly payment paid to landlords under the HAP scheme</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>32</td><td>&euro;927</td><td>&euro;11,124</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>773</td><td>&euro;885</td><td>&euro;10,620</td></tr><tr><td>2017<br /><br />(end Q2)</td><td>407</td><td>&euro;899</td><td>&euro;10,788</td></tr></table><b>Wicklow</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total HAP tenancies<br /><br />set-up</th><th>Average monthly rent paid to landlords under the HAP scheme at year end </th><th>Annualised cost* of the average monthly rent paid to landlords under the HAP scheme</th></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>3</td><td>&euro;750</td><td>&euro;9,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2017 <br /><br />(end Q2)</td><td>173</td><td>&euro;944 </td><td>&euro;11,328</td></tr></table>*The annualised cost is calculated on the basis that the average cost at year end was paid every month for twelve months.</p></reply>

There are currently more than 28,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP and some 20,000 separate landlords and agents currently in receipt of HAP payments.  A weekly average of 348 HAP tenancies have been set-up during 2017.</p><p>HAP is a form of social housing support under which local authorities will make monthly payments on behalf of tenants directly to landlords in respect of rent, subject to the terms and conditions of the scheme.  All the terms and conditions of the HAP scheme for both tenants and landlords are available on the dedicated HAP website, , and associated HAP documentation.</p><p>HAP tenants are required to sign a rent contribution agreement to pay a weekly rental contribution to the local authority in line with the local authority&rsquo;s differential rent scheme.  As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme.  HAP recipients are required to set up automatic electronic rent payment arrangements. </p><p>The HAP Shared Service Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme.  The HAP SSC applies a very clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise.  This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority. </p><p>Outside the formal notification letters there would always be attempts to contact the tenants by phone and by email to settle accounts and avoid escalation of the debt process.  Depending on the activity of arrears in question, both the relevant local authority and the landlord are informed when an account has not been cleared and of possible suspension and/or cessation of the HAP payment.  However, in the vast majority of cases a payment plan to deal with the arrears is agreed between the tenant and the local authority, before there is any necessity to advise the landlord. </p><p>If the tenant does not contact their local authority or does not enter into a payment arrangement within 8 weeks of the arrears commencing, both the landlord and the tenant are informed that the HAP payment may be ceased.  To date the approach has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants.  In 2016, when 12,075 additional households were supported by HAP, the scheme had a 99% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities.  Therefore, a very small number of tenants have fallen in to difficulty with their differential rent.  In 99.7% of cases where the tenant has had difficulty, this has been resolved with their local authority without any impact on the landlord&rsquo;s payment.  Therefore the likelihood of a HAP payment to a landlord being suspended or stopped is very small and occurs in only a very limited number of cases. </p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  In general, I am satisfied with the operation of the HAP scheme and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p></reply>

In general, households with a housing need who are in receipt of rent supplement for more than 18 months are considered for RAS. </p><p>RAS remains a significant part of the suite of social housing options available to local authorities and to those who are assessed as being in need of housing support.  618 of the 1,000 new RAS transfers targeted under Rebuilding Ireland in 2017, had been completed by end of August 2017.  With the introduction of HAP to all local authority areas, the availability of Rent Supplement has changed and is generally no longer available to households with a long-term housing need.  This change reduces significantly the numbers of households entering rent supplement support. Equally, as the transfers of existing rent supplement recipients with a housing need to HAP accelerates, the numbers of long term rent supplement recipients eligible for RAS will decline as will RAS transfers.</p><p>The following table sets out the annual target for the number of additional households to be transferred from Rent Supplement into new RAS tenancies as set out in Rebuilding Ireland and the annual targets for additional households to receive HAP support in each of those years.<table><tr><th></th><th>2018 </th><th>2019 </th><th>2020</th><th>2021 </th></tr><tr><td>RAS </td><td>600 </td><td>600 </td><td>600 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>HAP </td><td>17,000 </td><td>16,760 </td><td>13,000* </td><td>10,000 </td></tr></table>* The ambition is to complete the transfers of eligible households from Rent Supplement to HAP by 2020</p></reply>

Local authorities and the Housing Agency are now finalising Development Management Plans for their sites.</p><p>The final development model for each site, including the tenure mix, will be the subject of careful consideration by the local authority concerned, including its elected members.  The development of many sites for social and affordable housing is already underway.  For example, the Dublin local authorities are well advanced in bringing large-scale sites forward for mixed-tenure housing, with projects advancing that can deliver around 3,000 mixed-tenure homes in the Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council areas alone and other sites planned.</p><p>Funding for 34 projects under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), at a cost of &euro;226 million, will be key to the delivery of more than 20,000 new homes over the next four years.  There will be homes available at below &euro;320,000 on 70% of the sites being opened up through this enabling infrastructure.  South Dublin County Council has approval for three projects at Adamstown, Kilcarbery, and Clonburris, respectively.  The total cost of these projects is &euro;27.4 million, of which &euro;20.5 million will be funded by my Department, and &euro;6.9 million by South Dublin County Council.  These projects are expected to facilitate the delivery of 3,000 homes by 2021 and have the potential to support 11,500 housing units in the longer term, once the sites are fully built out.</p><p>As I have previously signalled, the Government recognises the housing affordability pressures faced by many households, particularly in certain parts of the country, and as such housing affordability has been examined across a range of interconnected policy areas in the context of the ongoing focused review of Rebuilding Ireland.  A number of new and enhanced actions in this area have already been announced and I expect to make further announcements in the coming weeks as this work is finalised.</p><p>New measures introduced to date, to enable the provision of affordable homes, to buy or rent, include:</p><p>- Planning reforms, such as the fast-track planning approval process for developments of scale with over 4,000 homes worth of applications submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la;</p><p>- Reduced and reformed development contributions; </p><p>- Rent caps in specific Rent Pressure Zones; and</p><p>- Amendments to apartment planning guidelines to allow for more cost-effective and affordable apartment development for our city centres.</p><p>On 10 October, as part of Budget 2018, I announced an additional &euro;75 million in Exchequer funding for new affordable housing initiatives.</p><p>Firstly, there will be a second LIHAF fund of &euro;50 million to unlock even more sites, more quickly, and at affordable prices.  Secondly, I&rsquo;m introducing a new fund of &euro;25 million, to be provided over 2018 and 2019, aimed at unlocking local authority-owned land specifically in order to deliver affordable housing on those sites.  My Department is currently drawing up the criteria for access to this scheme, to be announced in the coming weeks, along with further affordability measures.</p><p>In terms of residential land more broadly, the combination of the capital gains change and the more than doubling of the vacant site levy to 7%, as signalled in Budget 2018, will help to address the issue of land hoarding and to release more land for residential development.</p></reply>

However, any underspends in one year will be made good in future years and, through proactive management of the broader housing programme, any such underspends can be applied to other housing activities in the year in question, ensuring that the funding available in any given year is fully applied.</p>  <p>  The first drawdown for LIHAF projects is likely to occur in late November and actual drawdown figures will be available by the end of the year.

This will allow us to build more infrastructure to unlock further sites and activate more housing supply.  A further call for proposals under LIHAF is likely early in 2018.</p></reply>

The cost of the schemes in future years is therefore dependent on the number of housing units falling to be funded within the scheme and the lease payments involved.  Exchequer funding for SHCEP in 2017 is &euro;84m and an allocation of &euro;115m has been secured for 2018 &ndash; an increase of &euro;31m.

To achieve this, annual targets for both inspection and compliance will be agreed with local authorities. </p></reply>

The Naval Service have re-iterated that the individual&rsquo;s medical condition is incompatible with service at sea, especially in the military environment. </p><p>I am informed that a request for a medical derogation was made in 2015. The Deputy Chief of Staff (Support) considered the case and received the opinions of both the Director of Legal Services and Director of the Medical Branch. The Deputy Chief of Staff (Support) decided that a medical derogation could not be granted. </p><p>With regard to the reimbursement of a Naval Service Commissioned Officer&rsquo;s Dress Uniform, I have sought additional information and I will revert to the Deputy when this information is to hand.</p><p>Finally, I am meeting members of RDFRA this Thursday (19 October 2017) and I look forward to having a positive discussion with them on matters of importance to their members. </p></reply>

Personnel are posted on the basis of operational need across the organisation both at home and abroad.  As there is a significant turnover of personnel in the Defence Forces, targeted recruitment takes place on a regular basis so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces do not run a general service campaign specifically for the Air Corps.  The Air Corps induct personnel through a series of competitions including Cadetships, Air Corps Trainee Military Aircraft Technicians and through transfer of personnel from general service in the Army.  In this regard, 12 General Service Recruits enlisted in March 2017, have passed their training, and will now be posted to units in the Air Corps.  A further 11 general service recruits enlisted in October 2017 have commenced basic training alongside the Trainee Military Aircraft Technicians inducted in the same month.  It is expected that these recruits will also be assigned to Air Corps units on completion of their training.   </p>  <p>  On 13 March 2017, a class of 11 Trainee Military Aircraft Technicians began their training.  This was augmented by an additional 11 Trainee Military Aircraft Technicians who joined in October 2017.    </p>  <p>  With the support of the Chief of Staff, it is intended to continue to recruit new personnel in order to ensure that the Defence Forces retain the capacity to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government, both at home and overseas.</p></reply>
