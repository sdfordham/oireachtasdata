The Plan sets out 50 actions designed to maximise our rural tourism and recreation potential.  It also places a particular emphasis on the development and promotion of Activity Tourism in rural areas, through the development of Greenways, Blueways and other niche tourism products.</p>  <p>  As part of the Action Plan, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will prepare a new strategy this year to underpin the development, funding and promotion of Greenways to support activity tourism in rural areas and provide a boost to local economies.  This strategy will be delivered in the second quarter of 2017. </p>  <p>  My own Department will fund the Rural Recreation Scheme, which provides funding for the upkeep and development of recreational infrastructure.  Over the lifetime of the Action Plan, we will also double the number of trails included in the National Walks Scheme and will develop a Public Outdoor Recreation Amenities Plan to transform the provision of outdoor recreation facilities on publicly-owned land and waterways.  My Department will work closely with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, relevant State agencies and other key stakeholders to deliver these actions.   </p>  <p>  One of the key objectives of the Action Plan is to increase overseas tourists to rural Ireland by 12% by 2019.  The Central Statistics Office last week announced that 9.6 million overseas visitors came to Ireland in 2016.  While the breakdown of destinations for those visitors is not yet available, figures for 2015 indicate that 85% of overseas tourists visited at least one region outside of Dublin. </p></reply>

It is the first Plan of its kind to address both the economic and social needs of rural Ireland through a  whole-of-Government approach.  </p><p>The Plan includes number of initiatives across a range of Departments which will have a particular benefit for elderly people in rural Ireland.  For example: </p><p>- The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will invest in the Seniors Alert Scheme, which facilitates valuable community-based support for vulnerable older people living alone, particularly in isolated areas.</p><p>- The Minister for Health has committed to improving access to GP services in rural areas, and to delivering 18 new primary care centres in rural Ireland by the end of 2018.  This will help elderly people in rural Ireland to access services in their communities.  The Minister has also committed to investing &euro;435 million in 90 public nursing facilities and district and community hospitals in rural Ireland up to 2021.</p><p>- The HSE will maintain the network of senior helplines in operation throughout the country, to help address issues such as loneliness and isolation in rural areas.</p><p>- The implementation of the National Positive Ageing Strategy will also support older people in staying healthy and involved in their local communities.</p><p>- The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to support and prioritise community crime prevention schemes, including the Neighbourhood Watch and Text Alert schemes, and a new Community CCTV Grant Aid scheme will be introduced.</p><p>- The National Transport Authority will work with rural communities to assess and implement improvements to existing rural transport routes and develop new rural transport routes as necessary.  The Authority will also ensure that all Rural Transport Programme vehicles are accessible, having regard to passenger needs.</p><p>The Action Plan will be reviewed on an ongoing basis to monitor the progress of these, and all other measures in the Plan.</p></reply>

The OPW has appointed a design team to the project and work is ongoing to finalise the design.  It is expected that this will be completed shortly and that project will go out to tender this year.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the National Library I have announced a capital investment of &euro;10m for the Library's historic Kildare Street premises.  As with the Archives, my Department is working with the National Library and the OPW to advance this project as part of a phased programme of works.  Design work is well advanced on the project and I would expect works to start this year .   </p>  <p>  I am confident that the investment plan will help transform the Library into a world-class facility for the storage and display of some of our most important historical documents. </p>  <p>  Together these two investment programmes will allow the National Archives and the National Library to deliver on their core objectives of protecting and conserving their collections, as well as allowing them to develop as venues for research, culture, learning and tourism.   </p></reply>

In tandem with a number of local authorities and village communities, the Council has prepared a toolkit which was launched in October 2012 at the inaugural community-led workshop.  In many ways, the approach followed is similar to the Historic Towns Initiative (HTI) framework, also developed by my Department in collaboration with the Heritage Council, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and relevant local authorities, although it is focused on smaller communities.  </p>  <p>  Current policy encourages a community-led approach rather than the development of a nationwide plan.  I am however considering the possibility of a prioritised targeted approach to towns and villages with a view to not only protecting their character and heritage, but also contributing to regional development through encouraging economic growth and employment.   </p>  <p>  All approaches are still under consideration as I seek to further strengthen the protection of our built heritage and to provide for the regeneration of rural towns and villages as part of the Action Plan for Rural Development. </p></reply>

Similar arrangements will be made to publish the reports on the website following the receipt of the relevant reports from my officials and the ICC.

The Irish Arts Center is one of two key partners which promote Irish arts abroad and which my Department supports on an ongoing basis through the Culture Ireland programme.  The other is the Centre Culturel in Paris.  In both cases my Department provides annual funding to showcase the best of Irish arts and culture in these two culturally rich world cities.  </p>  <p>  This capital funding will supplement private and US State support, including City of New York funding of $36.85m, State of New York funding of $3.65m and private funding of $7.6m.  My Department&rsquo;s grant in December complements over &euro;3m provided to date by the Government through the Emigrant Support Programme of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as well as the support provided by the Office of Public Works in preparing the designs for the new Center.  The new Irish Arts Center, when completed, will be a flagship venue which will offer a major platform for the coming generation of Irish artists and performers. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s additional support was warmly welcomed by the Irish community in New York when I visited there two weeks ago to launch the Culture Ireland US programme for 2017 where my Department will provide &euro;1m to Irish artists to showcase their work in the United States throughout the year.   </p>  <p>  This builds on the increased funding which my Department was able to provide in 2016 to enable an enhanced programme to be presented as part of 'I Am Ireland', Culture Ireland's Centenary programme.   </p>  <p>  It is not clear to me what the Deputy is referring to in relation to the dropping of investment criteria, however, my Department has attached standard conditions to the grant to ensure that the investment is protected.    </p>  <p>  The additional funding which I have now provided will assist in ensuring that this flagship artistic Irish cultural venue is delivered on schedule by allowing site preparations to progress as planned.   </p></reply>

This is a cross-Government initiative to mainstream culture and creativity in the life of the nation and to promote individual, community and national wellbeing.  This will focus on boosting cultural provision and participation in communities and harnessing the goodwill and engagement generated by the 2016 commemorative programme. </p><p>The core proposition of this programme is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.  The programme is based on five pillars:</p><p>- Enabling the creative potential of every child</p><p>- Enabling creativity in every community</p><p>- Investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure</p><p>- Establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production</p><p>- Unifying our global reputation.</p><p>The second pillar &ndash; Enabling creativity in every community &ndash; will be implemented primarily through our local authorities.  This is because local authorities are the primary instruments of community engagement and, second, local authorities have a particular capacity for local programme delivery, especially in the context of citizen engagement. </p><p>I have asked each local authority to establish a Culture Team bringing together arts officers, librarians, heritage officers, museum curators, archivists and other relevant personnel which will be led by a Director of Services, with a nominated person as 'Creative Ireland Co-ordinator'.  The primary role of the Culture Team will be to develop a Culture and Creativity Plan, reflecting the overall structure and aims of the national strategy programme, and then to drive public participation in creative cultural activity in each local authority area.</p><p>I have made a specific allocation of &euro;1 million to the local authorities towards the implementation of the 2017 Creative Ireland Plans out of the overall funding of &euro;5m which I secured in Budget 2017 to underpin this new initiative.</p></reply>

The legislation required to allow for these pilot measures is included in the Heritage Bill 2016, which was published in January 2016.  The Bill is currently at Committee Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  In the meantime, the existing provisions relating to Section 40 of the Wildlife Acts remain in force. </p><p>Significant environmental damage is caused by wildfires.  This issue has become more acute in recent years, as evidenced by the spate of fires in various parts of the country, including the 2015 fire in Co. Kerry.</p><p>The main source of such wildfires is thought to be the deliberate starting of fires without concern for the consequences. My Department is one of a number of agencies represented on the Inter-Agency Gorse Fire Group that explores issues surrounding such fires.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also represented on the Group. My Department co-operates fully with Garda investigations and any other investigations that may be initiated by other statutory bodies. As the Deputy will appreciate, Killarney National Park on its own comprises over 10,000 Hectares (26,000 acres) so it can be difficult to provide a visible &ldquo;presence&rdquo; on the ground to discourage and prevent unauthorised burning in the countryside.  Trying to identify the culprits &ndash; those who deliberately set fires in open areas &ndash; can also be difficult. </p><p>Aside from such malicious activities, one of the main challenges is to encourage members of the public, (including landowners, farmers and recreational users of publicly accessible land), to act responsibly at all times, to be mindful of their own safety and the safety of others, to be mindful of the need to protect property, both publicly owned and privately owned, and to appreciate the value of our natural heritage, particularly in our National Parks, Nature Reserves and Designated (Natura 2000) Sites. </p></reply>

The scheme was developed to assist with the repair and conservation of structures that are protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).  In certain cases, the scheme is also available for the conservation of structures within Architectural Conservation Areas (ACAs) where, in the opinion of the local authority, a need for works to enhance the character and appearance of an ACA has arisen and has been demonstrated.  </p>  <p>  The 2016 Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS), with an allocation of &euro;2 million, was operated via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  In 2016, the scheme supported over 270 projects across the country, creating over 17,000 days of employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  The scheme has also leveraged aggregate investment just under &euro;5.5 million; more than double the scheme&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;2 million. </p>  <p>  I announced recently that the scheme will operate again in 2017.  It will provide a &euro;2 million euro investment this year for the repair and conservation of protected structures and will again be operated by the Local Authorities.  This scheme will support a significant number of projects across the country and help provide employment in the conservation and construction industries.   </p>  <p>  The focus and priority of the scheme is on heritage-led job creation.  As a result, local authorities are required to report to the Department on the number of jobs created under this scheme.  The scheme aims to leverage private capital for investment in a significant number of labour-intensive, small-scale conservation projects across the country.  It also supports the employment of skilled and experienced conservation professionals, craftspeople and tradespersons in the repair of the historic built environment. </p></reply>

The Action Plan for Rural Development recognises the further growth potential that tourism presents for rural communities.  It sets out 50 distinct actions designed to maximise our rural tourism and recreation potential. </p>  <p>  These actions will support the objective of rejuvenating Ireland&rsquo;s rural towns and villages by developing and promoting the expansion of activity tourism in rural areas, including through the development of Blueways and Greenways.   </p>  <p>  For example, my Department funded part of the Shannon - Erne Blueway development under the Rural Economic Development Zones (REDZ) pilot in 2015.  Launched in June 2016, the Shannon-Erne Blueway is bringing tourism to the rural areas of Cavan, Leitrim, Longford and Roscommon, connecting 22 towns and villages located alongside the River Shannon and the Shannon-Erne Waterway, through the Blueway. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, my Department provided funding to Waterways Ireland in 2016 via the Rural Recreation Scheme to develop a critical link in the walking and cycling element of the Blueway by linking the existing 14km of looped walks to the facilities and services at Acres lake and Drumshanbo town in Leitrim, through the development of an iconic boardwalk. </p>  <p>  Such developments can and do support economic development in the towns, villages and hinterlands along the route by providing leisure activities not only for visitors, but also for people who live and work in the vicinity.  The Action Plan for Rural Development aims to build on these initiatives and replicate their success in attracting visitors to rural towns and villages.   </p>  <p>  With regard to specific plans for a blueway in south County Kildare, as I understand it, the Deputy may be referring to the Barrow Way, which runs through County Kildare.  I am advised that just last week, Waterways Ireland submitted a planning application for development of this way, including a Blueway element along the Grand Canal. </p></reply>

The Plan contains over 270 actions to be delivered by a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other bodies.

These pillars are:</p><p>­ Supporting Sustainable Communities</p><p>­ Supporting Enterprise and Employment</p><p>­ Maximising our Rural Tourism and Recreation Potential</p><p>­ Fostering Culture and Creativity in rural communities</p><p>­ Improving Rural Infrastructure and Connectivity.</p><p>The Plan will support sustainable communities by making rural Ireland a better place to live through initiatives such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and CL&Aacute;R.  It will enhance local services, empower local communities to ensure that their voices are heard in decision-making, and build better communities through ongoing investment in schemes such as LEADER. </p><p>Key to the delivery of the Action Plan will be a robust process of monitoring progress on each of the 276 actions.  I will chair a Monitoring Committee which will include representatives of all relevant Government Departments, public bodies and key rural stakeholder interests.  The Monitoring Committee will meet on a regular basis and will report to the Cabinet Committee on Regional and Rural Affairs, which is chaired by An Taoiseach.  Progress reports on the implementation of the Plan will be published every six months. </p><p>The Action Plan for Rural Development will also be a living document, with the capacity to add further actions over its lifetime.  </p></reply>

Funding for regional and rural programmes in my Department&rsquo;s Estimate has increased from &euro;61.2 million in 2016, to &euro;79.2 million in 2017 &ndash; an increase of 29%.  This demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to rural development and will allow for the funding of schemes such as the CL&Aacute;R programme and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme.  The increased funding will be complemented by the work of other areas of my Department, much of which has a positive impact on rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is important to bear in mind that many of the commitments in the Action Plan for Rural Development involve new policy initiatives which will not necessarily require additional funding to have a positive impact &ndash; for example the development of a new and effective framework for rural proofing Government policies, or the development, for the first time ever, of a National Policy on Social Enterprise.</p></reply>

The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers.  The immediate objective of the revaluation programme is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in more than 150 years is conducted as soon as possible.  Following this revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation, in accordance with Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions and decisions with regard to the selection of rating authority areas for revaluation is his sole prerogative.  Section 19(1) of the 2001 Act empowers the Commissioner, after consultation with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the rating authority concerned, to make a Valuation Order specifying a rating authority area over which a revaluation is to be conducted.  I am advised that the revaluation programme which began with South Dublin, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council areas has also been rolled out to the Dublin City Council area, Waterford City and County Council area and Limerick City and County Council area.</p>  <p>  The current phase of the National Revaluation Programme known as "REVAL 2017" covers revaluation of counties Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Kildare, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny for the first time since the nineteenth century.  These are the nine counties referenced in Action No. 76 in the Government Action Plan for Rural Development.  The revaluation of these nine rural counties is expected to be completed in September 2017 and become effective for rates purposes from 2018 onwards.</p></reply>

They do not have refugee status and arrive in Ireland as asylum seekers and go through the asylum application process operated by the International Protection Office.  However, in order for an asylum seeker to be eligible for relocation an applicant must belong to a nationality for which the proportion of decisions granting international protection among decisions taken at first instance on applications for international protection is, according to the latest available updated quarterly Union-wide average Eurostat data, 75 % or higher.

Under this decision a programme office was established in my Department to oversee the operational aspects of the programme, which aims to bring in 4,000 vulnerable migrants to Ireland under two different mechanisms, refugee resettlement - operated by the Office for Promotion of Migrant Integration (OPMI) - and asylum seeker relocation.</p>  <p>  The IRPP deals with all aspects of a migrant's life from the moment they are selected for relocation or resettlement to their transportation to Ireland and eventual settlement in the communities around the state.  Consequently, the cost of the programme is spread across many government departments and state agencies and cannot be calculated without significantly impacting on resources in those Departments.</p>  <p>  Within my own Department the costs of the programme are spread across several different areas including the Irish Refugee Protection Programme Office, the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration, the International Protection Office and the Reception and Integration Agency - many of which cover a wide range of activities beyond those specifically related to the IRPP.  While it would be difficult to produce a detailed breakdown of funding across all Justice areas involved in the programme without disproportionately impacting on staff resources, I understand that the total funding for those aspects of the Programme being operated within my Department is in the region of &euro;20 million.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the pace of the programme will continue to increase during 2017.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.

As the Deputy will also be aware, the allocation of judicial resources and the scheduling of court cases is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the judiciary who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  The President of the Circuit Court has been very helpful as regards consideration of dedicated new court  arrangements for repossessions and the option and implications of use of pre-existing legislative powers to implement a system of specific court sittings for repossessions at specific venues on specific dates.  This is being pursued at present between my Department and the Courts with a view to possible new arrangements for the Easter law term where appropriate and having regard to constitutional constraints.  Furthermore the Government, at its meeting of 6 December 2016, decided to reassign, by appointment, three specialist judges of the Circuit Court as ordinary judges of the Circuit Court to fill three existing vacancies and so there are currently no vacancies in the Circuit Court.  The Department is actively involved in discussions, including with the judiciary and Courts Service, as regards what progress can be made on introducing the proposed dedicated arrangements for mortgage arrears cases which I hope to bring to Government for consideration in the near future.</p>  <p>  A key element of the commitments in the Programme for Government is, as the Deputy will also be aware, putting in place a national mortgage arrears resolution service and priority was given last year to getting the new national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service (Abhaile) up and running and this was formally launched last October. The service, which forms part of the Programme for Partnership Government commitments on mortgage arrears, ensures that people who are at risk of losing their home have access to free independent financial and legal advice and assistance.  The objective is to help these homeowners to identify and put in place solutions to their mortgage arrears, with priority to helping them remain in their home wherever possible.</p>  <p>  The Abhaile service is available through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) helpline and MABS offices across the country.  Homeowners who are at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears, including those facing repossession proceedings, can contact MABS which will provide support and advice.  Support available includes in-house dedicated Mortgage Arrears advisers in MABS offices across the country, specifically to assist and negotiate with financial institutions on the borrower's behalf.  MABS can also provide access to free independent financial advice and assistance on personal insolvency and bankruptcy from a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP), and to free independent legal advice from a solicitor, under a 'voucher' system.  The advice and assistance is provided by a PIP or solicitor from expert panels, established under the Scheme respectively by the Insolvency Service of Ireland and by the Legal Aid Board.  The service also includes free support and assistance at Circuit Court repossession court lists country-wide, with MABS court mentors in attendance to provide help and advice to borrowers attending, and a 'duty solicitor', from a Legal Aid Board panel, to provide legal assistance in court to unrepresented borrowers in repossession proceedings.  The scheme also offers legal aid to borrowers seeking the new Personal Insolvency court review under the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015.  Over 4,100 vouchers have been issued under the Scheme up to 27th January 2017.</p>  <p>  A further key element related to the power of a court to impose mortgage arrears solutions for those in arrears and it is critical to note that use of the key statutory provision allowing for imposition of debt solutions involving a mortgage, where the solution has been rejected by the creditors, is increasing due to the availability of the Abhaile service since last October.  I am referring to the "section 115A" procedure put in place under the 2015 Personal Insolvency legislation which allows the Circuit Court, in defined circumstances, to impose a personal insolvency arrangement (PIA), on application from the debtor, where the proposed arrangement has been rejected by the creditors.</p>  <p>  I would also like to point out to the Deputy that early indications, while based on small initial samples, suggest that the new Abhaile service is reaching those most at risk of losing their homes, and particularly the cohort of those who are in mortgage arrears equivalent to 720 days or more.  They also suggest that access to free, independent expert help, and to statutory protection against creditor pressure for those who are engaging, is a significant relief for those at risk, and that independent advice is identifying solutions which offer better outcomes for the homeowner, often enabling them to remain in their homes.  Representative outcome data for the Abhaile Service is not yet available, but this information is being tracked and collected, and full analysis will be available at a later date.</p>  <p>  My Department, together with the Department of Social Protection, leads both operational oversight and governance steering groups for the new Abhaile service and its effectiveness and impacts are being closely monitored as part of these processes, whilst my Department also continues to pursue the remaining aspects of the Programme for Government commitment with a view to further implementation measures in the next three months.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the damage done to rural communities by organised gangs engaged in burglary and other property crime. This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. In this regard the Deputy will be aware that Operation Thor has been put in place to tackle burglary and related crimes, in both rural and urban areas.  It is encouraging to note that since the launch of the operation in November 2015, the burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend. Indeed, the most recent CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q3 of 2016 show a decrease of 31% in burglary for the twelve months ending 30 September 2016 compared to the previous twelve month period. This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor. </p>  <p>   It is important we build on this success by ensuring that Garda numbers continue to increase.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, in the coming years.  The Government has put in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging programme of reform which is being implemented in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In addition, approximately 300 appointments will be made to the Garda Reserve.</p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will benefit all areas of Garda activity including addressing crime in rural communities such as Connemara. </p>  <p>  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works in partnership with a wide range of community based groups, including Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch groups, to support enhanced community safety and with particular regard to the needs of those living in rural areas.</p></reply>

It also considered what structure was needed to be put in place to exploit such opportunities. </p>  <p>  It was agreed at the workshop that a draft Terms of Reference would be prepared for the development and implementation of a strategy to increase employment for ex-offenders through social enterprises and other initiatives and in addition, a Steering Group would be established to oversee the work needed to develop and implement the strategy. </p>  <p>  The Steering Group, which is comprised of 6 members at present - three from the Department of Justice and Equality and three from the Social Enterprise and business sector - has been established and has met quarterly, with secretarial support provided by the Care and Rehabilitation Directorate of the Irish Prison Service.  Their primary goal is to develop a strategy (and a plan to implement the strategy) to increase employment opportunities for ex-offenders through social enterprise and other related initiatives.</p>  <p>  A Project Manager, based at the Probation Service head office, has been appointed to drive the work, reporting to the Steering Group on the implementation of the agreed actions including: </p>  <p>  - Assess the current activities and outputs of prisons and identify products and services that could have sustained market potential</p>  <p>  - Identify and secure seed funding and the ongoing financial supports needed to sustain any identified social enterprise activities</p>  <p>  - Explore the inclusion of social clauses in appropriate public contracts awarded by the Criminal Justice Sector requiring private companies to provide employment to a number of ex-offenders </p>  <p>  - Promote the employment of ex-offenders by community-based organisations part-funded by the Criminal Justice Sector</p>  <p>  - Further develop employment placement services for ex-offenders with employers</p>  <p>  - To pilot the establishment of a farm shop at Loughan House and to consider establishing a Dublin outlet shop in a suitable location</p>  <p>  - To pilot a Prison Entrepreneurship Programme in an Irish prison.</p>  <p>  I officially opened a social enterprise initiative at Loughan House Open Centre, County Cavan in July 2016, the Loughan House farm shop. This shop is operated by a group of prisoners currently based there under the guidance and oversight of prison management.  I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that this pilot initiative has been very successful to date with the active engagement by those in custody there and support from the general public.</p></reply>

Under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, any person found guilty of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation shall be liable to imprisonment for a period up to life.  It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years.</p><p>In September 2015, I published the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015, as approved by Government.  The Bill provides for two new offences of purchasing sexual services, in the context of prostitution.  The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.  The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, in the context of prostitution, and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not commit an offence. </p><p>These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012.  The new offences also implement the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.  Both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have recognised the effectiveness of the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services as a tool in the fight against human trafficking.</p><p>The Bill has completed all stages in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and is scheduled for Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 1 February 2017.<b><font color="#000080"></font></b></p></reply>

The Statute Law Revision Act 2007 specifically retained in existence, in Irish Law, the torts and offences of maintenance and champerty. </p><p>Under current law,<b></b>actions comprising maintenance and/or champerty in Ireland are considered to be contrary to public policy in that <i>inter alia</i>they may assist in the development of a market in legal claims thereby promoting litigation for the benefit of the promoter rather than the litigant and are considered to have the potential to create a substantial injustice to a defendant in an action. Maintenance and champerty are not permitted as a matter of Irish law regardless of the extent of the control exercised over the conduct of the litigation by the funder.  As I understand aspects of these matters to be sub judice, I will refrain from any further comment. </p><p>At the same time, I am aware that some change has been taking place under the law in other jurisdictions and that this has generated public debate. For example, the torts and crimes of maintenance and champerty were abolished in England and Wales under the Criminal Law Act of 1967 and I am also aware that a number of States in Australia have since followed suit. In contrast, however, I note that New Zealand has favoured the retention of maintenance and champerty, a position which would be more aligned with current public policy in this jurisdiction. </p><p>Clearly, any change to public policy in relation to maintenance and champerty would require detailed and balanced consideration. I am, therefore, pleased to note the publication by the Law Reform Commission last June of its Issues Paper on &quot;Contempt of Court and Other Offences and Torts Involving the Administration of Justice&quot;. Under Issue 6 of that paper, the Commission has opened up the retention of the crimes and torts of maintenance and champerty to public consultation along with the related question of whether third-party funding of litigation should be permitted. As with any developments before the courts, any report and recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission in relation to maintenance and champerty will be fully considered by my Department and by the Government in due course.</p></reply>

This involved significant new processes being developed, engagement with stake-holders and the setting up of a new International Protection Office. A new International Protection Appeals Tribunal has also been established. This has involved a period of considerable change for these institutions, their staff and for applicants in the the old process who may now be dealt with under the new procedures. The single applications procedure brings Ireland in line with the practice of all other EU Member States.</p>  <p>  As part of the implementation process, new information technology systems have been put in place and data migrated from older systems. This data is currently being checked taking into account the transition arrangements specified in the new legislation.  Accordingly, the figures requested by the Deputy are not immediately to hand.  The new International Protection Office is making direct contact with every applicant on record, to inform them of the changes that may impact on their applications and to confirm the status of their application.  Once the new systems beds in, I will provide the Deputy with the figures requested.</p></reply>

I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no function in decisions in this regard. Having a modern valuation base, which takes account of contemporary rents and current market circumstances, is very important for the levying of business rates on a fair and equitable basis. This has been the policy of successive Governments for many years and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme being rolled out by the Valuation Office. The current phase of this programme is known as "REVAL 2017" and covers the revaluation of all rateable properties in Counties Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Kildare, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny, where a revaluation is being undertaken for the first time since the nineteenth century. It also includes the second revaluation of South Dublin Country Council. The revaluation in these counties will be completed in September 2017 and will become effective for rating purposes from 2018 onwards. </p>  <p>  While the current phase of revaluation is a work in progress, the first significant milestone was reached this month with the issue of certificates of proposed valuation on 12 January 2017 to all ratepayers in counties Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath. Similarly, certificates of proposed valuation issued to all ratepayers in County Leitrim on 19 January 2017. As regards the revaluation in the five remaining counties - Kildare, Offaly, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny - of the current phase, I am advised that work has reached an advanced stage and proposed valuation certificates will issue to ratepayers in those counties during March 2017. In the case of the second revaluation of South Dublin, which is running in parallel to the revaluation in the nine rural counties, proposed valuation certificates are expected to issue in April 2017.</p>  <p>  I understand that, as part of its regular engagement with ratepayers during a revaluation, the Valuation Office has put arrangements in place to assist ratepayers who may have a concern in relation to the valuation that has been placed on their property. This includes a telephone helpline and detailed information is also available on the Valuation Office's website, www.valoff.ie. Arrangements have also been put in place to run an advertising campaign in the local press and on local radio to inform ratepayers of walk-in clinics that have been arranged in the County Council offices in counties Leitrim, Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath. Similar information campaigns will be undertaken when the certificate of proposed valuation is being issued to ratepayers in the other counties included in this phase of the revaluation programme. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Valuation Office that in some instances the valuation of certain properties would have increased to some degree, this would be due to the individual circumstances of the properties concerned. The experience of the most recent revaluations conducted to date in other local authority areas by the Valuation Office has indicated that about 60% of ratepayers had the valuation of their property reduced and about 40% had an increase, a pattern which is expected to be replicated when the final certificates of valuation, under the current phase of the programme, are issued in September 2017. </p>  <p>  There is an extensive system of redress available to those ratepayers who are dissatisfied with the proposed valuations or with any particular on the certificate relating to their property. In this regard, a dissatisfied person can make representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days of the date of issue of the certificate. The Valuation Office will consider the representations and may or may not change the proposed valuation depending on the circumstances of each individual property.</p>  <p>  A certificate of final valuation will issue to each ratepayer in September 2017 and the valuation shown on the certificate will be used as the basis for the assessment of rates by the local authority with effect from 1 January 2018. It is important to note that if a ratepayer is still dissatisfied with the valuation on the final certificate, they have a right to lodge a formal appeal with the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent statutory tribunal established for the purpose of hearing appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation.</p></reply>

The proposed amendments are currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. </p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the proposed changes is to expand the scope of lawful interception to include more modern forms of communication.  In the years since enactment of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993, the nature of electronic communications has changed significantly.  The proposed amendments will provide a clear, legislative basis for the interception of internet-based forms of communication under the same conditions and safeguards as currently apply.  The legislation will remain targeted and proportionate and will ensure that lawful interception remains a valuable tool in the fight against organised crime and terrorism.  In addition to domestic requirements, the current state of the law in this area impacts on the ability to fully meet international obligations under Part 3 of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 and the legislative amendments proposed will remedy this.</p>  <p>  The proposals also provide for consequential amendments that arise to the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983.

It is also worth pointing out that non-EEA students are not the only category of migrant subject to such a requirement.  This is a relatively widespread condition imposed by immigration authorities in many jurisdictions on persons seeking to reside in their jurisdiction for extended periods.</p>  <p>  This requirement has a dual purpose.  Firstly, it is a very reasonable condition imposed by many sovereign governments in order to protect the public interest and public resources.  Secondly, it is important to safeguard the welfare of non-EEA students who should have access to any necessary medical services while in the State and, of course, emergency medical repatriation to their home country in the event of a catastrophic injury or illness.</p>  <p>  The requirement to have private medical insurance is a long standing one and already in place before January 2011 when new student immigration rules were introduced, and these rules further confirmed and clarified that requirement for non-EEA students.  Clear guidance on this is available on the INIS website (www.inis.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions%20-%20Students) of the immigration service.  While, what is commonly referred to as 'travel insurance' might suffice for newly arrived students, subject to certain key requirements, it was always intended that those wishing to stay on student permission for more than one year would require private medical insurance for their second and subsequent years (as stipulated in the guidelines).</p>  <p>  I am aware of recent media reports relating to recent actions by the Health Insurance Authority (HIA).  Officials of my Department are due to meet with the HIA shortly to better understand these changes.  The HIA is, however, an independent statutory regulator of the private health insurance market in Ireland and, as such, is entirely free to impose any regulatory requirements it sees fit.  In the circumstances it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further on this matter, only to re-iterate that access to private medical insurance by non-EEA national students is in the interests of such students. </p></reply>

The report itself acknowledged that the ODCE &quot;.....has only a partial role with respect to &lsquo;white collar crime&rsquo;,&quot; and that its experience is not as extensive as that of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard. Of course the report was a very welcome and valuable contribution to the consideration of our response to white collar crime and since it was completed in November 2010, there have been a number of significant developments in our legislative framework. </p><p>In particular, I might mention the Criminal Justice Act 2011, the main purpose of which is to facilitate the more effective investigation of such crime and to reduce associated delays in the process.  The Act provides for procedures to facilitate Garda access to essential information and documentation to assist in investigations. The Act is targeted at specified serious and complex offences attracting a penalty of at least 5 years imprisonment, including offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud and corruption. </p><p>Another recent provision of relevance is Part 5 of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013.  It makes provision for the selection of up to 15 jurors to serve in a criminal trial which is likely to last more than 2 months, with 12 jurors to be selected to consider the verdict.  These provisions are of relevance to lengthy trials involving fraud or other complex financial matters where there is a risk of jurors becoming unavailable during the course of a protracted trial. </p><p>In terms of forthcoming legislation, the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010 will be replaced by the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill. This Bill will replace and update the offences of giving and receiving bribes contained in existing legislation. The Bill will also enhance the ability of the DPP to bring prosecutions by providing for presumptions of corrupt gifts or payments and it will provide for penalties of up to 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment and unlimited fines for persons convicted on indictment. </p><p>In addition, the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill<b></b>was approved by Government in December. The Bill will give effect to provisions contained in the 4<sup>th</sup>EU Money Laundering Directive which has the aim of strengthening laws in the EU to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The Directive adopts a risk-based approach whereby &ldquo;designated persons&rdquo; - such as banks and other bodies - must determine, on the basis of a risk assessment and taking into account relevant factors, the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing posed by a particular transaction, service or customer, and apply customer due diligence measures accordingly. While the Bill will give effect to the greater part of the Directive, some provisions (i.e. the establishment of registers of beneficial ownership of companies and trusts) will be transposed by the Department of Finance. </p><p>While my Department has responsibility for legislation addressing some aspects of white collar crime including fraud and corruption, other aspects, such as insider trading, Companies Acts offences and environmental offences, fall within the responsibility of other Government Departments. Relevant legislative enhancements in recent years include the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, the Companies Act 2014 and more broadly the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. </p><p>The breadth and diversity of the issues connected with this form of crime are such that no one piece of legislation could effectively address all of them and therefore legislation in this area is continuously under review and development.  Further developments in this area will be assisted by a forthcoming issues paper from the Law Reform Commission in relation to Regulatory Enforcement and Corporate Offences. l am also in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner in relation to the arrangements in place to investigate serious crime of this nature.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>Finally, I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop strategies aimed at targeting, dismantling and disrupting criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodology.  Garda&iacute; work closely with other bodies with relevant enforcement functions, including the ODCE.</p></reply>

Ongoing contributions to Revenue- approved pension schemes and personal pension plans are exempt from income tax (within limits) while the investment growth of such schemes and plans are also tax exempt.  Retirement benefits are taxable at drawdown at normal retirement age with the exception of the permissible tax-free retirement lump sum.  </p>  <p>  These concessionary tax treatments are not available to other savings arrangements.  This is because pre-retirement access to the benefits from pension schemes or plans is generally not permitted, as these arrangements (and the associated tax reliefs on contributions and pension fund growth) are designed to facilitate long term savings based on the principle that the benefits will be "locked away" to help fund an adequate income in retirement. </p>  <p>  The point at which pension savings can be accessed varies according to the type of savings vehicle and, in the case of occupational schemes, the scheme's particular rules.  It may be worth noting, however, that in many cases it is possible to access pension savings before the age of 65 and in some cases they can in fact be accessed from age 50.  It can also be possible to access savings early on grounds of ill health. </p>  <p>  I do not currently have any plans to extend the range of circumstances in which pension savings can be accessed early.</p></reply>

Contact is ongoing and as I previously advised a technical delegation will be travelling to Brazil to discuss the issue with Brazilian officials.  It should be noted that Brazil have not designated Ireland a tax haven.  The Brazilian Federal Revenue Service have advised that they have included Ireland on a tax list of countries with favourable tax regimes because our 12.5% corporation tax rate is below 17%, a level set by Brazilian legislation.  I disagree with the inclusion of Ireland on this list.  The 12.5% rate is a long established and important part of our overall tax system.  Focussing on the 12.5% rate ignores the existence of the 25% and 33% corporation tax rates.  It also creates a misleading impression that Ireland is a low corporate tax collecting country which is inaccurate.  We will continue to communicate with the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service and seek to provide clarity on our corporation tax regime.</p></reply>

Consequently, I established the Cost of Insurance Working Group and appointed Minister of State Eoghan Murphy as Chair.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group focussed on motor insurance in the first phase of its work, due to the fact that this had the widest impact on society and also because motor insurance premium increases had been the largest.  The Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was finalised in December 2016, approved by Cabinet on 10 January 2017, and subsequently published.  It contains 33 recommendations and 71 actions which are detailed in an action plan contained in the Report with agreed timelines for implementation.    </p>  <p>  The next phase of the Working Group's work will commence shortly and will focus on the cost of insurance for businesses.  Minister of State Murphy will make an announcement providing more detail on this in due course.  </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that many of the recommendations and action points contained in the Report on Motor Insurance will have a positive impact on the wider insurance sector, including the business insurance sector, through the creation of an enhanced claims environment, availability of data, and increased competitiveness.</p></reply>

The portion of this tax received from bookmakers with an annual turnover of less than &euro;2 million is not readily available.  However, Revenue advise that analysis suggests the majority of the receipts are paid by the larger companies and the share from those with an annual turnover of less than &euro;2 million is likely to be relatively small.</p><p>As it is not possible to separately identify the relevant bookmakers, there is no basis for Revenue to estimate a costing in relation to Question 4537-17.  However, a proposal to provide a tax relief or tax exemption for one sector of an industry, i.e. betting shops with an annual turnover of less than &euro;2 million, and not provide it to other sectors, such as for example the remote sector, would give rise to State Aid concerns.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-31a.350.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017013100065#WRG08600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 145, 147 to 159, inclusive, 193 to 204, inclusive, 208, 210 to 222, inclusive, 224, 225, 228 to 241, inclusive, 243 to 247, inclusive, 250, 253, 255, 259, 260 and 264 to 269, inclusive, together.</p><p>My Department has overall responsibility for policy development for education and training provision across the economy including the hospitality and tourism sector.  There are no plans to re-establish a dedicated training organisation for the sector, but rather to deliver the required education and training through the mainstream higher and further education and training sectors, in line with provision for other sectors.</p><p>The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGSFN) carried out a study on the future skills needs of the sector and the report of the study was published in November 2015.  The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020.  The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth.  The report provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth which is one the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025. </p><p>The Study assesses skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings.  The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020.  A key recommendation in the report was the need to set up of a National Oversight and Advisory Group comprising all the key hospitality stakeholders.</p><p>Following on this recommendation, the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group was established early last year, chaired by SOLAS for the first year.  To date the group has held seven meetings.  Membership of the Group includes the Restaurant Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotel Federation, Irish Hospitality Institute, Licenced Vintners Association, Vintners Federation of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Social Protection, Higher Education Authority, Skillnets, SOLAS, ETBs, IoTs, DIT and Quality and Qualifications Ireland.</p><p>The role of the Group is to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the EGFSN and to provide a forum for on-going collaboration in addressing the skills needs of the sector and to identify and progress actions to overcome barriers on its implementation.</p><p>The Group plan to publish a progress report later this year.  To date work has been undertaken on careers promotion via a range of fora, the launch of the <i>Tourism Insight</i>online programme &ndash;aimed at promoting careers in tourism and hospitality with particular reference to transition year and Youthreach participants.  Audits of both higher and further education facilities and courses are underway as well as the establishment of a Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet which aims to address key skills requirements of restaurants and catering companies to help drive the domestic hospitality sector, employment growth, talent attraction and retention. </p><p>Funded through the National Training Fund by my Department, the network plans to design tailored programmes covering all aspects of the restaurant, food and beverage industry to SMEs nationally, with a particular focus on career progression for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings and increase retention levels within the sector and is well placed to address key recommendations of the EGFSN 2015 Report on the Future Skills.</p><p>Last week, I launched the 2016-2020 Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, setting out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period to 2020.  The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals in 2015 and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year, to provide for the needs of all sectors, including hospitality and tourism.  Over the lifetime of the Action Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes representing a doubling of current activity.</p><p>Work is progressing on the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry Education and Training Board.  It is planned that this programme will commence later this year.  The Apprenticeship Council also recently approved development funding for a separate proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship.  The Apprenticeship Council will continue to work with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.  The funding for planned and forecast expansion in 2017 will see an additional &euro;20 million provided. </p><p>In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was begun by SOLAS in collaboration with ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice.  Networks of Employers have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers in identifying training needs, designing the training programmes, recruitment of learners and delivery of the training on and off the job.  The Career Traineeship model of work-based learning is currently being piloted with the Hospitality and Engineering sectors, with the involvement of seven ETBs.</p><p>Given the breadth and range of programmes within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, it is not possible to provide details of funding and places on a county by county basis across specific sectoral provision.  However, one way in which Solas classify FET provision is by the career areas which it serves.  The following table on provision in the FET sector, shows the total number of beneficiaries in the career areas of Food and Beverage and Tourism in each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards for 2015 along with that planned for 2016.  As yet, final 2016 figures are not available.</p><p>While it is not possible to give details of expenditure at the level of career areas, the scale of total investment in FET and the numbers served on both a full and part time basis are also included in the table. </p><p>In relation to the number of tourism and hospitality skills training positions within the higher education sector in 2015 and 2016 and the amount of funding allocated for tourism and hospitality skills training in the same years, it is not possible to give a breakdown by county as students can apply for courses throughout the country, through the CAO application process.  However the table on provision in the higher education sector gives a breakdown outlining the number of training positions and the total estimated funding allocated which is categorised by each individual Institute.</p><p>In 2015 the total number of student in higher education courses in this sector was 8,220 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;47.4million and in 2016 the total number of students for the sector was 8,033 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;48.4m.  The funding detailed in this response includes an estimation of grants allocated to these courses, student contribution and free fees.  The student numbers are calculated as full time equivalents (FTE) which includes part time and full time student counts.</p><p>This analysis of the higher education sector includes all courses within the following categories:  </p><p>- Tourism/Hotel/Leisure/Event </p><p>- Hospitality &amp;amp; Culinary </p><p>- Heritage &amp;amp; Cultural.</p><p>I also<font color="#1F497D"> </font>understand that a limited amount of complementary tourism-related business development and training supports are provided by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the agency responsible for encouraging, promoting and supporting tourism as a leading indigenous component of the Irish economy.  However, I have no role or responsibility in relation to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Matters relating to that agency and its training and business supports are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  If the parents of the child, the subject of this question, have specific concerns about his educational progress I would advise, in the first instance, that they speak to the Principal of the school with a view to raising these concerns with the school&rsquo;s assigned NEPS psychologist.  I have checked the matter with the local NEPS service and as yet no approach has been made by school authorities to NEPS in this connection.</p></reply>

Funding currently amounts to &euro;6.75 million annually.  This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.</p><p>The overall process used by the Secondary Education Committee involves the following:</p><p>- Submission of a completed application to the Secondary Education Committee.  Guidance is provided to parents in relation to the application process.</p><p>- The child must be a verified member of a recognised Protestant religion </p><p>- The child must be planning to attend a school included in block grant scheme </p><p>- Parents/guardians are means tested as part of the application process</p><p>- Grants are paid at different levels and not as a proportion of fees charged.</p><p>- Boarding grant is only available if child lives more than 30km from school.</p><p><b>Application Procedure:</b></p><p>- Application forms are sent in late October annually to schools</p><p>- Application forms are forwarded to parents </p><p>- Religion criteria is verified by a recognised clergy person</p><p>- Financial information and supporting documents (e.g. P60 tax form) is submitted to the Secondary Education Committee with the application form.</p><p>- Closing date for receipt of completed applications is 28th February.</p><p>- Applications are means tested and fully assessed by end of March</p><p>- Secondary Education Committee Board decides amount for each grant level in early April and provisional notification is issued thereafter to applicants</p><p>- Approved applications are offered by mid-May</p><p>- Grant funds accepted are paid directly to schools in 3 term payments.</p><p><b>Financial Criteria:</b></p><p>The means test establishes whether applicants are in need of financial assistance to afford to send their child to a secondary school that accords with their religious ethos.  It also assesses the level of assistance needed.  The threshold for the allocation of funding is calculated on an annual basis and is derived from a calculation based on the total number of eligible applications in relation to the available funds. </p><p>For example, the level and number of grants awarded in 2016/17 school year was as follows:<table><tr><th></th><th>Day Grants</th><th>Boarding Grants</th></tr><tr><td>No. of Grants awarded</td><td>1,377</td><td>867</td></tr><tr><td>Level of Grants awarded</td><td>&euro;261   - &euro;2,682</td><td>&euro;957   - &euro;7,629</td></tr></table></p></reply>

It was decided that such payments would be offered to those persons whose cases were not statute barred prior to their proceedings being discontinued and where the person can demonstrate that their circumstances involved sexual abuse of a school child by a primary or post-primary school employee in respect of whom there was a prior complaint of sexual abuse to a school authority (including an authority of a school in which the employee had previously worked) prior to the issue of the Department of Education guidelines to primary and post-primary schools in 1991 and 1992 respectively.</p>  <p>  For the purposes of the settlement of litigation and the Government&rsquo;s ex gratia scheme, there is no strict interpretation as to what constitutes a &ldquo;prior complaint.&rdquo;   The State must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there was a prior complaint but the State does not insist on a strict evidential standard in assessing the material put forward by an applicant.  A holistic analysis of the case is undertaken and a flexible approach is adopted.</p>  <p>  In assessing whether a settlement will be offered or whether an applicant comes within the ex gratia scheme, the State will consider instances of abuse which occurred in both primary and post-primary schools.  </p>  <p>  In assessing a case or application, the State works on the basis that a prior complaint includes not only complaints made to teachers but also complaints made to any person(s) in authority in a school. </p>  <p>  The conditions attached to the ex-Gratia scheme have been agreed by Government and allow for the State Claims Agency to make settlement offers where the claims come within the terms of the ECtHR Judgement and are not statute barred.</p>  <p>  I don't consider it necessary to revisit the terms of the scheme. </p></reply>

The system uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and information from my Department's own databases. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic analyses to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.</p>  <p>  When it is decided that a new school is required in an area, my Department runs a separate patronage process to decide who will operate the school. This patronage process incorporates consideration of, and the potential for, Irish-medium provision. It is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons, including patrons involved in Irish-medium provision and indeed any prospective patron which wishes to provide Irish-medium education, to apply for patronage of a new school under the patronage process. Parental preferences for each patron, together with the extent of diversity currently available in the area, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. In this regard, as part of the application process, prospective patrons must submit completed parental preferences for their model of patronage and also parental preference for Irish-medium or English-medium provision.</p>  <p>  Earlier this week, I announced my plans aimed at providing more multi-denominational and non-denominational schools across the country, in line with the choices of families and school communities.  The new plans incorporate the provision of additional multi-denominational schools in either of the nation&rsquo;s languages.  Accordingly, in addition to the patronage process which I have outlined above, this provides additional opportunities for increasing the number of multi-denominational, Irish-medium schools available to parents nationwide. </p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. </p>  <p>  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. </p>  <p>  The Staffing Schedule includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds.  The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.  This process includes a provision in which schools that are not gaining an additional teaching post under the developing schools criterion can submit an appeal to the independent Appeals Board.  This appeal criterion is targeted at those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places and so assist the response to demographic growth within their area. </p>  <p>  The Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places will arise.  The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Department of Social Protection, in addition to the Department&rsquo;s own databases.  With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic analyses at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.  </p>  <p>  On foot of the last nationwide demographic analyses, the establishment of four new primary schools and nine new post-primary schools to open in 2017 and 2018 was announced.   As part of this announcement, it was also stated that a range of areas nationwide are experiencing increased demographic pressure and will be kept under ongoing review by the Department.  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that every child has access to a school place - however, this may not always be in the school of their first choice. </p>  <p>  Where the demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of this additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school(s).</p>  <p>  In relation to new school provision, four new primary schools and nine new post-primary schools will open in 2017 and 2018 to provide additional school places in areas experiencing significant demographic pressure.  My Department is keeping all school planning areas under review to take account of updated data and the impact of ongoing and planned capacity increases in these areas.  My Department is focussed on ensuring that every child has access to a school place - however, this may not always be in the school of their first choice. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 sets out the resources available for schools for the 2017/18 school year.  This Budget represents the start of a major reinvestment in education, and the first phase of implementation of the Action Plan for Education, aimed at becoming the best education system in Europe within a decade.</p>  <p>  The budget provides for over 2,400 additional teaching posts for our primary and post-primary schools in the next school year.  This includes additional teaching posts to meet demographic need, curriculum reform, additional resource teaching posts and the strengthening of school leadership.</p></reply>

The Department of Education and Skills invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling: </p><p>- 63% of students to attend mainstream schools</p><p>- 23% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and</p><p>- 14% to attend special schools.</p><p>The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required. Special classes are part of a continuum of educational provision that enables students with more complex special educational needs to be educated, in smaller class groups, within their local mainstream schools and are forstudents who have a recommendation for a special class placement in their professional reports.</p><p>Special classes offer a supportive learning environment to students with ASD who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day. Special class for students with ASD are staffed with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level and 6:1.5 at post primary level, and also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children.</p><p>Students enrolled in special classes should be included in mainstream classes to the greatest extent possible, in line with their abilities.</p><p>The NCSE continues to engage with schools in opening special classes where there is an identified need for special class provision.</p><p>Progress in developing the network of Special Classes has been significant. </p><p>In 2011 there were 548 special classes, of which 224 were primary ASD classes, 72 were post primary ASD classes and 34 were early intervention classes. The remaining 218 were special classes service children with mild to moderate/severe general learning difficulties and specific learning difficulties including speech and language difficulties. </p><p>There are currently 1,153 special classes, which is an increase of over 100% on the number available in 2011.

Its first task was to formally invite proposals for new apprenticeship programmes from consortia of enterprise, professional bodies and education and training providers. Over 80 separate proposals were received all of which were evaluated by the Council. Included in these proposals are a number of proposals in the hospitality sector, particularly in the culinary area.</p>  <p>  Work is progressing on the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry Education and Training Board.  It is planned that this programme will commence in 2017. The Apprenticeship Council recently approved development funding for a separate proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship. The Council will continue to work closely with these consortia to develop their proposals into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware all statutory apprenticeships in Ireland must lead to an award on the National Framework of Qualifications.  Legislative amendments are necessary to facilitate the inclusion of awards made by non-national awarding bodies such as City and Guilds within the National Framework of Qualifications.  These amendments will be contained in the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Amendment) Bill.  The Heads of this Bill are currently being prepared by my Department in consultation with Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI).</p></reply>

As part of these commitments my Department undertook in 2013 to carry out a review of the Apprenticeship system in Ireland.</p>  <p>  An independent group produced the Review of Apprenticeship Training in Ireland, which was published in 2014.  The review contained a range of recommendations to expand participation of apprenticeship, including the establishment of an Apprenticeship Council.  The Council was established in November 2014 and immediately began work on a call for proposals for the development of new enterprise-led apprenticeships.  The call issued in January 2015 and over 80 proposals were received from industry stakeholders working with education and training providers.  The Apprenticeship Council has been working with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them in sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.  The funding for planned and forecast expansion in 2017 will see an additional &euro;20 million provided.</p>  <p>  An Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020 was launched on 26th January 2017 and sets out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period to 2020. 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes over the lifetime of the Action Plan, a doubling of current activity.</p>  <p>  The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals in 2017.  The Plan sets out a clear 10 step path for the development of new apprenticeships and also sets an overall development timeline for a new apprenticeship of 12-15 months.  The Plan also commits to examining the potential for public sector engagement with the apprenticeship system.</p>  <p>  The Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship, the first of the new programmes developed through the Apprenticeship Council&rsquo;s first call for proposals, launched in September 2016 and an Industrial Engineer Apprenticeship commenced in November 2016.  13 further new apprenticeships are due to launch later this year in various sectors including medical devices, polymer processing and financial services.</p>  <p>  In addition, a campaign to promote apprenticeship is currently being developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners, including the Apprenticeship Council. The campaign will raise awareness and promote the value of apprenticeship for individual apprentices and for employers and it will cover both existing apprenticeships and the new apprenticeships now coming on stream.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  NEPS psychologists are recruited via regional panels formed from national recruitment competitions administered by the Public Appointments Service (PAS). The previous panel which had existed in this regard had reached the end of its useful life and was closed in autumn 2016. A new national recruitment competition has been put in place by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) to fill vacancies within all NEPS Regions.  The resulting interview process associated with this competition will be completed in the current week immediately following which recruitment panels for each NEPS region will be formed.  PAS will then finalise the processing of the candidates, including Garda vetting, and propose each candidate in series to my Department Human Resources Section for contract negotiations and formal job offer.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the process will produce new NEPS psychologists for assignment to schools, including that to which the Deputy refers in his question, by the end of the current academic year. In the interim this school will continue to have access to the SCPA for its assessment needs. Direct support from NEPS to the school in the event of a critical incidents will in any case continue to be provided.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is reflected in the commitment that, by mid-2017, hotels should only be used in limited circumstances as emergency accommodation for families.  Full details and time frames in relation to the range of actions to address family homelessness are set out in <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, which is available on the website.</p><p>The increases in Rent Supplement and Housing Assistance Payment levels from 1 July 2016 will play an important role in the achievement of this overall objective, in terms of supporting families to remain in rented accommodation.  However, where families do find themselves in homelessness situations, there are a range of solutions in place and bring progressed.  These include the Housing Agency programme to acquire 1,600 units and the expanded HAP Homeless Pilot Scheme in Dublin, where some 800 homeless HAP tenancies were entered into by end-2016 and a further 1,200 tenancies are targeted for 2017 across the Dublin Region.  A rapid-build programme is also in place, with over 350 rapid-build homes advancing at end-2016.  My Department engages with the Dublin Region local authorities on a regular and on-going basis in relation to the delivery of these initiatives. </p><p>Overall, it is important to note that the significant programme of actions underway has resulted in an estimated 2,700 exits from homelessness being achieved nationally in 2016, a significant increase on the comparable figure of 2,322 in 2015. </p></reply>

It was open to all local authorities to apply, with funding to be allocated on the basis of a competitive bid process.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p><p>Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities.  However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  Many of the provisions are outdated and not suitable for business trends in the modern era.  I have asked my Department to develop proposals for the preparation of a consolidated Rates Bill to modernise and consolidate the legislation in this area.  Among the measures being considered for the General Scheme of the Bill are provisions to allow a local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support, inter alia, urban regeneration and rural development. </p><p>The Government recently launched <i>Realising Our Rural Potential: The Action Plan for Rural Development.</i>The Plan is aimed at delivering real change for people living and working in rural Ireland and includes a specific action to determine the feasibility of enabling local authorities to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support rural development policy objectives.

The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters except appeals of valuation procedures set out under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, as amended, which comes under the remit of an independent Valuation Tribunal.  The Valuation Acts come under the aegis of my colleague, the Tanaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality. </p>  <p>  Under Part 5 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, the Commissioner of Valuation is conducting a revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State.  To date, revaluations have been completed in South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Dublin City Council, Waterford City and County Council and Limerick City and County Council.  I understand that revaluations in 10 local authorities, including Kildare, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo and Westmeath County Councils are due to be completed this year with valuations to take effect for rates purposes for 2018. </p>  <p>  I am aware of recent media reports that certain business owners have stated that they will face higher rates bills.  However, it is not the purpose of a revaluation to increase or decrease the total amount of commercial rates collected by local authorities but rather to ensure that the valuations used for rating purposes are up-to-date and reflect current market conditions.  With this in mind, it is possible that some ratepayers may see the rateable valuation of their properties increase while other ratepayers may see the rateable valuation of their properties decrease.  Section 56 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, as amended by section 8 of the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Act 2006, provides that I, as Minister, can make an order directing a rating authority to limit the overall amount of income it could raise through rates in the year following a revaluation to the total amount of rates liable to be paid to it in the previous year, adjusted for inflation.  Rate limitation orders have been made in each of the local authorities that have undergone a revaluation to date and I will be making further orders later this year in respect of the rating authorities currently undergoing revaluations. </p></reply>

The primary purpose of the Act is to replace the system whereby a vehicle was declared off the road retrospectively with a system under which the vehicle must be declared off the road in advance.  The system of making retrospective declarations had become a means of evasion of motor tax estimated to have cost some &euro;50m annually.</p><p>The Act provides that a vehicle can be declared off the road for a minimum period of three months and a maximum period of twelve months.  Where the owner of a vehicle wishes to make a declaration of non-use, he or she must do so during the final month of an existing tax disc or a previously made declaration of non-use.  The declaration can be made on-line at or through the local motor tax office.  The National Vehicle and Driver File, under the auspices of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, issues renewal notices at the beginning of the final month of tax or a previously made declaration of non-use to remind motorists that the vehicle must be either taxed or declared off the road for a further period. </p><p>Where a declaration of non-use is not made in the final month of a tax disc or previously made declaration of non-use, a vehicle must be taxed for the minimum period provided for in motor tax legislation for the category of vehicle concerned. A new declaration can then be made at any stage during the final month of the new motor tax disc if the vehicle is thereafter not going to be in use in a public place.</p><p>These arrangements were well publicised at the time of introduction of the legislation.</p></reply>

As set out in the recently published <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>, this commitment is to be progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones.  Lands held by local authorities in rent pressure zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent , targeting middle income households, in mixed tenure developments.  The cost of providing rental units is to be permanently reduced by lowering the initial investment and development costs for providers - AHB or private - allowing the rental units to be made available at below market prices without the need for ongoing rental subsidies.</p><p>The local authorities concerned will identify a number of sites with the potential for up to 1,000 units of accommodation and will move forward, as soon as possible, to issue calls for proposals from parties interested in developing projects.  As speed of delivery will be critically important, appropriate licence arrangements, incorporating clear timescales for delivery, will be a key feature of the process.</p><p>This programme is being co-ordinated with the dedicated measures in <i><i>Rebuilding Ireland </i></i>to accelerate housing output from the Major Urban Housing Delivery Sites, including support from the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) where necessary.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s grant &ndash; towards the organisation&rsquo;s core costs - amounts to &euro;507,000 in 2017.</p>  <p>  Since 2014, my Department has allocated a grant of &euro;150,000 in additional funding to Irish Water Safety for drowning prevention measures. Deaths by drowning have ranged between 110 and 140 per annum in the years 2012 to 2015.  The factors that influence drownings are many and complicated but promoting awareness has a measurable effect.  In recognition of the tremendous work by Irish Water Safety in the promotion of water safety, I have increased this additional funding to &euro;500,000 in 2017.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with Irish Water Safety to ensure that the resources available are used to their fullest potential and to support them in developing responses to water safety challenges.</p></reply>

A table setting out the details of the three bands and the limits currently applicable in each housing authority area is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>.</p><p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.  The maximum net income threshold for a household in Co. Tipperary is therefore &euro;30,000. </p><p>Income is defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy which was issued by the Minister under Regulation 17 of the 2011 Regulations.  The policy sets out the manner in which housing authorities are to assess the means of any household seeking social housing support.  Net income is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge.  The policy defines the types of income to be taken into consideration when assessing eligibility for social housing support.  Authorities do have discretion to disregard income that is considered to be temporary, short-term or once off in nature and which is outside the regular pattern of a person&rsquo;s income.</p><p>The limits will continue to be kept under review by my Department, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda set out in the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>.</p></reply>

These procurement arrangements are the normal national and EU procurement requirements, as required by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of all publicly-funded capital projects.  As major public sector bodies, local authorities deal with procurement on an ongoing basis across many areas of activity, not just social housing construction.  Accordingly, they have a strong level of experience and expertise in the area of procurement.</p><p>However, I recognise that the ramping up of social housing activity in line with the targets of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>will create additional challenges for local authorities and AHBs.  Accordingly, <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>contains a commitment that the Housing Agency will establish a new Housing Procurement Unit to provide a procurement centre of excellence and advice in support of local authorities and AHBs in the accelerated delivery of their social housing programmes.  The Procurement Unit has now been established and I look forward to the positive benefits it will bring in assisting social housing delivery.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.    As part of the capital funding supports provided by my Department, funding of 50% is provided to housing authorities for the purchase of &lsquo;Emergency Replacement Mobiles&rsquo;.  An emergency in this respect is an unanticipated event, such as flood/storm/fire damage, that would render a caravan/mobile uninhabitable or dangerous to live in.  Non-emergency replacements i.e. where mobiles falls into disrepair over time due to lack of maintenance, are expected to be anticipated and preventative action taken by the owner/Local Authority.

A household may apply for support to one housing authority only, which may be the authority for the area in which the household normally resides or with which it has a local connection, or the authority that agrees, at its discretion, to assess the household for support. In determining whether a household has a local connection with its area, a housing authority must have regard to whether a household member:  - lived in the area for a continuous five- year period at any time in the past,</p><p>- is employed in the area or within 15 km of the area,</p><p>- is in full-time education, or attending specialist medical care in the area, or</p><p>- has a relative (defined in the Regulations) living in the area for two years or longer.</p><p>A household meeting either the residence or local connection condition may specify up to three areas of choice for receipt of support in the areas of all housing authorities in the county and city concerned and, if qualified, will be entered on the housing waiting list of each of those housing authorities. Thus, a household that applies to Galway City Council could, if qualified for support, be also entered on the waiting list of Galway County Council without having to make a separate application to the latter.</p><p>I am not aware of households qualified with Galway City Council for social housing support, which includes the Housing Assistance Payment scheme, having to reapply to Galway County Council to avail of the scheme.  However, if the Deputy wishes to furnish further details on the matter, I will arrange for my Department to follow up on the matter.</p></reply>

It is only certain programmes for the improvement of existing stock for which annual allocations are provided to local authorities.  In respect of the provision of new social housing, funding is provided to local authorities under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Capital Investment programme to deliver additional social housing stock through new construction projects and through the acquisition of new and previously owned houses and apartments to accommodate persons on local authority social housing waiting lists.</p><p>Arising from the Social Housing Strategy, targets and provisional funding allocations were notified to each local authority , including Galway City and Galway County Councils, from 2015 out to end-2017.  These targets are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i></i>.</p><p>The Galway authorities have a combined target of 1,126 social housing units to end-2017, supported by an allocation of &euro;58.5m, to be invested in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes.</p><p>Following on from the notification of these targets, approvals for a substantial number of new social housing projects have issued, details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:  -</p><p><i> </i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>. </i></p><p>These include over 270 new housing units in respect of the Galway authorities, supported by investment of some &euro;45 million. Additional projects in respect of Galway County Council that have also been approved which are not listed at the above links are: <table><tr><th>Location </th><th>AHB </th><th>Estimated <br /><br />Cost </th><th>No. of <br /><br />Units </th></tr><tr><td>Rossaveal Cottages, Ros &aacute; Mh&iacute;l <br /><br />Connemara </td><td>Tearmann Eanna Teo </td><td>&euro;1,175,000 </td><td>8 </td></tr><tr><td>Caheroyn, Athenry </td><td>Peter Triest Housing Association </td><td>&euro;407,000 </td><td>3 </td></tr></table></p><p>In addition to the above projects, under the &euro;300 million public private partnership (PPP) model for new social housing, 73 new units are earmarked for a site at Ballyburke in Galway City. </p><p>As well as capital-funded projects, the Galway local authorities have also been collaborating with a number of AHBs to deliver additional social housing through the CALF (Capital Advance Leasing Facility) scheme. In 2016, there were 15 new social homes delivered in this way and a healthy pipeline for future delivery is in place, with approvals made for the delivery of a further 204 units across 9 projects by AHBs. </p><p>I am keen that all local authorities advance all of these projects as soon as possible and I have assured them that funding is available to fully support their efforts in this regard. </p><p>In 2016, capital funding for housing delivery by Galway City Council was self-funded from their local property tax receipts.  A total of &euro;2,173,786 of self-funding was expended across a range of capital housing programmes, with &euro;607,625 of this contributed towards their local authority housing construction and acquisition programmes.  My Department provided &euro;1,230,910 to Galway County Council to support them in the delivery of their local authority housing construction and acquisition programmes, with a further &euro;3,199,866 provided for projects by AHBs under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme. </p><p>In respect of the number of new units built and completed with this funding, my Department publishes a wide range of statistical information on housing delivery, including information on social housing units constructed and acquired in respect of all local authorities and AHBs.  This is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i>.</i></p><p>The information on the website is currently provided up to the end of quarter 3 of 2016; information for the last quarter of 2016 is currently being finalised and will be published shortly.</p></reply>

We continue to be committed to these objectives notwithstanding the immigration policy agenda of the new Administration.</p>  <p>  The Government has raised the issue of immigration reform with US interlocutors &ndash; including at the highest levels &ndash; on many occasions.  I personally raised the issue when I met then-Secretary of State John Kerry in Co. Tipperary, on 30 October 2016.  I also raised it when I spoke to Speaker Paul Ryan by telephone on 23 November 2016. </p>  <p>  The Government has also availed of every opportunity to sensitise the incoming Administration to our concerns and interests regarding immigration reform, and the plight of the undocumented Irish in particular.  The Taoiseach raised the matter in his separate telephone conversations with President Trump and Vice-President Pence in the days following the Presidential election. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious that this is a time of worry and uncertainty for our undocumented Irish citizens in the United States.  This issue will therefore be high on the agenda for my visit to Washington DC later this week.  In my engagements with the new US Administration and Congress, I plan to avail of all appropriate opportunities to raise the plight of the undocumented Irish citizens and to explore any viable way of providing them with some measure of reassurance and relief.  Moreover, the forthcoming St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day engagements will provide a further opportunity to express to senior figures in the new Administration and Congress our concerns and policy objectives in relation to the undocumented.  </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to use high-level visits to and from the US, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic representation in the United States, to advance these aims.  The Embassy in Washington has worked closely with members of the US Congress - in both the House of Representatives and the US Senate, and on both sides of the aisle &ndash; to advance progress on this matter and will continue to do so.  We are fortunate to be able to draw on the assistance of the Friends of Ireland in Congress and the many representatives of Irish-America, who appreciate our concerns.  I will be meeting some of these senior leaders this week in Washington and will ask for their continuing support for our undocumented citizens.</p>  <p>  In addition to these political efforts, our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the United States will continue to engage with Irish community groups in relation to their concerns.  On 12 January, Ambassador Anderson convened a meeting of senior immigration stakeholders at our Embassy in Washington in order to hear directly from those who work most-closely with the undocumented Irish.</p>  <p>  We will also continue to support organisations that deliver frontline advisory services and community care to Irish emigrants through the Emigrant Support Programme.  More than 70% of the funds allocated through this programme are directed towards welfare services, including in support of the undocumented Irish in the U.S. In the last funding round for the Emigrant Support Programme, organisations in the U.S. were allocated more than &euro;2.3 million in funding.  The Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our Embassy in Washington continue to work closely with Irish-American community leaders in actively pursuing all viable opportunities to advance immigration reform.  We will encourage and promote any realistic possibilities for a solution that may arise.</p></reply>

Within my Department, the key Divisions are the European Union Division and the Ireland, UK and Americas (IUKA) Division, both headed at Second Secretary General level. Additional resources have been assigned to both Divisions to cover the issues arising from the UK exit process.  The European Union Division contains a specific team focused on the EU-UK negotiations.  Within the IUKA Division, there are teams focused on Northern Ireland and on wider British-Irish Relations; their duties include Brexit related issues.</p>  <p>  In effect, most branches of the Department at its headquarters in Dublin are involved in some way as part of the response to the UK exit, for example the Legal Division, the Trade Division and also the Policy Planning Unit.  In addition, there is also an intra-Departmental senior management group on issues relating to the UK exit, chaired by the Secretary General and comprising senior officials from across all relevant business units of the Department.</p>  <p>  In addition, a number of officers of my Department are seconded to the Department of the Taoiseach and working on EU matters, while two officers are seconded to the International and EU Relations Division of the Department of Finance. </p>  <p>  In terms of Irish offices focused on work relating to the UK exit, specific posts have been assigned to our Embassies in London, Berlin, and Paris as well as the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels and at HQ in Dublin.  The Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels has a unit dedicated to managing our response to this issue.</p>  <p>  These measures comprise the initial phase of our response to the UK decision to leave the EU and matters remain under review as the Government carries out its work in response to the UK referendum decision and as preparations for the forthcoming negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU intensify.</p>  <p>  In general terms, all of our diplomatic Missions across the EU and further afield are working on this issue.</p></reply>

It behoves Israel therefore to make every effort to resolve their position peacefully and by consent, so far as is possible.</p>  <p>  One cannot but be struck therefore by the contrast with the enormous lengths to which the authorities go to avoid executing similar orders against Jewish settlements and outposts illegally constructed on Palestinian land, and the use of extensive physical force in this case, including recourse to live fire. </p>  <p>  The Irish Ambassador in Tel Aviv met leaders of the Arab minority, including a number of members of the Knesset Joint List, last week, and received a detailed briefing on their concerns.  The Embassy will continue to monitor developments consistent with the heavy demands on our limited resources in the region, including the issues in the occupied territory which must remain a primary focus of our efforts.</p></reply>

Such independent evaluations play an essential role in assessing the impact of the Irish Aid programme, identifying ways to improve on its delivery, and providing accountability for public funds spent.</p><p>The Uganda evaluation report, which was completed in 2015, included a number of important findings. Overall, it found that the Irish Aid programme delivered significant results in reducing poverty, expanding access to social services and generating awareness of gender and gender-based violence.  It also documented the significant impact of Irish Aid&rsquo;s investment in education in the poorest part of Uganda, the Karamoja region.</p><p>The evaluation report provided valuable recommendations to improve the delivery of the aid programme. Taking these recommendations into consideration, new Uganda Country Strategy, for the years 2016-2020, has streamlined and prioritised sectors in line with need and in areas where most progress is possible.  The programme has a particular focus on the Karamoja region, focusing on education, HIV/AIDS prevention, social protection and governance.</p><p>The new Country Strategy also includes, as recommended, an explicit risk management system to safeguard our investment in development, and to ensure the Embassy can monitor and respond to any changes in the working environment.  No funding is currently being channelled through the Ugandan public financial management system.  I am confident that the recommendations outlined in the 2015 evaluation have been taken on board in the new Strategy.  I was pleased to launch this Strategy during my visit to Uganda in July 2016, where I witnessed first-hand how our aid programme is being delivered, and the impact it is having on the poorest and most vulnerable.  The Strategy, and the Evaluation, are available on the Irish Aid website at .</p></reply>

The full text as issued by my office was as follows:</p><blockquote>Ireland condemns the recent announcements by Israeli authorities of further settlement construction.<br /><br />The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Charlie Flanagan TD, has condemned recent announcements by Israeli authorities of further settlement construction in the occupied Palestinian Territories.<br /><br />Minister Flanagan said: &quot;Ireland's views on Israeli settlements couldn&rsquo;t be clearer.  Indeed, the views of the international community on settlements couldn&rsquo;t be clearer &ndash; they are comprehensively set out in UN Security Council Resolution 2334 and in the declaration of the Paris Conference which I participated earlier this month.  These settlements are illegal, they actively undermine the prospects for a sustainable negotiated two-state solution, and the relentless expansion of settlements inherently involves injustice and provocation for Palestinians.<br /><br />&quot;These most recent announcements, proposing more than 3,000 units, are deeply disappointing.  Such actions serve only to undermine Israel&rsquo;s reputation and the credibility of its government&rsquo;s declarations of support for a negotiated, peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<br /><br />&quot;In particular, the intention to proceed with new settlements in East Jerusalem only serves to call further into question the commitment of the Israeli government to engage in meaningful negotiations aimed at achieving a two-State solution.<br /><br />&quot;Ireland remains steadfast in its support for a comprehensive two state solution which protects the future of both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.<br /><br />I call for an end to all settlement construction, and the reversal of these announcements.&quot;</blockquote></reply>

This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations will work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on completed OPW flood defence schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  II members have committed to take into account all information provided by OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas.</p>  <p>  The Memorandum came into effect on 1 June, 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the OPW to II in respect of 12 completed flood defence schemes and showing the design, extent and nature of the protection offered by these works.  A further tranche of data was provided to II in January 2015 covering a further 4 completed flood defence schemes.  OPW will continue to provide data to II as flood defence schemes are completed.</p>  <p>  II estimates that flood cover is included as standard in 98% of household insurance policies throughout the country.  II has carried out a number of surveys among its members to ascertain the extent to which flood insurance cover is available in the areas for which OPW has provided data on completed flood defence schemes.  The results of the most recent survey were provided in December last year; they indicate that 83% of property insurance policies in these areas include cover against flood risk.  Where the defences are permanent in nature the percentage is 90%; where demountable defences are used the percentage is 77%.</p>  <p>  In line with Action No. 270 of the Action Plan for Rural Development, the OPW and the Department of Finance are now engaging with II on a quarterly basis.  At the most recent meeting on 8 December 2016, it was decided that a sub group be established to explore the legal, technical and administrative arrangements that may allow for the further sharing of data on flood insurance cover for those 300 areas where the OPW has mapped the flood risk through the CFRAM Programme.  This sub group held its first meeting on 18 January last.</p>  <p>  I am happy with the work of the Group thus far and am confident that it will continue to progress the issue of flood insurance.</p></reply>

The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.</p>  <p>  Public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts.  In this regard applicants are required to make declarations in relation to their financial standing, their legal standing and in relation to payment of taxes and social contributions.</p>  <p>  Prior to the award of a public works contract, the successful applicant is also required to produce a current Tax Clearance Certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.  Under our national rules, any non-resident contractor being awarded a public contract must provide a Tax Clearance Certificate issued by Revenue confirming that the firm's tax affairs are in order and that it has complied with its tax obligations in this jurisdiction. Additional information in relation to tax requirements for non-resident contractors can be obtained at www.revenue.ie.</p>  <p>  The management of the tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.</p>  <p>  Once awarded, the conditions of the public works contracts require the contractor to certify compliance with employment law, to maintain records of all those employed on the site, regardless of whether they are employees of the contractor or their subcontractors, and the hours worked by them.  Where requested, the contractor must also provide details of the payments made to those employed on the site.</p>  <p>  Where the contractor fails to comply with their obligations under the contract or employment law, deductions may be made from payments due under the contract until the situation is rectified.</p>  <p>  Enforcement of tax, social welfare and employment law are matters for the relevant State authorities.</p></reply>

In Ireland's case, the main potential beneficiaries of EFSI are likely to be commercial investment projects (including PPPs). There is little or no scope to use EFSI to increases public capital investment due to the need to continue to comply with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. The Deputy may wish to note that my Department is not the lead Department in relation to EFSI, nor has my Department responsibility for coordinating applications for funding under EFSI or for reporting on lending by EFSI or EIB to Ireland.  However, I understand information on projects approved by EFSI, by country, is available on the website of the EIB at<i></i>.</p></reply>

It is the first Plan of its kind to address both the economic and social needs of rural Ireland through a whole-of-Government approach.

These actions are spread over five thematic pillars aimed at:</p><p>- Supporting Sustainable Communities,</p><p>- Supporting Enterprise and Employment,</p><p>- Maximising our Rural Tourism and Recreation Potential,</p><p>- Fostering Culture and Creativity in rural communities, and</p><p>- Improving Rural Infrastructure and Connectivity. </p><p>Initiatives under the Plan will be rolled out by various Government Departments and State agencies, and will benefit all rural communities, including those in Co. Tipperary. </p><p>As far as my own Department is concerned, along with Minister Ring I will shortly be launching calls for proposals under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the CL&Aacute;R programme, the Rural Recreation Scheme and the Built Heritage Investment scheme. There will also be &euro;40 million available this year for the delivery of the LEADER Rural Development Programme.</p><p>I will also be increasing access to the arts in rural communities, including through the roll out of a new small grants scheme for upgrades to regional arts and culture centres. </p><p>Overall funding for Regional and Rural Programmes in my Department&rsquo;s Estimate has increased from a figure of &euro;61.2 million in 2016, to &euro;79.2 million in 2017 - an increase of 29%.

As part of Budget 2017, I have secured funding of &euro;12 million for an enhanced Town and Village Renewal scheme this year.  This represents a trebling of the original 2016 baseline allocation of &euro;4 million for the scheme. The Town and Village Renewal Scheme for 2017 will be launched shortly and towns and villages involved in the scheme, including in County Meath, will be selected through an application and assessment process. The scheme will be funded by my Department and administered by the Local Authorities. </p>  <p>  As part of the scheme, I intend to launch a pilot project to encourage residential occupancy in rural towns and villages.  This pilot will be launched separately in the second half of the year, when details of the scheme have been finalised in consultation with relevant Departments.  The pilot will examine ways in which properties that are currently not in use in town centres can be renovated to allow them to be used for residential purposes.</p></reply>

The increase in the Arts Council's allocation in 2017 is &euro;5 million, or 8%, and will assist the Council greatly in implementing its 10-year strategy Making Great Art Work (2016-2025).  I also secured an increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board, representing a 14% increase in its annual budget.  This increase in funding will allow the Board to invest more in Irish talent in the year ahead and follows on from a very successful year for the Irish film sector, particularly the indigenous film sector. </p><p>Budget 2017 also includes:</p><p>- increased funding for all of the National Cultural Institutions;</p><p>- an increase of &euro;1 million for Culture Ireland;</p><p>- an additional &euro;1 million to the Heritage Council; and</p><p>- funding of &euro;5m for the implementation of a Legacy Programme now known as the <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i>and the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in the draft framework policy Culture 2025/&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach which I published in July last year. </p><p>All of this represents real and substantial funding increases across the arts and cultural area and has been welcomed across the sector.  It re-affirms the commitment of this Government to progressively increase funding for the arts as the economy improves, as set out in <i>the Programme for a Partnership Government.</i></p><p>As previously pointed out to the Deputy, the source of the reference to 0.6% of GDP is a Council of Europe research project and that many European countries, including ten EU member states, are not included in the data. I understand also that the data is not standardised and is not comparable across countries.  For example, local authority expenditure on the arts, the artists' exemption tax relief, expenditure on public service broadcasting and the Irish language are not included in the figures for Ireland but comparable figures are included in the data for some other countries.</p></reply>

The process included full public consultation and an in-depth review of all proposed candidate sites.    </p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department has engaged with local authorities and local groups from the areas with proposals on the Tentative List to gauge the extent of the support available to advance the proposals and to clarify the work and resources required for that purpose.  The fundamental requirement is that each site must be capable of demonstrating Outstanding Universal Value to UNESCO. </p>  <p>  Of the sites featuring on the Tentative List, the greater progress so far has been with the Royal Sites serial nomination which includes Cashel, D&uacute;n Ailinne, the Hill of Uisneach, the Rathcroghan Complex, the Tara Complex and Navan Fort (Eamhain Macha).  Technical evaluations have been produced for each of the six component sites and, earlier this month, my Department convened a meeting of stakeholders from all six locations to review progress and to chart the next steps.  It was agreed that the technical evaluations would be sent for international peer review following which work will need to begin on developing draft management plans for each site, including designation of core and buffer zones in each case.  A further plenary meeting of this group is scheduled for next April.  The process will also have to take into account that some sites will be managed by the Office of Public Works, others by local authorities, that two are privately owned and that Eamhain Macha is in Northern Ireland.  The culmination of these steps, which will also have to be adopted with each of the other tentative list nominations, would be the creation of the full nomination documents for each site for submission to UNESCO. </p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting the current proposals in every way that I can.  The process is undoubtedly both complex and lengthy and the work at every stage must be supported and developed from the local level up with stakeholder buy-in and commitment at every stage.  While this adds to the timescale, it avoids a top down approach lacking the engagement necessary with local communities to secure full support for the proposals and for the protection and preservation of the sites into the future. </p></reply>

This increased allocation will further enable my Department, acting in co-operation with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and relevant stakeholders at community level, to implement a range of specific and practical measures aimed at both supporting the implementation of the Strategy, as well as the language planning process in Gaeltacht areas. </p><p>A further increase of &euro;1m in current funding provided in my Department&rsquo;s Vote this year for the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and Islands programme area will enable my Department to allocate extra resources to Gaeltacht support schemes such as the Irish Language Summer Colleges and Gaeltacht community groups funded by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</p><p>In relation to the economic development of the Gaeltacht, as Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, I very much appreciate the importance of job creation in helping to retain sustainable communities in Gaeltacht areas.

In Budget 2017, I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council.  This will see an increase in the Arts Council allocation in 2017 of &euro;5m, or 8%, and will assist the Council in implementing its 10-year strategy <i>Making Great Art Work (2016-2025).</i>This strategy places specific emphasis on the need to plan and provide for children and young people.  The 5 high-level values of the strategy include a commitment to excellence, as well as respect for diversity of artistic practice, of public engagement, and of social and cultural traditions.  The strategy also commits to working to achieve full implementation of the Arts in Education Charter.  The Strategy is available on the website of the Arts Council.</p><p>The <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i>is the Government&rsquo;s Legacy Programme for Ireland 2016 and the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in Culture 2025/&Eacute;&iacute;re Ild&aacute;nach the draft framework policy which I published in July of last year.  It is a five-year all-of-government initiative, from 2017 to 2022, which places creativity at the centre of public policy. </p><p>The Programme is built around five pillars one of which <i>Enabling Creativity in Every Community. </i>The Centenary Programme demonstrated two critically important aspects of local governance: first, local authorities are the primary instruments of community engagement and second, local authorities have a particular capacity for local programme delivery, especially in the context of citizen engagement.  Further details of the Creative Ireland Programme can be accessed at the following link .</p><p>In addition to the Creative Ireland Programme, I recently launched the Action Plan for Rural Development which is the first whole-of-government strategy aimed at people living and working in rural Ireland.  It aims to unlock the potential of rural Ireland through a framework of supports at national and local level which will ensure that people who live in rural areas have increased opportunities for employment locally, and access to public services and social networks that support a high quality of life.

This study has commenced and will examine the economic impact and potential of the Irish film, TV and animation sector and analyse the scale and economic contribution of the screen-based creative industries and examine its potential to expand further.  The study, when complete, will help to inform Government strategies and initiatives as we seek to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a home of creative talent.</p><p>My Department will continue to promote the creative industries and economic development across its remit including, for example, through the recently published <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i>and <i>Action Plan for Rural Development.</i><i></i></p><p>The <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i>is the Government&rsquo;s Legacy Programme for Ireland 2016 and the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in Culture 2025/&Eacute;&iacute;re Ild&aacute;nach the draft framework policy which I published in July of last year.  It is a five-year initiative, from 2017 to 2022, which places creativity at the centre of public policy. </p><p>The <i>Action Plan for Rural Development</i>is the first whole-of-government strategy aimed at people living and working in rural Ireland.  It aims to unlock the potential of rural Ireland through a framework of supports at national and local level which will ensure that people who live in rural areas have increased opportunities for employment locally, and access to public services and social networks that support a high quality of life.  The Plan is spread across five pillars and the fourth pillar is Fostering Culture and Creativity in Rural Communities.

I am also hosting a Sectoral Dialogue on Brexit in Cavan on Monday 6th February.

Planning began before the UK referendum and analysis has deepened across Government since then.  The programme of engagement by the Government with other EU Governments and the EU institutions, including the Commission&rsquo;s Brexit Negotiations Task Force, is already underway and will be intensified in 2017.  This activity is reinforced by extensive engagement at diplomatic and official level.  In that regard, I met with Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, Vice President of the European Commission last November. </p>  <p>  The Government has also put in place a number of structural and other arrangements to address issues relating to Brexit.  These include an inter-Departmental Group that was formed in April 2016.  My Department has been represented on the Inter-Departmental Group since its establishment.  In addition, a Working Group, chaired at Assistant Secretary level and composed of officials from across the Department was established within my Department to deal with Brexit issues.  This Working Group is supported by the Department's EU Coordination Unit which is also responsible for managing those issues relating to Brexit that fall within my Department&rsquo;s remit.  These arrangements are being kept under review and will be enhanced if required in the coming period.</p></reply>

For example, the Department consulted widely with the arts and culture sector in preparing Ireland&rsquo;s first draft framework policy <i>Culture 2025/&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach</i>which I published in July last year.  The preparation of this document was supported by a steering group and wider expert group drawn from the sector.  The draft document was submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for input.  I understand that the Committee is currently preparing a report on the draft framework policy which I will consider when received.  </p><p>In the meantime, I believe that it is important to continue momentum in terms of delivery of the priorities set out in the framework policy and to build on the positive legacy of the <i>Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme.</i></p><p>To that effect therefore, on December 8<sup>th</sup>last, the Taoiseach and I launched the <i>Creative Ireland Programme/Cl&aacute;r &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach</i>as the Government&rsquo;s Legacy Programme arising out of the <i>Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme</i>and as the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in <i>Culture 2025. </i>The <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i>is a high-level, high-ambition, all-of-Government initiative to mainstream creativity in the life of the nation.</p><p>My Department is now working to implement the Creative Ireland Programme with partners across Government and other key stakeholders including those working in the sector.  I will continue to keep the process and structures for consultation under review as we work through the implementation phase.</p><p>It should also be noted that under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council also has a function of advising and providing information on the arts to the Minister and to the Government.</p></reply>

This will focus on boosting cultural provision and participation in communities and harnessing the goodwill and engagement generated by the 2016 commemorative programme. </p><p>The core proposition of this programme is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.  The programme is based on five pillars:</p><p>- Enabling the creative potential of every child</p><p>- Enabling creativity in every community</p><p>- Investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure</p><p>- Establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production</p><p>- Unifying our global reputation</p><p>The second pillar &ndash; Enabling creativity in every community &ndash; will be implemented primarily through our local authorities.  This is because local authorities are the primary instruments of community engagement and second, local authorities have a particular capacity for local programme delivery, especially in the context of citizen engagement.</p><p>I have asked local authorities to establish a Culture Team bringing together arts officers, librarians, heritage officers, museum curators, archivists and other relevant personnel which will be led by a Director of Services, with a nominated person as 'Creative Ireland Co-ordinator'.  The primary role of the Culture Team will be to develop a Culture and Creativity Plan, reflecting the overall structure and aims of the national strategy programme, and then to drive public participation in creative cultural activity in ach local authority area.</p><p>I have made a specific allocation of &euro;1million to the local authorities towards the implementation of the 2017 Creative Ireland Plans out of the overall funding of &euro;5m which I secured in Budget 2017 to underpin this new initiative.</p></reply>

Mr Kerr submitted his final report to An Post on 23rd December last.</p>  <p>  The role of the Post Office Hub Working Group was to identify potential models under which the post offices could act as community hubs, especially in rural areas.

A Monitoring Committee, which will be chaired by Minister Heather Humphreys, will meet on a regular basis to monitor the progress of each of the actions in the Plan.

It is the first plan of its kind to take a cohesive and coordinated approach across the whole of Government to both economic and rural development. </p><p>The Action Plan collates both new and existing rural development policies and initiatives from across Government under one cover, and the monitoring mechanisms set out in the Plan will drive their implementation.  This approach will ensure that rural development policies are cohesive, effective and fully implemented for the benefit of rural communities. </p><p>The actions contained in the Plan represent firm commitments from Government Departments and agencies.  Funding for the actions will be reflected in the Estimate of the relevant Department.  Many of the funding components are new, or have only been announced in recent weeks, in anticipation of the Action Plan being published.  Examples of new investments include:</p><p>- Up to &euro;60 million over the next three years to rejuvenate over 600 rural towns and villages.</p><p>- A doubling of funding for flood risk schemes to &euro;100 million per annum by 2021.</p><p>- &euro;6 million for investment in the development of Blueways.</p><p>- &euro;10 million to be invested in our National Parks and Nature Reserves.</p><p>- A &euro;10 million (50%) increase in funding under the SEAI&rsquo;s Better Energy Communities Programme, which will total &euro;30 million for 2017.</p><p>- A new Community CCTV grant scheme will be introduced by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, while significant investment in the Seniors Alert Scheme will also be made by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. </p><p>It is important to bear in mind, however, that many of the commitments in the Action Plan involve new policy initiatives which will not necessarily require additional funding to have a positive impact. </p><p>As far as my own Department is concerned, I do not foresee the need for a supplementary Estimate this year.  Funding for regional and rural programmes in my Department&rsquo;s Estimate has increased from &euro;61.2 million in 2016, to &euro;79.2 million in 2017 &ndash; an increase of 29%.  The increased funding will be complemented by the work of other areas of my Department, much of which has a positive impact on rural Ireland. </p></reply>

Provision is made in the REV for the capital carryover amount by subhead and in a Ministerial Order to be made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform before 31 March in the year of carryover.  The making by the Minister of this Order renders capital expenditure on the programmes, which have been included in the Order, a first charge against the carryover amounts for those programmes.  As such a Ministerial Order has not yet been made in 2017, no expenditure has been incurred by my Department this year against capital carryover.</p></reply>

There is provision in section 40 (2) for some strict exemptions from the prohibition during the closed period which include the clearance of vegetation in the course of road or other construction works or in the development or preparation of sites on which buildings or other structures are to be provided. In addition, the cutting, grubbing or destruction of vegetation during the closed season is allowed in the course of works carried out for reasons of public health or safety by a Government Minister or a body established or regulated by or under a statute.  Companies can apply to my Department for licences under the Wildlife Acts in cases of maintenance work to electricity or telephone lines which may involve disturbance or removal of bird nests. </p>  <p>  Following a review of Section 40, which involved, inter alia, consideration of submissions from interested parties, I announced proposals in December 2015 to introduce legislation to allow for managed hedge cutting and burning at certain times within the existing closed period on a pilot two year basis. The legislation required to allow for these pilot measures is included in the Heritage Bill 2016, which was published in January 2016. The Bill is currently at Committee Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann. In the meantime, the existing provisions relating to Section 40 of the Wildlife Acts remain in force. </p></reply>

It is the first Plan of its kind to address both the economic and social needs of rural Ireland through a whole-of-Government approach.  The Plan contains over 270 actions, all of which aim to support rural communities throughout the country. These actions are spread over five thematic pillars aimed at: </p><p>- Supporting Sustainable Communities, </p><p>- Supporting Enterprise and Employment, </p><p>- Maximising our Rural Tourism and Recreation Potential, </p><p>- Fostering Culture and Creativity in rural communities, and </p><p>- Improving Rural Infrastructure and Connectivity. </p><p>Initiatives under the Plan will be rolled out by various Government Departments and State agencies, and will benefit all rural communities, including those in Co. Meath. </p><p>One of the objectives outlined in the Action Plan for Rural Development is to bring high speed broadband to every premises in Ireland through the rollout of the National Broadband Plan (NBP). Under the NBP, 1.4m premises in Ireland now have access to high speed broadband, with investment by telecoms companies continuing. The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is in a procurement process to bring high speed broadband to those premises where services will not be provided by telecoms companies. In tandem with this, the Government is taking immediate steps to accelerate and facilitate the rollout of broadband and mobile phone services by implementing the recommendations of the report of the Taskforce on Mobile Phone and Broadband Access which was published last December. </p><p>Full details of these actions are contained in the Action Plan for Rural Development, which is available on . </p></reply>

The programme is based on five pillars:</p><p>- Enabling the creative potential of every child</p><p>- Enabling creativity in every community</p><p>- Investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure</p><p>- Establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production</p><p>- Unifying our global reputation.</p><p>I am confident that this programme will be very beneficial in promoting the national image at home and abroad and in increasing interest in cultural and heritage matters amongst young persons.</p></reply>

Longford. The Plan contains over 270 actions to be implemented by a range of Government Departments, agencies and other bodies to progress the economic and social development of rural Ireland.  In preparing the Action Plan, my Department conducted an extensive consultation process around the country to seek the views of people in rural Ireland on the issues of concern to them. The Plan includes a range of measure which will contribute significantly to the enhancement of local services and addressing social inclusion in rural areas.  Specific examples of actions which will help those who feel isolated or vulnerable in rural areas include:</p><p>- The introduction of a new Community CCTV Grant Aid Scheme. </p><p>- Significant investment in the Seniors Alert Scheme, which facilitates valuable community based support for vulnerable older people living alone. </p><p>- Investment of &euro;46 million in Garda fleet to ensure that Gardai are mobile, visible and responsive to prevent and tackle crime. </p><p>- Provision of support for local strategies across rural Ireland to address suicide and improve mental wellbeing.</p><p>- Maintaining the network of senior helplines in operation throughout the country, which offer a listening service for older people to help address issues such as loneliness and isolation in rural areas.</p><p>- Support for 450 Men&rsquo;s Sheds across rural Ireland which provide a safe space where men can gather and participate in their communities, develop social networks and potentially gain new skills and access information.</p><p>- Continued support and prioritisation of community crime prevention through schemes such as Neighbourhood Watch and Text Alert.</p><p>The full Action Plan for Rural Development is available at .</p></reply>

Under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts 1930-2014, my Department has established and maintains the Record of Monuments and Places, which affords legal protection to over 120,000 recorded archaeological sites and monuments in the State. Anyone proposing works to a monument that is included in the Record of Monument and Places must give my Department two months prior notice before works can start.   </p>  <p>  I also have a role, as Minister, in terms of being a prescribed body under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001-2015, whereby development proposals that may impact on our built heritage are referred by a planning authority to my Department so that recommendations can be made as appropriate to avoid or mitigate any such impacts.   </p>  <p>  My Department has a number of measures at its disposal to facilitate the maintenance and restoration of major historical or cultural sites. As Minister, I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at approximately 750 sites and in such cases there is a statutory duty to maintain the national monument. Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW). Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians. </p>  <p>  My Department is also providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the OPW in 2017 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership. OPW undertakes the care and maintenance of national monuments in my ownership or guardianship (of which there are approximately 750). My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care. </p>  <p>  Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for the protection of architectural heritage. The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures. Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.   </p>  <p>  I launched a new &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme - for the repair and conservation of protected structures on 21 October 2015.  This scheme operated in 2016, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014. It will operate again this year and is expected to support in excess of 330 projects across the country in 2017 and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  </p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund, administered through the local authorities, supported 57 projects nationally in 2016. It seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  The scheme will operate again in 2017. </p></reply>

The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>contains a commitment to encourage strong, mutually beneficial links between the business community and the arts community to assist arts organisations to capitalise on sponsorship opportunities and to develop business partnerships and fundraising skills. In this regard, I recognise the important work carried out by Business to Arts for which my Department provides a small amount of assistance.  </p><p>In addition, the Arts Council operates the RAISE programme, which seeks to enhance fund-raising skills in arts organisations with a view to diversifying the sector's sources of funding.  It is designed to assist the sector in securing philanthropic contributions to the arts in Ireland. </p><p>In terms of other capital investment requiring co-funding, I have announced a new &euro;9 million investment scheme for arts and cultural centres to run over the next three years, focussed on upgrading the existing stock of such centres around the country.  The funding, which is being made available as part of the Capital Investment Framework 2016-2021,will be dependent on matching funding being secured by project promoters and will therefore provide an opportunity for philanthropists to involve themselves in the arts.  I will be announcing the details of grants under this scheme very shortly.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to know that, on December 8 last, the Taoiseach and I launched the Creative Ireland Programme/Cl&aacute;r &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach as the Government&rsquo;s Legacy Programme arising out of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme and as the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in Culture 2025. The Creative Ireland Programmeis a high-level, high-ambition, all-of-Government initiative to mainstream creativity in the life of the nation. </p><p>My Department is now working to implement the Creative Ireland Programme with partners across Government and other key stakeholders.  This includes delivery on an ambitious Year 1 Programme to deliver 10 initiatives by the end of 2017.  Details of the Programme can be found on www.creative.ireland.ie. </p><p>It is hoped that this initiative will further stimulate private support for the arts.</p></reply>

The grant funding scheme is designed to support the presentation and promotion of Irish arts internationally, to raise the global awareness of the Irish arts sector, generate new career opportunities and develop new audiences abroad for Irish artists.  Strategic priorities include providing support for the international presentation of Irish artists and arts organisations, developing new and diverse international audiences and markets for Irish arts, and linking culture into the Government&rsquo;s international promotion strategy in tandem with other relevant Government Agencies.A budget of &euro;3.5 million has been allocated to support the travel and travel related costs of artists in 2017 and this support will contribute to the strength of Ireland's reputation for creative excellence and make a significant impact on the arts internationally.</p><p>In addition to Culture Ireland, the<b></b>Creative Ireland Programme, which the Taoiseach and I launched in December, places a special emphasis on unifying our Global reputation.  Pillar 5 of the Programme - Unifying our Global Reputation- is about presenting a coherent representation of Ireland to the world as a creative people.

The Government&rsquo;s intentions in this regard were welcomed when I launched the Creative Ireland Programme on the international stage in New York on 13 January. </p></reply>

Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians. A wide range of other monuments (in the order of 130,000) are currently subject to protection under other provisions of the National Monuments Acts but my Department and the Office of Public Works do not have a direct role in their maintenance except where, as already noted, a monument is a national monument of which the Minister is owner or guardian. </p>  <p>  My role, as Minister, with regard to the protection and management of our architectural heritage, is set out in the provisions of relevant legislation, as is the role of local authorities and the responsibilities of owners as regards heritage assets. </p>  <p>  Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for the protection of architectural heritage.

As Minister, I draw on information provided by the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, maintained by my Department, to recommend structures for inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures.  However, the final decision is a reserved function of the planning authority.  I understand that Kildare County Council employs both an architectural conservation officer and a heritage officer.  There is also a monuments advisory committee in the county. </p>  <p>  In addition to the statutory role of Local Authorities, Financial support is provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings, such as the Structures at Risk Fund, which funded two projects in the county mentioned during 2016, and the Built Heritage Investment Scheme which provided funding for eleven projects in that county during 2016.  I was pleased to announce this week that both schemes will run again in 2017 - details are available on the local authority website.   </p>  <p>  Well maintained historic buildings contribute positively to the vitality of our cities, towns, villages and countryside. Local communities have a great sense of pride in their built heritage, which in turns can help to provide an important source of local employment by boosting tourism. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy requires more detail on specific programmes or plans, I will be happy to provide this information.</p></reply>

A total of 504 annual payments, 220 turf deliveries and 41 once-off incentive payments have been made in respect of the applications received from Mouds Bog and 125 annual payments, 22 turf deliveries and 15 once-off incentive payments have been made in respect of the applications received from Ballynafagh Bog.  79 applicants from Mouds Bog and 23 applicants from Ballynafagh Bog have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog.</p>  <p>  Discussions are on-going with qualifying applicants from Ballynafagh Bog with a view to relocation to a non-designated bog in close proximity.</p>  <p>  Due to the issues involved in terms of a relocation site for turf cutters from Mouds Bog, my Department, in consultation with turf cutter interests, is considering whether the provisions of article 6.3 of the Habitats Directive could be utilised to allow cutting within areas of the special area of conservation. Under article 6.3 of the Directive consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation where it can be shown by rigorous scientific investigations that such cutting will not have an adverse effect on the integrity of the site. </p>  <p>  The Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network,  published in January 2014, concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network. Arising from this review, the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 has been presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and is currently proceeding through the necessary stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Its purpose is to provide for the implementation of a reconfiguration of the natural heritage area network arising from the 2014 Review.</p>  <p>  Carbury Bog natural heritage area in County Kildare is one of the natural heritage areas which is to remain designated as a natural heritage area arising from the review.  Hodgestown Bog natural heritage area in County Kildare is one of those scheduled for de-designation.</p>  <p>  Final resolution of all issues in relation to the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s protected raised bogs will only be brought about by everyone working together, within the law, with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established for the purpose of ensuring the input from all stakeholders.</p></reply>

Regrettably the pike was recently released in some lakes upstream of Lough Corrib on the Owenriff system.  I understand that Inland Fisheries Ireland are working to control or ideally eradicate these introduced fish.   </p>  <p>  Pearl mussels depend for some months of their lives on juvenile trout or salmon.  The larval mussels attach themselves in a parasitic manner to the gills of the small fish and then drop off to begin life on the river bed.  There is a possibility therefore that pike could have an impact on the number of juvenile fish available to the mussels. </p>  <p>  It is believed however that the juvenile fish that host the mussels are likely to have spawned close to the mussel beds, and it may be the case that such stream-living fish are not impacted by pike elsewhere in the river system.   </p>  <p>  My Department intends in 2017 to carry out a fish host survey, including the Owenriff, to sample juvenile salmon and trout for mussel larvae and will review available fish data to assess trends in host fish populations.  </p></reply>

Significant progress has been made in this area through the expansion of community mental health teams from 49 in 2008 to 67 currently. In addition, specialist secondary care mental health counselling and psychotherapy is provided within HSE Community Mental Health Teams, and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams.  Counselling is also provided by a range of voluntary organisations across the health service, including those supported by the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention. </p><p>Budget 2017 provided additional funding for mental health, to  promote positive mental health and the development of  Early Intervention and counselling responses. It made allowance for an additional &euro;35 million for services to be initiated in 2017. Key priorities to be addressed in the HSE 2017 Service Plan include youth mental health, further improvement to child &amp;amp; adolescent (CAMHS) and adult services, older people's services and further enhanced out of hours response for those in need of urgent services. Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with this increased allocation will be some &euro;15 million. There will also be a further additional spend of &euro;9.5 million in mental health associated with increased pay rates. This additional &euro;24.7 million for 2017 will see the HSE Mental Health Budget increase to &euro;851 million. With other minor adjustments, the National Service Plan Budget for Mental Health for 2017 totals &euro;853.1m.</p><p>HSE funding for Jigsaw counselling services for young people was expanded in 2016 to establish five new centres in three cities. The Executive continues to  commit to the development of publicity  campaigns such as and #littlethings. In 2013, the Department of Education and Skills, the HSE, and the Department of Health jointly developed Well-Being in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention. This was followed in 2015 by the publication of Guidelines setting out a framework for mental health promotion in primary schools.  The HSE will continue to assist in the development of this initiative during 2017.</p><p>The Programme for Partnership Government committed that &quot;A National Taskforce on Youth Mental Health will be established to consider how best to introduce and teach resilience, coping mechanisms, greater awareness to children and young people, and how to access support services voluntarily at a young age.&quot;  The Taskforce was established within the first 100 days of Government and is being chaired by me.</p><p>The aim of the Taskforce is to provide national leadership on youth mental health and wellbeing in order to enhance how the public, private and voluntary and community sectors work together to improve:</p><p>- Emotional literacy in the population;</p><p>- Awareness of services and supports;</p><p>- Accessibility to services and supports at different times and in different areas;</p><p>- Alignment of services and supports across different providers (public organisations, private organisations, community organisations, voluntary organisations, etc.).</p><p>The Taskforce is a small, diverse group of 18 leading national figures that represent a number of different sectors.It is an action-focused group, has met monthly since September 2016 and will work for 12-18 months. It has visited frontline services, and met with service users, parents and staff. As part of my commitment to ensuring that the voices of children and young people are at the core of the work of the Taskforce, a series of consultations with young people has commenced.</p></reply>

Last year saw the launch of the first Action Plan for Education by the Department of Education.  This included a section on Mental Health and Wellbeing.  The aims in this section were set to roll out a national programme to support the implementation of Wellbeing Guidelines to all primary and post-primary schools; to implement Wellbeing at Junior Cycle; and to publish the 2015 Lifeskills survey, providing information on how schools cater for the well-being of their students.  This plan outlines hundreds of actions and sub-actions to be implemented across 2016-2019, with timelines and lead responsibility assigned.  I will be working closely with my colleague the Minister for Education on this issue to ensure these actions are implemented.  With this in mind, for further details on school-based mental health and well-being, the Department of Education would be better placed to answer such queries.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the Department of Education have a strong history of working together to support youth mental health.  In 2013, the Department of Education and Skills, the HSE, and the Department of Health jointly developed Well-Being in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention.  This was followed in 2015 by the publication of Guidelines setting out a framework for mental health promotion in primary schools.  </p>  <p>  In 2015, the Government launched Connecting for Life, Ireland's National Strategy to Reduce Suicide with the aim of reducing suicide and self-harm over 2015-2020.  The Strategy sets out a vision where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and well-being.  It will provide community-based organisations with guidelines, protocols and training on effective suicide prevention. </p>  <p>  One of the main goals in Connecting for Life is to target approaches to reduce suicidal behaviour and improve mental health among priority groups, including young people.  Several key actions have been identified to further this goal in the Education sector, including: </p>  <p>  - Support the implementation of the relevant guidelines for mental health promotion and suicide prevention across primary and post-primary schools;</p>  <p>  - Guide and encourage the implementation of the relevant policies and plans in schools, including support for Student Support Teams and for critical incident management; </p>  <p>  - Work with the HSE to develop national guidance for higher education institutions in relation to suicide risk and critical incident response; </p>  <p>  - Implement the National Anti-bullying Action Plan including online and homophobic bullying;</p>  <p>  - Support all junior and senior schools to implement a new Wellbeing programme; and </p>  <p>  - Deliver early intervention and psychological support service for young people at primary care level. </p>  <p>  These actions are part of the overall policy objectives of the Department of Education and Skills.  They are supported by my Department and the HSE through the inter-agency implementation arrangements provided for in Connecting for Life and overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.</p></reply>

The Department has commenced an examination of options to bring greater national consistency to the regulation and financing of home care.

This new legislation  will effectively mean that all children in respect of whom a DCA payment is made will automatically qualify for a medical card and, therefore, no longer be subject to the medical card means test at any point in the future while in receipt of DCA.  The legislation is currently being prepared and will be brought before the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  In addition to the preparation of the legislation, the HSE has commenced the process of planning for the requirements of the scheme and how the cards will issue so that the proposal can be implemented in a smooth and efficient manner. </p></reply>

The result of the Brexit vote has caused considerable uncertainty for the Agency and its staff as it will have to be relocated to a country remaining within the European Union.  This scenario creates real risks for the EMA and its stakeholders &ndash; foremost, European citizens and the industries which the Agency regulates.</p>  <p>  The Government believes that it will be important to address the question of the Agency&rsquo;s future location relatively early in the Brexit process.  It is important that the selection of a new host country is informed by clear and careful consideration of the requirements which will need to be met in order to ensure continuity of the EMA&rsquo;s activities and a sustainable future for the Agency.  It will be particularly important to maximise the retention of the EMA staff whose expertise and skills have been key to Agency&rsquo;s development over the last 20 years and to the standing which it enjoys as a regulator at a global level.</p>  <p>  In October the Government decided to propose Dublin as a new home for the EMA.  An interdepartmental/interagency working group led by my Department was established to prepare a proposal. </p>  <p>  Last week I visited the EMA in London in order to better understand the workings of the Agency and the challenges it will face as a result of Brexit. I met the Executive Director, Professor Guido Rasi, and key members of his team.  It was agreed that we would not speak publicly about the content of those discussions.</p>  <p>  Work is continuing on Ireland&rsquo;s proposal to host the EMA and I will travel to Brussels next week for discussions with a range of stakeholders. </p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria: </p><p>1. the health needs of the public; </p><p>2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement; </p><p>4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and </p><p>9. the resources available to the HSE. </p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Respreeza for maintenance treatment of emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency.</p><p>In June of this year the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment on the cost effectiveness of this treatment. The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation on 9 December 2016. The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug and did not recommend it for reimbursement.</p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: .</p><p>The HSE will consider the NCPE assessment, and other expert advice, as part of its decision-making process for reimbursement. This decision will be made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>The operation of compassionate access schemes is at the discretion of manufacturers. There is no provision in Irish legislation for the approval of compassionate use programmes for specific groups of patients with an unmet medical need. I have previously asked manufacturers to show compassion and to maintain compassionate access schemes for patients during the assessment process by the HSE and this remains the position. The manufacturer of Respreeza, CSL Behring, has confirmed that the compassionate programme<font color="#FF0000"> </font>has been extended until the end of February 2017.</p></reply>

Last year, the NTPF rolled out the Endoscopy Waiting List Initiative to arrange for the provision of endoscopy procedures to patients waiting over 12 months. By the end of December, over 5,500 people had come of the Endoscopy waiting list and the NTPF had managed to clear over 99% of the long waiters on that list. Building on this successful initiative, &euro;20 million was allocated to the NTPF in the Budget 2017, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.</p>  <p>  In December 2016, I granted approval to the NTPF for the first tranche of funding in the region of &euro;5m, for an initiative focusing on day case procedures. It is estimated that around 3,000 day cases will be managed through this process with the aim of ensuring that no patient will be waiting more than 18 months for treatment by 30 June 2017. Tender documentation was issued last week and it is expected that the outsourcing of treatment will commence shortly.</p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE is currently developing a 2017 Waiting List Action Plan for inpatient/daycase procedures to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 15 months by the end of October. This Plan is being developed in conjunction with the NTPF's proposal for utilisation of its remaining &euro;10m funding for patient treatment in 2017.  A similar plan is being developed for outpatient appointments. I expect to make known the details of both plans in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Under this initiative, public hospitals will identify patients waiting for 18 months or more for a day case procedure who are suitable to have their treatment outsourced. The NTPF will then contact these patients in relation to availing of services under the initiative.</p></reply>

The HSE advises that a number of hospitals use parking revenue solely for maintenance and re-investment in parking facilities, including repayment of loans obtained for upgrading such facilities and investment in security. The remainder of hospitals use parking revenue to cover the cost of parking services, with any additional income being used to contribute to the general hospital budget, or to fund research or specific patient facilities. </p>  <p>  As demand for parking services at our hospitals increases, so too do the associated costs such as the initial capital costs of purchasing or renting parking areas; the cost of developing extra parking spaces; the need to provide and upgrade security systems in hospital car parks; staffing and general maintenance of parking services.  </p>  <p>  Obviously the costs in providing these services need to be recouped; provision of these services to visitors, staff and patients should not impact on hospital budgets intended to provide healthcare services to patients.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that it does not have one single contract to provide parking services at all hospitals. Instead each hospital has a unique arrangement which reflects its specific circumstances. Some hospitals do not provide public car parks while a minority of others do not charge a car parking fee.</p>  <p>  Hospitals which charge parking fees are very cognisant of the financial implications of parking costs for patients and their families particularly those with long-term illnesses. Consequently hospitals have introduced a maximum daily fixed parking charge, thus capping this expense. While there is no national HSE policy governing car park charges, the HSE advises that it keeps hospital parking charges under review.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the future development of our hospital system, we must take account of public transport services. This is evident in relation to the planned development of a new Children&rsquo;s Hospital. By supporting the expansion of public transport facilities, we continue to provide more transportation choices to the public when visiting their loved ones in our hospitals. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query regarding the revenue generated from car parking services in each public hospital in 2016,  I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly as this is a service matter.</p></reply>

Hospital Groups enable a better configuration of hospital services with benefits relating to safety, quality, access, cost and sustainable medical staffing and every hospital in the group, large and small, statutory and voluntary, will play a vital role within the Group.  Hospitals working together in a Group will be able to support each other, providing a stronger role for smaller hospitals in delivering less complex care, and ensuring that those who require emergency or complex planned care are managed safely in larger hospitals.  </p>  <p>  The Smaller Hospitals Framework focuses in particular on the future role of smaller hospitals and outlines the wide range of services that can be provided within these  smaller hospitals.  It also outlines the potential to expand the services delivered in smaller hospitals, especially in services such as:</p>  <p>  - day surgery (e.g. cataracts, hernia repairs, gynaecological procedures, and other surgeries that can safely be done in a day-based environment); </p>  <p>  - ambulatory care (including chronic disease management and assessment for older persons); </p>  <p>  - medical services (including cardiac failure clinics, cardiac rehabilitation, COPD outreach and clinics, rheumatology, dermatology, diabetic day centre, rehabilitation, and a range of others depending on local policies and protocols); </p>  <p>  - diagnostics (including blood tests, X-rays, endoscopy, bronchoscopy and sigmoidoscopy).</p>  <p>  As a Model 2 hospital, Monaghan does not have a 24/7 Emergency Department or critical care unit.  However, in line with the Framework, Monaghan Hospital has a Minor Injuries Unit located on site.</p>  <p>  I am committed to securing and further developing the role of our smaller hospitals with the expansion of services delivered in these hospitals, especially in services such as day surgery; ambulatory care; medical services and diagnostics. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government commits to a review of Medical Assessment Units, Urgent Care Centres and Minor Injuries Units, including the Unit at Monaghan Hospital.

Lifetime Community Rating (LCR) was introduced to the private health insurance market from 1 May 2015, to encourage people to take out insurance at a younger age. It introduced late entry loadings on health insurance premiums for those aged 35 years or older taking out private health insurance for the first time. Without LCR there would be a deterioration in the age profile of the insured population, which in turn would contribute to claims inflation and higher premiums for all.</p><p>The medical arrangements in place for Commissioned Officers of the Defence Forces are not private health insurance plans. Given they are not private health insurance plans, they cannot comply with the key principles of community rating, open enrolment, lifetime cover and minimum benefits as required under the Health Insurance Acts. </p><p>Private health insurance in Ireland is optional and, similar to any other individual or groups in Ireland, there is no statutory obligation on members of the Defence Forces to purchase private health insurance plans. Where people choose to purchase private health insurance, the application of loadings under LCR applies consistently to all residents of the State, whether purchased during periods of employment or during retirement. </p><p>A review of the Lifetime Community Rating regulations, after 30 April 2017, is provided for in the legislation. The independent regulator, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), has already commenced its public consultation process as the first phase of its review. A consultation paper to inform and assist those who may wish to make a submission can be viewed on its website . Proposals will be accepted before the deadline of 3 March 2017.

Section 55 provides that the HSE may provide private in-patient services to persons who are not entitled to, or who do not have or have waived eligibility to public in-patient services.  An essential element of the eligibility arrangements is that the "public" or "private" status of a patient must be specified on admission to hospital.  The holding of private health insurance is optional and has no effect on people's statutory entitlements or obligations.  These arrangements have operated under successive Governments and over several decades.</p>  <p>  Where a patient elects to be treated privately by a consultant, he or she is liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for statutory hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care.  The application of a charge by a hospital for private in-patient services is obligatory and Government policy has been to move towards recovery of the full economic cost of the services provided by the hospital.  Where private in-patient services are provided, the daily charges that apply depend on the category of hospital (Schedule 5 or 6 of the Health Act) and whether the overnight accommodation was in a single or multi-occupancy room.</p></reply>

The Programme for Partnership Government gives a clear commitment to increasing our mental health budget annually, as resources allow, to expand existing services.  In 2014 and 2015 funding was directed to reconfiguration of general adult teams, including psychiatry of later life, and also child and adolescent community mental health services and the strengthening of community teams.  In 2016 it was directed towards improvement of counselling services; enhanced Community Mental Health teams; improved 7/7 response and Liaison Services; Psychiatry-of-Later-Life; and Perinatal Mental Health.  Two new mental health clinical programmes have been introduced - ADHD in Adults and Children, and Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse.</p><p>Budget 2017 made allowance for an additional &euro;35 million for services to be initiated in 2017.  Key priorities to be addressed in the HSE's 2017 Service Plan include youth mental health, further improvement to child &amp;amp; adolescent (CAMHS) and adult services, older people's services and further enhanced out of hours response for those in need of urgent services.  Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with this increased allocation will be some &euro;15 million.  There will also be a further additional spend of &euro;9.5 million in mental health associated with increased pay rates.  This additional &euro;24.7 million for 2017 will see the Mental Health Budget increase to &euro;851 million.  With other minor adjustments, the National Service Plan Budget for Mental Health for 2017 totals &euro;853.1m.</p><p>The Department has also given the go-ahead to the HSE for the construction of a new National Forensic Hospital at Portrane.  This major health infrastructure project will benefit from significant capital investment in 2017 with spending on the new hospital and other, more minor, mental health projects planned to exceed &euro;50 million next year.</p><p>In addition to the substantial ongoing financial commitment to service development, the Department recently commissioned an evidence-based expert review which will focus on the progress made to date in the implementation of A <i>Vision For Change</i>, including a review of current delivery of services in Ireland.  The review will also take account of international best practice and will inform the next steps in the development of our mental health policy, having regard to both human rights and health and wellbeing objectives.  The review will provide a solid evidence base to determine the policy direction for a revision of <i>A Vision for Change</i>, provide a basis for further service development in this area, and shape our future mental health policy.</p></reply>

Once enacted, this Bill will, for the first time, introduce a licensing requirement for all public and private hospitals in Ireland, as well as certain designated high risk activities that take place outside a hospital setting. </p>  <p>  The introduction of a system of licensing for healthcare providers stems from the Government Decision on the Report of the Commission of Patient Safety and Quality Assurance; followed by a commitment to legislative proposals in the previous Programme for Government and in &ldquo;Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015&rdquo;.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Bill is listed in the Legislative Programme for the current session. It is my intention to move towards publication of the Bill later this year.</p>  <p>  A Working Group, made up of officials from the Department of Health, the HSE, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), the Private Hospitals Association, the Hospital Group CEO Forum, and the Forum of Chief Executives of Health and Social Care Regulatory Bodies, has met regularly throughout 2016.  This Group has been considering the draft General Scheme of a Patient Safety Licensing Bill, and providing feedback to inform and support the finalisation of the draft Heads.  The Group has also been considering the practical implementation and operation of the licensing system. </p>  <p>  While this work has not yet been fully completed, I can report that it is planned that HIQA would be the licensing authority, granting or refusing applications.  The awarding of a licence would be dependent on the applicant demonstrating compliance with the regulatory regime that will be introduced.  The emphasis will be on an improvement approach, with a focus on effective governance and management accountability in acute hospitals, both public and private, and for high risk designated activities.  In carrying out its functions, it is envisaged that HIQA will be balanced and targeted in its approach, having regard to best practice by others performing comparable functions to its own and be effective and efficient in the use of resources required for the purpose of performing its functions.  </p></reply>

As part of this initiative, the HSE submitted a Business Case for the introduction of around 114 Assistant Psychologist posts on a two-year pilot basis across the primary care psychology services.  The role of the Assistant Psychologist will be to support services and enhance the service provision and research capacity of qualified Psychologists. Sanction has now been given for this initiative and the recruitment process will begin shortly.  This will cost approximately &euro;3.5 million.</p>  <p>  In addition, approximately &euro;1.5 million will be used for the recruitment of 20 Staff Grade Psychologists for Children in geographical areas where there are none or inadequate numbers of posts in place.  This will provide the necessary clinical governance framework required to oversee stepped care provision by Assistant Psychologists.  These posts are currently being recruited. </p>  <p>  The balance of this funding will be used to fund the delivery of a computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT) programme for young people. </p>  <p>  These additional posts will provide services to service users under 18 years of age to address those waiting for treatment in the Mental Health and Primary Care Divisions.  The online resource will also be developed for adolescents with mild to moderate mental health presentations.</p>  <p>  These initiatives are central to the commitment in the 2016 National Service Plan (Mental Health) to continue to develop early intervention and prevention counselling services by mental health and primary care, specifically for young people under 18 years of age. </p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  </p>  <p>  In December 2016, I granted approval to the NTPF to dedicate &euro;5m to a daycase waiting list initiative with the aim of ensuring that no patient will be waiting more than 18 months for a daycase procedure, including those on the gynaecology waiting list, by 30 June 2017.  Around 3,000 daycases will be managed through this process and outsourcing of treatment will commence shortly.  </p>  <p>  In addition to current NTPF daycase initiative, in December 2016, my Department wrote to the HSE requesting that it submit in January a Waiting List Action Plan for 2017 in respect of both the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List and the Outpatient Waiting List.  The focus of these plans should be to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 15 months on either list by the end of October, including those awaiting gynaecological appointments and procedures.  The HSE has been requested to develop the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List Action Plan in conjunction with and supported by the NTPF's proposal for utilisation of the remaining &euro;10m of 2017 funding for patient treatment.  I expect to make known the details of both plans in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  As part of these plans the HSE has been asked to target specialties, services and hospitals with highest numbers of long waiters as well as improving in-sourcing in public sector, within and across Hospital Groups.</p></reply>

This has resulted in approximately 800,000 people now being eligible for GP care without fees without having to undergo a means test.</p>  <p>  The introduction of GP care without fees to children under 6 represents a major step forward in improving access, quality and affordability of health care in Ireland.  The under 6s service contract, which includes age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and a dedicated cycle of care for children with asthma, underlines the Government's commitment to enhancing primary care and keeping people well in their community.  To date, almost 364,000 children have access to GP care without fees through a medical card or GP visit card and approximately 94% of GMS GPs have entered into agreements with the HSE for the provision of services to children under 6. </p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge the contribution of general practitioners to meeting the heavy demand on our health service, particularly during the peak winter period.  The management by GPs of seasonal pressures is an example of how primary care plays a critical role in our healthcare system.  However, GPs do not currently provide information to the HSE in relation to patient visit activity, waiting times etc.  In the absence of such general practice activity data, it is not possible to evaluate the impact the introduction of free GP care to all children under 6 has had on GP practices.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the continued development of GP capacity and in 2017 the training intake will increase for the second successive year, from 172 to 187 places.  In addition initial engagement has commenced with GP representatives in the development of a new and modernised set of contractual arrangements for GMS and other public GP services.</p></reply>

GPs are remunerated for these services primarily on a capitation basis, with a range of additional support payments and fees for specific items of service.  The amount payable in respect of certain of these supports is related to the doctor's panel size.  GPs can also provide services to private patients if they wish.  The arrangements and fees charged for such consultations are a matter of private contract between the patient and the GP and I have no role in relation to such private income for GPs.</p>  <p>  As a consequence of the severe difficulties arising from the economic and fiscal crisis of recent years, between 2009 and 2013 a number of reductions were applied under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 (FEMPI) to the fees and allowances paid to healthcare professionals, including GPs who provide services under the GMS scheme. </p>  <p>  There have been significant developments in general practice service in recent years, with more services being made available to our citizens and additional financial support provided by the HSE.  Developments include a universal GP service for all children under 6 years and all persons over 70 years, the introduction of a Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult patients with Type 2 Diabetes, an enhanced support framework for rural GPs and a revised list of special items of service to encourage the provision of more services in the primary care setting.  Additional funding of over &euro;100 million per annum has been provided to general practice to support the roll-out of these initiatives.</p>  <p>  I envisage that, subject to the overall resources available to Government, commitments to the provision of additional State resources to general practice will be linked to the outcome of contractual negotiations on the expansion of the range of services encompassed by the GMS contract.</p></reply>

Significant work is underway to improve access to services outside of normal working hours.  The HSE is responsible for secondary care mental health services in Ireland.  These are specifically for people with moderate to severe mental health problems / illnesses such as more serious depression, bipolar illness, schizophrenia or anxiety related disorders.  Services are organised as age related specialty services, provided by multi-disciplinary teams, in line with <i>A Vision For Change.</i>The teams are Child and Adolescent, General Adult for working age adults, and Psychiatry-of-Old Age for those over 65 years, together with some sub-specialty teams, such as Rehabilitation / Recovery and Acute Hospital liaison teams.  The work of these teams is supported by a network of day hospitals, and general hospital based acute in-patient units.</p><p>Data on timely access to services is collected for each team on a monthly basis.  This shows 68% of children referred are seen within twelve weeks, and 74% of working age adults, and 97% of older adults within one week, illustrating improved response times to those with mental health problems. Work is underway by the HSE Mental Health Division to determine the existing level of service provision, and to examine international models of best practice on the most appropriate model of service delivery for use in the Irish context in order to enhance access to seven day services.  In addition, the HSE is progressing a detailed plan for provision of 7 day services across all HSE mental health service areas.</p><p>Significant and detailed work is underway in this area.  The current provision of HSE 24/7 mental health care involves various inter-linked components involving, for example, access via Community Mental Health teams during normal working hours (i.e. 9am-5pm Monday to Friday).  During this period, access may also be made through  Emergency Departments, involving as necessary the existing Liaison Psychiatric Service for hospitals, or alternative arrangements at local level pending further development of a liaison service in some CHO areas.  There is Consultant Psychiatric-led cover in place in hospital Emergency Departments, in respect of the hours 5pm to 9am Monday to Friday, and for the weekend period.  Finally, the National Clinical Programme for the Assessment and Management of Self-Harm was initiated by the HSE in 2014, and is being developed on an on-going basis.  Overall, the HSE indicate that weekend access for each Saturday and Sunday is provided in 9 of the 17 mental health areas, with a further 7 areas having partial cover.</p><p>The HSE has prioritised the provision of  improved Out-of-Hours liaison and seven day responses for mental health as a key priority under its agreed Service Plan  2017.  Services, in respect of both adults and those under age 18, are being developed in the light of significant new investment being made available for mental health, balanced against an acknowledged difficulty for the Executive in securing suitably qualified and experienced staff for this care programme.  My objective, and that of the HSE , is to improve all aspects of mental health care nationally for children and adults,  including better access outside of normal working hours, or via Emergency Departments.</p></reply>

This Initiative was developed to manage the expected winter surge in demand for hospital care in an integrated way across Primary, Acute and Social Care.  On 5 January, in response to significant pressures in our EDs in the New Year, a series of enhanced measures were added to this initiative. </p>  <p>  As part of the measures detailed in the Winter Initiative, the Smithfield Clinic which provides minor injury care in the catchment area of the Mater University Hospital was funded to expand its service with the aim of treating up to an additional 100 patients each week.  This has been in place since 1st November 2016.  A review of the five day week expanded service and determination of inclusion of weekend service will be undertaken shortly. </p>  <p>  There are currently 11 Minor Injury Clinics operating nationwide, and as the Deputy will be aware, Minor Injury Units are for the treatment of broken bones, dislocations, sprains, strains, wounds, scalds and minor burns that are unlikely to need admission to hospital.  In cases where an injury is more serious than originally thought, the patient is transferred to the hub ED linked to the Clinic for further assessment and treatment. </p>  <p>  The HSE has recently launched an information campaign, including social media, to promote and further inform the public of the services available through these clinics and their locations.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government commits to a review of Medical Assessment Units, Urgent Care Centres and Minor Injury Clinics.  Preliminary scoping work on this review is being carried out. </p></reply>

While the centre in question does not, and has never run hare coursing activity for its service users the Executive cannot understandably comment on activities of staff or service users during their own personal time. The Executive indicates also that the support of service clients, in the context of promoting positive mental health and recovery generally, does not constitute an endorsement of approval of this activity. No service users, as part of any recovery process, were brought  to or encouraged by the HSE to attend any such events. The Executive indicate that hare coursing has never been funded by the HSE locally, nor would it be appropriate from the point of view of a social care provider.</p></reply>

One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers.  The Scheme was developed in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), which has confirmed that AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank will distribute the loans, making &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at low-cost interest rates of 2.95%.  It will provide farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  This Scheme is supported by &euro;25 million being provided by the Department, including &euro;11 million in EU &lsquo;exceptional adjustment aid&rsquo;.  Working with the partner financial institutions, SBCI uses the public money to leverage the total of &euro;150 million, enabling them (along with COSME, the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs) to provide the guarantee required to underpin the loan&rsquo;s flexibility, and lower the cost of the loans.  The SBCI has undertaken extensive research, due diligence and analysis during the design of the Scheme.</p></reply>

This rate of delivery would not have been possible without the availability of high quality complex IT software systems to support the business units in operating these schemes.  Since 2014 my Department has adopted a policy of implementing fully digital end-to-end support for all but the smallest of schemes.</p><p>The Department is delivering the vast majority of these schemes by enhancing the capability of its Generic Claims Processing System (GCPS) with support from its Geospatial Information System (GIS), Land Parcel Information System (LPIS) and Agriculture Field Inspection and Testing System (AFIT).  This approach has been very successful in delivering schemes and was particularly effective in the implementation of the application submission process for GLAS where the Department used available datasets to identify the appropriate actions to be carried out on holdings.  </p><p>The GCPS system currently supports the various GLAS, TAMS II, Knowledge Transfer and Organic Farming Schemes in addition to the AEOS and TAMS I schemes under the previous Rural Development Plan.  </p><p>My Department has an excellent record in the delivery of high quality IT systems.  In that respect my Department is ahead of the rest of our European partners. </p><p>In the period from 2014 to date a total of &euro;7,540,383.30 has been spent in the development, maintenance and enhancement of the GCPS software.  A specific figure is not assigned to any one particular scheme, which the software supports, as much of the functionality operates across schemes.

The Scheme was developed in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), which has confirmed that AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank will distribute the loans, making &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%.  It will provide farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  The SBCI has demonstrated its commitment to the agriculture sector and has worked with my Department to get this product to the market in a timely manner.  I welcome the participation of the main banks, which will ensure nation-wide coverage for the scheme.  The fact that most farmers will have an existing relationship with the participating banks should facilitate the loan application process.</p></reply>

I asked the POs to make contact with their members and encourage them to agree, that any amounts landed in excess of their allocated quota in 2016, arising from the application of the landing obligation, as recorded by the SFPA in 2016, be deducted from their 2017 allocation.  I  have held back 6% of this quota (75,837 tonnes) in order to allow the voluntary quota balancing scheme to be progressed.  I have received the completed documents agreeing to the scheme from one PO and am awaiting the formal response from the other PO.  </p>  <p>  My Department is currently awaiting the final figures from the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority to determine excess landings of mackerel in 2016 in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 polyvalent segment, arising from the application of  the landing obligation.  On receipt of the figures, I will consider the possibility of asking the Producer Organisation to implement a  voluntary scheme for Tier 1 and Tier 2 polyvalent segment vessels as proposed for the RSW pelagic segment.  As soon as this voluntary payback scheme is finalised, I will be in a position to allocate the 6% of the mackerel quota held back for this purpose.</p></reply>

It is a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza which means that it causes severe disease and often death in infected birds.  Its spread can be attributed to the movement of wild migratory birds and since December 2016 there have been 5 confirmed cases of H5N8 in wild birds in Ireland.  It is now likely to be well established in the wild bird population throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  On the 23/12/16 this Department announced regulations under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 requiring flock keepers to confine all poultry and captive birds in their possession or under their control in a secure building to which wild birds, or other animals do not have access, and to apply specific bio-security measures.  This is the first time such action has been taken by this Department.  The requirement to keep birds confined was extended on the 23/01/17 and it will remain in place until further notice but will kept under review. </p>  <p>  Bird gatherings (shows, exhibitions and races) are permitted under general licence, subject to prior notification and certain bio security conditions. </p>  <p>  This Department emphasises the requirement to confine poultry and other birds, and to apply strict bio-security measures to prevent the introduction of avian influenza.  Poultry flock owners should remain vigilant for any signs of disease in their flocks, and report any disease suspicion to their nearest Department Veterinary Office.  A range of biosecurity information and advice for people owning different species (ducks, geese, turkeys) and backyard flocks is provided on the Department&rsquo;s website.  Key biosecurity advice has also been published in the national press.</p>  <p>  Other measures e.g. a bans on hunting, release of game bird or pigeon racing have been considered and have been ruled out at this time.  The Department continues to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and will adjust its measures if necessary.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to review all aspects of its contingency arrangements in light of any emerging veterinary or scientific information and introduces such measures as are considered appropriate.  Lessons learned by colleagues in other EU Member States are regularly taken into account in our plans.</p></reply>

Ireland's negotiating position will be coordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p><p>From an agri-food perspective, and given the importance of the UK market for the sector, our demand will be for continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures, and to keep the UK market viable for Irish producers by minimising the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries.</p><p>In fisheries, we want to maintain current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal and protect Ireland&rsquo;s quota share for joint fish stocks.</p><p>In the meantime, I and my Department continue to progress our analysis of the likely implications of Brexit, and to further our engagement with stakeholders, UK and Northern Ireland counterparts, Member State colleagues and European institutions.

My Department is also active on third country markets with a view to developing new business opportunities for Irish food companies.  In that context I will be leading a trade mission to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates at the end of this month.</p><p>All of the Department&rsquo;s ongoing activities will continue to be informed by the need to secure the best possible outcome for the Irish agri-food sector.

Added to this is the new Sheep Welfare scheme under the Programme for Government in which there was a commitment to the introduction of a scheme for sheep farmers under the Rural Development Programme with a budget of some &euro;25 million in 2017.  This Sheep Welfare Scheme was launched successfully by my Department last December and officials from my Department held a series of strongly attended public meetings on the scheme in the last number of weeks.  I am glad to report that applications are being received by my Department in high numbers on a daily basis.</p>  <p>   The scheme provides support of &euro;10 per ewe to farmers for undertaking actions which make positive contributions to flock welfare.  In designing the scheme, I was conscious that the varying challenges faced by sheep farmers in lowland and hill areas would need to be taken into account and I believe we have successfully struck this balance.  The end product is a reflection of the extensive consultations which were carried out by my Department with a range of stakeholders, particularly farm organisations, in 2016, in addition to intensive discussions with the European Commission. </p>  <p>  The scheme represents a clear acknowledgement of the contribution the sheepmeat sector makes to the Irish Agri-Food sector, which in 2016 saw an increase in exports of sheepmeat of 3% in volume and 4% in value terms to &euro;240 million supporting some 35,000 farm families directly, as well as providing several thousand jobs indirectly in rural areas.  This scheme in addition to the others outlined above will make a vital contribution to ensuring the continuing viability and sustainability of the sheep sector in Ireland.</p></reply>

A total of &euro;395m has been made available for TAMS II schemes over the course of the Rural Development Programme period, with some &euro;17m earmarked for the pig and poultry sector.  The new scheme is being co-funded by the European Union.</p><p>The areas of investment available include: medicine dispenser units, water meters, solar panels, heat recovery units/heat pumps, energy efficient boilers, feed system upgrades (for medication reduction and energy efficiency), energy efficient upgrade for farrowing house, weaner housing, fattener housing.</p><p>The scheme is open to all farmers who meet the eligibility criteria, offering a standard rate of 40% on investment up to a ceiling of &euro;80,000.  This investment reflects our ongoing commitment to the growth potential of this important sector and to the modernisation of farming in Ireland.</p><p>There is also additional funding under the Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme.  This Scheme is jointly funded by the European Union and the national exchequer.  Grant aid will be paid on approved, completed and eligible expenditure and shall be paid at the rate of 60% up to the applicable maximum investment ceiling of &euro;80,000 per holding.<b></b></p><p>In recognition of the importance of the Pig Sector to the economy, in May 2015 my Department set up a group representing all stakeholders (producers, processors, specialist pig vets, Teagasc and DAFM) in the pig sector with an independent chairperson, Dr. Sean Brady, to examine issues in the sector informed by extensive consultations with additional experts.  This is one of the recommendations under the Food Wise Strategy. </p><p>The group consulted widely and met with or received contributions from a wide range of bodies.  Their report was finalised in early 2016 with 65 recommendations identified and was presented to the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee in January 2016. </p><p>It was crucial to the development of the Irish pigmeat sector that an appropriate forum was established to ensure follow-up on these actions.  Against that background the Department recommended the appointment of an Implementation Group and proposed the re-convening of the stakeholder group chaired by Dr. Sean Brady. </p><p>The Implementation group held their inaugural meeting in November 2016.  The group will meet as often as is practicable for the relevant stakeholders to implement the actions and  the Chairman will report to the HLIC annually. </p><p>The sector is also supported by Bord Bia&rsquo;s pigmeat promotions.  Their current campaign will be aired for the last time in March, before it is replaced with a new pork and bacon campaign due to be rolled out in May, with additional advertising planned for September and October. </p><p>In terms of trade development and market access for the pigmeat sector, my Department continues to make these a priority.  Opening markets is of the greatest importance, particularly in the context of Brexit, to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drink internationally.  It is for this reason that we have undertaken major trade missions to Asia and Africa in recent times.</p><p>Irish pigmeat exports in 2016 increased by 2% in volume while average pig prices were almost 2% higher.  This left the value of Irish pigmeat exports up by 4% in 2016 at an estimated &euro;615 million.  Net production also increased last year, helped by a significant demand for exports, particularly in China, with volumes up an estimated 44% at 65,000 tonnes reflecting strengthening demand for product in this market.  China is the second largest market for Irish pigmeat exports after the UK, accounting for almost 30% of total exports. Increased volumes to International markets, particularly Asia, offset lower shipments to the UK. Market access for pigmeat in the Philippines and Vietnam has also provided new market opportunities for Irish companies.  These markets have significant potential due to rising per capita wealth and urbanisation.</p></reply>

Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services;</p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county. </p><p>The Department is actively monitoring the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE areas to ensure that all premises can get access to services. In this regard, direct feedback from consumers is important and if customers in these areas cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at broadband@dccae.gov.ie, quoting their address and Eircode and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services. </p><p>A formal procurement process is now in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. The Department will also shortly update the High Speed Broadband map and finalise this Intervention Area for bidders, taking into account any industry investments that have not materialised and potential other new investments. </p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. This provides for a future proofed solution for the  25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.</p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.  The Taskforce report is available at the following link: <i></i></p><p>I have signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, to provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.</p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country. </p></reply>

These wholesale, open access fibre networks are operated and managed in a commercial manner, on behalf of the State, by a Managed Services Entity (MSE), enet.  Currently, over 60 operators use the MANs infrastructure, and there are some 2,500 connections to the MANs.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that in excess of 600,000 business users and individuals are benefitting from the MANs, including industrial estates, multinationals, SMEs, State entities, educational institutions, together with fixed and mobile customers outside Dublin.  It is not possible to provide information relating to the percentage of commercial customers, since data relating to end customers is a matter for each individual service provider.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to sell the MANs and in this regard, no valuation exercise has been carried out to assess the current market value of the MANs.  A recent retrospective review of the MANs Programme carried out by my officials concluded that the MANs have played, and continue to play, an important role in driving competition in the regions and attracting foreign direct investment to the cities and towns where they are located.  The creation of the MANs as an exclusive fibre network facilitates service providers, large and small, in responding to the ongoing growth in demand for bandwidth capacity.  </p>  <p>  With reference to the Action Plan for Rural Development, the MSE continues to actively encourage licensed operators to utilise the MANs infrastructure. My Department is currently making arrangements to carry out an independent evaluation of the operations of the MANs, including pricing of the MANs products and services to ensure that they are within market norms. Recommendations are also being sought as to proposals to boost further uptake of the MANs.</p></reply>

The preparation of the plan is designed to be a &lsquo;whole-of-government&rsquo; approach to tackling greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this context, each Minister with responsibility for the largest emitting sectors -  electricity generation, the built environment, transport and agriculture - has been requested by Government to develop sectoral mitigation measures. The primary objective of the first NMP will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify potential additional measures that, in the medium to longer term, will reduce GHG emissions so that we can make progress towards achieving our <i>national transition objective </i>to become a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by the end of 2050.</p><p>Work is well under way on the development of the NMP which must be underpinned by appropriate technical, environmental, economic and financial analysis.

Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER). In 2016 over 15,000 homeowners had energy efficiency works carried out to their homes which resulted in &euro;17m being spent on this Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Better Energy Warmer Homes (BEWH) Scheme funds energy efficiency improvements in the homes of the elderly and vulnerable, making the homes more comfortable, healthier and more cost effective to run. In 2016, 6,839 applications were funded under the BEWH scheme and the level of funding was just over &euro;20m.</p>  <p>  The Better Energy Communities Programme (BEC) aims to encourage community based partnerships to improve the thermal and electrical efficiency of the building stock and energy poor homes and facilities, encouraging the implementation of deeper and more technically and economically challenging measures. These partnerships can be between the public and private sectors, domestic and non-domestic sectors, commercial and not-for-profit organisations and energy suppliers. The community and business supports leverage considerable additional private investment. In 2016, almost &euro;17m in funding was provided to support 36 projects throughout the country. </p>  <p>  In total, around &euro;100m will be dedicated to energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in 2017, which in addition  to the Better Energy Programme  will also provide for a number of other programmes including the Warmth and Wellbeing programme, SME and Industrial engagement  with energy efficiency, Public Sector Energy Efficiency and Electric Vehicles. Across these three strands of the Better Energy Programme, I anticipate investing more than &euro;60m in 2017. This funding will clearly demonstrate the continuing potential of the scheme to deliver energy efficiency gains and related benefits, such as reduced energy costs and better health outcomes.</p></reply>

This fee is not provided for in legislation but exists as an informal charge applied by tyre retailers.  There is no accountability associated with the existing charge and no certainty for the consumer that the disposal fee they currently pay is being used for its intended purpose. The level of illegal stockpiles would suggest that it is often not properly applied.</p>  <p>  The model that I am introducing will formalise the disposal arrangements and ensure that the fee consumers pay funds the environmentally sound management of waste tyres.  </p>  <p>  I have met with representative organisations from the tyre industry and I am very aware of their concerns in relation to the new structures being introduced for tyres.  I will be ensuring that, in so far as is practical, their concerns will be addressed. In addition tyres will be a priority area for enforcement in 2017 for the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) and I will be asking them to give particular attention to the border regions.  I am confident that this will address market distortion and it is an issue which I will keep under review. </p>  <p>  I should point out that I have also received a lot of support during the extensive consultation that has taken place with the industry for the introduction of the scheme from other operators in the tyre market.</p>  <p>  The charge will fund a producer compliance scheme which will be operated by Repak End of Life Tyres (ELT) with a registration and reporting role for the Producer Register Limited. This type of model is one that has been operating very successfully across other waste streams in Ireland, including packaging, batteries, waste electrics and electronics and farm plastics. The scheme will carry out regulatory functions on behalf of its members.  All operators will be obliged to provide data on the numbers of tyres coming on and off the market. This will be the first time that there will be clarity in this regard. It will be mandatory for anyone placing tyres on the market in Ireland to join the compliance scheme.</p>  <p>  There is nothing unusual about the designation of a single compliance scheme for a particular waste stream. Indeed, a comprehensive review of compliance schemes in Ireland in 2014 examined this aspect and recommended that the tyre market in Ireland is such that only one Producer Organisation would be viable. This single compliance model already works in other waste streams for example, farm plastics (IFFPG) and packaging (Repak).</p>  <p>  I am convinced that the new structures which I am introducing will address the lack of regulation in the tyre market to date and address the occurrences of stockpiles of waste tyres that could have a detrimental effect on the environment and human health.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  </p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p><p>The map currently indicates that 100% of the townland of Kilcossy  falls within an AMBER area and will therefore will be included in the State Intervention procurement process under the NBP. Individuals can check whether their premise is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.</p><p>A formal procurement process is now in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. The Department will also shortly update the High Speed Broadband map and finalise this Intervention Area for bidders, taking into account any industry investments that have not materialised and potential other new investments. </p><p>Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. This provides a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second. The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.</p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. </p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage. The Taskforce report  which was published in December, is available at the following link: .</p><p>I have also signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with the allocation of spectrum in the 3.6GHz band in early 2017. This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. I have secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.</p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country, including County Leitrim.</p></reply>

At its heart is a commitment to transform Ireland into a low carbon society and economy by 2050 and reduce the country&rsquo;s fossil fuel dependency. The Programme for Government also commits to reducing our import dependency while maintaining energy security, affordability and reducing energy-related emissions.</font></p><p><font color="#262626">Ireland&rsquo;s dependency on imported fossil fuels - which increased to 88% of all energy used in 2015 - means that the Irish economy is particularly exposed to international energy price volatility. The cost of all energy imports to Ireland in 2015 was approximately &euro;4.6 billion, and while that was down from  &euro;5.7 billion in 2014 due mainly to falling oil and gas import prices, further increases would place cost pressures on businesses and households across the country.</font></p><p><font color="#262626">I am therefore committed to minimising this exposure through the promotion of energy efficiency measures and support for indigenous renewable energy in different sectors of the economy. The deployment of indigenous renewable energy resources and the implementation of energy efficiency measures can help ensure we maintain energy security and stable affordable prices for all energy users.</font></p><p><font color="#262626">My Department has developed a series of policy measures designed to promote the cost effective use of renewable energy in the electricity and heating sectors and support the uptake of energy efficiency measures across the economy, in accordance with the energy efficiency first approach.  Heating a property which is not appropriately insulated and ventilated will result in wasted energy and unnecessary costs regardless of heating type, while a home that is properly insulated will achieve a much greater degree of warmth and comfort for a smaller amount of energy.</font></p><p><font color="#262626">While there are no supports for the use of biofuel for heat production at a household level, through the Better Energy Homes Scheme administered by SEAI, my Department makes a wide range of grants and supports available to householders who wish to upgrade the energy efficiency of their home.  To date, nearly one fifth of all homes in Ireland have received some form of Government supported energy efficiency upgrade. Households can also avail of grant support for investment in renewable energy installations, including solar thermal, under the Scheme.</font></p></reply>

As regards the 40% electricity target, provisional data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicates that 27.3% of electricity demand was met from renewable sources in 2016, of which wind accounted for 23.2%.</p><p>The SEAI also estimates that the amount of CO2 avoided from renewable energy use in electricity generation increased by 226% over the period 2005-2015, reaching 3,188 kt.

This Taskforce was established by myself and Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.</p>  <p>  The production of a mobile phone coverage map will be of great value to consumers.  Aside from handset performance, consumers need to understand the extent of coverage being offered by different operators in their area.  The level of coverage and quality of service received can vary from one operator to the next depending on location.  This could significantly impact on the choice of provider that individuals make.</p>  <p>  From a consumer perspective therefore, the development of a mobile phone coverage map by ComReg will be hugely important - particularly viewed in tandem with the results of the mobile handset sensitivity testing programme that ComReg is planning.  For the first time, consumers will be in a position to independently assess what handset is right for their specific needs, wherever they live or work.  As indicated in the Report, the timeline envisaged for the production of such a composite map is 2018. </p>  <p>  In order to maintain momentum, an Implementation Group is being established to drive and monitor the implementation of the actions in the Taskforce report.  The Implementation Group will be led by my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The Implementation Group will formally report every 90 days to both myself and Minister Humphreys, who will in turn jointly brief the Cabinet on progress made.  The Implementation Group will carry out a fundamental review of progress made after twelve months and will also be mandated to recommend further actions that would result in an improved service for consumers.</p></reply>

Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>The proposed State intervention under the NBP represents a potentially very significant capital investment project for the State and the Government is firmly committed to delivering this investment, as evidenced in the National Broadband Plan itself and in the Programme for Government.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area.  The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER. </p><p>-The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  </p><p>- The AMBER areas on the map show the target areas for the State intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process. It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county. </p><p>My Department is actively monitoring the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE areas to ensure that all premises can get access to services.  In this regard, direct feedback from consumers is important and if customers in these areas cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at broadband@dccae.gov.ie, quoting their address and Eircode and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services. </p><p>My Department is also actively monitoring developments of commercial operators that might impact the Intervention Area.  This is being done in accordance with procedures set out by my Department in December 2015. </p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map and finalise this Intervention Area for bidders, taking into account any industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.</p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the  25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.</p><p>A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.  The Taskforce report which was published in December, is available at the following link:.</p><p>I have signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with the allocation of spectrum in the 3.6GHz band, in early 2017.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.  </p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p><p>My Department carried out the first formal stage of the environmental assessment process by screening the draft National Broadband Intervention Strategy for the need to carry out a full Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and an Appropriate Assessment (AA), in consultation with the prescribed environmental authorities listed in the legislation.  The Department consequently, and in accordance with statutory obligations, issued a determination that a full Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment would be required.  </p><p>Consultation on an SEA Scoping Report was then carried out as the next step in the environmental assessment process.  The submissions received have been taken into account in the next phase which the Department is currently in the process of completing.  This phase includes the preparation of an Environmental Report and a Natura Impact Statement for consultation.  This consultation will take place in the coming months and will inform the conclusions of the SEA.</p></reply>

These proposals will allow mobile broadband services to use this part of the spectrum band.</p>  <p>  The Commission's Digital Single Market Strategy highlights the importance of this band for ensuring the provision of broadband services in rural areas. The band is particularly attractive for wireless broadband services, allowing higher speeds and greater coverage over long distances.  </p>  <p>  The procedure to formally approve the text for a formal Decision agreed in December by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission is underway and is expected to be completed in spring 2017.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, the 700MHz band is currently used by digital terrestrial television services (DTT) and the migration of these broadcasting services from this band has not yet happened. </p>  <p>  The move to the lower part of the UHF band by the DTT services that currently use the 700 MHz band will require a significant amount of work on the transmission network. </p>  <p>  In consultation with ComReg and 2RN (formerly known as RT&Eacute; Networks), my Department is working on a range of issues aimed at delivering a managed migration of broadcasting services from this band within the timeframe available.  The aim in Ireland is to achieve the release of this spectrum in advance of the June 2020 date, in co-ordination with the UK.</p>  <p>  In respect of the management of spectrum, including the future allocation of the 700MHZ band, ComReg is independent in its functions and I have no role in that process.   Having regard to the independence of ComReg in the matter, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time.  I have no reason to believe that any process undertaken by ComReg will not result in the fair allocation of any future spectrum assignment and I expect the outcomes of any such process to provide a level of certainty and transparency for all stakeholders.  A policy direction is neither necessary nor appropriate in the circumstances.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I have not issued nor do I propose to or see any necessity to issue any policy direction to ComReg in this regard.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have responsibility for developing effective policies for the regulation and optimal use of Ireland&rsquo;s national radio frequency spectrum, underpinned by an appropriate legislative framework. </p><p>Implementation of those national policies rests with the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) as independent Regulator with statutory responsibility for the day to day efficient management and use of the radio spectrum within the policy and legal framework set by the Government and the EU.  </p><p>My Department published a Spectrum Policy Statement in September 2010 and the National Broadband Plan which was published subsequently committed to a further review of spectrum policy. </p><p>My Department initiated a review in 2014 and held an extensive consultation with all interested stakeholders, dealing with a broad range of spectrum policy issues while respecting the role of ComReg as independent Regulator.  A significant range of issues and comments were received, all of which were considered.</p><p>As part of the consultation process, the Department stated its intention to amend the structure of the Statement of Policy to produce an overarching principles document and a shorter more focussed document which would set out the Department&rsquo;s Medium Term Priorities for the next 3-5 years, to be updated on a more regular basis than the overarching principles.  While I have not yet published an updated statement, much work has been done by my Department in identifying the various medium term priorities.  Focus moved from producing a statement to prioritising work items aligned to the various EU spectrum developments underway and in particular, the Digital Single Market (DSM) which is currently under active discussion.</p><p>As part of the DSM package of legislative proposals, the European Commission brought forward proposals to co-ordinate the release of the 694-790MHz (700MHz) spectrum band in all Member States by 30 June 2020.  The proposals will allow mobile broadband services to use this part of the spectrum band, which is currently used by digital terrestrial television services (DTT) in Ireland.  The Commission's Digital Single Market Strategy highlights the importance of this band for ensuring the provision of broadband services in rural areas.  The band is particularly attractive for wireless broadband services, allowing higher speeds and greater coverage over long distances.  Details of the Department&rsquo;s work on this issue can be found on the Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>My Department is in regular contact with ComReg, given its role in spectrum management.  This has included consideration of the various issues emerging from the Department&rsquo;s consultation process and from EU level discussions, prior to ComReg issuing its Radio Spectrum Management Strategy for 2016 to 2018 in June 2016.  That document sets out ComReg&rsquo;s radio spectrum work plan priorities over the next two years.  In preparing the Strategy Statement, ComReg took into account its role, statutory objectives, all relevant obligations as well as material submitted in response to its own public consultation on the draft Strategy.  ComReg is also conscious of the potential developments at EU level in respect of spectrum management which may impact on national spectrum strategies and policies in due course.  </p><p>The critical element emerging from the Department&rsquo;s review of spectrum policy has been to ensure that our legal and regulatory environment support continued investment in mobile telecommunication infrastructure, which is dependent on access to radio spectrum.</p><p>We will continue to engage with ComReg, and I will keep under review the need to publish an up to date spectrum policy document taking account, <i>inter alia,</i>of developments at EU level including in relation to the DSM package and the related review of the telecoms regulatory framework.</p></reply>

Those engaged in leisure pursuits on the water are encouraged to be aware of and familiar with the contents of the Code of Practice and to comply with the safety requirements.  The Code of Practice, which is currently under review, is available free of charge from my Department and is also available to view or download from the Department's website www.dttas.ie or www.safetyonthewater.ie.  As regards the licensed, commercial passenger boat sector (i.e. vessels that carry no more than twelve passengers), there are certain specific requirements.  In particular,  a vessel may not be used as a passenger boat without a valid licence, and manning requirements are provided for in the Merchant Shipping (Passenger Boat Manning) Regulations 2005 (S.I.

No. 349 of 2012.</p>  <p>  The master or owner of a pleasure craft must ensure that there are sufficient suitable Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs) available at all times on board the craft for each person on board.  The regulations also set out provisions relating to the wearing of PFDs.   </p>  <p>  There are certain exceptions for where the craft is being used for rescue, emergency or law enforcement, and for rowers in boats which are designed and specifically used in boat races or other events.  Failure to comply with the PFD requirements is an offence.</p>  <p>  While not a requirement of the regulations, my Department recommends that (i) anyone using a pleasure craft alone should wear a PFD at all times regardless of weather conditions, the size of the craft or whether it is made fast to the shore or at anchor, and (ii) persons should wear lifejackets at all times while on open decked vessels over 7 metres length that are not fitted with inherent buoyancy.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to revise the PFD regulations in relation to pleasure craft.  The provisions relating to wearing PFD on pleasure craft of less than 7 metres length include all the high risk classes of craft such as dinghies, jet skis, open sail boats, small motor boats, etc.  Pleasure craft of 7 metres length and greater generally offer improved safety and stability features.  The requirement to wear a PFD by a person under 16, regardless of the length of the craft, contributes to the education of those using pleasure craft from an early age.</p></reply>

The increase in the number in employment has impacted on transport through the beginning of a recovery in public transport numbers, but also through increased car use and re-emergence of peak period congestion.  Insofar as congestion issues in Dublin are concerned, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has overall responsibility for the implementation of their published Transport Strategy for the GDA.  My Department is working closely with the NTA with a view to intensifying efforts to combat congestion in the short to medium term through greater use of bus priority, demand management and other alleviating measures.  I expect this work will help to strengthen the case for increased public transport investment, as part of the Mid-Term Review of the Government's Capital Plan in 2017.  With regard to the M50, Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), along with other stakeholders are continuing to implement a number of measures on the M50 to manage demand and optimise operational efficiency, including changes to merge and diverge layouts at junctions; the introduction of permanently signed emergency diversion routes; increased incident access points and increased provision of incident response units together with enhanced interagency co-ordination to improve incident management.  TII have also established a project team to manage the design and procurement of a system of Mandatory Variable Speed Limits for the M50 and will progress this project in 2017.</p></reply>

However, I am not of the view that the situation requires a legislative response.  As the Deputy knows, legislation is a rigid framework which, in the realities of daily operations of public transport services, could give rise to a range of unforeseen or unintended consequences.  There may well be a role for public information campaigns or improved signage and I can raise that with the National Transport Authority and the operators themselves.</p></reply>

The Company's difficulties stem from its commercial Expressway services which are not subsidised by the taxpayer and operate in competition  with other non-subsidised operators.</p>  <p>  During the course of 2016 Bus &Eacute;ireann management worked on developing a business plan to address the loss making situation in its commercial Expressway business.  Several drafts of Bus &Eacute;ireann's proposals were presented to my Department and NewERA &ndash; my Department's financial advisors &ndash; and were discussed.  These discussions highlighted some shortcomings that existed in the draft proposals.</p>  <p>  In September 2016 the Board of Bus &Eacute;ireann commissioned its own independent consultants, Grant Thornton, to review the company's proposals and to advise the Board.  The consultants' confidential report to the Board - which was widely commented upon in the media - essentially came up with a similar analysis as that which had been given over the preceeding months by the Department and NewERA.  Arising from the Board's consideration of the Grant Thornton advice, the company has now embarked upon developing a new plan to address the company's loss making situation and restore it to a sustainable future, and it aims to have this plan in a few weeks' time.  Meanwhile it is taking various measures to address its costs.  One of several elements of the plan will be proposals to address the Company's pay bill, and to this end the Company has put forward proposals on which it is seeking to negotiate with staff.</p></reply>

Local authorities were given flexibility to prioritise projects when drawing up their programme of works.  </p>  <p>  Local authorities were informed that the Department of Public Expenditure, in approving the additional funding for repair works, had stipulated that the monies involved had to be drawn down in 2016 and that for that reason works listed in returns for implementation in 2017 could not be considered for funding.</p></reply>

The Authority is independent of the Department and the Minister in the conduct of such investigations and in its decision-making (together with the DPP) on whether to prosecute or not based on the findings in each case.</p><p>In instances where an individual is dissatisfied with the outcome of an investigation this must be pursued directly with the Authority in the first instance.  The HSA is committed to providing the highest level of customer service.  In this regard the Authority has a Customer Service Charter which outlines its commitment and provides details of what a person can expect in their dealings with the Authority.  If for any reason a person is not satisfied with the service that they receive from the HSA the Customer Charter outlines how a complaint can be made to the Authority and how that complaint will be dealt with.</p><p>This Charter sets out the procedures in relation to both the making of informal complaints and formal complaints.  A formal complaint will tend to be of a more serious nature and will be thoroughly investigated by a senior Investigating Manager who will endeavour to resolve the complaint within thirty working days of receiving it.  The Investigating Manager will advise the complainant (in writing for written complaints and verbally for verbal complaints) of the findings of the investigation, any recommendations considered appropriate and the reasons for such findings and recommendations.  In a situation where a complainant is dissatisfied with the response they have received they have a right of appeal which will involve an independent review of the response by an Assistant Chief Executive (ACE) of the HSA (where the ACE might have acted as the Investigating Manager the appeal will be dealt with by the Chief Executive of the HSA).  Reviews on foot of an appeal will be completed within twenty working days.</p><p>For more information please see the link to the HSA Customer Service Charter on the HSA website: .</p></reply>

Of these approximately 25% have been scheduled and the average period between date of receipt of the complaint and the first hearing date is approximately 25 weeks. </p>  <p>  The remaining complaints received in 2016 include a number of multiple complainants against single respondents.  These complaints are "on hold" at the request of the parties for a variety of reasons, including the availability of the parties/witnesses, requests from parties or their representatives for the hearing not to proceed for myriad reasons including ill health, unavailability of a key witness, settlement talks etc.  While these scenarios are outside the control of the WRC, they naturally impact on timelines for hearings. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that the ability of the Commission to schedule cases is influenced by a number of factors; the completeness of the information on the initial complaint form; the need to seek statements in equality/unfair dismissal cases and the availability of Adjudicators.</p>  <p>  Complaints under equality legislation are, in general, complex matters, where the facts surrounding the complaint can be quite sensitive and often disputed. </p>  <p>  Consequently, parties are required to furnish comprehensive details of the issues in dispute, in advance of the hearing.  This enables each party and the Adjudicating Officer, to have prior notice of the arguments which the other side will be relying upon.  Moreover, there may be significant aspects of law at issue.  Affording the parties adequate time to address these matters at the outset facilitates the efficient conduct and smooth hearing of the matter later on.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to know that in feedback received by the WRC as part of its stakeholder engagement, there was a strong view that both equality and unfair dismissal cases may actually require a longer lead in time for scheduling.</p>  <p>  The situation under the redundancy legislation is that the Commission received 722 specific complaints in 2016, of which approximately 50% have already been scheduled.  The average period between the date of receipt of the complaint and the first hearing date is just under 19 weeks.  A considerable number of the remaining complaints are linked to complaints under other employment rights statutes, including linked claims for unfair dismissal.  These linkages impact on the scheduling period, and similar to the situation under the equality legislation, external requests for more time are also a delaying factor.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the WRC is doing everything within its control to ensure that cases are brought on for hearing without undue delay.  However, the Commission is always mindful that parties must have sufficient time to prepare for cases bearing in mind the often sensitive nature of the cases.</p>  <p>  Should the Deputy have details of a particular complaint which has been lodged for eight months and has not yet been scheduled for hearing, she might contact the Commission's Director of Adjudication so that the matter can be investigated.</p></reply>

My Department then undertook an examination of the primary and secondary ticket markets and the measures taken, or not taken, in other countries to regulate these markets.  That examination led to the detailed consultation paper which I issued on 20 January 2017 together with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Tourism and Sport.  Though ticket resale has been the subject of considerable comment, there is a lack of reliable information about important aspects of the practice, including its extent, the sources of tickets put up for resale, and the prices achieved, as opposed to advertised, on the secondary ticket market.  The aim of the consultation is to provide us with a better understanding of the issue and to help us identify the practical measures that might be taken to give consumers fairer access to tickets in the future.  Those measures may include changes to the existing regulatory framework.  That will be determined following an assessment of the responses to the consultation and other relevant factors. </p>  <p>  My Department has overall responsibility for consumer protection.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Tourism and Sport have a role on the issue because of the wish to ensure that fans can access tickets for sporting events on fair terms and because of commitments given to UEFA in connection with the Euro 2020 Championship and to be given to World Rugby in connection with the bid for the 2023 Rugby World Cup.  Major concerts and sporting events also draw large numbers of visitors to Ireland and are important for the tourism sector.  Our discussions to date have focused on the decision to hold a public consultation and the arrangements for the launch of the consultation.</p></reply>

This decision, underpinned by primary legislation, provided for the dissolution of the 35 County Enterprise Boards.  Subsequently, 31 LEOs were established in each Local Authority Area, with LEO Louth situated in the County Council Offices in Dundalk.</p>  <p>  During the first two years of their existence, the LEOs have supported an additional 7,500 net new jobs nationwide in small and micro enterprises.  The LEO Capital allocation was increased by &euro;4 million for 2017 to continue this momentum.  The LEOs will use the additional monies to enhance the competitiveness and longer-term sustainability of start-ups, micro and small firms, which is of critical importance in the context of Brexit.  Targeted initiatives will be rolled out through every LEO, including Louth, to develop capabilities in innovation, market diversification, cost competitiveness and business management. </p>  <p>  In addition, a whole of Government approach has been put in place focussing on Brexit.  My Department and its agencies are to the forefront of this effort.  Ahead of the referendum we conducted a risk assessment of the potential impacts of Brexit across policy areas and this fed into the national level assessment led by the Department of An Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Department launched eight Regional Action Plan for Jobs in late 2015 and this included the North East/North West Regional Action Plan for Jobs which covers Counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan &amp;amp; Louth.  An implementation Committee is in place and is working hard to deliver on the actions agreed within the plan that was created following extensive consultation with stakeholders.  LEO Louth is a member of the Implementation Committee and is very much involved in driving the Regional Action Plan for Jobs agenda in that region.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-31a.1918.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017013100111#WRCCC00700"><p>Improving Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness position is a key economic priority for Government.  As set out in 'A Programme for a Partnership Government', our objective is to protect our national competitiveness from unsustainable cost growth and to deliver a job-fit business environment which ranks in the top tier globally.</p><p>The most recent <i>Costs of Doing Business Report</i>published by the National Competitiveness Council provides an assessment of Ireland's cost competitiveness performance vis-a-vis a range of competitor countries.  It found that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last five years.  This has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in.  However, despite these improvements, the Council warns that Ireland is particularly vulnerable to external shocks beyond our control &ndash; external risks at the moment include in particular Brexit, oil prices and exchange rate movements.  My Department and its agencies continually engage with relevant public and private stakeholders, as there is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage their cost base and drive efficiency improvements.</p><p>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes, in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in their annual budget and its determination is a reserved function of a local authority.</p><p>As set out in the 2016 Action Plan for Jobs, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government encouraged local authorities to exercise restraint in adopting the Annual Rates on Valuation and, where appropriate, the Base Year Adjustments for 2016.  It encouraged local authorities to provide to the greatest extent possible certainty for commercial ratepayers in terms of the impact harmonisation may have on their rates bills in future years.</p><p>Following the reorganisation of local government structures arising from the Local Government Reform Act 2014 there are 31 local authorities which adopted an Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV).  11 local authorities are not affected by rates harmonisation measures provided for in the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  This is due to those local authorities either having amalgamated prior to establishment day under separate amalgamations, or due to there being no former town or borough councils in the local authority area.  Two of these local authorities (Galway City Council and Limerick City and County Council) increased their ARV for 2016 and nine adopted the same ARV in 2016 as in 2015.  The average increase in ARV for this group of local authorities was 0.46%.  The remaining 20 local authorities are required by law to harmonise their rates through implementing the Base Year Adjustment (BYA) process.  In 2016 of 74 former rating authority areas within the 20 local authorities subject to the BYA, ARVs have increased by an average 3.07% in 40, decreased by an average 1.12% in 17 and remain unchanged in a further 17.  This equates to an overall average increase of 1.4% in commercial property rates.</p></reply>

This information is outlined as follows:</p><p><b>Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme</b></p><p>The CCS programme provides funding to childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.  Parents qualify as disadvantaged or low income on the basis of means-tested entitlements.</p><p>Prior to its expansion in 2016, about 25,000 children could be catered for under the CCS each year. </p><p><b>Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme </b></p><p>Under the CETS programme, childcare services are contracted to provide childcare places to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Board (ETB) trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  In the region of 2,500 full time equivalent places can be catered for annually.</p><p><b>After-School Childcare (ASCC) programme</b></p><p>The After-School Childcare (ASCC) programme is designed to support low-income and unemployed people to take up a job, increase their days of employment or take up a place on a Department of Social Protection Employment programme.  The programme provides between 300 to 500 places per year, depending on the mix between after-school and after-school with pick-up places.</p><p><b>Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme </b></p><p>The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme is targeted specifically at participants in the Community Employment (CE) schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.

My Department published a <b><i>High Level Policy Statement on Parenting and Family Support</i></b><i></i>in 2015.<i></i>The Statement sets out 29 policy messages around improved interagency working, workforce development, information and evidence to inform the targeting of resources, integration of service planning and delivery, and partnership with children and their parents.  It also underscores the importance of developing cross-agency coordination of services to children and their families.  </p><p>The Child and Family Agency&rsquo;s <b><i>Parenting Support Strategy</i></b>aims to ensure that there are appropriate supports and services available to parents within their community; that these services are accessible and friendly and that supports are available to parents at all stages of their children&lsquo;s development. </p><p>Together, these provide the context for the extensive work of the Child and Family Agency in the area of family support including the work of its <i>Prevention, Parenting and Family Support</i>(PPFS) teams which are currently being rolled out at local level to support a standardised approach to the provision of family support.  In addition, the planned<b></b><b><i>Early Years Strategy</i></b>currently in development by this Department will provide an opportunity to consolidate commitments and initiatives relevant to parenting support for parents of the 0-6 age group.</p><p>I understand that the UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre is currently researching and evaluating Tusla's Development and Mainstreaming Programme for Prevention, Partnership and Family Support.

While operational responsibility for parental leave does not come under my Department's remit, I do support its extension for parents; particularly in the crucial first year.  The Government has provided additional support for stay-at-home parents through the home carer tax credit, which has been increased to &euro;1,100 per year.  I also support an increase in the earnings threshold for this, and have raised this with the Minister for Finance.</p><p>On 28th October, my officials launched a public consultation on the new Affordable Childcare Scheme for Ireland.  The consultation is focused on the details of the new scheme, as set out in the published policy paper, and is intended to inform the further refinement of the scheme in advance of its implementation in September 2017.</p><p>I would like to stress that my Department is very much open to hearing views about supports for parents raising children at home, while also ensuring that the measures announced recently are implemented with the needs of children and their parents to the fore.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme responds to a specific need to increase the affordability, quality and supply of early years and school-age care and education services in Ireland.  It also reflects a core recommendation of the 2015 Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare in Ireland to replace the existing targeted childcare schemes, which are administratively complex and inadequate in terms of accessibility, with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme.</p><p>It is important to recognise that the Affordable Childcare Scheme is only one element of a broader set of commitments and supports aimed at parents and children.  Although the provision of improved services for centre-based care is very important, we will not lose sight of the needs of children who do not attend them.  In this regard, <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People</i>contains a commitment to produce Ireland&rsquo;s first-ever National Early Years Strategy.  The intention is to deliver a cross-cutting strategy which will take a joined-up, whole of Government approach to the issue of supporting children and their families during the early years (0-6 years).  The drafting of the National Early Years Strategy is very advanced and an Open Policy Debate on the strategy was held on the 7th December 2016 with a view to publication shortly thereafter.</p><p>I, and the wider Department, believe that we need to develop the quality, affordability and accessibility of centre-based care, and that achieving this should not affect the supports that we can offer parents who opt for other forms of care for their children.</p><p>In this regard, my Department is committed to reviewing future policies, and liaising with other Departments, to ensure that options for childcare provision respect parental choice.</p></reply>

The ABC Programme commenced in 2013 and is a time-bound co-funding arrangement of &euro;29.7m for the period 2013 to 2017 in conjunction with The Atlantic Philanthropies.  Due to contractual arrangements, each of the existing 13 sites are scheduled to come to the end of their contracts at various points throughout 2017.  My department secured an additional &euro;4.5million in Budget 2016 to extend all of the existing ABC Programme to the end of December 2017 bringing the total investment to &euro;34.2 million.  </p>  <p>  A key purpose of the ABC Programme is to identify the learning in and across the ABC sites and to transfer this learning into existing and established services, in order that we can ensure a greater reach and sustained impact in services across the country.  The aim of this is to ensure that rather than creating parallel provision, the learning from this programme informs the ongoing reform of established services and supports for children and young people in the areas of Health, Education, and Social Services.  Mainstreaming the learning in this way will bring improvements, not only in specific areas, but across the wider system, thereby addressing all areas of disadvantage.  </p>  <p>  The extension of all sites to the end of 2017 will provide all sites participating in the ABC programme with additional opportunities to evaluate their activities and focus on mainstreaming the interventions and programmes that make a real difference to children&rsquo;s lives.  This extension also brings the existing ABC programme closer in line with the expected timeline for delivery of the national evaluation report in 2018.  The purpose of the national evaluation is to assess the impact and implementation of the ABC Programme nationally, which will be crucial in charting future developments.</p>  <p>  My department is currently reviewing the emerging learning from the programme in terms of design and implementation.  We will utilise these learnings and the findings from the national evaluation to design future community based prevention and early intervention initiatives to meet the Programme for Government commitments. </p>  <p>  As another key step in this regard, my department will hold an open policy debate on the existing and emerging learning from the ABC programme.  This event will be on 14 February and will include the range of key stakeholders involved in this valuable work.</p></reply>

Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has advised that the young people will need residential assessment, and then, it is likely in the majority of cases, residential placement until they are 18 when aftercare supports will be provided.</p><p>The most recent estimate indicates a full year cost to Tusla, for approximately 40 young people, will be almost &euro;8 million based on initial estimates and is subject to review pending completion of needs assessments for young people.

I should say that homelessness as part of a family group is not, in of itself, a basis for seeking to receive a child into care.  However where there is a specific child protection concern, Tusla can investigate and take the child into care, if necessary.</p>  <p>  Children in emergency homeless accommodation are in the care of their parent/s and a key role of a primary carer is that of protection.  If there is a specific child protection concern, it should be reported immediately to Tusla for appropriate response.  Tusla provides family support and works with relevant services to maximise the supports available to children and families who are homeless.  Where underlying problems are identified, for example mental health issues, it can refer the family to the appropriate service.</p></reply>

Until last year, the targeted childcare subsidy schemes operated by my Department were only available to parents whose children were enrolled in community childcare services.  During 2016 this was expanded to allow private childcare providers to participate for the first time.  I intend that the Affordable Childcare Scheme will further expand the availability of subsidised childcare by increasing the number of providers participating. </p>  <p>  In particular, the Affordable Childcare Scheme will for the first time be open on an equal basis to all Tusla-registered childcare providers, regardless of whether they are centre-based providers or home-based child minders.  In addition to more than 4,000 centre-based childcare providers, which operate independently in a market context, all Tusla-registered child minders will be eligible to participate in the scheme.  It is open to any child minder who cares for more than three unrelated preschool children in the child minders own home to register with Tusla. </p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that the number of Tusla-registered child minders is currently small.  In order to meet the needs of parents whose preference is to use a child minder, and to build capacity to cater for increased demand in future years, the Department has commenced talks with Childminding Ireland (CMI) in recent months to explore a number of options around how quality can be assured within the child minding sector.</p>  <p>  A Working Group has been established, chaired by CMI, and including officials from Tusla and the DCYA, to make recommendations on reforms and supports for the sector in the short, medium and long term, and the feasibility and implications of the migration from voluntary to mandatory regulation.  These will include recommendations in relation to child minders who are not currently eligible to apply for registration with Tusla (those minding three or fewer pre-school children, or those minding school age children only). </p>  <p>  All existing legislation and international obligations will be considered in the drafting of legislation to underpin the Affordable Childcare Scheme.</p></reply>

Personnel are posted on the basis of operational needs across the organisation both at home and abroad.  As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force, targeted recruitment takes place so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength level.  Retention of personnel is also a key priority for the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  One of the key policies supporting personnel retention is the opportunity for extensive personal and professional development offered by the Defence Forces.  However, it is also the case that the extensive training that personnel receive makes them very attractive to employers within the private sector.  It is within that context and the emergence of skills gaps in certain disciplines within the Defence Forces that the reappointments of former officers may be considered. </p>  <p>  There have been relatively few requests and subsequent reappointments of retired personnel.  Of those who have returned their reappointments have generally been on the basis that their experience would be an asset to the organization and to fill an identified skills gap, for example in the case of Medical Officers.  It is in this context, the range of issues arising in respect of applications from former members of the Defence Forces for reappointment is kept under active review.</p></reply>
