The remit of the NTA is to regulate and develop the provision of public transport services (bus, rail, light rail and taxi) by public and private operators in the State, to secure the development and implementation of an integrated transport system within the Greater Dublin Area, and to contribute to the effective integration of transport and land use planning across the state.</p>  <p>  As part of its statutory role, the NTA has prepared a transport strategy for the GDA which establishes a framework to guide transport provision in the region.  The Authority is in the process of finalising an Integrated Implementation Plan which will outline the measures to be implemented in the short term in pursuance of the Transport Strategy.</p>  <p>  In terms of achieving cost effectiveness and efficiency for commuters, the Authority is working to simplify the fares structure for bus and rail services and to offer integrated fare products across the State.  The introduction of the Leap card has greatly facilitated such integration. The Authority is striving to achieve a further simplified, better value fares offer for public transport customers.  I understand that it is currently examining what the next generaton of smart ticketing might be for Ireland in this regard.</p>  <p>  I would also highlight the Authority's multi-modal journey planner which has been in operation for 4 years.  This allows anyone to plan their journeys to and from any location in Ireland by public transport.  Furthermore, real time passenger information has greatly enhanced the experience of the public transport customer and is a key integration tool.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-08a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020800064#WRA00900"><p><font color="#222222">The overarching goals contained in Smarter Travel Policy continue to be the cornerstone of our transport policy.  This is recognised and reflected in the Programme for Partnership Government where we commit to ensuring that the &euro;3.6bn investment in the public transport system provided for in the Capital Plan will uphold the principles of </font><i><font color="#222222">Smarter Travel</font></i><font color="#222222">.  The Capital Plan also specifically commits &euro;100m in funding measures to support smarter travel and carbon reduction.</font></p><p><font color="#222222">  While it is recognised that there has been some decrease in the combined spend on the programmes outlined for the years in question, it should be noted that in 2017 &euro;2.5m has been  allocated specifically to support carbon reduction in transport, a sum that would have previously been included under the Smarter Travel programme.  In addition a sum of &euro;10m allocated for Smarter Travel in 2014/2015  was a once-off allocation under the Government Stimulus Programme and this also impacts the figures the Deputy is quoting.</font></p><p><font color="#222222">It is recognised that with renewed economic growth, particular challenges for the transport sector with regard to congestion and climate change are re-emerging  While cost effective investment in walking, cycling and public transport infrastructure is clearly a priority, which is consistent with the goal of ensuring a more sustainable transport system, funding challenges remain, with many competing demands for the limited amounts of funding available.  In terms of overall funding of public transport, I was able to secure an increase in funding of &euro;54m for public transport infrastructure and services in Budget 2017.  In 2017, &euro;355m is being invested in public transport and sustainable transport infrastructure and &euro;276m is being allocated to fund the operation of public transport services.  The capital funding allocation includes funding for the LUAS Cross City project which, when completed, will increase the capacity and efficiency of the public transport network in the GDA. </font></p><p><font color="#222222">Progress has been made and continues to be made in encouraging people to use public transport and more sustainable forms of transport.  We have seen a significant increase in cycling in Dublin with steady year on year growth with an increase of more than 125% between 2006 and 2015.  There was also an increase of an additional 10 million passenger journeys on Public Transport in 2016, a 4.4% increase on 2015.</font></p></reply>

I would like to refer to the Deputy's inference that loss making routes arise from an over-supply of licences in the commercial bus market.  This is simply not the case.  Over the period 2011 to 2016, the NTA have issued 8 licenses and refused 11 applications.  The changes to the regulation of the bus market has had, without question, a positive effect on the experience of the travelling public.  They have benefitted from more services, better frequencies and lower prices.</p>  <p>  This is not hearsay.  People have chosen to use these improved services in increasing numbers - in 2015 almost 23 million people used commercial bus services which was a 9.5% increase on the previous year.  More people using public transport is a good thing.</p>  <p>  The NTA is responsible, under statute, for making decisions about licensing and have been very effective in the execution of functions under the relevant legislation.  The benefits of the current regulated competition model are continuing to accrue benefits for public transport customers.  While I have no plans to change the underlying policy in relation to the current regime, the Programme for Government does contain a commitment to conduct an overall review of public transport policy to ensure that services are sustainable into the future and capable of fully meeting the needs of a modern economy, and work on this be carried out this year.</p></reply>

Leitrim.  The website allows hotels, restaurants, cafes, pubs and food and drink producers to advertise their businesses and products through short videos, photographs, descriptions and maps.  It also advertises six "Taste Trails".</p>  <p>  Although Taste Leitrim did not avail of F&aacute;ilte Ireland sector supports in 2016, initiatives such as this are very much in line with the Agency's food tourism policy in their promotion of local food and drink establishments and products, development of food trails, and support and utilisation of existing tourism brands such as the Wild Atlantic Way and Blueways.</p></reply>

With regard to revenue, the most recent CSO Quarterly Tourism and Travel publication shows that spending in Ireland by overseas visitors (excluding carrier receipts) in the first nine months of 2016 amounted to over &euro;3.647 billion, an increase of 9.4% compared to the same 9-month period in 2015.  I am delighted that Irish tourism has had a record breaking year in 2016.  This has been achieved largely due to the hard work of the tourism industry with the assistance of the tourism agencies.  Both Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue to ensure Ireland is highly attractive for tourists and the agencies anticipate another good year for tourism in 2017.</p>  <p>  The longer-term tourism goals, as outlined in the Government's Tourism Policy Statement are that by 2025: revenue from overseas visitors would increase to &euro;5 billion, net of inflation; we would have 10 million visits to Ireland in that year; and employment in the tourism sector would reach 250,000 compared to around 220,000 at present.  In the event that these targets are achieved ahead of schedule, my Department, in collaboration with the tourism agencies, would work to ensure that Ireland's tourism sector would continue to grow in a manner that would be economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.</p>  <p>  In terms of access, as an island destination, direct, convenient and competitive access services are critical to achieving tourism growth.  There is a direct correlation between access and growth in visitor numbers.  Tourism Ireland works with airports, airlines and ferry operators to identify opportunities and 'case-make' for new or extended air and sea services from key markets.  Supportive Government policies on Air Travel Tax and the 9% VAT rate have helped to foster continuing expansion in air services to Ireland and increase our overall competitiveness.</p>  <p>  A specific allocation of &euro;1m was provided to Tourism Ireland in 2016, with a similar allocation in 2017 for additional focused co-operative marketing activity to be undertaken, to encourage visits to the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East via points of entry outside of Dublin.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-08a.31.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020800065#WRB00700"><p>Ireland faces a significant challenge to meet its international greenhouse gas reduction commitments.  Currently, Ireland's transport demand and emissions are increasing, with approximately three quarters of all journeys made by private cars accounting for over 55% of our transport emissions.  Increasing modal shift away from cars and towards public transport and active travel will play a vital role in our national mitigation effort.  Accordingly, I welcome the fact that passenger growth on public transport has risen in 2016 for the fourth consecutive year with an increase of almost 10m trips.</p>  <p>  Rail plays an important role in meeting increased passenger demand and also providing an energy-efficient mode of transport.  Electrified rail use, in particular, is capable of achieving low emissions through utilising renewable sources of energy. Considerable progress has been achieved in increasing capacity on the light and heavy rail networks.  For instance, the Luas Cross City project is scheduled for completion before the end of the year and it is estimated that the new line will add an extra 8 to 10 million journeys per annum on the Luas network.  Also, in 2017 we will see an increase in Dart frequency and additional commuter services through the newly-opened Phoenix Park Tunnel.</p>  <p>  Rail operators are also playing an active role in emission reductions on existing services, introducing a range of technical measures including automatic engine shutdown, configuring train length to match passenger demand and installing traction control software.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I am committed to the further development of electric fuelled public transport, particularly along high demand routes in the GDA where capacity requirements make such investment cost-effective.  We are progressing plans on the New Metro North project which is due to commence construction in 2021; while &euro;82 million has been allocated to the DART Expansion Programme between 2019 and 2022 to begin the extension of the DART line to Balbriggan, and the design and planning of DART services to Maynooth in the west and Hazelhatch in the southwest.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the NTA will ensure continued public transport connectivity for rural communities.</p></reply>

Given Ireland's reliance on Britain, from where 41% of our overseas visitors came in 2016, tourism to Ireland is likely to be more impacted than to any other destination.</p><p>Tourism Ireland's strategy for responding to Brexit will involve various strands, including defending key segments of the British market, very focussed competition in existing markets in Europe and North America, and pursuing new, potentially lucrative, markets further afield.  </p><p>In terms of markets further afield, a commitment is given in the Government's Tourism Policy Statement <i>&quot;People, Place and Policy &ndash;  Growing Tourism to 2025&quot;</i>to prioritising tourism marketing efforts towards those markets providing higher revenue returns.  The Programme for Government commits to implementing the policy objectives in the policy statement and achieving the targets for Irish tourism contained therein.  The UK vote does not change this.</p><p>As regards competing more vigorously in existing markets, a key element of Tourism Ireland's strategy since 2014 has been market diversification which has seen Mainland Europe become the largest contributor of overseas tourism revenue and will see the United States overtake Britain as the number two contributor to tourism revenue over the next few years.  In 2017, Tourism Ireland will continue to implement its market diversification strategy and intends to maximise holiday revenue through investment in Mainland Europe and North America.</p><p>In addition, the depreciation of the pound against the euro since the UK referendum means that value for money will be a key message for Tourism Ireland in Britain this year.  A strong focus on the &quot;culturally curious&quot;, who tend to stay longer and spend more, will assist Tourism Ireland in their defence of their British market.  Looking to the medium term, Tourism Ireland is currently finalising  its corporate plan for the period from 2017-2019.  This plan will, <i>inter alia,</i>include the agency's response to marketing Ireland in Britain in the new situation that has developed following the referendum.</p></reply>

Rail services would have to operate at low frequencies in order to meet demand and this would be less attractive to passengers than a higher frequency bus-based service.  Buses provide greater flexibility within transport systems, catering for high volumes of demand in the city centre as well as diverging out to less-dense suburban areas.</p>  <p>  Funding is provided by my Department, through the NTA, for the provision of public transport and sustainable transport infrastructure in the Regional Cities, including Galway, in order to encourage people to use public transport or more active travel modes including cycling and walking in order to reduce congestion and tackle emissions from transport.  The Regional Cities Programme funds the development of bus lanes, green routes, other bus priority measures and safety measures for pedestrians and cyclists. </p>  <p>  In line with the Paris Agreement and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, the National Mitigation Plan, is currently being developed.  The draft mitigation plan will be available for extensive public consultation before being submitted for approval to Government.  Transport will, of course, have to play a significant role on the national mitigation effort and the investment being made in public transport and sustainable transport measures in order to promote modal shift will be critical in this regard.</p></reply>

In keeping with the revised project timeline, the Government funding is to be provided in three tranches of &pound;25 million in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. </p>  <p>  The A5 project was discussed at the North South Ministerial Council Transport Sectoral meeting on 12th December.  The Council noted that the Public Inquiry into the road scheme opened on 4 October 2016 and that the Inspector's report is expected around May 2017.</p></reply>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also an active participant, alongside the RAI and other key industry bodies, on the consortium collaborating on the development of the culinary apprenticeship.</p><p>I believe that this collaborative approach is the most effective way to tackle the current challenges and to support the sustainable development of the Irish tourism industry, including addressing challenges concerning the supply of skilled chefs.</p></reply>

The Guide details the relevant staff member in Sports Capital Division dealing with each county who can assist with any queries applicants may have.  Furthermore, my Department has arranged seven regional workshops to guide organisations through the application process.  These are taking place this week and next and I am aware that the Local Sports Partnerships have assisted in organising and advertising these events.

In the morning, there was an informal meeting of the European Council, where we discussed the external aspects of migration, particularly the central Mediterranean route, and agreed a formal declaration.  In the afternoon, there was a meeting of the 27 EU Heads of State and Government - i.e. without the UK., where we considered the renewal and future direction of the EU.  </p>  <p>  I participated fully in both meetings, noting that the migration crisis remains one of the great humanitarian challenges facing our continent.  The discussions on the future direction of the EU, which were wide ranging, were based on the Declaration and Roadmap agreed at the Bratislava Informal Summit last September: the items included commitment to the EU as the best guarantee of peace and democracy; the need for concrete initiatives on migration; internal and external security and defence; and economic and social development, including youth.  I said that we need to demonstrate unity and resolve, and make it clear that the Union, with its core values, is an indispensable source of stability in this turbulent world.  We need a balanced response to the many challenges we face, with a focus on delivering our priorities, particularly those in relation to jobs, growth, investment and trade, which will bring concrete improvements to the lives of our citizens.  </p>  <p>  The exchanges at Valletta will now feed into preparations for a Summit in Rome on 24 and 25 March, to mark the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.  The intention is to agree a declaration after that meeting which will provide further guidance for us in the period ahead.</p></reply>

The IRPP was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the humanitarian crisis that developed in Southern Europe as a consequence of mass migration from areas of conflict in the Middle East and Africa.  Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State, 2,622 through the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, 1,040 (519 by the end of 2016 and the remainder in 2017) under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focused on resettling refugees from Lebanon and the balance through a variety of mechanisms.  Some elements of this intake, such as the relocation strand, come with a time limit of two years and other elements are not time bound.</p><p>In a further gesture of humanitarian assistance towards the most vulnerable caught up in the migration crisis and following a debate in the D&aacute;il, the Government also committed to taking up to 200 unaccompanied minors from France who were previously resident in the migrant camp at Calais.  These initiatives therefore leave just a small residual balance to be allocated from the Government decision to take 4,000 persons.</p><p>Taking account of the situation in the Middle East, and the plight of the refugees, the T&aacute;naiste announced that Ireland would accept 520 persons for resettlement over an 18-month period to the end of 2017.  This was almost double the figure proposed for Ireland by the European Commission and was delivered a year ahead of the Commission deadline.  In addition, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 520 refugees from Lebanon in  2017, most of whom are of Syrian origin.  260 refugees have already been selected during a selection mission to Lebanon in October 2016 and are expected to arrive in Spring 2017.  Most of these refugees are also Syrian.  A further selection mission to Lebanon will be arranged in the coming months to select the remaining refugees due to come to Ireland in 2017 under the resettlement programme.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>In relation to the EU Relocation Programme, Ireland has to date taken in 241 people from Greece.  In November, IRPP officials travelled to Athens and interviewed a group of 84 people who once cleared for travel, are expected to arrive over the next two weeks.  An IRPP mission to interview 80 people took place in Athens from 12 &ndash; 16 December.  A further mission has already taken place in January which interviewed 61 people.  An IRPP team are currently on the ground in Athens interviewing another group of over 90 asylum seekers.  The intention thereafter is to sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its commitments to Greece within the time frame envisaged by the  Programme. </p><p>Ireland will meet in full its commitment to Greece.  However, as explained in responses to previous Parliamentary Questions, matters relating to security assessments of the asylum seeker cohort eligible for relocation from Italy to Ireland remain to be resolved.  Accordingly, it has not been possible as yet for Ireland to take asylum seekers from Italy.  Numerous efforts have been made and continue to be made to resolve this situation. </p><p>The topic of 'Migration', in the context of the ongoing crisis, remains a standing agenda item for all meetings of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and of the European Council and I expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future. </p></reply>

This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na more into line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff.  I have requested the Garda Commissioner, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, to prepare a 5 year plan to achieve this 20% target by way of a twin-track approach (i) a civilian by default policy  and (ii) the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to operational policing posts and backfilling by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.  </p><p>The &quot;civilian by default&quot; policy refers to a policy where all new posts, other than operational policing posts, and non-operational policing posts that become vacant, are to be filled by suitably qualified civilian staff.  In relation to the redeployment policy, I have requested the Commissioner, in conjunction with the Authority to identify posts suitable for redeployment having regard to the indicative figure of 1,500 posts identified by the Garda Inspectorate in its report &quot;Changing Policing in Ireland&quot;.  These policies are designed to ensure that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, trained police men and women, are available for and utilised in operational areas.  The Authority, in view of its statutory functions in relation to approving the number of civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and appointing or approving the appointment of such staff has an important role to play in this regard. </p><p>The recruitment and appointment of up to 500 civilians provided for in this year's budget will facilitate the Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional level and also to begin the phased redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front-line policing roles.  These additional resources will make an important contribution to the delivery of the ambitious reform agenda set out in the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 and will facilitate deeper civilianisation in the coming years.</p><p>In addition, and again having regard to Garda Inspectorate report I have already mentioned, the Commissioner has commenced the roll-out on a pilot basis of a Divisional model of policing to replace the current District model.  The benefit of the Divisional model is that responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis which will facilitate greater flexibility in the deployment of resources in response to policing needs.  It also will have the benefit of reducing duplicate administrative tasks currently done at both the District and Divisional level.  In this regard, the Commissioner has estimated that 10 Garda&iacute; will be freed up for front-line duties in each Division once the model is fully rolled out.  The roll-out will be done on a phased basis and in such a manner as to ensure that the close relationship between Garda&iacute; and local communities is maintained.<b><font color="#000080"></font></b></p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the table the number of civilian staff for  each of the years from  December 2010 to 31 December 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available from the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>I have requested the information sought by the Deputy from the Commissioner regarding the civilian strength in the years 2010 and 2011 and I will write to the Deputy on receipt of same.  <table><tr><th>YEAR END</th><th>CIVILIAN STRENGTH</th><th>GARDA STRENGTH</th><th>TOTAL STRENGTH</th><th>PERCENTAGE CIVILIAN</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>2028</td><td>13,424</td><td>15,452</td><td>13%</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>2071</td><td>13,093</td><td>15,164</td><td>14%</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>2054</td><td>12,799</td><td>14,853</td><td>14%</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>2006</td><td>12,816</td><td>14,822</td><td>14%</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>1998</td><td>12,943</td><td>14,941</td><td>13%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Specifically, Section 12 of the Act provides that a person who is refused preclearance to travel onwards to the United States, shall be deemed for the purpose of the Aliens Act 1935 and the Immigration Act 2004, to have arrived at the frontier of the State.  In many cases, the persons are Irish citizens or EU nationals subject to Free Movement and once this is established they are not subject to any further immigration requirements. In circumstances where a person is refused leave to board a US bound flight, he or she is brought to the Garda immigration authorities and the case is considered by Garda immigration officers in the same manner as if they had presented at the frontier of the State seeking permission to enter the State.  For those subject to immigration controls under the Immigration Act 2004, as is normal in these cases, each case is examined on its individual merits to determine if the person is to be given permission to enter the State.  Specific details on numbers refused by the US immigration authorities are not available, and from an Irish immigration perspective are dealt with as part of the overall immigration process at the relevant airports.  </p><p>These decisions are taken in accordance with Irish law and take fully into account our international obligations.

This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Vetting Disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.  Furthermore, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date.  Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform that Deputy that at present, 80% of overall vetting applications are being processed by the National Vetting Bureau in five working days.  This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-Vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations.  The e-Vetting system is available to all registered organisations and the Garda Authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-Vetting system to do so.  In circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is very largely obviated. </p>  <p>  There are certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  Section 12(3)(A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of an person to undertake relevant work or activities thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.</p>  <p>  I have requested the detailed information on personnel and expenditure from the Garda Authorities and I will communicate it to the Deputy when the information is to hand.</p></reply>

My officials' understanding is that it relates to the inclusion of an institution that is not one of the 12 covered by Scheme.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment at this stage as to do so might serve to prejudice the respective ongoing consideration processes. </p>  <p>  The Magdalen Laundries Restorative Justice Ex Gratia Scheme was set up following the publication of the report in February, 2013 of an Inter-Departmental Committee set up to establish the facts of the State's involvement with the Magdalen Laundries.  It was chaired by then Senator Martin McAleese and it is commonly referred to as the McAleese report.  The material in the Report relates to 10 different institutions which were run by 4 different Orders of nuns over a period of 70 years.  Although there was no finding in the McAleese Report which indicated that the State had any liability in the matter, following the report&rsquo;s publication the Taoiseach issued a State apology to the women.  Mr. Justice Quirke was asked by the Government to make recommendations on an appropriate redress scheme for those who were in the 10 Magdalen laundries that were the subject of the McAleese Report.  The Government also included in the scheme the laundry that was attached to Stanhope Street Training School and later also decided to include a 12th institution, the Training School in Summerhill.</p>  <p>  The centre named in the details supplied with one of the questions above is An Grian&aacute;n Training Centre.  Although located on the same complex as the Magdalen Laundry in High Park, i.e. one of those 12 named institutions, An Grian&aacute;n was a separate institution in its own right.  Its function was to rehabilitate teenage girls and provide education to prepare them for reintegration into society.  It thus served a different purpose to that of the traditional Magdalen institutions which dated back to the 19th century and which were open to women of all ages.  An Grian&aacute;n Training Centre, officially established in 1971, had a separate legal status as a certified place of detention and an approved residential children's home.  An Grian&aacute;n is among the 130 institutions listed in the Schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002 and was therefore covered by the Residential Institutions Redress Board Scheme operated by the Department of Education and Skills.  </p>  <p>  Aside from An Grian&aacute;n's own separate legal status and its different function to that of a Magdalen laundry, it should be further noted that the terms of the Scheme specifically exclude institutions that are covered by the Residential Institutions Redress Board Scheme.  This is to prevent a situation arising where an individual could receive compensation under two separate schemes for the same period of time spent in one institution.</p>  <p>  I will take this opportunity to give some background to the operation of the Scheme.  Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking into account any available records, documents and statements including the applicant's testimony.  Processing of all applications under the Scheme operates on the premise that the testimony of the applicant is correct and the officers processing the application then seek to verify the application by checking appropriate records.  If there are records and they are consistent with the application, then an offer is made.  If there is a discrepancy, or in cases where the religious congregations have an incomplete or no record for an applicant, my officials must carry out a thorough examination, checking whatever records are available from other departments, agencies and institutions to support the application.  The records of the religious congregations are not regarded as decisive; they are just one factor that is taken into consideration.</p>  <p>  To date, over &euro;25 million has been paid out to 669 women under the Scheme.  The Scheme remains open to new applications but it is important to note that decisions have been made on all of the 819 applications made to date.  The difference between that figure and the 669 payments made is accounted for by refusals and for other reasons including probate cases, applicants still considering provisional offers, and the application of the Assisted Decision Making Act, 2015 in relation to those women who lack the necessary capacity. </p>  <p>  The Scheme provides for lump sum payments varying from &euro;11,500 to &euro;100,000 depending on the length of stay in the institution concerned.  Further, each woman is entitled to a top-up payment to bring her weekly income from the Irish State up to the equivalent of the Irish Contributory Pension in recognition of the fact that they were not paid for the work they did while in the laundries.</p>  <p>  Moreover, the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015 provided for certain services to be made available by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to the women.  The services, which are free of charge, include GP services, prescribed drugs, medicines, aids and appliances, dental, ophthalmic and aural services, home support, home nursing, counselling services, chiropody, podiatry and physiotherapy.  The HSE has administrative arrangements in place for health and social services for women living outside Ireland.</p></reply>

This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Vetting Disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.  Furthermore, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date.  Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform that Deputy that at present, 80% of overall vetting applications are being processed by the National Vetting Bureau in five working days.  This efficiency in vetting has been achieved by the deployment of the e-Vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations.  The e-Vetting system is available to all registered organisations and the Garda Authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-Vetting system to do so.  In circumstances where has been such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is very largely obviated.  There are certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  Section 12(3)(A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of an person to undertake relevant work or activities thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.</p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and maintain revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base.  However, the base for USC does not include payments made by the Department of Social Protection, including the State pension.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the USC was reviewed by my Department in 2011 and the issue of USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public service who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of that review.  Such individuals are (or were) liable to modified rate PRSI, which does not generate an entitlement to the State Pension.  In retirement therefore they receive an occupational pension only, and do not receive a separate State Pension unless as a result of PRSI contributions made in another employment during their working life.</p>  <p>  It was decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these individuals from the USC charge as an exemption would be very costly and difficult to achieve, and it could involve all income earners with the equivalent income benefiting from the exemption.  In addition, it would also undermine the principle of the USC being applied to income with few exceptions.</p>  <p>  However, as a result of the review of the USC, in Budget 2012 the entry threshold to USC was increased from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum, and the threshold was subsequently increased further in Budgets 2015 and 2016, to the current threshold of &euro;13,000.  This exemption threshold equalises the position for single individuals whose sole source of income is the State Contributory Pension with Public Service pensioners whose pension is at an equivalent level.  It is estimated that over 700,000 income earners will not be liable to USC from 2017.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the current Government has committed to continuing the process of phasing out the USC in future Budgets, with a particular focus on low and middle-income earners, subject to having the required fiscal space.</p></reply>

Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that in my role as Minister for Finance I have no direct function in the relationship between the banks and their customers.  I have no statutory function in relation to the banking decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time and these are taken by the board and management of the relevant institution.  This includes decisions in relation to products as determined by the banks.</p>  <p>  All viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy.  As the Deputy may be aware, section 3.5 (Ensuring Finance for Growth) of the Action Plan for Jobs 2017 (APJ) sets out a range of commitments to ensure viable SME's can access appropriate finance at a reasonable cost from both bank and non-bank sources.</p>  <p>  In line with Action 62 of the APJ 2017, officials from my Department will collate and examine data from AIB and Bank of Ireland on a monthly basis, including data pertaining to the various sectors.  Furthermore, my officials meet the banks on a quarterly basis to ensure an informed understanding of the wider SME bank lending environment which assists the development and implementation of policies aimed at ensuring SME access to finance and increased competition in the SME lending sector.</p>  <p>  In terms of monitoring the requirements for SMEs, my Department commissions biannual surveys to ascertain the demand for credit by SMEs.   This survey series, most recently conducted by Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes on behalf of my Department, is the most comprehensive survey of SME credit demand in Ireland, covering 1,500 respondents and involving over 6,000 direct telephone calls to SMEs.  SMEs of all sizes trading in all sectors, excluding property development and speculative activities, are included.  The survey covers demand for credit from both bank and non-bank sources.</p>  <p>  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the most recently published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey covering the April to September 2016, which can be found at www.finance.gov.ie.  The results of this survey show that, when pending applications are excluded, 84% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved.  Demand for credit remains subdued and the latest survey shows only 22% of SMEs in the Hotel and Restaurant sector requested bank finance in the previous six months down from 34% in September 2015.</p>  <p>  Purchases, replacement or lease of new vehicle/equipment is now provided as the main reason for applying for bank finance with 29% stating this is why they requested bank finance.  Working capital/cash flow requirements were provided as the second highest reason for applying for bank finance with 27% of respondents stating that they required finance for this purpose.  When asked about sources of finance for working capital, internal funds/retained earnings were the main finance source of working capital with 73% of working capital coming from this source (up 6%).  The survey also showed continued positive trends in terms of trading performance, profitability and employment.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector, as reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government, and sees it as a key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently, my Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate participants in the SME sector to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.</p></reply>

They have advised me that, in 2016, 6,100[1] tobacco seizures were made which resulted in approximately 44.5m cigarettes and 1,500kgs of tobacco being seized by Revenue.  The quantities of cigarettes and other tobacco products seized and data on the number of tobacco seizures made by Revenue in the years 2012 2016 are shown in Table below.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Quantity of seized cigarettes</th><th>Quantity of other tobacco KGs</th><th>Number of Tobacco seizures</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>95,604,730</td><td>5,277</td><td>9,503</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>40,844,800</td><td>4,203</td><td>6,888</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>53,445,350</td><td>9,824</td><td>6,866</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>67,917,500</td><td>2,364</td><td>7,154</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>44,563,810</td><td>1,526</td><td>6,100</td></tr></table></p><p>The table demonstrates that while Revenue continues to prioritise enforcement action in this area and has maintained the level of resources allocated to this activity, the volumes seized and the number of seizures can vary significantly.  This occurs because smugglers are constantly looking for new ways to avoid detection, and adapt their operations in response to seizures by Revenue and other law enforcement agencies internationally.  Seizure statistics are also very variable because of the effect of individual very large seizures on annual data.  Revenue continually reviews the ways in which it acts against this illegal activity, to ensure detection and seizure of illegal cigarettes and to carefully monitor trends and patterns in the illicit trade so that the response can be adjusted accordingly.</p><p>Revenue advise me that the same factors that impact seizure quantities also affect the number of seizures and that there has been no reduction in the level of checking undertaken at ports and airports.  There has been a reduction in the number of detections made at Irish airports in 2016, but this mirrors a similar pattern experienced in a number of other airports in other jurisdictions including the United Kingdom and reflects a shift in the pattern of tobacco smuggling of the kind referred to above as smugglers react to high levels of seizures in airports in particular.</p><p>In terms of assessing the overall performance in tackling illegal tobacco,  a reliable measure is the IPSOS/MRBI surveys of illicit tobacco conducted for Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office.  The surveys indicate that in 2015 12% of cigarette consumption was illicit, up from 11% in 2014 but down on 2011 and 2012 levels, of 15% and 13% respectively.</p><p>[1] Headline figures published in January 2017 noted 6,024 seizures in 2016.  This information was provided before year end and has since been revised to reflect the total number of seizures for 2016.</p></reply>

As we know the establishment of Section 110 companies is completely legal as it is permitted under Irish law and tax codes.As we also know, this House recently moved to change legislation governing the tax treatment of certain activities carried out within Section 110 companies.</p><p>In 2009, prior to passing the NAMA Act and prior to the establishment of NAMA, as part of the efforts of the Government of the time in planning for NAMA, Section 110 company structures were evaluated, considered and adopted as being central to ensuring tax neutrality and respecting the tax equivalent treatment of NAMA as a commercial body.</p><p>In 2010, resulting from this planning, NAMA established its Group structure which included a number of Section 110 companies.  I am advised that the proposed structure was first presented to the NAMA Board in February 2010 and was formally approved by the Board in June 2010.  The Revenue Commissioners were informed of the proposed structure in 2010 and raised no objection to it.</p><p>It is important to note that NAMA's use of Section 110 structures is not new information.  NAMA has repeatedly and publicly disclosed its utilisation of SPVs, which include Section 110 structures, in its Annual Reports.  The C&amp;amp;AG has also been aware of NAMA's use of Section 110 company structures since NAMA's inception.  In October 2010, the C&amp;amp;AG published its Special Report entitled &quot;National Asset Management Agency - Acquisition of Bank Assets.&quot;  Appendix E within this report outlines in detail NAMA's Group Structure and its use of Section 110 Companies.  It also contains a detailed description of the principal tax benefits that accrue to a qualifying Section 110 company.  This report is publically available at : .</p><p>NAMA's accounts have been audited, since inception, by the C&amp;amp;AG and filed with Revenue and reflect activity by NAMA that is, and has been, operating in full compliance with the tax code.  Following the change that we, as a legislature, made to the tax law governing Section 110 companies last year, NAMA paid &euro;158 million to the Revenue Commissioners as a preliminary tax payment to reflect its expected tax obligations under this new tax regime.  Thus, NAMA has always and continues to act in accordance with tax law.  Through this payment, NAMA is now simply moving, as would be expected, to operate in line with the recent change to tax legislation.</p><p>Under Section 214 of the NAMA Act, NAMA, the Agency - which owns 49% of the NAMA Group companies, is exempt from income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  NAMA Group companies, which contain all of the assets, liabilities and activities of NAMA, do not benefit from such an exemption and are tax-equivalent to any other market operator.</p><p>The tax exemption of the NAMA Agency does not adversely affect the Exchequer given that any surplus generated by the NAMA Group companies will accrue to the NAMA Agency and will vest in the State on a tax neutral basis.</p><p>The purpose of utilising Section 110 companies was to ensure that there was no unnecessary cash leakage from within the NAMA Group.  This is no different to any other market operator.  In NAMA's case, this was particularly important given the need to redeem guaranteed senior debt expeditiously and also the need to apply available cashflow to fund development projects ultimately intended to preserve and enhance the State's return from acquired assets, as required by Section 10 of the NAMA Act.  Under an alternative tax regime, the amounts applied by NAMA towards debt redemption and development funding may well have been different.</p><p>I would also point out to the Deputy that all NAMA proceeds, whether through tax payments or a dividend surplus at dissolution, are ultimately destined to be transferred to the State.</p><p>I am advised that some NAMA entities are minority shareholders in a limited number of investments.  NAMA is a passive investor and has no active management role or controlling interest in these structures.  The corporate structures relating to NAMA's minority interests are ultimately a matter for the investment vehicle managers and/or directors.  I am further advised that, in any event, the investment vehicles in which NAMA has an interest have not, to NAMA's knowledge, availed of the Section 110 tax exemptions.</p></reply>

The relief is available, subject to a maximum limit, where farm land is leased to a qualifying lessee for a period of 5 years or more.</p>  <p>  The 2014 Agri-Taxation Review found that long-term leasing has a number of advantages over the more traditional conacre system and it recommended the continuation and enhancement of measures to assist in rebalancing the market in its favour, including the amendments brought forward to this tax incentive.  This tax relief has a very specific policy aim of accelerating land mobility and productivity through making additional agricultural land available to farmers on a medium to long term basis for husbandry purposes.</p>  <p>  There are a number of specific criteria that must be met in order to qualify for this relief, including the use of the land itself, that the lease must be completed in writing, it must run for a minimum of 5 years, and that it cannot be made between connected parties.  The incentive is targeted and designed to achieve a specific policy objective in terms of making more land available for husbandry and therefore increased agricultural production.  Extending the relief such that it was available for the leasing of agricultural land to sporting organisations, would have no impact on the achievement of the socio-economic objectives for which the exemption was designed, and could potentially, lead to circumvention of the original policy intention.</p></reply>

There are no plans to re-establish a dedicated training organisation for the sector, but rather to deliver the required education and training through the mainstream higher and further education and training sectors, in line with provision for other sectors.</p><p>The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGSFN) carried out a study on the future skills needs of the sector and the report of the study was published in November 2015.  The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020.  The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth.  The report provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth which is one the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025.</p><p>The Study assesses skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings.  The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020.  A key recommendation in the report was the need to set up of a National Oversight and Advisory Group comprising all the key hospitality stakeholders.</p><p>Following on this recommendation, the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group was established early last year, chaired by SOLAS for the first year.  To date the group has held seven meetings.</p><p>Membership of the Group includes the Restaurant Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotel Federation, Irish Hospitality Institute, Licensed Vintners Association, Vintners Federation of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Social Protection, Higher Education Authority, Skillnets, SOLAS, ETBs, IoTs, DIT and Quality and Qualifications Ireland.</p><p>The role of the Group is to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the EGFSN and to provide a forum for on-going collaboration in addressing the skills needs of the sector and to identify and progress actions to overcome barriers on its implementation.</p><p>The Group plan to publish a progress report later this year.  To date work has been undertaken on careers promotion via a range of fora, the launch of the <i>Tourism Insight</i>online programme &ndash; aimed at promoting careers in tourism and hospitality with particular reference to transition year and Youthreach participants.  Audits of both higher and further education facilities and courses are underway as well as the establishment of a Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet which aims to address key skills requirements of restaurants and catering companies to help drive the domestic hospitality sector, employment growth, talent attraction and retention.</p><p>Funded through the National Training Fund by my Department, the network plans to design tailored programmes covering all aspects of the restaurant, food and beverage industry to SMEs nationally, with a particular focus on career progression for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings and increase retention levels within the sector and is well placed to address key recommendations of the EGFSN 2015 Report on the Future Skills.</p><p>Last week, I launched the 2016-2020 Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, setting out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period to 2020.  The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals in 2015 and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year, to provide for the needs of all sectors, including hospitality and tourism.</p><p>Over the lifetime of the Action Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes representing a doubling of current activity.</p><p>Work is progressing on the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry Education and Training Board.  It is planned that this programme will commence later this year.  The Apprenticeship Council also recently approved development funding for a separate proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship.  The Apprenticeship Council will continue to work with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.  The funding for planned and forecast expansion in 2017 will see an additional &euro;20 million provided.</p><p>In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was begun by SOLAS in collaboration with ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice.  Networks of Employers have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers in identifying training needs, designing the training programmes, recruitment of learners and delivery of the training on and off the job.  The Career Traineeship model of work-based learning is currently being piloted with the Hospitality and Engineering sectors, with the involvement of seven ETBs.</p><p>Given the breadth and range of programmes within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, it is not possible to provide details of funding and places on a county by county basis across specific sectoral provision.  However, one way in which Solas classify FET provision is by the career areas which it serves.  The following table on provision in the FET sector shows the total number of beneficiaries in the career areas of Food and Beverage and Tourism in each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards for 2015 along with that planned for 2016.  As yet, final 2016 figures are not available.</p><p>While it is not possible to give details of expenditure at the level of career areas, the scale of total investment in FET and the numbers served on both a full and part time basis are also included in the table.</p><p>In relation to the number of tourism and hospitality skills training positions within the higher education sector in 2015 and 2016 and the amount of funding allocated for tourism and hospitality skills training in the same years, it is not possible to give a breakdown by county as students can apply for courses throughout the country, through the CAO application process.  However, the following table on provision in the higher education sector gives a breakdown outlining the number of training positions and the total estimated funding allocated which is categorised by each individual Institute.</p><p>In 2015 the total number of student in higher education courses in this sector was 8,220 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;47.4 million and in 2016 the total number of student  for the sector was 8,033 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;48.4m.  The funding detailed in this response includes an estimation of grants allocated to these courses, student contribution and free fees.  The student numbers are calculated as full time equivalents (FTE) which includes part time and full time student counts.</p><p>This analysis of the higher education sector includes all courses within the following categories:</p><p>- Tourism/Hotel/Leisure/Event</p><p>- Hospitality and Culinary</p><p>- Heritage and Cultural </p><p><b><font color="#1F497D">  </font></b>I also<font color="#1F497D"> </font>understand that a limited amount of complementary tourism-related business development and training supports are provided by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the agency responsible for encouraging, promoting and supporting tourism as a leading indigenous component of the Irish economy.  However, I have no role or responsibility in relation to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Matters relating to that agency and its training and business supports are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p>Summary of 2015-2016 Tourism and Hospitality Courses Higher Education Sector<table><tr><th>Institute</th><th>2015</th><th></th><th>2016</th><th></th><th></th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Student No's</td><td>Amount &euro;</td><td>Student No's</td><td>Amount &euro;</td><td>Student No's</td><td>Total Amount &euro;</td></tr><tr><td>AIT</td><td>427</td><td>2,538,000</td><td>384</td><td>2,477,000</td><td>811</td><td>5,015,000</td></tr><tr><td>ITB</td><td>231</td><td>1,541,000</td><td>223</td><td>1,541,000</td><td>454</td><td>3,082,000</td></tr><tr><td>ITC</td><td>109</td><td>730,000</td><td>143</td><td>910,000</td><td>252</td><td>1,640,000</td></tr><tr><td>CIT</td><td>896</td><td>5,161,000</td><td>885</td><td>5,261,000</td><td>1781</td><td>10,422,000</td></tr><tr><td>DKIT</td><td>450</td><td>2,272,000</td><td>462</td><td>2,521,000</td><td>912</td><td>4,793,000</td></tr><tr><td>DIT</td><td>2482</td><td>14,143,000</td><td>2471</td><td>14,085,000</td><td>4953</td><td>28,228,000</td></tr><tr><td>DLIADT</td><td>21</td><td>10,000</td><td>56</td><td>21,000</td><td>77</td><td>31,000</td></tr><tr><td>GMIT</td><td>1130</td><td>6,051,000</td><td>1065</td><td>5,934,000</td><td>2195</td><td>11,985,000</td></tr><tr><td>LYIT</td><td>219</td><td>1,475,000</td><td>203</td><td>1,455,000</td><td>422</td><td>2,930,000</td></tr><tr><td>LIT (incl LIT Tipp) </td><td>447</td><td>2,657,000</td><td>438</td><td>3,015,000</td><td>885</td><td>5,672,000</td></tr><tr><td>ITS</td><td>331</td><td>1,746,000</td><td>301</td><td>1,696,000</td><td>632</td><td>3,442,000</td></tr><tr><td>ITTD</td><td>241</td><td>1,573,000</td><td>270</td><td>1,861,000</td><td>511</td><td>3,434,000</td></tr><tr><td>ITTR</td><td>649</td><td>3,844,000</td><td>596</td><td>4,129,000</td><td>1245</td><td>7,973,000</td></tr><tr><td>WIT</td><td>587</td><td>3,667,000</td><td>536</td><td>3,560,000</td><td>1123</td><td>7,227,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>8220</td><td>47,408,000</td><td>8033</td><td>48,468,000</td><td>16,253</td><td>95,874,000</td></tr></table></p></reply>

That legislation sets out the respective responsibilities of the Board and executive of Caranua and of the Minister for Education and Skills.  In summary, the key statutory responsibilities assigned to me, as Minister for Education and Skills, under the 2012 Act, that are directly relevant to Caranua are:</p><p>- the approval of contracts and consultancies (section 7(7));</p><p>- approving additional classes of services (section 8);</p><p>- the appointment of Board members (section 11);</p><p>- approving the appointment of a Chief Executive (section 13);</p><p>- approving the number of staff, their terms and conditions and remuneration, etc. (all with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform) (section 17);</p><p>- the receipt of annual reports and laying them before the Houses of the Oireachtas (section 19);</p><p>- matters relating to the independent appeals officer (sections 21 &amp;amp; 22); and</p><p>- the receipt of annual accounts and laying them before the Houses of the Oireachtas (section 31).</p><p>I am satisfied that the arrangements that are in place for the monitoring and oversight of Caranua by my Department are appropriate and operate effectively while respecting the statutory independence of that organisation and complying with the provisions of the 2012 Act and other requirements including the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.</p><p>The Deputy will wish to be aware that up to the end of December 2016 Caranua had received over 5,600 applications and had spent over &euro;56 million on supports to or on behalf of almost 4,200 applicants.  Thus a significant level of funding has been provided to a large number of former residents, a fact which is to be particularly welcomed.  I believe that the lives of many former residents will have been improved as a result of this support.</p></reply>

SCPA is utilised, in the main, where as yet unfilled vacancies exist in NEPS staffing provision locally or where staffing resource is lost through extended leave (maternity, sick or carer&rsquo;s leave).</p><p>Included for the Deputy&rsquo;s information is a list of schools that do not currently have access to a NEPS Psychologist for the purposes of carrying out an assessment in Dublin and which currently derive this service through the abovementioned SCPA scheme.  In respect of NEPS staffing, NEPs psychologists are recruited via regional panels formed from national recruitment competitions administered by the Public Appointments service.</p><p>In the case of some schools, NEPs psychologists may no longer be assigned to those schools as a result of retirement, resignation or transfer to another NEPs region, and while every effort was made to fill the resulting vacancy during 2016 from the existing PAS panels this was not successful and the panel was closed.</p><p>A new national recruitment competition has been put in place by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) to fill vacancies within all NEPS Regions.  The resulting interview process associated with this competition was completed last week and recruitment panels for each NEPS region, including Dublin, will now be formed.  PAS will finalise the processing of the candidates, including Garda vetting, and propose each candidate in series to my Department Human Resources Section for contract negotiations and formal job offer.</p><p>It is envisaged that the process will produce new NEPS psychologists for assignment to schools, including that to which the Deputy refers in his question, by the end of the current academic year.</p><p>In addition a number of the assigned NEPS psychologists to schools, included in the attached count, are currently absent due to maternity leave, long-term sick leave or carer&rsquo;s leave necessitating a temporary hiatus in NEPS coverage. This situation will change as individual staff return to work.</p><p>However it is important to point out that in cases where NEPS service is not available through staffing vacancy or temporary absence of staff, as described above, the schools affected continue to have access to a psychologist through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments to undertake pupil assessment work.</p><p>I would also confirm that all schools are able to access full NEP supports in the event of a critical incident irrespective of their having ongoing access to an assigned NEPS psychologist or not.</p><p>County by County of schools that do not currently have access to a NEPS Psychologist for the purposes of carrying out an educational assessment (ref: 2/2/17)<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Number of Schools</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>131</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The remainder are non-ASD special classes.</p><p>The NCSE has advised that there are almost 18,000 students with ASD attending schools nationally. Of these 3,484 are attending primary ASD classes and 1,118 are attending post primary ASD classes. </p><p>The NCSE continues to review special class placement requirements nationally and have informed the Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand.</p><p>The continued growth in post primary special class numbers is a natural consequence of the earlier growth in primary special class numbers.  However, it should not be assumed that the same levels of growth in post primary class numbers should apply.  This is because, for children with Autism, transferring from a special class in a primary school to a special class in a post primary school may not always be the optimal choice.  Many children can progress to mainstream post primary with support of SNA and Resource Teaching hours, while more may transfer from primary to a special school depending on their presentation and needs.</p><p>It should also be noted that there is a proportionally larger enrolment at Primary level due to the higher number of standard years.  Of the total enrolment in schools currently 68% of students are enrolled at Primary Level (which includes all Special Schools) and 32% are enrolled at Post Primary level.</p><p>As such my Department does not consider the lower number of Post Primary Special classes for students with ASD currently constitutes a shortage of placements.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, my Department acknowledges that there are challenges in opening special classes in some Post primary schools.  The NCSE is working with these schools to address this. </p><p>My Department continues to consider all options to improve the situation, including whether there is a need for legislation.  However, my Department is of the view that the legislation option carries significant risks and would clearly prefer that all schools would open classes where needs arise voluntarily.  My Department believes that, in the light of recent improvements in Special Class numbers in Post Primary schools, there are some grounds for optimism that schools are becoming more positively disposed to requests to open such classes.</p><p>The attached NCSE guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools contain information on setting up and organising special classes, including information on resources which may be provided to schools to establish special classes as requested by the Deputy.  The guidelines are available to download from www.ncse.ie.</p><p>Furthermore, it is general practice to include a Special Needs Unit in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required.  In addition, my Department may also provide capital funding to schools to establish special needs provision e.g. reconfigure existing accommodation to provide a special class where this has been approved by the National Council for Special Education through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult with the NEPS service should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will a psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p>  <p>  I would advise if there are concerns in relation to the educational development of any student that these should be raised, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he/she is attending, with a view to the Principal raising the situation with NEPS. </p></reply>

This indicates a national ASD prevalence rate of 1.55% or 1 in every 65 students.</p>  <p>  My Department invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling:</p>  <p>  - 63% of students to attend mainstream schools</p>  <p>  - 23% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and</p>  <p>  - 14% to attend special schools.</p>  <p>  My Department provides a range of supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, they will have access to an appropriate education. </p>  <p>  The range of supports and services which are made available include additional learning and resource teaching support, Special Needs Assistant (S) support, funding for the purchase of specialised equipment, services of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), enhanced levels of capitation in Special schools and Special Classes and additional teacher training.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENO), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (S) to schools to support students with special educational needs, including autism.  The NCSE operates within the Department's criteria in allocating such support. </p>  <p>  The NCSE also provides information for Parents of Children with Special Education Needs through its website (www.ncse.ie) and Pamphlet Series which inform parents and guardians of supports and services available for children and young people with ASD and their families.</p>  <p>  Also, for children with autism, the school year is extended to include the month of July.  This is commonly referred to as 'the July Provision Programme'.  This is typically delivered in the child's school, but where the school is not in a position to deliver this, it can be provided as home tuition. </p>  <p>  My Department supports the professional development of staff working with children with special educational needs, including those with Autism, through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).</p>  <p>  Further support is provided to children and their families by the Middletown Centre for Autism in Co. Armagh.  This centre is jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.  The Centre provides a comprehensive nationwide training service for parents and educational professionals.  Parents can view the range of courses which the Centre has available through the website www.middletownautism.com.</p>  <p>  The availability and provision of health-related therapy services, including speech and language, occupational therapy and sensory therapy support, is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE), and matters in relation to the provision of such services should be directed to the Minister for Health through the Health Service Executive.  My Department has no responsibility or mandate for such services.</p></reply>

The scheme also provides a compensatory educational service for children with special educational needs seeking an educational placement and provision is made for early educational intervention for children with autism.</p>  <p>  In terms of the number of children in receipt of home tuition for 2016/17 school year, my Department does not maintain statistics for specific areas within counties.  Statistics available show that there are:</p>  <p>  - 30 children with a diagnosis of ASD, aged between 2.5yrs and 3yrs of age</p>  <p>  - 259 children with a diagnosis of ASD aged over 3 years and</p>  <p>  - 85 children with a significant medical condition currently availing of home tuition in City and County Dublin. </p>  <p>  Children aged 2.5 years with a diagnosis of ASD are not eligible for enrolment in an early intervention class and qualify for 10 hours tuition per week under the terms of the Home Tuition Grant Scheme should the parent wish to avail of it.  Home Tuition continues from their 3rd birthday if no placement in a school based autism early intervention class is available for them.  The number of hours tuition per week will then increase to 20 for eligible children. </p>  <p>  When a child with an autism diagnosis reaches 4 years of age they may be accommodated in a number of settings.  In such circumstances, a school placement can be a place in a mainstream class in a mainstream school, a place in a special class attached to a mainstream school, a place in an early intervention class for children with ASD (where the child will not reach the age of 6 during the school year), or a place in a special school.  Where there is no educational placement available, my Department will consider applications under the Home Tuition Grant Scheme, where the child can receive 20 hours home tuition per week and until a placement is available. </p>  <p>  The Home Tuition Grant Scheme is an interim measure to provide for education until an educational placement becomes available.  When a school placement becomes available the Home Tuition Grant will be discontinued. </p>  <p>  My Department also operates a Home Tuition Grant Scheme for children, other than those with special education needs, who do not have a school place, are without the offer of a school place and for whom a school place is being actively sought.  The purpose of this Grant Scheme is to provide funding towards provision of a compensatory educational service for children who do not have a school place.  Application forms for this Home Tuition Grant Scheme are available from the local Educational Welfare Officer of the Child and Family Agency. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department operates a Maternity Related Absences Home Tuition scheme.  The purpose of the Maternity Related Home Tuition scheme is to provide funding towards the provision of a compensatory education service for girls  who are unable to attend school due to pregnancy. Statistics for these schemes are held on a county basis only.  Currently in County Dublin there are 16 children who have been granted 9 hours per week under  these two schemes.</p></reply>

The Vetting Act applies not just to schools but to any relevant organisation that employs, contracts, permits or places a person in relevant work with children or vulnerable persons.  The vetting legislation and the vetting procedures operated by the National Vetting Bureau fall within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  When the vetting requirements were commenced last April, my Department issued circular 0031/2016 which set out the statutory vetting requirements applicable to schools along with the practical arrangements in place to support the vetting procedures.</p>  <p>  The Vetting Act provides that a relevant organisation must, other than in certain limited circumstances, obtain a vetting disclosure from the National Vetting Bureau prior to commencing the employment of an employee to undertake relevant work with children or vulnerable adults.  The Vetting Act allows for some limited exemptions to this requirement, including certain exemptions that are applicable in the case of recurring substitute employment such as a recurring substitute S employment.  The Act&rsquo;s exemptions in respect of substitute employment are set out in section 5.3 of my Department&rsquo;s circular.</p>  <p>  Under the new statutory vetting procedures, the vetting of Ss and other non-teaching staff continues to be conducted via the relevant diocesan office or school management body as the relevant conduit organisation for the vetting of Ss and other non-teaching staff employed by schools.  In the case of ETB schools the relevant ETB is the relevant organisation for such vetting.  My Department understands that the majority of these bodies are now using the National Vetting Bureau&rsquo;s electronic vetting facility.</p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.</p>  <p>  Under Part 5 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, the Commissioner of Valuation is conducting a revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State.  The Valuation Acts come under the aegis of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.  In a revaluation all rateable property within a rating authority area is revalued so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property and changes in the local business environment.  Following revaluation there is a much closer and uniform relationship between contemporary rental values of property and their commercial rates liability.  In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the rates burden relative to the modern rental value of the property that they occupy.</p>  <p>  To date, revaluations have been completed in South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Dublin City Council, Waterford City and County Council and Limerick City and County Council.  I understand that revaluations in ten local authorities, including Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, South Dublin and Westmeath County Councils are due to be completed this year with valuations to take effect for rates purposes from 2018.</p>  <p>  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities.  However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  Many of the provisions are outdated and not suitable for business trends in the modern era.  I have asked my Department to develop proposals for the preparation of a consolidated Rates Bill to modernise and consolidate the legislation in this area.  Among the measures being considered for the General Scheme of the Bill are provisions to allow a local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support, inter alia, urban regeneration and rural development.</p></reply>

Since taking up office as Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, I have been open to ideas and proposals from private sector bodies to assist the delivery of social housing and affordable private housing.  I have met with a range of organisations, including representative bodies, private companies and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).</p><p>On 14 June 2016, I met with Irish Residential Properties REIT plc where the matters of housing and building regulations were addressed.  On 23 June 2016, I attended a meeting of Property Industry Ireland, an organisation representing the property industry, during which interest was expressed by participants in private investment in social housing provision.  Meetings were held involving WK Nowlan Property Ltd. on 7 September 2016 and 25 January 2017, which I attended, where proposals to improve the delivery of affordable housing were raised.  On 22 September and 6 October 2016, I attended meetings involving the Construction Industry Federation where housing development issues were addressed.  On 29 September 2016, I attended a meeting with Atelier Capital LLP, a private body interested in investing in student accommodation provision.  On the same date I participated at an event hosted by the Cork Chapter of the Irish League of Credit Unions at which the potential for credit union investment in social housing was addressed.<b></b>On 19 October 2016 I met with a representative of the European Investment Bank, during which the potential for investment in social housing was discussed.</p><p>A number of private equity firms have expressed an interest in purchasing mortgage debt portfolios from commercial banks with a view to exploring the potential for them to access the Mortgage to Rent Scheme model for the borrowers in occupation of the mortgaged property.  They are seeking an alternative arrangement that would see the mortgaged property staying in the funding firm&rsquo;s ownership and the property itself leased back to the local authority in circumstances where the borrower is eligible for Mortgage to Rent and the borrower would therefore remain in their own home.  In this regard, Minister of State English met with Beacon Social Housing on 1 July and 21 September 2016, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) on 21 September 2016, Bartra Capital on 1 December 2016 and the Arizun Group on 15 December 2016.</p><p>Currently, the mortgage to rent scheme relies on Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) purchasing from lenders properties that have been voluntarily surrendered by eligible borrowers.  One of the outcomes of the Review of the Mortgage to Rent Scheme is that in order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities who have come forward with an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a minimum of 200 units based on alternative lease arrangements.  The objective is to explore what is available within the current market and to determine if this alternative model will benefit a greater number of households.</p><p>I routinely meet with Approved Housing Bodies in the course of my work, where issues relating to investment by the voluntary housing sector in social housing are raised.  In the development of Rebuilding Ireland, and subsequently, I have been actively engaged with stakeholder bodies, including those involved in the delivery and financing of social housing.</p><p>The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme provides a means whereby properties can be built or bought by AHBs with the combined use of State and private funding, and, leased by AHBs and Local Authorities from private providers, for the provision of social housing.  This scheme is underpinned by a lease and other legal agreements.  These provide that rental payments are made by the State over an agreed long-term time period, typically 20 years. In return the housing unit is made available for social housing.</p><p>Changes are now being proposed to this scheme in order to facilitate larger institutional private investors to become involved in the financing of social housing.  The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) is acting as financial advisor to my Department in this work and is undertaking market engagement in the development of the scheme.  Work on the scheme is well advanced, with details expected to be announced in the coming months.</p></reply>

Recognising the pressures in the rental market, the Government increased the maximum rent limits available under the HAP scheme across the country with effect from 1 July 2016.  Furthermore, additional flexibility above the existing HAP rent limits was made available to all HAP local authorities from the same date.</p><p>My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf.  While my Department does monitor such trends, the data requested by the Deputy is not available. Ultimately, the level of support made available to individual households is a matter for the local authority concerned.  The increased flexibility provided to local authorities offers them, as housing authorities, more capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.  Since the introduction of the increased HAP rent limits in July 2016 more than 2,500 pre-existing HAP households have received an increase in their level of support.  </p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of the scheme under review.  In general, I am satisfied with the operation of HAP scheme and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under the Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p></reply>

This is distinct from the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) which is a different type of social housing support where the tenant may not always find their own accommodation and instead are allocated a dwelling in accordance with Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  Similarly, the local authority is not party to the tenancy agreement underpinning a HAP arrangement, but is a party to the three-part contract underpinning a RAS arrangement.  </p>  <p>  A HAP tenancy arrangement is governed by the terms of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended) and is afforded the same protections available to all private rental tenancies, which were recently enhanced.  The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  </p>  <p>  There are more than 17,000 households supported by HAP currently and the scheme is working well for the households who are benefitting from the security of the long-term housing support that it offers.  </p></reply>

Additionally, the funding that my Department provides to local authorities to remediate certain social housing includes support for the energy retrofitting of the property.

The number of vacant units will therefore fluctuate constantly, as would be expected in the management of the thousands of homes owned by local authorities, where tenancies change on a regular basis. </p><p>The low rates of vacant units of 1-2% reported by some authorities in 2016 is a strong indication that the local authorities, through the additional provision of funding provided by my Department, have substantially addressed the backlog of vacant units that had accumulated pre-2014.  </p></reply>

It is intended that the new measures will complement the existing regeneration programme under my Department's Social Housing Capital Programme, as well as other social regeneration initiatives already under way.  Having held its inaugural meeting in mid-June 2016, the Working Group has met on three occasions and is due to meet again in the coming weeks to consider issues and emerging proposals, including the scope for further grant aid and incentive programmes to facilitate urban regeneration generally.  </p></reply>

The Guidelines also aim to ensure that sites being developed for rural housing are suitable with regard to access and wastewater disposal, and also from landscape and design perspectives.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for individual planning authorities to prepare their development plans and the policies contained within such plans, taking account of local and varying geographical and landscape circumstances, as well as the approaches set out under the Guidelines in relation to rural-generated housing.  It is also a matter for planning authorities, as well as An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to implement the Guidelines and local planning policies in assessing and deciding on individual planning applications and appeals under the development management consent process. </p>  <p>  I intend to keep the 2005 Guidelines under review, particularly in view of the commitment in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness &ndash; Rebuilding Ireland to accelerate the delivery of housing in order to address the current housing supply shortage and projected housing needs over the coming years, contributing to wider objectives, including the need to support sustainable urban and rural development and communities.  In this connection, my Department is consulting planning authorities about modifying the Guidelines to ensure that rural housing policies and objectives contained in development plans comply with Article 43 (Freedom of Movement of People) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  On conclusion of these consultations, my Department will engage with the European Commission on proposed changes to the Guidelines, with a view to issuing updated Guidelines to planning authorities on the matter in due course. </p></reply>

This means that the person is the parent, step-parent, adoptive parent or legal guardian of at least one relevant child.  The term relevant child means a person who</p><p>(<i>a</i>) is ordinarily resident in the State,</p><p>(<i>b</i>) is not detained in a children detention school,</p><p>and</p><p>(c) has not attained the relevant age.  The One-Parent Family Payment is payable until a person&rsquo;s youngest child reaches the age of 7.  Special provisions exist for those caring and on half rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and those in receipt of Blind Pension that extend the age of the youngest child to 16 years.</p><p>The person must be under the age of 66 and also have the main care and charge of at least one child who is residing with them.  This means that a person making an application for the One-Parent Family Payment must show that the child spends the greater amount of time during the week with them. </p><p>The One-Parent Family Payment is not payable in cases where a couple have joint equal custody of a child.  However, when an application is made for the One-Parent Family Payment, the actual circumstances of the case are taken into account when a Deciding Officer makes a decision on a payment.  If the Deciding Officer is satisfied that the circumstances warrant a payment based on Social Welfare legislation, then that is the payment that is made, and the presence of a Court Order is one, but not necessarily the only, issue to be taken into account.  However, if the actual circumstances were at variance with the Court Order, then the actual circumstances would prevail.  For example, parents may have joint equal custody by law, but in reality one parent may have main care and charge and the One-Parent Family Payment may therefore be payable to that parent.</p><p>It is not possible to split the One-Parent Family Payment between the couple proportionate to the amount of time that their child resides with them during the week and this has always been the case.</p><p>The purpose of the One-Parent Family Payment scheme is to support the parent who has main care and charge of the child or children. </p></reply>

In this regard, the Government&rsquo;s clearly stated preference is to maintain the closest possible trading relationship between the UK and the EU, including Ireland.When the EU-UK negotiations start, the Government will pursue, together with our EU partners, an outcome that protects Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interests and an one that can be accepted by all.  We are not under any illusions about the challenge and complexity of these negotiations and are engaged in detailed planning to prepare for them.   As part of our preparations, I have met with all of my EU counterparts in order to make them aware of the need for specific arrangements which protect the key gains of the peace process on this island &ndash; a process to which the EU has already made a key contribution.  Our concerns in relation to Northern Ireland are understood and appreciated and there is a general desire to assist in addressing them satisfactorily.  In this regard, Commissioner Barnier&rsquo;s clear statement in December that Irish issues would be a negotiating priority was very positive.  </p>  <p>  However, the negotiations have not even begun yet.  </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach discussed the imperative of the open border on the island of Ireland with Prime Minister May in Dublin on 30 January.  I have also discussed these issues with the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, David Davis, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire.</p>  <p>  The Government is preparing for and will be ready for all eventualities.  Contingency planning began before the referendum last June and the necessary analysis has deepened across Government since then.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to comprehensively and proactively prepare for all dimensions of the EU-UK negotiations in pursuit of our priority concerns.  In this regard, we will continue to engage with all of our EU partners and with the EU institutions, including the European Commission, to highlight the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland, and the consequences for North-South cooperation on the island as a whole, which must be factored into any new EU relationship with the UK. </p></reply>

Romania has been subject to the EU Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM) since it joined the European Union in 2007. One of the key aims of the CVM is to combat against corruption.

The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU has no impact on its obligations under the ECHR. Even after the UK leaves the EU, there will be a continuing obligation on the British Government to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law, as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Irish and British Governments have a clear and continuing obligation to uphold all of the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  In the crucial area of human rights it is important that both Governments do all they can to engender confidence by demonstrating their commitment to both the letter and spirit of the Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government has underlined this obligation in the context of British Government proposals, not connected with Brexit, to repeal the UK Human Rights Act, which incorporates the ECHR into domestic law, and to introduce a domestic Bill of Rights.  The Government has stressed to the British Government the importance of fully meeting its human rights obligations under the Good Friday Agreement and will continue to monitor the situation closely.  </p>  <p>  I raised the matter directly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, at a meeting in September.  He confirmed the British Government position that any changes to the UK Human Rights Act would be made in a way which would be fully consistent with the British Government&rsquo;s obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.  In this context, I would note that while a domestic Bill of Rights can complement incorporation of the Convention, it does not replace it.  </p>  <p>  As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles including in the area of human rights.  In this regard, as part of the All-Island Civic Dialogue, I have convened a sectoral civic dialogue on Human Rights under the Good Friday Agreement on 13 February, to hear from those directly involved in work that relies on the human rights frameworks and protections of the Agreement. </p>  <p>  Human rights are central to the peace process and must be protected and sustained, regardless of the UK&rsquo;s status in the EU.  The Government will continue to work closely with the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland.  This includes the continued incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights in Northern Ireland law as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.</p></reply>

The Government strongly believes that the absolute prohibition of torture is one of the cornerstones of the international human rights framework, and all countries are obligated to comply with this unconditional prohibition.  No exceptional circumstances may be invoked as a justification for torture or any other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p>  <p>  The Government takes the allegations made in the recent television report very seriously and is looking very carefully at the issues.  I raised this in discussion with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on Thursday, 2 February, and we agreed that the matter would be followed up by our respective officials.  Secretary of State Brokenshire stated that the British Government was clear that it rejected the use of any methods of torture.</p>  <p>  The allegations are another deeply concerning example of the suffering that was inflicted on people from all communities during the Troubles, and further underscore the central role of human rights protections in Northern Ireland in ensuring confidence in the evolving peace process.</p>  <p>  Ireland is fully committed to the prevention and eradication of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through our work in the EU and in international fora such as the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p></reply>

The report was submitted to An Post towards the end of December 2016 and it is now a matter for the management and Board of An Post to consider the report.</p>  <p>  The postal sector has been undergoing significant change both nationally and internationally in recent years, with the increased use of electronic communications leading to a decline in core mail volume for An Post.  Nonetheless, the Government is committed to working with all stakeholders to find solutions to the sustainability of the post office network in this changing business environment.  The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a number of commitments in this regard.  </p>  <p>  For my own part, I established the Post Office Hub Working Group last year to identify potential models under which the post offices could act as community hubs, especially in rural areas.  I chaired the meetings of this Working Group, which included representatives from An Post, the Irish Postmasters Union and rural representatives, and my officials are currently finalising the Group's report.</p>  <p>  In addition, my officials have been examining the potential for the post offices to deliver other services, including the renewal of motor tax.  A number of options for the delivery of this service have been identified and proposals are currently being finalised in consultation with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

Provisional figures indicate that the total programme expenditure, excluding administration subheads, for the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and Island programme area in 2016 amounted to 106% of the 2016 allocation as per the Revised Estimates 2016 as additional funding was made available on foot of savings elsewhere in the Department's Vote.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Public Financial Procedures, the surplus of the amount provided in a Department's Vote, over the net amount applied in that Vote is liable for surrender to the Exchequer, with the exception of unspent appropriations for capital supply services up to a maximum of 10% of the capital envelope of the Vote, which may be carried over for spending on capital priority programmes in the following year.</p>  <p>  The surplus of the amount provided in my Department's Vote over the net amount applied amounted to &euro;8,895,773 in 2015.  Of this, an amount of &euro;6,158,000 was carried forward to 2016 by way of deferred surrender leaving a surplus to surrender to the Exchequer of &euro;2,737,773.  Full details of these figures and all associated expenditure are available in the 2015 Annual Appropriation Account for my Department which is published on the website of the Comptroller and Auditor General at: www.audgen.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/annualreports/2015/AppAcc/En/Vote 33.pdf</p>  <p>  Work is continuing on finalising the 2016 expenditure figures for my Department and adjustments continue to be made in relation to individual financial transactions to ensure that expenditure is accounted for in accordance with Government accounting policies, principles and procedures.  However, I can advise that provisional figures indicate that the surplus of the amount provided in my Department's Vote over the net amount applied will be in excess of &euro;16 million in 2016.  An amount of &euro;13,548,000 has been carried forward to 2017 by means of deferred surrender leaving a net surplus to surrender of over &euro;3 million.  When account is taken of expenditure which could not be incurred under Programme E of my Department's Vote because of the non-receipt of corresponding Appropriations-in-Aid and surplus Appropriations-in-Aid in other programme areas which must be surrendered to the Exchequer, the remaining balance will amount to some &euro;425,000 in administration budget efficiencies and some &euro;600,000 in programme savings.  The programme savings largely relate to capital savings on commemoration projects that did not proceed as promptly as anticipated.  As I have already indicated, these figures are provisional and are subject to finalisation by my Department and audit by the Comptroller and Auditor in General.  </p>  <p>  Details of the actual outturn for my Department at subhead level for 2016, including details of any surplus, together with explanations for any variances between allocations and expenditure, will be published in the Annual Appropriation Account for 2016 and be made available on the website of the Comptroller and Auditor General later this year, as was the case for previous years.</p></reply>

The primary objective of the first NMP is to track implementation of measures already under way, identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  The first iteration will focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020, but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures can be put in place beyond 2020 and out to 2030.</p>  <p>  I recently published a briefing document outlining the development of the NMP to date.  It covers the four sectors concerned of electricity generation, the built environment, transport and agriculture, and highlights some key questions to be considered in terms of how best we should position Ireland in taking this important step towards achieving the national transition objective by 2050.  The briefing document is available to download from my Department's website.  A public consultation is planned for mid-March before a final plan is submitted to Government in early June.  </p>  <p>  A key part of developing the NMP has been the preparation of appropriate technical, environmental and economic analysis to inform the decision-making process as to what should be included in the plan.  These analyses are still ongoing as part of the iterative approach to the development of the plan, and will be an important input into resource allocation as part of future expenditure planning, including as part of the Capital Review. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that funding climate action to the required level presents an enormous challenge for Ireland.  Early action is imperative to find the most cost-efficient and cost-effective solutions.  However, finding the appropriate and most equitable manner to address this issue is not going to be easy, particularly given the economic circumstances of recent years and where finances are still continuing to stabilise and recover.  A whole-of-Government approach is essential to identify the optimal mix of measures and policy tools to enable an effective transition.  Consideration must be given to the role of regulations, standards, education initiatives and targeted information campaigns, in addition to public and private sector investment.  Some initiatives in these areas are outlined in the briefing document which I recently published.  </p></reply>

However, the evidence of a good adult spawning stock over five years would indicate a healthy population of juvenile salmon which migrate to sea and return to the Owenea as adults to spawn and replenish the stock.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Harvest</th><th>Catch and Release</th><th>Total  Angling Catch</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>252</td><td>47</td><td>299</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>177</td><td>54</td><td>231</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>286</td><td>69</td><td>355</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>345</td><td>110</td><td>455</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>437</td><td>120</td><td>557</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Queries received in relation to the NBP are then responded to by members of my Department&rsquo;s NBP team.  There is also helpful information on the NBP available through my Department&rsquo;s website at .  </p><p>The National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland.  The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  </p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area:  </p><p>- The areas marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services. </p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county.  Individuals can check whether their premises are in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.</p><p>My Department is actively monitoring the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE areas to ensure that all premises can get access to services. In this regard, direct feedback from consumers is important and if customers in these areas cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at broadband@dccae.gov.ie, quoting their address and Eircode and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services. </p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. The Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map and finalise this Intervention Area for bidders, taking into account any industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, along with new industry investments and concrete, commitments by industry for further new investments within the proposed State Intervention Area.</p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed-solution for the  25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors, including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to roll-out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.  The Taskforce report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i></i>. </p><p>As part of the Taskforce recommendations, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is funding all local authorities to assign an officer with responsibility for broadband to act as the single point of contact for engagement with operators to assist with accelerated roll-out of the National Broadband Plan and create awareness of/stimulate demand for broadband services.  24 local authorities have now appointed dedicated Broadband Officers, to work with the telecoms industry. Each of these reports to and is being actively supported at Director level in the relevant Local Authority.  My Department will be working closely with these Officers and this initiative will further enhance the availability of local information.  </p><p>I have signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, to provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.  </p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services. </p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p></reply>

Successive Governments have introduced a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and deliver energy efficiency.  </p>  <p>  There is already a vibrant energy research and development environment in Ireland.  Government continues to encourage innovation and significant funds are already invested in energy research, development, demonstration and deployment across a range of third level institutions, research institutions such as the Beaufort Centre in Cork, agencies including Science Foundation Ireland, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the Environmental Protection Agency.  In addition, EU research programmes such as Horizon 2020, provide opportunities for Irish public bodies and private companies to maximise funding opportunities. </p>  <p>  Energy research plays an integral part in Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy and support to renewable energy research is  a vast multiple of the  &euro;35,000 p.a. approx. provided to support geoscience scholarships.  As regards my Department, I recently doubled the funds available to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) for its Energy Research, Development and Demonstration (RD&amp;D) fund in 2017 to &euro;2 million.  This fund is open to Irish researchers in industry and academia to support sustainable energy research into new market solutions which overcome various barriers in the move to a secure, clean energy future, and provides for the possibility of support to postgraduate studies.  SEAI, with my Department, is currently reviewing RD&amp;D funding to see how it could better align with the timelines of academic research, and the potential for postgraduate studies.  Priority areas include energy efficiency, citizen engagement and energy storage with the programme open to a wide range of proposal types - including technology RD&amp;D, field research, and feasibility studies.  Since 2002, my Department has funded SEAI to provide &euro;26 million through its Energy RD&amp;D programme and details of these projects are available on the SEAI website (www.seai.ie).  Furthermore, in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute, SEAI funds a Research Fellowship which focuses on energy efficiency incentivisation activities.  </p>  <p>  Exchequer funding is also supporting ocean energy research with a total cumulative funding of &euro;26.3 million provided under my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual ocean energy development budget for the period 2013 to 2016 and administered by SEAI. </p>  <p>  Noting the availability and scale of Government and EU funding for energy research, while I have no plans to introduce scholarships in the field of renewable energy, I will continue to keep the matter under review.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p>  <p>  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p>  <p>  There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint.</p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie, shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:</p>  <p>  - The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,</p>  <p>  - The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p>  <p>  Most of North County Dublin falls within a BLUE area and will be provided for commercially, whereas the entire townland of Kilsallaghan falls within an AMBER area and will therefore, be included in the State Intervention procurement process under the NBP.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.</p>  <p>  My Department is actively monitoring commercial deployment plans in the BLUE areas to ensure that all households and businesses can get access to the services.  My Department is also actively monitoring developments of commercial operators that might impact the Intervention Area.  This is being done in accordance with procedures set out by my Department in December 2015.</p>  <p>  I should add, however, that the provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services to particular locations.</p>  <p>  A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  My Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.</p>  <p>  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.

The Preclearance service is available to all travellers on a voluntary and non-discriminatory basis.  The terms and conditions of the Preclearance arrangements with the US are covered by an International Agreement and by domestic legislation, the Aviation (Preclearance) Act 2009.</p>  <p>  The preclearance facility is within Irish jurisdiction and the laws of Ireland apply at all times, enforced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is expressly confirmed at Article II(5) of the Preclearance Agreement.  Given the fact that US law does not apply, provision is made at Article II(6) of the Agreement to confirm that passengers who wish to avail of preclearance do so on condition that they recognise and consent to the right of the US to grant or refuse preclearance in accordance with its laws.</p>  <p>  If someone is refused permission to fly to the US at preclearance in either Dublin or Shannon Airports, the passenger then becomes the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who deal with them, in line with Irish law and in accordance with the full human rights protections that apply.  A refusal at US Preclearance has no impact on the rights available to refugees or persons wishing to seek asylum in Ireland.  If they apply for asylum they will be dealt with in the normal way or if they wish to return to their point of origin they will be facilitated.  These are issues for Irish Immigration authorities and US officials have no role in relation to them.  It should also be noted that my Department does not have responsibility for policy in relational to international refugees.</p>  <p>  The operation of the Ireland-US Preclearance Agreement does not conflict with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, nor does it give rise to any breach of obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Agreement expressly provides that nothing in the Agreement diminishes the rights enjoyed by individuals under the Constitution and laws of Ireland or the US.  While the right to travel is recognised under the Irish Constitution, there is no right under the Irish Constitution whereby Ireland could require another sovereign State to allow an individual entry to that State.  The right of a passenger to enter the US is a matter for US law.</p>  <p>  The Ireland-US Preclearance Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party, by giving one year's written notice to the other party.  There is no provision in the Agreement for suspension.  Therefore, Ireland has an obligation, under International law, to adhere to the terms of the Agreement unless it is terminated in accordance with the procedure laid down.  However, it is important to point out that the US Preclearance facility is a very valuable arrangement for Ireland, as well as being of benefit to the United States, and having discussed the matter last week, the Cabinet was in favour of retaining our Preclearance facilities.</p>  <p>  In light of recent events, An Taoiseach has requested that a review of US Preclearance in Ireland be undertaken by the relevant Departments - Justice and Equality, Foreign Affairs and Trade and my own Department.  A report will be made to An Taoiseach this week.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the local authority's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  Maintenance of private laneways/roads not taken in charge by local authorities is the responsibility of the landowners concerned.  Due to the major cutbacks in roads funding it was necessary for the Department to cease making separate allocations to local authorities in respect of LIS.  The approved scheme remains intact and local authorities can use a proportion of State grant funding for LIS should they wish to do so.</p>  <p>  While there is a modest increase in funding for roads this year, it will take some years yet under the Capital Plan to restore "steady state" funding levels for regional and local roads.  The primary focus has to continue to be on the maintenance and renewal of public roads.  Local authorities can continue to use a proportion of their Discretionary Grant for the Local Improvement Scheme in 2017.</p>  <p>  In light of the provision in the Programme for Government indicating that, as the economy recovers, the Government will promote increased funding for Community Involvement and Local Improvement Schemes, I will review the scope for making a separate grant allocation once the planned Review of the Capital Plan is completed.</p></reply>

Furthermore, in line with the <i>Tourism Action Plan 2016-2018</i>, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is committed to working with the tourism industry and the wider education and training sector to implement the recommendations contained in the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) report on the hospitality sector, aimed at ensuring an adequate supply of skilled staff. </p><p>In this regard, F&aacute;ilte Ireland participates in the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group, which oversees skills development and promotion in the sector, including monitoring the implementation of the EGFSN recommendations, and involves key stakeholders, education and training providers and relevant Government Departments and agencies.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also an active participant, alongside key industry bodies, on the consortium collaborating on the development of the culinary apprenticeship.</p><p>I believe that this collaborative approach is the most effective way to support the sustainable development of the Irish tourism industry and help maintain and enhance our competitive position.</p></reply>

In this context, on 23 January 2017, Minister of State Patrick O'Donovan T.D. and I hosted an All-Island Dialogue on the impact of Brexit on the tourism and hospitality sector.  At that event Tourism Ireland presented on the research they had commissioned to assess the propensity of consumers living in Britain to travel overseas in a post Brexit world.  The research shows that 7% of people living in Britain say they are less likely to holiday overseas in 2017.  The research also indicates that spending patterns are likely to change, e.g. 50% of people expect that they will spend less while on holiday abroad.</p><p>Tourism Ireland also presented research which estimated that outbound travel from Britain will decline by 2.5% in 2017.  Given Ireland's reliance on Britain, from where 41% of our overseas visitors came in 2016, tourism to Ireland is likely to be more impacted than to any other destination.</p><p>Tourism Ireland's strategy for responding to Brexit will involve various strands, including defending key segments of the British market, very focussed competition in existing markets in Europe and North America, and pursuing new, potentially lucrative, markets further afield.</p><p>In terms of markets further afield, a commitment is given in the Government's Tourism Policy Statement <i>&quot;People, Place and Policy &ndash; Growing Tourism to 2025&quot;</i>to prioritising tourism marketing efforts towards those markets providing higher revenue returns.  The Programme for Government commits to implementing the policy objectives in the policy statement and achieving the targets for Irish tourism contained therein.  The UK vote does not change this.</p><p>As regards competing more vigorously in existing markets, a key element of Tourism Ireland's strategy since 2014 has been market diversification which has seen Mainland Europe become the largest contributor of overseas tourism revenue and will see the United States overtake Britain as the number two contributor to tourism revenue over the next few years.  In 2017, Tourism Ireland will continue to implement its market diversification strategy and intends to maximise holiday revenue through investment in Mainland Europe and North America.</p><p>In addition, the depreciation of the pound against the euro since the UK referendum means that value for money will be a key message for Tourism Ireland in Britain this year.  A strong focus on the &quot;culturally curious&quot;, who tend to stay longer and spend more, will assist Tourism Ireland in their defence of their British market.  Looking to the medium term, Tourism Ireland is currently finalising  its corporate plan for the period from 2017-2019.  This plan will, <i>inter alia,</i>include the agency's response to marketing Ireland in Britain in the new situation that has developed following the referendum.</p></reply>

The Programme aims to foster an integrated and planned approach to developing sports and physical recreation facilities throughout the country.  In particular, its stated objectives are to:</p>  <p>- Assist voluntary and community organisations, national governing bodies (NGBs) of sport, local authorities and Education and Training Boards and schools to develop high quality, accessible, well-designed facilities in appropriate locations and to provide appropriate equipment to help maximise participation in sport and physical recreation.</p>  <p>- Prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilities.</p>  <p>- Encourage the sharing of local, regional and national sports facilities by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.</p>  <p>  The 2017 round of the programme is open for applications until 24th February, 2017. </p>  <p>  In terms of how grants are subsequently allocated, while the precise assessment criteria and scoring system for the 2017 Sports Capital Programme are currently being finalised, I do not envisage that the scoring and weighting system will change significantly from previous rounds of the Programme.  In this regard, the distribution of the overall funding to each county will be considered on a per capita basis.  Individual applications will first be checked to ensure eligibility and eligible applications will then be initially scored according to criteria designed to give higher scores to applications that will increase participation, that are from designated disadvantaged areas and had not received substantial funding in the past.  The assessment process will not commence prior to the closing date for applications on the 24th of February and the scoring system will be finalised before then and published thereafter.</p></reply>

This work is based on collaboration with the young person, their carers and partner agencies to generate an aftercare plan that is specific to the individual young person's needs. Advice, guidance, support and signposting are key elements of the supports available to care leavers.  </p><p>For those young people who are not in training or education, aftercare services have a key role in providing support to them in liaising with the relevant departments and agencies in accessing financial assistance, employment opportunities, training or supporting them to return to education.  Those who are unemployed, and not engaged in training or education, can apply for jobseeker's allowance from the Department of Social Protection.  The jobseeker's allowance payable to care leavers is the full rate and not the reduced rate normally payable to those under 25.</p><p>At the end of September 2016, there were 1,841 young people aged 18 to 22 years in receipt of an aftercare service, with 54% (1,001) in full-time education or training. </p></reply>

Funding of &euro;51m for current expenditure is available from my Department in 2016 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people.  It is estimated that the voluntary youth services involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working throughout the country. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 has provided an additional &euro;5.5m in current funding to my Department to support the provision of youth services.  This will bring the total youth funding in 2017 to &euro;57.4m.  This additional funding will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.  My Department has commenced the process with national organisations and local services to identify service development needs for 2017 and to agree the 2017 allocations. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a number of funding schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review in 2014.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of the impact youth service provision has on young people&rsquo;s lives.  The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  Work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the review over the coming years. </p>  <p>  My Department has embarked on an exercise, in conjunction with Pobal and each Education and Training Board (ETB) Youth Officer, which will map youth service provision across the State.  This mapping exercise will assist my Department and the relevant ETB in developing a detailed socio-demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.  It is my intention that this mapping exercise will inform future development and investment in youth services, including areas such as Mitchelstown.</p></reply>

The ABC Programme commenced in 2013 and is a time-bound co-funding arrangement of &euro;29.7m for the period 2013 to 2017 in conjunction with The Atlantic Philanthropies. </p>  <p>  All sites are currently in contract for 2017 and operating according to their agreed budgets for 2017.  Due to contractual arrangements, each of the existing 13 sites is scheduled to come to the end of their contracts at various points throughout 2017. </p>  <p>  My department secured an additional &euro;4.5million in Budget 2016 to extend all of the existing ABC Programme to the end of December 2017, bringing the total investment to &euro;34.2 million.  This means that sites being granted an extension to their original contract, may require additional funding.  </p>  <p>  To ascertain this, my Department requested that the ABC Programme Managers provide the Department with revised financial projections and information on the cyclical nature (including costs) of the various interventions/programmes implemented by each Area.  The information currently to hand does not fully indicate the additional funding required by these sites.  The programme managers will now be requesting additional detail from each site and, once received, it is expected that funding allocations can be agreed upon and all ABC areas notified by end February.</p>  <p>  I look forward to the continued engagement of all ABC sites with my Department in 2017 as we work towards the implementation of quality prevention and early intervention initiatives in order to achieve our shared goal of improving the lives of children and families throughout the country.</p></reply>
