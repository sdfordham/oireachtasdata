For instance, there may be breaches of market abuse rules, company law principles, Central Bank rules on fitness and probity and/or the criminal law.</p>  <p>  The rules in relation to insider dealing are set out in the Market Abuse (Directive 2003/6/EC) Regulations, 2005 (S.I. 342/2005), Part IV of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 2005, Part V of Companies Act 1990 and the Companies (Amendment) Act 1999.  In circumstances where loans take the form of transferable securities traded on a multilateral trading facility or junior market then the rules on insider dealing in the 1990 Act may apply.  </p>  <p>  Where loans or loan books do not take the form of financial instruments such as transferable securities, the Market Abuse regime would not apply but other legal principles and rules would continue to apply.  For example specific and general principles of company, financial services and criminal law would continue to apply.  </p>  <p>  Directors of any Irish company, including banks, incorporated under the Companies Act, 1963, or the Companies Act, 1990, are required to comply with their fiduciary duties to that company, which include:</p>  <p>  -  acting in good faith and in the interests of the company as a whole,</p>  <p>  -  avoiding conflicts of interest,</p>  <p>  -  a prohibition on making undisclosed profits from their position as directors and must account for any profit which they secretly derive from their position as a director, and</p>  <p>  -  an obligation to carry out their functions with due care, skill and diligence.</p>  <p>  In addition, directors of banks operating in Ireland are required to ensure that they have governance and control arrangements in place that comply with, inter alia, the Central Bank of Ireland's Corporate Governance Code and the European Banking Authority's Governance Guidelines.  The Central Bank of Ireland's Fitness and Probity regime also requires credit institutions to assess the suitability of members of the management body and requires high standards of behaviour of those individuals on an ongoing basis.  Banks are expected to have strong controls in their front line businesses, in their risk management and compliance functions and an effective internal audit capability, such that conflicts of interest are managed appropriately and the associated risks are mitigated.  These arrangements are assessed through, for example, external audits and are also subject to ongoing supervisory engagement by the Central Bank of Ireland, including through regular inspections.</p>  <p>  If directors were to approve the selling of a company's asset at less than market value where that decision is not objectively justifiable, shareholders would have a right of action against the directors concerned for a breach of their fiduciary duty.  As things stand, this duty to the company is a common law one, but with the proposed commencement of the Companies Act 2014 on 1 June 2015, section 228 makes this a statutory duty.  </p>  <p>  Finally, where an action by a director or employee of a Bank constitutes fraud or offence, they are subject to the rigour of criminal law.</p></reply>

He stated that those targets were predicated on conditions in the Irish market remaining favourable and on NAMA being in a position to retain sufficient specialist staff to enable it to generate the optimal financial return from the realisation of its residual loan portfolio. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that in July 2014 the NAMA Board also undertook to facilitate the timely and coherent delivery of key Grade A office space, retail and residential space within the Dublin Docklands strategic development zone and Dublin's Central Business District and to maximise the delivery of residential housing units in areas of most need. </p>  <p>  So while we have increasing visibility regarding the elimination of the State's contingent liability through the accelerated redemption of NAMA's government guaranteed senior notes, it is too early to speculate as what date in the future NAMA will have made sufficient progress on its objectives as to warrant consideration of its dissolution.</p></reply>

Ensuring that those borrowers can repay is paramount in the protection of those savings.  There are also EU Regulations in place in relation to Consumer Credit Agreements, the scope of which includes credit agreements where the loan amounts are between &euro;200 and &euro;75,000.  Part 2 of these regulations focuses on the obligations to assess creditworthiness of consumers based on information provided in support of a loan.  The Central Bank further informs me that it expects credit unions to apply prudent lending standards to the granting of all new loans or top-ups of existing loans and to have systems in place to ensure that such applications are fully assessed to confirm the member's creditworthiness.</p>  <p>  The safety of members' savings and the security of the credit union sector as a whole are priorities for this Government and I have, on a number of occasions, highlighted the Governments' recognition of the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country and also the importance of getting lending going in the economy.  However, the issue of lending needs to be constructively considered in order to ensure a viable credit union sector into the future.</p></reply>

The new strategy is an action oriented approach to growing and developing the financial services industry in Ireland.  The aim is to improve the level of foreign financial services investment and to encourage the growth of more domestic financial services companies including those providing financial technology services.  The new strategy was developed to cope with a changing financial services and technological environment, greater international competition and changing consumer preferences in the delivery of financial services products.  The five priority areas identified</p>  <p>  -  promotion and branding</p>  <p>  -  improving the competitive environment</p>  <p>  -  supporting research, innovation and entrepreneurship (particularly Fin Tech)</p>  <p>  -  exploring the emerging sector opportunities and</p>  <p>  -  the implementation process </p>  <p>  are I believe key to the success of the strategy.  Clearly the ultimate point of the strategy is job creation.  Working with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland the aim is to create an additional 10,000 jobs in IFS firms over the lifetime of the strategy.  I consider this is achievable over the lifetime of IFS 2020.  It is expected that those jobs in turn will create a virtuous circle, underlining Ireland's attractiveness to the financial services sector, and contributing to the wider recovery now under way. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-07a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050700042#WRA01800"><p> The announcement by Permanent TSB (PTSB) that it has successfully completed a capital raise as part of its capital plan is a significant milestone in its recovery which gained momentum recently with the European Commission approval of its Restructuring Plan.  PTSB has raised &euro;525 million on new capital and through a series of transactions returned &euro;539 million to the State.</p>  <p>  The capital raise was required as a result of PTSB failing the SSM Adverse Stress Test, announced in late 2014.  PTSB agreed a Capital Plan with the SSM which required them to raise &euro;525 million of new capital - &euro;400 million equity and &euro;125 million Additional Tier 1. </p>  <p>  As part of this transaction the State will recoup &euro;509 million in capital receipts from the sale of shares and the repurchase of the Contingent Capital Notes (CoCos), bringing the total capital receipts to c &euro;1.8 billion since our investment in 2011-2012.  As a result of much hard work over 45% of the capital invested by the State will have been repaid before taking account of investment income, fees and our residual shareholding.  The CoCos were repurchased at market value - a &euro;10.5 million premium over par value.  </p>  <p>  As a result of PTSB moving to a main market listing in London and Dublin a minimum 25% free float is required.  To enable that free float I was requested by the board of PTSB to sell &euro;98 million or 22 million shares to reduce the State's shareholding to 75%.  The move to the main markets in London and Dublin will be positive for PTSB and allows the State additional flexibility and liquidity to manage its sell down in due course.</p>  <p>  Existing shareholders will be able to subscribe for new ordinary shares at the same price as was available to new investors in the Placing by way of an Open Offer which is being managed by PTSB.</p>  <p>  Changes to the Relationship Framework were required in order to facilitate the migration to the main markets but will not alter the overall relationship between PTSB and the State which has been professional and constructive to date. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that we have maintained a 75% shareholding in PTSB on behalf of the taxpayer and that high quality international institutional investors have joined us as shareholders - 83% of investors were from the UK or US.  It is also noteworthy that the &euro;125 million AT1 issuance is the first such issuance in Ireland.</p>  <p>  While much work remains to be done I am satisfied with the continued progress and in particular the fact that the capital raise was completed without the need for investment from the State highlighting the progress that PTSB has made since 2011.</p></reply>

    <ques id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-07a.22.q" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050700042#WRA02000"><p><i>16.</i> To ask the Minister for Finance the extent to which he has had consultation with the various lenders, with a view to reducing interest rates to borrowers, having regard to the rate at which the lenders are currently borrowing, thereby alleviating the concerns of many borrowers; and if he will make a statement on the matter. <b>[17516/15]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-07a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050700042#WRA02100"><p>At the outset, I would like to confirm to the Deputy that the lending institutions in Ireland - including those in which the State has a significant shareholding - are independent commercial entities.  I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions setting interest rates.  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. </p>  <p>  Equally, the Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review.  I discussed the issue of mortgage interest rates with the Governor of the Central Bank on 2 April.  As a result of this meeting the Governor is currently reviewing the issue of the standard variable rates charged by the lenders.  The Governor should be in a position to present this analysis to me in the coming days.  I will then meet the six principal mortgage lenders in order to discuss this issue. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that there have been moves on interest rates.  As the Deputy will be aware, on 1 May, AIB Group announced a number of reductions to its mortgage interest rates for owner occupier and buy-to-let mortgages. </p>  <p>  A series of reductions over a fixed time frame would be acceptable to me and in that context I welcome AIB's announcement as a good first step.  Competition between the banks will be crucial in ensuring that the price that the customers have to pay moves in the right direction.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-07a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050700042#WRA02400"><p>I am aware of the various reports and analyses referred to by the Deputy in his question. </p>  <p>   The TASC report found that market income inequality (i.e. income before taxes and transfers) is relatively high in Ireland and has increased since the recession.  However, more importantly, recent data and research from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) respectively, indicate that disposable income inequality over the period 2004-2013 has remained broadly stable.  These patterns reflect the efficacy of the Irish tax and social welfare system in reducing market income inequality and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has shown the Irish system to be one of the most effective of all OECD countries in this respect. </p>  <p>  The fact that this Government has maintained such a progressive and redistributive tax and social welfare system during one of the most difficult fiscal consolidations in the history of the State demonstrates its commitment to equality and fairness.  ESRI research shows that Budgets 2009-2015 had neither a progressive nor a regressive pattern and that losses due to budgetary policy were highest for those in the top ten percent of the income distribution followed by those in the bottom ten percent. </p>  <p>  With respect to wealth inequality, comprehensive data on household wealth in Ireland, including assets and liabilities, has been published for the first time by the CSO.  Crucially, these data have been collected across the entire eurozone according to a standardised methodology.  These data indicate that wealth inequality in Ireland for 2013, as measured by the Gini Coefficient, is lower than the eurozone average.  The results also show that wealth is less concentrated at the top of the distribution here than the eurozone average. Central Bank analysis of these data also indicates that while wealth inequality has increased since 2011, it is actually lower than in 2006, the earliest period for which data are available.</p>  <p>  I am aware that some recent economic research, including by the OECD, has indicated that there may be a negative relationship between inequality and growth.  However, their analysis suggests that this negative relationship did not apply in the case of Ireland.  Given this, and the fact that Ireland's income and wealth inequality levels are around the EU and eurozone average, I do not consider Ireland's level of inequality to constitute a macroeconomic threat.</p></reply>

This has included an extensive suite of interventions designed to address the problem including specific Central Bank targets for the banks through the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART), the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), extensive recasting of the personal insolvency legislation, the provision of advice through Department of Social Protection-led initiatives and the mortgage to rent scheme which is designed to assist borrowers in an unsustainable mortgage position to remain in their homes through the involvement of social housing agencies.</p>  <p>  The CCMA sets out requirements for mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence and provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  The CCMA provides that a lender may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where the lender has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower or his/her nominated representative, and where the specific timeframes set out in the CCMA have been adhered to, or where the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.   </p>  <p>  Where a borrower engages with his lender, a restructure arrangement to address his/her mortgage arrears situation,  is agreed in the majority of cases.  The Central Bank's most recent quarterly release on Residential Mortgage arrears and Repossessions (Q4 2014) indicates that almost 115,000 restructure arrangements have been put in place.</p>  <p>  Where a mortgage in arrears is deemed to be unsustainable by the lender the mortgage to rent scheme, administered by my colleague, Alan Kelly, TD, Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government may be a viable alternative which will keep families in their family home. </p>  <p>  The effective management of the mortgage arrears issue is an area that remains under continuous review.  More and concerted action can be undertaken by the banks to assist customers in arrears.  As the Deputy is aware the Taoiseach has previously announced that the Government is considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions.  Given the importance of the issue, his Department is co-ordinating the response across the various Government Departments and agencies and I anticipate that a detailed announcement will be forthcoming shortly.</p></reply>

At the time it was introduced, the expected yield from the USC in its first year, in 2011, was to be equivalent to that raised under the two taxes which it replaced, with an additional estimated yield of &euro;420 million in a full year.</p>  <p>  The USC was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and maintain revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base.  It was designed and incorporated in to the Irish taxation system as part of its permanent structure and the revenues collected play a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer.  It is also a fair tax in that income cannot, in general, be sheltered from the charge through the use of tax reliefs.  I am cognisant of how unpopular the USC is but given that it raises over &euro;4 billion per annum for the Exchequer, it is difficult to see how it could be abolished without the imposition of additional taxation elsewhere or through equivalent cuts in expenditure.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, the Government has sought to ensure that the impact of the charge on those with the lowest incomes is minimised.  In Budget 2012, I increased the threshold at which the charge becomes payable from just over &euro;4,000 to just over &euro;10,000, which removed approximately 330,000 individuals from the scope of USC.  A further 87,000 individuals were removed from the scope of the charge in Budget 2015 when I further increased the threshold to just over &euro;12,000, as well as reducing the lower rates of USC and increasing the bands.  The Government has indicated that it will continue to adjust the USC in a similar manner to the changes introduced in the last Budget.  I would hope to be in a position to be able to further increase the threshold for USC to remove a further 90,000 individuals from the scope of the charge.  However, changes to the income tax and USC will be considered in the round as part of my deliberations for the Budget.  Therefore it is not possible to indicate at this stage the precise adjustments that will be made.  As the Deputy will be aware, much will depend on the fiscal space available to the Government and the exact position will become clearer as the year progresses.</p></reply>

I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions setting interest rates.  This is a commercial decision for the institutions concerned. </p>  <p>  Equally, the Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November stated that in Ireland, as in most advanced economies, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis.  Such control would strongly discourage new entrants when, in fact, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services. </p>  <p>  In this regard, there have been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may be entering a new and more competitive phase.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act) 2013 introduced changes to Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which regulates fees and charges in order to attract new entrants to the Irish banking sector.  There is some evidence of improvements in the banking sector with a number of institutions introducing new products and adapting their business model.  In the last 12 months there have been a number of new entrants to the Irish mortgage market bringing additional and welcome competition to this sector.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review.  I discussed the issue of mortgage interest rates with the Governor of the Central Bank on 2 April.  As a result of this meeting the Governor  is currently reviewing the issue of the standard variable rates charged by the lenders.  The Governor should be in a position to present this analysis to me in the coming days.  I will then meet the six principal Mortgage Lenders in order to discuss this issue. </p>  <p>  A series of reductions in interest rates over a fixed time frame would be acceptable to me and in that context I welcome AIB's announcement of a reduction in interest rates as a good first step.  Competition between the banks will be crucial in ensuring that the price that the customers have to pay moves in the right direction.</p></reply>

The incentive provides tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence.  In the last Budget I extended the scheme to include rental properties, whose owners are subject to income tax.</p>  <p>  The Home Renovation Incentive has been very successful to date with works on just over 19,257 homes notified to the Revenue HRI online system as of 23 April 2015.  This represents more than &euro;403 million worth of works involving some 4,869 contractors.  </p>  <p>  The tax credit is only available to the homeowner and not to children or other individuals who may fund the works.  However, the Deputy will be aware that a Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability is available from local authorities.  That scheme provides grant aid to applicants to assist in the carrying out of works that are reasonably necessary for the purposes of rendering a house more suitable for the accommodation needs of a person with a disability.  The grant can assist with changes and adaptations to a home such as making it wheelchair accessible, extending it to create more space, adding a ground floor bathroom or toilet or installing a stair lift.  The grant, which is means tested, can cover up to 95% of the cost of works carried out, which is far more generous than the relief available under the Home Renovation Incentive.</p>  <p>  Works which are grant-aided also qualify for the Home Renovation Incentive.  Three times the value of the grant is deducted from overall expenditure, with any remainder attracting the tax credit of 13.5%.  This is good fiscal practice in that relief is not provided twice for the same expenditure.  It is worth noting that the deduction in respect of grant-aided work is not taken into consideration for the purposes of reaching the minimum spend threshold of &euro;4,405, excluding VAT.</p>  <p>  As with all tax incentives and reliefs, it will be reviewed in the context of my deliberations for the Budget.</p></reply>

The European Parliament Special Committee on Tax Rulings (TAXE) has six months in which to complete its work. As part of the parliamentary activities that have been scheduled for this purpose, the coordinators of the political groups in the TAXE Committee decided to conduct fact-finding missions to several Member States. These fact-finding missions are designed to take place in full cooperation with the national authorities, and TAXE members wish to hold constructive and forward-looking dialogues with the relevant bodies. As outlined in our policy documents "Ireland's International Tax Strategy" (2013) and the "Road Map for Ireland's Tax Competitiveness" (2014), Ireland is fully committed to transparency in international tax matters and to that end we will assist the European Parliament in their important work.</p>  <p>  Section 891E of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, introduced in Finance Act 2013, provides for the implementation of the agreement between the Governments of Ireland and the United States of America on the operation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).</p>  <p>  The related Financial Accounts Reporting (United States of America) Regulations 2014 came into effect on 1st July 2014.

Every person must have a domicile, whether domicile of origin or domicile of choice. They can have only one at any given time.</p>  <p>  An individual who is resident and domiciled in Ireland is taxable on their worldwide income and gains.</p>  <p>  A person who is resident but not domiciled in Ireland is only taxable on their Irish source income and any foreign income which they remit into the state, the so-called remittance basis of taxation. Regarding employment income, the charge to tax extends to all income from an Irish employment and income attributable to the performance of duties of a foreign employment in the State. The income attributable to the performance of the duties of a foreign employment outside the State is chargeable only when remitted to the State. Remittances are effectively amounts which are brought directly or indirectly into the State. (e.g. using foreign income to pay off a foreign loan, where the proceeds of the loan had been used in the State.)</p>  <p>  There can be many valid reasons why a person resident in Ireland would not be domiciled here and avail of the remittance basis. However, it is important to ensure that the combined impact of domicile status and the remittance basis do not inappropriately operate in such a way as to avoid taxation in Ireland. Anti-avoidance measures have been introduced over the years for this purpose.

He stated that those targets were predicated on conditions in the Irish market remaining favourable and on NAMA being in a position to retain sufficient specialist staff to enable it to generate the optimal financial return from the realisation of its residual loan portfolio.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the NAMA Board has also undertaken to facilitate the timely and coherent delivery of key Grade A office space, retail and residential space within the Dublin Docklands strategic development zone and Dublin's Central Business District and to maximise the delivery of residential housing units in areas of most need. Given that these commitments were agreed with NAMA only in July 2014, it is too early to speculate as what date in the future NAMA will have made sufficient progress on its objectives as to warrant consideration of its dissolution.</p>  <p>  As regards accountability, it is important to point out that NAMA is already subject to a high level of public accountability compared to other commercial bodies, including commercial bodies in the State sector.</p>  <p>  Its Annual Report and Financial Statements are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In addition, NAMA is also required to submit to me an Annual Statement by 30 September each year setting out its proposed objectives for the following financial year, the scope of activities to be undertaken, its strategies and policies and its proposed use of resources.</p>  <p>  NAMA is also required to report to me on a quarterly basis giving detailed information about its loans, its financing arrangements and its income and expenditure. These reports, which also include other information specified under Section 55 of the NAMA Act, track progress on a quarterly basis.  I am obliged to lay such reports before the Oireachtas and I endeavour to do so on a timely basis.</p>  <p>  The Chairman and Chief Executive are also accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts (PAC) and other Oireachtas committees and to give evidence to those committees whenever required to do so.  Furthermore, there have been numerous Parliamentary Questions addressed to me on NAMA-related issues and the associated replies are on the Oireachtas record.</p>  <p>  NAMA's accounts are comprehensively audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who has a permanent team of officers based in the Agency with unrestricted access to all its records and files.  If there is concern about a specific aspect of NAMA's work, it is within the power of the Comptroller and Auditor General to scrutinise any aspect of it.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has already produced three special reports on NAMA's activities and they have been broadly positive in their assessment of how NAMA is managing its complex business.</p>  <p>  Against this backdrop, I do not accept that there is a need to make NAMA more accountable than is already the case.</p></reply>

The main output relating to this issue was the agreement to the secondment of a senior Department of Finance official to IBRC.

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance.</p>  <p>  For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the "Group threshold" below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.</p>  <p>  There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.</p>  <p>  The Group A tax free threshold of &euro;225,000, applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p>  <p>  The Group B tax free threshold of &euro;30,150, applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p>  <p>  The Group C tax free threshold &euro;15,075, applies in all other cases.</p>  <p>  Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold. In recent years these thresholds were reduced and the rate has been increased in order to maintain the yield from capital taxes in the face of falling asset prices and as part of our fiscal consolidation efforts. In addition, taxes on capital are less harmful from an economic perspective than taxes on employment.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the property market continues to improve, with positive developments which had been restricted to the Dublin area now manifesting in other areas of the country, though not to the same extent in terms of price rises, and I recognise that this has a bearing on taxation of the inheritance and gifting of property with respect to CAT thresholds. In this light, I will be keeping Capital Acquisitions Tax thresholds and other aspects of the tax under review, particularly in the context of preparations for Budget 2016 and the consequent Finance Bill.</p></reply>

The SLs instructions and obligations provide for the winding up of IBRC in an orderly and efficient manner in the public interest and in order to maximise the return for the creditors of IBRC. The passing of the IBRC Act and the appointment of the SLs was part of the promissory note transaction which yielded significant benefits for the State.</p>  <p>  On the appointment of the SLs, I instructed them to arrange for and complete the independent valuation of IBRC s loan assets by no later than 30 November 2013. In this respect, the SLs appointed PwC as independent advisors to value the residential mortgage portfolio and to provide advice in developing a strategy for the sale of the residential mortgage portfolio which would ensure that maximum value was obtained for all creditors of IBRC. I further instructed the SLs to ensure that the sale of all loan assets was agreed or completed by no later than 31 December 2013 or as soon as practicable thereafter.</p>  <p>  Per my instruction, the assets of IBRC could only be sold at a price equal to or in excess of the independent valuations obtained. Should a bid not be received in excess of the independent valuation obtained, the loan asset was to transfer to NAMA at the independent valuation price.</p>  <p>  In total there were 11,825 individual residential mortgage customers in IBRC (comprising 12,702 mortgages with a par value of &euro;1.8 billion). Following receipt of legal advice, the SLs corresponded with all residential mortgage holders and provided them with an opportunity to make written representations on the method of disposal of their loans and the criteria for determining who may bid for loan assets. The SLs reviewed and considered each and every representation. The representations were also considered by PwC in providing their sales strategy advice.</p>  <p>  Following the receipt and review of borrower representations and the independent advice provided by PwC, it was decided that the mortgage portfolio (i.e. the Sand portfolio) be sub-divided into four portfolio tranches with a view to maximising market interest and return within the timelines set out in the Ministerial Instruction.</p>  <p>  The SLs did consider the concept of selling individual mortgages but a number of issues impacted on the decision, including:</p>  <p>  - cost;</p>  <p>  - timing;</p>  <p>  - independent advice received from PwC;</p>  <p>  - borrower only bids;</p>  <p>  - confidentiality of personal information;</p>  <p>  - delivering best results for the creditors including the taxpayer; and</p>  <p>  - execution risk.</p>  <p>  The valuation of the Sand portfolio completed on 11 November 2013 and the sales process commenced on 14 October 2013</p>  <p>  On 1 April 2014, the Special Liquidators announced that 64% of the mortgage portfolio (with a par value of &euro;1.8 billion) had been sold to two buyers, namely Lone Star and Oaktree Capital Management L.P.</p>  <p>  Following my instruction in April 2014, NAMA were no longer obliged to purchase the unsold IBRC assets at their independent valuation as previously envisaged due to the fact that the expected proceeds from the sale of the IBRC loan assets was sufficient to fully repay the IBRC debt to NAMA.  The SLs therefore devised a further sales process in respect of the unsold loan assets to maximise the return to all remaining creditors of IBRC, including the State.The SLs again corresponded with all those remaining residential mortgage holders whose loan assets were not sold in the first sales process providing them with an opportunity to make written representations on the method of disposal of their loans and the criteria for determining who may bid for loan assets. Consideration was given to these Borrower representations and the SLs responded to these Borrower representations.</p>  <p>  Following representations received from borrowers and the independent advice received, the unsold residential mortgage loan assets, which were now known as the Pearl portfolio were split into two tranches.  The sale of the Pearl portfolio tranches were contracted prior to 31 December 2014 and completed in February 2015.</p></reply>

The CBI continues to monitor banks' progress regarding MART requirements, most notably through: intensive ongoing supervisory engagement; audits; on-site reviews of operations and compliance with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA); and ongoing monitoring of performance. The CBI has reported that the banks continue to meet or exceed the targets set for them.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the key issue is engagement  The completion of affordability assessments is a key step in the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process.  In this regard a lender must examine each case on its individual merits and must base its assessment on the full circumstances of the borrower, including their personal circumstances, level of overall indebtedness, completeness and accuracy of information in their standard financial statement (SFS), their current repayment capacity and previous repayment history. The latest figures demonstrate that some 115,000 mortgages on family homes have been restructured with the vast majority of the borrowers able to adhere to the new arrangements and stay in their homes.</p></reply>

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided an annual saving of &euro;22 million.  This allowed the Department to protect other more fundamental social welfare payments such as the State pension.  Accordingly, I have no plans to reinstate the bereavement grant.</p>  <p>  There are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include a weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pension based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension and carer&rsquo;s allowance, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  Guardian payments are available where someone is looking after an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  An application can be made under the ENP scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses.  The assistance is toward the costs of the necessary basic requirements for a dignified funeral.  However, there is no automatic entitlement to such a payment.  An ENP is a means tested payment payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the individual applicant and that of the deceased person including any savings, property, insurance policies, etc. that would render the applicant or anybody else liable for the burial costs.  The Department official will also consider if a bereavement grant is available from any other source including former employer, credit union or trade union.</p></reply>

I would highlight that income tax is charged under Schedule D of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of a number of sources of income, including rent received by landlords (both individuals and companies) from property in the State.</p><p>In the case of rental activity, taxable income is the gross rent as reduced by a limited number of specified deductions as set out in section 97 (2) TCA 1997. The main deductible expenses are:</p><p>- any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;</p><p>- the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;</p><p>- the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;</p><p>- the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with PRTB registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year); and </p><p>- payment of local authority rates. </p><p>In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation. These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.</p><p>The effect of the deduction of allowable expenses from gross rent means that the amount of taxable rental income will often be substantially lower than the gross rent, and could, depending on individual circumstances, be nil.</p><p>The Government is monitoring the rental market closely and the overriding objective in relation to rents is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole. Housing policy is a matter for the Department of Environment, and my officials have been in contact with officials in that department. Any tax proposals would be considered by the Government as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.</p></reply>

I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions setting interest rates. This is a commercial matter for the institutions concerned. </p>  <p>  Equally, the Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review. I discussed the issue of mortgage interest rates with the Governor of the Central Bank on 2 April. As a result, the Governor is currently reviewing the issue of the standard variable rates charged by the lenders and should be in a position to present this analysis to me in the next 10 days or so. I will then meet the six principal mortgage lenders in order to discuss this issue. </p>  <p>  In addition, there have been moves on interest rates. As the Deputy will be aware, on 1 May AIB Group announced a number of reductions to its mortgage interest rates for owner occupier and buy-to-let mortgages. </p>  <p>  A series of reductions over a fixed time frame would be acceptable to me and in that context I welcome AIB's announcement as a good first step. </p>  <p>  The effective management of the mortgage arrears issue is an area that remains under continuous review.  More and concerted action can be undertaken by the banks to assist customers in arrears.  As the Deputy is aware the Taoiseach has previously announced that the Government is considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions.  Given the importance of the issue, his Department is co-ordinating the response across the various Government Departments and agencies and I anticipate that a detailed announcement will be forthcoming shortly.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-07a.122.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050700045#WRD01100"><p>Finance Act 2014 introduced changes to allow owners of approved minimum retirement funds (AMRFs) to draw-down up to 4% of the assets of such funds on one occasion in each year instead of the facility to draw-down the accrued income and gains of such funds, as had applied prior to the changes. </p>  <p>  I should explain by way of background, that under the flexible options at retirement arrangements (the so-called "ARF option"), where an individual in a Defined Contribution pension savings arrangement is under age 75 at the time of exercising the option and does not meet the guaranteed pension income requirement of &euro;12,700 per annum, that individual must place a maximum "set aside" amount of &euro;63,500 (or the remainder of the pension funds if less than &euro;63,500 after taking the retirement lump sum) in an AMRF or purchase an annuity with those funds.</p>  <p>  Any amount of remaining pension funds in excess of &euro;63,500 can be invested in an ARF with access to those funds at the owner's discretion (subject to tax, at the marginal rate and having regard to the imputed distribution requirements). </p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension "nest-egg" to provide for the latter years of his/her retirement. Up to Finance Act 2014, the capital invested in an AMRF could not be accessed until the AMRF owner reached age 75 (or meets the guaranteed pension income requirement before then) at which point the AMRF becomes an ARF with unrestricted access to the funds, subject to taxation. While the capital sum in an AMRF could not be accessed, as set out, any income, profits or gains accrued from the investment of the capital could, up to now, be withdrawn by the AMRF owner, subject to tax at the marginal rate. </p>  <p>  I decided to change the arrangements for AMRFs so as to allow AMRF owners voluntary, tax-liable access to a maximum of 4% of their AMRF assets each year up to the point at which the AMRF becomes an ARF. This change provides AMRF owners with access to a definitive and certain level of income from their AMRF rather than the uncertain level of income which access to the accrued income, profits and gains in the AMRF provided. </p>  <p>  Under the previous access arrangements for AMRFs, the extent of any income, profit or gains would depend on the performance of the investment options taken and could, therefore, be highly volatile with the possibility of little or no gains accruing in certain years. In addition, the scale of the capital allowed for in an AMRF, at &euro;63,500, would not always permit for investment returns of any significant scale to be made using a prudent investment policy. </p>  <p>  The change allowing access to a specified percentage of the capital in an AMRF is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to provide a more certain form of supplementary pension income prior to reaching age 75. This facility also ensures that an individual will have some remaining funds in the AMRF at age 75 to provide for their remaining years, assuming the individual has not purchased a pension annuity in the meantime.</p>  <p>  Individuals whose AMRF represents a less significant part of their retirement funds and whose circumstances would allow for greater investment risk and, therefore, potentially greater investment returns will be limited to the 4% level of asset draw down. However, this draw down will also be available to them for periods when their AMRF investments make losses or returns of less than 4% of the value of their AMRF assets and where, under the previous arrangement, they would not have been able to make a draw down or a draw down of a lesser value than will now be permitted. I consider that the change will be to the benefit of AMRF owners, generally, over the medium to longer term and I have no plans to reverse it. </p></reply>

Insurance Ireland has indicated that 98% of policyholders have household insurance which includes flood cover.</p><p>In order to help those who have been affected by flooding, Government policy aims to address the underlying problem through appropriate remedial works where this is economically feasible. The Office of Public Works is committed to alleviating the impact of flooding through the provision of defences as well as a comprehensive assessment of flood risk throughout the country and development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme.  This commitment is underpinned by a significant capital works investment programme on flood relief measures. Works are completed on a prioritised basis. Once these works are completed the availability of flood insurance in affected areas would be expected to increase.</p><p>The OPW and Insurance Ireland have agreed a Memorandum of Understanding on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes.  The outcome of this arrangement, which came into effect in June 2014, is that the insurance industry will have a much greater level of information and understanding of the extent of the protection provided by completed OPW flood defence works and will therefore be in a position to reflect this in assessing the provision of flood insurance to householders in areas where works have been completed. The arrangements set out in the Memorandum represent an ongoing process which, over time, should lead to an improvement in the availability of flood insurance cover.</p><p>The OPW and the Department of Finance will continue contact with Insurance Ireland to review the operation of the Memorandum of Understanding.</p><p>In cases where individuals are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance and believe that they are being treated unfairly it is open to them to contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. Their service can be contacted at (01) 6761914 or by email at </p></reply>

The Code was first published in 2009 and has been updated on a number of occasions since.  The CCMA sought to deliver on the following established principles:</p>  <p> 1. Ensure the appropriate resolution of each borrower's arrears situation;</p>  <p>  2. Ensure that lenders deal with borrowers in a fair and transparent manner;</p>  <p>  3. Support and facilitate meaningful engagement between lenders and borrowers; and </p>  <p>  4. Ensure borrower awareness of the benefits of cooperating with their lender and the consequences of not cooperating.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that the CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.  </p>  <p>  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long-term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers. All cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the lender, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his/her mortgage obligations.  A lender may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where it has made every reasonable effort under the Code to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower or his/her nominated representative and the specific timeframes set out in the Code have been adhered to or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating. </p>  <p>  Where a borrower engages with his lender with a view to putting in place a restructure arrangement to address his/her mortgage arrears situation, repossession of the family home should only be considered as a last resort.  The Central Bank's most recent quarterly release on Residential Mortgage arrears and Repossessions (Q4 2014) indicates that almost 115,000 restructure arrangements have been put in place up to the end of December and of these almost 85% were deemed to be meeting the terms of their arrangement.  This shows that active engagement can deliver positive results and in the majority of cases will enable a borrower in mortgage distress to remain in his/her family home.</p>  <p>  Many borrowers can also find solutions through the options offered by the Insolvency Service of Ireland and Government will ensure that the personal insolvency process is as fair and effective as possible and that the objectives as set out in the original Personal Insolvency Act are realised as much as possible.   My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, and her officials are actively preparing amendments to the legislative framework for personal insolvency aimed at enabling Government's objectives in this regard to be met and allowing more people in distressed debt to access the available mechanisms than has been the case to date. </p>  <p>  The effective management of mortgage arrears is, however, an area that remains under continuous review.  more and concerted action can be undertaken by the banks to assist customers in arrears and, as the Taoiseach has previously announced, the Government is considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the update of personal insolvency solutions.</p></reply>

From the European Commission's most recent spring forecasts, it can be estimated that nominal unit labour costs in Ireland fell by nearly 8 percent between 2008 and 2014. This compares with an increase of 12 per cent in the UK and 8 per cent in the euro area over the same time period. </p>  <p>  In addition, relatively low consumer price inflation over the last number of years has contributed to the improvement in Ireland's competitiveness because Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to those of our euro area peers. For instance, annual HICP inflation in Ireland has been below that of the euro area average for every year since 2009. </p>  <p>  The European Central Bank's Expanded Asset Purchase Programme (EAPP) which began on 9 March, has been associated with a depreciation of the euro in recent months. With the US and the UK being Ireland's biggest trading partners outside the euro area, a depreciation of the euro against the dollar and sterling have a particularly positive impact on Ireland's competitiveness and therefore the export potential of firms in Ireland. The real Harmonised Competitiveness Indicator (HCI) measures the trade weighted exchange rate for Ireland, adjusted for relative price developments in trading partners. Between April 2008 and March 2015 Ireland's real HCI fell by over 23 per cent, indicating a significant improvement in competitiveness over the period. </p>  <p>  The gains in Irish competitiveness achieved since 2008 have been hard-won through productivity improvements, wage and price moderation. It is important that this competitiveness is preserved and continues to support growth. In this regard we must be cognisant that favourable exchange rate movements and gains from the fall in oil prices may unwind in the future.  Therefore we need to stay focused on continuing to improve Ireland's competitiveness through other channels such as wage and productivity improvements.</p></reply>

Encouragingly, domestic demand made its first positive contribution to growth since the crisis began with consumption increasing by 1.1 per cent in 2014 compared to 2013 and investment up 11.3 per cent over the same period. Exports rose by 12.6 per cent annually with imports rising by 13.2 per cent.</p>  <p>  The economic recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market where we have now had nine successive quarters of solid employment growth. As a result, the unemployment rate has fallen 5 percentage points since its peak in early 2012.</p>  <p>  High frequency data relating to 2015 have also been encouraging:</p>  <p>  - Consumer spending has been strong in Q1 2015 with retail sales up by almost 9 per cent year on year.  Core sales (excluding motor trades) were up close to 5 per cent over the same period.</p>  <p>  - Investment is also growing with both building/construction and machinery/equipment spending on a rising path.  Recovery in the construction sector continued in March with the Purchasing Managers' Index for the sector recording its nineteenth successive month of expansion. </p>  <p>  - These encouraging macroeconomic data are mirrored in the total taxation receipts which are up strongly in the first four months of the year.</p>  <p>  My Department published its latest macroeconomic forecasts in April with the Stability Programme Update 2015. GDP is expected to expand by 4.0 per cent in 2015 and by 3.8 per cent in 2016. Over the remainder of the decade, Departmental estimates indicate that the economy has the capacity to grow by around 3-3&frac14; per cent per annum. These forecasts reflect the latest economic indicators and demonstrate that a sustained recovery is underway.</p></reply>

Investors in project-specific bonds would require higher yields than standard Government bonds to reflect the lower liquidity.  Such project-specific bonds, if issued by Government, would be on the Government's balance sheet.</p>  <p>  However in the case of a Public Private Partnership (PPP), where the State selects a private consortium to Design, Build, Finance &amp;amp; Operate State infrastructure, that private consortium can issue project-specific bonds. Such bond issuance may be deemed to be outside of General Government provided that the necessary risks are contractually transferred to the private sector in line with Eurostat rules.   The latter type bonds are considered by investors to carry significantly more risk than standard Government issued bonds and consequently require higher yields to reflect the risk profile. The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) has advised that there is currently a strong supply of funders/investors for PPP projects.  </p>  <p>  I am happy to confirm that the Government remains committed to exploring alternative means of financing capital projects. The NDFA is charged with advising on the optimal means of financing the costs of all public investment projects over &euro;20 million in order to achieve value for money, including the &euro;2.25 billion stimulus package announced by the Government in July 2012. NDFA continues to facilitate securing funding for both PPPs and non-PPP capital projects from a wide range of sources including domestic and international banks, institutional investors and supranational organisations such as the European Investment Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

Over the medium term, the economy can probably grow by around 3-3&frac14; per cent per annum on a sustainable basis. Achieving these growth rates is contingent upon many factors including trading partner growth, continued improvements in competitiveness, sustainable public finances, access to credit, etc.</p>  <p>  We have no control over some of these, but we do over others. As set out in the Spring Economic Statement (SES), the Government is using all policy instruments available to ensure continued improvements in competitiveness, sustainable public finances and improved access to credit.  So we are putting in place the framework conditions to help ensure medium-term growth rates of around 3-3&frac14; per cent per annum are achieved.</p>  <p>  But of course there are risks, and in this context the Stability Programme Update (published alongside the SES) sets out a number of potential risks to continued economic development. Quantitative estimates of the impact of particular risks emerging are also provided.</p>  <p>  A broader array of risks will be set out in the forthcoming National Risk Assessment 2015.

Looking at more recent trends, prices decreased by 0.9 per cent in the first quarter of 2015, although the latest figures for March indicated a monthly price increase of 0.9 per cent. It is too soon to say whether the recent developments in prices represent a break from the property price inflation pattern exhibited over the past two years.</p>  <p>  Rising residential property prices can impact on the economy through a number of channels.</p>  <p>  The current situation is one where housing supply has not yet responded commensurately to the increase in demand in urban areas, the latter driven by underlying demographic factors and by the economic recovery. In this context, an increase in residential property prices can be expected to lead to an increase in the supply of new housing to the market.  An increase in property prices improves the profitability of construction and should encourage developers to construct new housing, resulting in an increase in the level of supply. There is some evidence to show that housing supply is beginning to respond. Over the last year over 11,000 housing units were completed nationally representing more than a 30 per cent increase over the previous year. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, rising property prices add to market liquidity as owners and investors bring second hand properties to the market. A more liquid property market should help support individuals' mobility within the economy.</p>  <p>  Residential property price increases are also relevant in alleviating the extent of negative equity and household over-indebtedness. The reduction in negative equity should improve mobility amongst those affected, further supporting the economy's recovery. In addition, increasing property prices may lead to an increase in consumption though a wealth effect.</p>  <p>  Rising property valuations also have a direct impact on our bank investments. To the extent that they  feed through positively to impairment provisions, it further strengthens the banks' capital positions and consequently improves the valuation of the State's shareholdings. In addition rising values can also assist the credit channel through the provision of stronger collateral.</p>  <p>  On the other hand, excessive property price increases could adversely affect the affordability of accommodation.  This could restrict individuals' mobility and harm our economic competitiveness. In light of this, a return to affordability levels seen at the peak of the property bubble would be unwelcome.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, it is Government policy to tackle the impediments and barriers to housing supply which should contribute to a reduction in property price pressures. Construction 2020 sets out the Government's strategy for addressing issues in the property and construction sectors.  The strategy involves ensuring that any critical bottlenecks impeding the sector in meeting residential and commercial demand are addressed. It incorporates 75 time-bound actions encompassing the development of an overall strategic approach to housing supply, identifying and implementing further improvements in the planning process, and seeking to improve financing options for development and mortgage provision. This work is complemented by the Social Housing Strategy which was launched last November. This Strategy aims to provide more than 35,000 new homes to meet social housing needs by 2020 and to deliver up to 75,000 units of long term accommodation through local authority housing support schemes for tenants.</p></reply>

To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has been focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit facilities from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.</p><p>On 19 February 2015, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland launched its initial range of products. The SBCI has already signed up the two largest SME lenders in the country, AIB and Bank of Ireland, to deliver products to SMEs.  Loans have been available from 9 March 2015 at branches of both banks throughout the entire country. SBCI's funding must be passed to SMEs and the SMEs must receive the full benefit of any discounted rate offered to the partner lenders. SBCI has committed &euro;200m to each of the initial bank lending partners and has a further &euro;400m available to other future lenders. Talks are continuing with a number of other potential funding partners from both the banking and non-banking worlds. The SBCI will offer longer term loans, working capital facilities of 2 years' duration, loans to agriculture and loans for the refinancing of credit originally extended by banks who have since exited the Irish market.  Further information is available at </p><p>The Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014. On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at .</p><p>The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and my Department have worked on an amendment to the existing guarantee scheme to provide funding to SMEs whose banks are exiting the Irish market. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, will shortly bring legislation to the Oireachtas which will enable the development of a more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme with longer duration and more products and providers included. </p><p>The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides loans of up to &euro;25,000 to small businesses who have been refused credit by commercial banks. Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund. This scheme is currently being reviewed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with a view to making proposed changes to enhance its effectiveness. </p><p>The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by either Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Reviewer, John Trethowan and his team, have overturned 55% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.  Further details are available at .</p><p>In seeking to build on the progress to date and to further support the financing of growth within the SME sector our focus in 2015, outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs, will be to implement a series of actions under the following thematic areas:</p><p>- Support and influence the effective implementation of major policy initiatives to ensure that the maximum benefits are afforded to SMEs;</p><p>- Continue to raise awareness and understanding amongst SMEs and entrepreneurs of the full suite of State business supports that are available;</p><p>- Ensure that the Local Enterprise Office network is a key conduit in providing information, support and advice to small businesses on access to finance issues and strengthen the linkages between enterprise capacity building, accessing finance and business guidance;</p><p>- Deepen our engagement with international funding institutions;</p><p>- Facilitate and support the development of a more diverse range of financing options for SMEs;</p><p>- Maintain a strong focus on policy impact, evaluation and learning; and</p><p>- Develop measures to ensure prompt payments and promote improvements in the payment culture and practices in Ireland.</p><p>The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently the Department of Finance, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit with a view to taking appropriate actions as warranted to ensure that SMEs in Ireland have the opportunity to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.</p></reply>

In circumstances where they are exposed to a high level of claims, it is possible that their capital position can be affected with a consequential effect on prices. In this regard, it should be noted that the new prudential regime for insurers across the EU known as Solvency II, which will come into force from the start of 2016, will place a greater emphasis than the existing regime on the need to price risk appropriately, and will in turn require insurance companies to be more conscious of their pricing policy. This will benefit the consumer in many instances. </p>  <p>  Government initiatives such as the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and legislation to improve road safety, which has reduced accidents significantly, continue to make a major contribution to keeping insurance costs at a reasonable level. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-07a.184.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050700047#WRF01300"><p>While it is not absolutely clear from the details supplied, I am assuming that the questions at issue relate to past changes that were made to the annual earnings limit which, along with age-related percentage limits, determine the maximum tax-relievable pension contributions that an individual can make in a tax year and to the 0.6% pension fund levy which I introduced in 2011.</p>  <p>  In that regard, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the earnings limit which was originally set at &euro;254,000 in 2003 and increased through indexation to &euro;275,239 by 2008, was subsequently reduced by the previous Government to &euro;150,000 in 2009 and further reduced to its present level of &euro;115,000 as part of a range of pension-related measures introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2011 by that administration. </p>  <p>  It should be borne in mind that all of the pension-related changes made at that time were implemented against the very difficult and challenging budgetary situation which was facing the country and continued to face the country in the years that followed. It was clear that the tax base had to be broadened and tax expenditures curtailed or abolished if the serious financial and economic problems facing the country were to be addressed. Given the very significant cost of pension tax reliefs, such reliefs could not escape attention. Apart from contributing to the curbing of overall tax expenditures, the pension-related tax changes introduced also brought greater equity to the system by impacting for the most part primarily on higher earners. Indeed, I have introduced further restrictions in this area by, for example, reducing the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT)   the maximum tax relievable pension fund at retirement   to &euro;2 million from its previous level of &euro;2.3 million with effect from 1 January 2014 and by changing the valuation factor used for establishing the capital value of defined benefit pension schemes from a standard factor of 20 to a higher age-related factor that varies with the individual's age at the point at which pension benefits are drawn down. These changes to the SFT regime apply to pension arrangements across the board in both the private and the public sector.</p>  <p>  In the same vein, the original 0.6% stamp duty levy on pension fund assets, which I introduced in 2011 and which ended last year, was used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and create new jobs. These include expenditure measures such as the Jobbridge and the Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives, such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the halving of the lower employer PRSI rate.  It is the case that the levy does not apply to unfunded public service pension schemes. However, the pensions of public servants have been subject to a public service pension reduction (PSPR) since 1 January 2011. The PSPR was introduced on 1 January 2011 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010. The PSPR is not a levy but is a pension cut affecting public service pensions, including those of former members of the Oireachtas and Ministers.</p>  <p>  While the 0.6% pension fund levy has ceased and the lower 0.15% levy introduced for 2014 and 2015 will not apply beyond 2015, I have no plans to either repay the pension fund levy tax collected or to retrospectively reinstate the higher earnings limit for pension contributions, as may be implied in the details supplied with the question. </p>  <p>  Overall, the restrictions in tax expenditures and the funds raised by way of the levy have helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State. We have begun to see the benefits of this improving position as evident from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and which will continue in future Budgets to reduce the income tax burden on low and middle income earners. </p></reply>

These powers are contained in the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014.

As the Deputy will know, I have consistently emphasised that it is important to ensure there is balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector and that Ireland continues to have robust agri-food and retail sectors, particularly given the importance of these sectors to the national economy.  The regulation of certain practices in the grocery goods sector is intended to achieve such a balance taking into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector including the interests of the consumer and the need to ensure that there is no impediment to the passing-on of lower prices to consumers.</p></reply>

My Department remains of the view that infection from wildlife, in particular badgers, remains a particular issue in the Wicklow area.  For example, a recent study conducted in the Callary area detected a TB culture confirmation rate in badgers of over 26% which compares with a national rate of 13.3%.  The level of TB found in badgers was also considerably higher than that found in deer in that area, where 4.8% of deer had visible lesions, with 15.5% culturing positive for TB. Strain typing with a view to establishing a clearer picture of the origin or transmission pathways for the infection as between the species is ongoing.</p><p>While my Department continues to implement a badger removal programme in Wicklow as it does in other relevant areas, responsibility for wild deer rests, under the Wildlife Acts, with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  A non-statutory Irish Deer Management forum has recently been established with an independent chairman and includes representation from stakeholder groups, as well as the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  It is intended that results of the exercise conducted in Callary will initially be considered by the forum.</p></reply>

In 2014 export volumes increased by approximately 7%, with growth to the UK, Continental Europe and International markets. Export values increased by some 3% and are in the range of &euro;570 million, continuing the growth seen in recent years. Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices and production followed by recovery. My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure in recent months and the difficulties that this is causing for producers. Having said that, it must be noted that Irish prices remain above the EU average at present. However I would also add that like any other EU Minister I do not have a role in the setting of prices. This is a function of the market.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I called on the European Commission to monitor the developments on markets and where necessary, to quickly activate safety net provisions such as public interventions and/or private storage aid. This resulted in the introduction of the Aids to Private Storage scheme for the pigmeat sector which opened in early March of this year. However due to the fact that EU pigmeat market prices stabilised somewhat over recent weeks and the uptake of the scheme by operators dropped to minimal volumes, the Commission closed the scheme as of last week.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Russian ban on EU pigmeat exports, I am fully aware of the concerns Irish pig farmers have as a result of the closure of this market. My Department has met with the Russian authorities on a number of occasions to impress upon them the importance we attach to the normalisation of trade with Russia. Ultimately however, the Russian ban on pigmeat is an EU wide issue and is likely only to be resolved at EU level. The Commission has referred this matter to the WTO for resolution.</p>  <p>  Support is provided by my Department for the pig sector in a number of ways. Firstly I have included provision in the Rural Development Programme for an on-farm capital investment scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors. Some &euro;37 million has been allocated for 2015.  Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers. Other elements of the RDP, such as a targeted on farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the pig sector.</p>  <p>  Other supports for the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility and courses in pig production, plays an important role in improving production at farm level. Through its Joint Research Advisory Programme, Teagasc supports Irish pig producers by providing advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector. The programme which is funded by a voluntary industry levy has enabled Teagasc to employ four additional advisors and researchers to support producers and the sector through advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector. The high level objective of the programme is to enhance the sustainability of Irish pig meat production, including improvements in economic, social and environmental standards. This will result in improvements in the production and marketability of Irish pigmeat.</p>  <p>  I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pigmeat in domestic and overseas markets. Bord Bia provides assistance to the pigmeat sector through its marketing and promotional activities, and the pigmeat quality assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets.</p>  <p>  For my part I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish Pigmeat processors since the closure of the Russian market last year. In this regard I was pleased to announce the opening of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which will serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports. My Department will continue in its efforts to develop access to international markets.</p></reply>

The payments audited covered the period from 2008 to 2012 during which over &euro;9 billion was paid to farmers in Ireland under the Direct Payment Schemes. I have always been opposed to the imposition of flat-rate penalties and particularly so in this case. I have strongly refuted the application of this proposed correction as disproportionate to the true level of risk involved and on this basis my Department sought a hearing with the Conciliation Body.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department met with the Conciliation Body on 10 December 2014. At the Conciliation Hearing, my Department outlined Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental objection to the flat rate correction and argued that the risk to the Fund should be a calculated amount. My officials informed the Body regarding the amount of work undertaken by my Department to identify and remove all ineligible features from the LPIS database, the technical improvement in the LPIS system and the time and resources used by my Department to address all issues raised by the Commission.</p>  <p>  The Conciliation Body acknowledged the amount of work done by my Department over such a short period of time and expressed the opinion that the issues with the Commission related to a few, though important, elements of this work.</p>  <p>  The report of the Conciliation Body concluded that conciliation seemed within reach and that the two parties should continue discussing the matter with a view to an agreed settlement. On foot of this my Department has maintained regular contact with the Commission with a view to bringing the matter to a conclusion. Further work has recently been carried out to quantify the level of risk to EU funds and this information is with the Commission for consideration.</p></reply>

Firstly it is required under the Fisheries Control Regulation (EU) 1224/2009 to implement a points system for skippers of fishing vessels found to have committed serious fishery infringements. Secondly it is intended to introduce a system of Fixed Penalty Notices for minor fishery infringements; this will deliver on a commitment in the Programme for Government. Thirdly it is intended to affirm in legislation that fishing quotas are a national resource. In addition to this, it is intended that the Bill will resolve some typographical errors and introduce a number of miscellaneous minor amendments.

The primary objective of Operation Obair is to disrupt and prevent mobile and organised criminal groups from committing criminal offences, to apprehend suspects in the commission or the attempted commission of offences and to fully investigate, detect and, where possible, prosecute any offences outstanding against these suspects.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that Operation Obair is one of a number of specific burglary related operations which have been implemented in each Garda Region, in support of Operation Fiacla, to target suspect offenders, disrupt their activities and secure their attendance before the courts. The Operation provides both a preventative and detection element, and focuses on geographical areas and specific targets. Targeted offences include; burglary, aggravated burglary, robbery, possession of house breaking implements, possession of stolen property and trespassing.</p>  <p>  I am advised that, as of 30 April 2015, Operation Fiacla has led to the arrest of 13,027 persons with charges being brought against 7,394 persons nationally.  I am further advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not in a position to provide the specific information requested by the Deputy in relation to Operation Obair as this would require a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources to collate.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I have also been carrying out a broad review of the criminal justice system&rsquo;s response to the problem of burglaries.  This includes a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities, and an examination of legislative issues.  In this regard I recently published the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill which was approved by Government.  This legislation targets repeat burglary offenders through bail measures and provisions concerning the imposition of consecutive sentencing for repeat burglary offending. </p></reply>

It was intended to visit Russia in January of this year.  However it has been decided to liaise with officials in the Ministry of Education and Science in Russia to ensure that Irish proposals in regard the provision of post placement reports are acceptable to the Russian Federation.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Constitution protects the integrity of family life and that once adopted in Ireland the child is treated in the same way as other Irish children.  This means that the ability of the State to intervene in a family, when a child&rsquo;s welfare and protection is not compromised, is limited.  The Department has advised the Russian Federation of this Constitutional imperative in instances where families, who had given commitments to the Russian authorities in regard to the provision of post placement reports, fail to adhere to those commitments.  In these instances the State has no legislative power to enforce compliance with the commitments given by Irish families, legal or otherwise, to provide post placement reports.  It is imperative that this matter is fully addressed so as to ensure that further discussions on other aspects of the bilateral agreement are beneficial.</p></reply>

Anyone ordinarily resident in the country is entitled, subject to certain charges, to receive public in-patient and out-patient hospital services. People who do not take out health insurance continue to have the same entitlement to services in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  Community rating, reflecting the principle of intergenerational solidarity, is a fundamental cornerstone of the health insurance system. This means that people who are old or sick do not have to pay more than the young and well.  Under community rating, the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid.  Premiums for younger or healthier lives are typically higher than their expected claims would require, whereas for older or less healthy lives, premiums are typically lower than the expected claims would require. </p>  <p>  For Community Rating to work we depend on adequate numbers of younger people taking out health insurance to help keep premium prices down for everybody. Lifetime Community Rating is being introduced to encourage people to take out health insurance at a younger age, thereby helping to spread the costs of older and less healthy people across society, to support affordable community-rated premiums for everyone who wishes to purchase insurance. It is a necessary measure to help support the viability of community rating within our system of health insurance.</p>  <p>  It is worth clarifying that those who do not wish to avail of private health insurance will not face a financial penalty. They retain their full entitlement to use of public hospital services. Under Lifetime Community Rating, those who decide to take out  health insurance later in life will face an added premium compared to those who have subscribed over a longer period.  I am satisfied that this measure is fully justified for the purposes of maintaining a stable insurance market which provides equity of treatment between young and old.</p></reply>

The consultation forms part of a wider review which aims to explore the feasibility of setting up a system to allow appropriately trained non-medical persons to have ready access to certain prescription-only medicines for use in emergency situations, while ensuring that medicines continue to be controlled in an appropriate manner.  The medicines under consideration are adrenaline, salbutamol, glucagon, naloxone and glyceryl trinitrate. </p>  <p>  Members of the public and other stakeholders were asked to respond to the consultation by mid-March.  Submissions have been received from a wide variety of respondents and analysis of these responses is under way.  My Department has also consulted with a number of health care organisations and agencies to ensure that the various options for extending the availability of certain prescription-only medicines for use in emergency situations are fully explored.  The outcome of these discussions and feedback from the public consultation are currently being considered.  I expect to receive a report and policy recommendations shortly.  I will then consider the report and make a policy decision on the best way to proceed.  The report of the consultation will be made available on my Department's website once this process is complete.</p></reply>

The funding is being used to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children, to enhance specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness, those with an intellectual disability and mental illness, forensic mental health services, and to enhance access to counselling and psychotherapy in primary care and investment in suicide prevention measures.  The additional funding is enabling the HSE to recruit staff who are more suited to the development of a community-focused Mental Health Service and has provided for a required change in the mix of staff, in particular allied health professionals, across Community Mental Health Teams, in line with <i>A Vision for Change</i>.  </p><p>As at 17th April 2015, 397.5 or 95.5% of the 416 posts approved for 2012 and 405.5 or 85% of the 477 posts approved for 2013 have been filled.  Of the 250 posts allocated in 2014, 50 have started and a further 70.5 are at various stages in the recruitment process. </p><p>There are some difficulties in identifying some outstanding candidates, for geographic and qualification reasons.  The HSE Mental Health Division is acutely aware of the need to focus on recruitment of frontline staff and is working closely with the Human Resources and the National Recruitment Service to address difficulties attracting candidates to particular parts of the country.  A number of national and international recruitment campaigns are under way currently for medical consultant posts, senior and staff nurses as well as a range of required allied health professionals and support staff to deliver a multidisciplinary based Mental Health Service.  Every effort is being made to fill the remainder of the approved posts as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

However, the Act provides that the Minister for Health may, under section 4(2), designate a health and social care profession not already designated if he or she considers that it is in the public interest to do so and if specified criteria have been met.</p>  <p>  My predecessor, Minister James Reilly T.D, wrote to the The Health and Social Care Professionals Council last year seeking advice on the question of specifically designating counsellors and psychotherapists under the 2005 Act.</p>  <p>  A number of issues require clarification and there are varying views among the professional bodies representing counsellors and psychotherapists in Ireland.  The main questions to be resolved include whether counselling and psychotherapy should be treated as one or two professions for the purposes of regulation, the title or titles of the profession(s) to be protected, and the minimum qualifications that would be required of applicants for registration.  The readiness and compatibility of the professions for designation under the 2005 Act also need to be determined.</p>  <p>  The Council's detailed report on the matter has been received in recent weeks and is being examined carefully in the Department with a view to deciding the next steps which, I envisage, will include a wider round of consultation involving the various professional bodies and other interested parties.</p></reply>

In outlining the importance of such quality assurance structures and functions, the Faculty explained that "like many diagnostic services that involved decision making under conditions of uncertainty, a certain degree of error is inevitable".  The challenge to every system internationally is to ensure systems are put in place to mitigate risk, minimise the degree of error and provide assurance around the services provided.</p>  <p>  The process of audit is built into radiology practice.  Peer review occurs continuously: radiologists review older images when reporting on new images.  In addition, radiology departments partake in multidisciplinary team meetings, where images are reviewed by teams who decide on the treatment a patient should receive.  In line with the recommendations of the NQAPR, many departments hold discrepancy meetings, with open discussion of cases where reports appear to be inaccurate.  Such meetings facilitate collective learning, improving patient safety.  Prospective double reporting is where a consultant radiologist seeks a second opinion from another consultant radiologist within his or her department on a particular case prior to authorisation.</p>  <p>  Radiological services will be improved through the implementation of Hospital Groups.  Within Groups, a networked approach will be adopted, allowing the major centres to direct and manage services.  This will ensure that appropriate and enhanced governance and staffing arrangements are in place.  The full implementation of the National Integrated Medical Imaging System (NIMIS) which provides filmless imaging data and enhances the secure and rapid movement of patient image data throughout the health service including across hospitals within Hospital Groups is continuing to enhance radiological services nationally.</p>  <p>  Finally, new structures have been created in the HSE and in my Department to advance patient safety and clinical effectiveness.  The creation of a Quality Improvement Division within the HSE and the Clinical Programmes set up between the HSE and the RCPI, have greatly enhanced our governance and capacity for ensuring robust quality and risk frameworks, developing models of best practice in clinical care.  The establishment and strengthening of the Clinical Effectiveness Unit in my Department has been fundamental to reducing risk and improving the performance of our health system.  I fully support this clinical effectiveness agenda.  It is vital that Ireland has a suite of quality assured National Clinical Guidelines and National Clinical Audit in place.  These are standards for patient care and treatments set out by leading clinicians in the health service.</p></reply>

In addition, my Department will conduct a widespread consultation on the draft General Scheme during which stakeholders and members of the public will be invited to share their views.</p>  <p>  As I have previously stated it is currently not the case that the public funding of fertility treatments will be included as part of these provisions.  While I would favour public funding of fertility treatments in principle there are many other pressing funding demands on the health service at this time.</p>  <p>  Although in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment is not provided by the Irish public health service, there is some support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.  In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;.  The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

In line with the recommendations, the role of the Task Forces has been extended to tackle alcohol misuse and a National Coordinating Committee has been established to guide the work of the Task Forces and drive implementation of the National Drugs Strategy.</p>  <p>  The National Coordinating Committee is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the recommendations.

Where children have significant care needs whereby they may need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.</p><p>  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>  All schools have been asked to apply to the NCSE for SNA support for the 2015/16 school year by 18th March, 2015. </p><p>  The NCSE will consider all applications for SNA support which have been made by schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy. Schools will be advised of their revised SNA allocations for the 2015/16 school year, prior to the end of the current school year.</p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  As the Deputy's question relates to the consideration of an the SNA allocation by the NCSE to an individual, I have referred this question to the NCSE for their consideration and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is a condition therefore that the maximum length of time that a teacher may be on secondment is five years, following which they return to their teaching roles within their schools. In this way, their expertise and knowledge is not lost to the system.  These teacher secondment arrangements were disseminated extensively so the necessary planning could take place at all levels including education centres, support services, school boards of management and individual teacher.</p><p>  The support services have engaged in succession planning as a key strategy in ensuring continued support for teachers and school leaders in implementing national education policy priorities and CPD and which allows for continuity, quality planning and management.</p><p>  An alleviation of the application of the five year limit, up to 10% of the posts where required, has been agreed to allow secondees to serve for a further limited period.

At  post primary, I have prioritised work in both mathematics and science.  I will summarise the work that is currently in hand. </p>  <p>  In fact, this year at primary level, the NCCA is developing draft components of a new Primary Mathematics curriculum for junior infants to 2nd class to support their consultation process in this area.  Work on the review of primary science will happen at a later stage since the review of all aspects of the primary curriculum is being done on a phased basis. </p>  <p>  In January this year, I launched the performance report on the 2014 National Assessments of English and Reading and Mathematics which was prepared by the Educational Research Centre.  Their study of 8000 pupils in 150 primary schools found that overall performance in reading and mathematics in second and sixth classes was significantly higher than for the 2009 assessments.  These are the first significant improvements in over 30 years. Such improvements are to be welcomed.</p>  <p>  Significant system developments have been introduced in the primary school system to promote teaching and learning in Mathematics for boys and girls including standardised national assessments of reading and mathematics introduced in 2007.  These now happen at 2nd, 4th and 6th classes; the National strategy to improve literacy and numeracy introduced in 2011 and School self-evaluation guidelines for primary schools published in 2012.</p>  <p>  TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Studies) is a project of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA).  It is designed to assess the mathematics and science achievement of fourth class pupils. In 2011, Ireland took part in TIMSS for the first time since 1995. </p>  <p>  There are many initiatives in place to promote interest in science and mathematics. Scoilnet is the Department of Education and Skills (DES) official portal for Irish education.  The website is managed by Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) in Education on behalf of the DES.  The Sci-Spy Initiative which is a section of this website is aimed at primary students in 5th and 6th classes.</p>  <p>  Science Week Ireland is an annual event established to promote the relevance of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) in our everyday lives.  It is coordinated by SFI Discover, the education-outreach programme of Science </p>  <p>  In relation to post-primary, Dr Travers, in his February report, recommended that implementation of Junior Cycle science be postponed from September 2015 to September 2016.  Currently over 90% of students take Junior Cycle science.  It is expected that the vast majority will continue to do so.  A range of comprehensive continuing professional development (CPD) will be provided for teachers of junior cycle science through the dedicated JCT service. </p>  <p>  The NCCA has provided me with new specifications for Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology.  The NCCA has notified the Department that before the specifications are made available to all schools that it, working with the SEC and my Department, will trial, in particular the proposed new practical examinations. </p>  <p>  Work is currently underway on revising Leaving Certificate Agricultural Science and Applied Mathematics. </p>  <p>  New syllabuses are in place at both junior and senior cycles for Mathematics, often called "project mathematics".  Since 2010, the Project Maths Development Team, www.projectmaths.ie, a support service funded by my Department provides a range of professional development supports including workshops, and resources for 6,000 post-primary teachers of mathematics across the country. </p>  <p>  Since 2012, the Professional Diploma in Mathematics for Teaching, a blended learning, two year part-time programme Professional Diploma in Mathematics for Teaching has been made available nationwide and free of charge, to assist 'out-of-field' teachers to acquire skills for effective mathematics teaching and to register with the Teaching Council as teachers of mathematics at post-primary level.  The programme, provided by a consortium led by the University of Limerick, is being made available again in September 2015.  Some 800 teachers are involved in this initiative.  The first cohort graduated in 2104. </p>  <p>  It is heartening to know that the number of students in recent years presenting for Higher Level in both the Junior Certificate and in the Leaving Certificate mathematics has been increasing. </p>  <p>  Support is also available at primary and post primary level through the Professional Development Service for Teachers in the science and mathematics area.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives have given our students the skills and confidence, if they choose, to continue their studies in these areas in Higher Education. </p></reply>

Only if there is a failure  to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child  be referred for individual psychological assessment.  It is the responsibility  of the school Principal in the first instance to identify and prioritise pupils  for assessment under the process described above. </p><p>  If a parent has concerns in this regard they should be raised with the school  Principal in the first instance who can contact NEPS Regional Office for  clarification if necessary.  </p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy also that the National Council for Special  Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special  Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teaching support  to schools to support children with low incidence special educational needs, as  defined by my Department's Circular SpEd 02/05.  </p><p>  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  </p><p>  All schools have been asked to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching support  for the 2015/16 school year by 18th March, 2015.  </p><p>  The NCSE will consider all applications which have been made by schools, following which allocations will be made to qualifying schools.  </p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may  also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special  educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  </p><p>  In circumstances where a parent or school wishes to make an appeal against a  refusal by the NCSE to allocate resource teaching hours to a school on behalf  of a child, in accordance with my Departments criteria, they may make an appeal  in accordance with the procedures set out by the NCSE.  These are available on  the NCSEs website at www.ncse.ie.  </p><p>  It should also be noted that all Primary schools have been allocated additional  teaching resources to cater for children with high incidence special  educational needs through the General Allocation Model of additional teaching  supports.  </p><p>  It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of  additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in  accordance with my Department's guidance.

All mainstream Primary schools have been allocated additional  teaching resources under the GAM to cater for children with high incidence  special educational needs.  </p><p>  Separately, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates  additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been  assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05. The NCSE operates within my  Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education  supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. </p><p>  It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of  additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in  accordance with my Department's guidance. The teaching time afforded to each  individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each  child's individual learning needs.  </p><p>  Should a parent be dissatisfied with the manner in which the resources or  facilities which have been provided to support their child's education are  being applied in school, they should raise this matter directly with their  school Principal or the Board of Management of the school. </p><p>  All schools have been asked to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA  support for the 2015/16 school year by 18th March, 2015.  </p><p>  The NCSE will consider all applications which have been made by schools, following which allocations will be made to qualifying schools.  </p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may  also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special  educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants in this sector.</p><p><b></b>According to the PRTB Annual Report for 2013, adjudication processing times were an average of 7 months in 2013 compared to 12 months in 2012.  For 2014, I understand adjudications were taking an average of 5 to 6 months to process.  Late 2013 also saw the introduction of a pilot telephone mediation service as an alternative means to address disputes.  Processing times for mediation cases are typically 10 to 12 weeks.</p><p>The PRTB, as an independent statutory body, will adjudicate each dispute on its own facts and merits and may grant redress and give specific direction as appropriate on foot of a determination order.  Receipt of a determination order is the official notification to parties of the final outcome of a dispute resolution case.  The order sets out the terms to be complied with, including any payments owing and the length of time given to comply.  In making determination orders, the PRTB can make provision to allow for payment of awards in instalments to facilitate recovery of the award, based on the circumstances of the case.</p><p>A party who fails to comply with one or more terms of a determination order is open to having legal proceedings taken against him or her in the Courts.  Under the Act, enforcement of PRTB orders is a discretionary power and the Board exercises this power taking account of the circumstances pertaining to each case.  However, while there is no legal obligation on the PRTB to enforce, the Board takes the issue of non-compliance with determination orders seriously.  During 2013, it referred 394 cases to its legal advisors for enforcement proceedings.  It is also open to parties to pursue enforcement independently through the Courts, including the seeking of a garnishee order.  It should be noted that going to Court does not of itself ensure successful enforcement and more particularly, recoupment of an award.  In many cases the best option, and one which the PRTB facilitates, is for the parties to agree a schedule of payments.</p></reply>

In the context of the forthcoming energy policy paper, my Department is considering the optimal fuel mix, including the role of renewable energy, for Ireland. The Green Paper on Energy Policy, <i>inter alia</i>, sought feedback on the role that alternative technologies, such as solar, could play in delivering our renewable energy ambitions. Views received will be taken into consideration in the preparation of the White Paper on Energy which will be published in September.</p><p>The Renewable Electricity Feed in Tariff (REFIT) schemes are the principal means of supporting renewable electricity generators for renewable energy exported to the grid. These schemes support electricity generated from a range of renewables sources including small scale hydro, biomass and wind. Small scale renewable generation is eligible to apply for support under the REFIT schemes. </p><p>Analysis of the potential of microgeneration technologies such as small scale wind, solar (including photovoltaic) and small scale hydro, has been carried out by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). The SEAI's findings, along with responses to the recent consultation on the Green Paper on Energy Policy in Ireland, will inform future policy on the provision of any market support for microgeneration.</p><p>Given the emerging policy context and the requirements of the EU target market for electricity, my Department is beginning the process of developing a new support scheme for electricity, to be available from 2016 onwards. A key component of this will be consideration of all available technologies, their cost effectiveness and the level of support required. The scheme will be subject to State Aid clearance and the initial public consultation on the new scheme will commence shortly.</p></reply>

I understand Minister Varadkar was concerned that to proceed any further with the scheme to build the M20 would have exposed the NRA to significant costs arising from a consequent requirement to purchase the CPO'd land within a limited timeframe.  This would have had to be done without the reasonable prospect of proceeding to the construction stage quickly.</p>  <p>  Given continuing budget constraints and the need to focus on road maintenance and renewal, I do not currently plan to review this decision.</p></reply>

The RMP contains in excess of 130,000 monuments and places, the vast majority of which are privately owned.</p>  <p>  While St. Naul&rsquo;s Well is of archaeological interest, it would not be of a national significance consonant with being taken into Ministerial guardianship or being acquired by my Department whereby, it would become one of the relatively small number of national monuments in State care.  There are present in the region of 1,000 such monuments at some 700 locations around the country.</p>  <p>  As indicated in my reply to Question No. 512 of 28 April 2015, my Department carried out an inspection of the monument in December 2012 and advised the owner of the legal protection afforded to it under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994. That inspection did not establish that there had been a contravention of the provisions of section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994. </p></reply>
