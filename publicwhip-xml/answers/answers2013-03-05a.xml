Entitlement to this benefit for employees is contingent on entitlement to statutory maternity leave.  In 2012 there were 45,129 recipients under the scheme, down from 48,413 in 2011.  My Department spent &euro;303 million on maternity benefit payments in 2012, down from &euro;309 million in 2011.  Subject to the provisions of social welfare legislation, the 26-week period of core statutory maternity leave attracts a benefit payment.  Maternity leave legislation also provides an option for a woman to take an additional 16-week period of leave that does not attract a benefit payment.</p><p>  In line with the programme for government commitment to maintain headline rates of social welfare, maternity benefit remains payable at rates ranging from &euro;217.80 per week up to &euro;262 per week, derived with reference to earnings in the relevant tax year.  Budget 2013 provided that, from July of this year, maternity benefit will be subject to taxation, in line with the majority of social welfare payments and the general principle that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation.  The right to maternity leave is established under the Maternity Protection Acts, legislation which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  Any changes to current Maternity Leave provisions are a matter for that Minister to consider in the first instance &ndash; and consequential changes to Maternity Benefit would have to be considered by Government in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-05a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030500062#WRA00900"><p>Jobbridge is the National internship scheme introduced in July 2011 as a means of giving unemployed people an opportunity to secure work experience and to prove their competence to prospective employers. Under the scheme unemployed people and people with disabilities can secure work experience of either six or nine months and receive a top-up of &euro;50 onto their weekly social welfare payment.  To date over 15,000 people have benefitted from such an internship, there are currently 5,832 people working as interns and a further 2,400 internships opportunities are advertised on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The positive impact of the scheme was shown in an interim evaluation conducted on behalf of the Department by Indecon International Economic Consultants.  That interim evaluation, which I published on 5 October 2012, states that 61% of JobBridge finishers progressed into employment with either their host organisation or another employer within 5 months of finishing their internship.  The interim report found that, of all internships, 67% were with private sector host organizations, 21% were with public sector host organizations and the balance were with host organizations in the community and voluntary sector.</p><p>With regard to the specific question raised by the Deputy I wish to advise that 232 interns took up Jobbridge internships in the Civil Service, in respect of which I have provided a break-down in a table below.  A total of 3,242 placements commenced in the public sector since JobBridge came into operation.  In addition to the Civil Service, those placements have been with commercial and non-commercial semi-state organizations, the Health Service Executive, Local Authorities, and various bodies in the education sector.</p><p>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Indecon interim report found that 49.9% of former public sector interns who had completed their internships were in employment at the date of the report. I am sure the Deputy will agree that this shows that, despite the public sector recruitment moratorium, the public sector is making its contribution to empowering and up-skilling interns by giving them quality real workplace experience and enhancing their skill sets, putting them on a better trajectory back to employment.</p><p><b>Public Sector Internships as at 28 February 2013.</b></p><p><table><tr><th></th><th>Finishers</th><th>Current Interns</th><th>Total Interns</th></tr><tr><td>Civil Service</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>D/Agriculture Food and Marine</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>D/Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>D/Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</td><td>19</td><td>4</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>D/Defence</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>D/Education and Skills</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>D/Environment, Community and Local Government</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>D/Finance</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>D/Health</td><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>D/Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>D/Justice and Equality</td><td>60</td><td>23</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>D/Public Expenditure and Reform</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>D/Social Protection</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>D/Taoiseach</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>D/ Transport, Tourism and Sport</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Houses of the Oireachtas</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Office of the Attorney General</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Chief State Solicitor&#8217;s Office</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Comptroller and Auditor General&#8217;s Office</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Ombudsman&#8217;s Office</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Pensions Ombudsman&#8217;s Office</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Office of the Secretary General to the President</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue Commissioners</td><td>3</td><td>10</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Valuation Office</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>157</td><td>75</td><td>232</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-05a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030500062#WRA01100"><p>The contract for the delivery of cash payment services to customer which is currently with An Post, expires on 31 December, 2013.  In anticipation of this, the Department is undertaking two public procurement competitions for the delivery of welfare payments.  The first procurement competition is seeking over the counter cash services for social welfare customers.  This procurement was publicly advertised on 20 December 2012 with a closing date of 18 February, 2013.  The contract will be for a term of two years, which may be renewed annually, for up to six years in aggregate.  The outcome of this competition will give rise to a contract to maintain continuity in the delivery of cash payments to the Department&rsquo;s almost one million customers, whilst also putting in place arrangements to facilitate the transition from cash payments to electronic payments.</p><p>  Given that an evaluation is currently underway, Deputies will appreciate it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the procurement competition other than to say that the requirement for convenient access payment outlets and the standards of the customer service were specified in the published Tender.  The Department envisages a future where all payments to our customers will be paid electronically.  This is in line with the Government policies and objectives such as better public services, to improve the efficiency of the national payments environment and to modernise payment approaches in the economy.  These objectives are aligned to the objectives of the National Payments Plan.</p><p>  In Ireland a relatively low level, only some forty per cent, of social welfare payments are made electronically into a financial institution.  This does not compare well with other countries where   the level of social benefit paid electronically through an account is very high, in many instances close to one hundred per cent.  Given the volume of payments issued annually, any progress made by the Department towards more modern and efficient payments approaches will bring benefits to both customers and the national payments environment generally.  However, direct payment into a financial institution may not suit all our customers.  For this reason, a supplementary approach is required to provide additional scope for electronic payments.  In this context, the Department will be advertising a second procurement later this year for an ePayment solution.  This ePayment solution will supplement existing levels of payments made directly by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) into customer accounts in financial institutions.  I anticipate this procurement will be published before the end of June 2013.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-05a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030500062#WRA01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 97 together.</p><p>  The total cost of the Electricity/Gas allowance in 2013 is estimated at &euro;176m with 405,000 recipients. The total cost of the Telephone allowance in 2013 is estimated at &euro;48.1m with 395,000 recipients.  My Department meets regularly with the energy and telecommunication providers to ensure the smooth operation of the household benefits scheme and to pursue savings for the Department and better deals for our customers.</p><p>  In Budget 2013, the structure of the electricity and gas allowance was changed from a unit based allowance to a cash credit which is currently &euro;35 per month.  This rate is aligned to the best average market rate currently available. The changed structure of the allowance is designed to encourage customers to achieve better savings through greater mobility between energy suppliers who can best meet their individual energy needs.  If customers do not use their full entitlement, they will be able to carry forward that unused cash credit and draw it down as they wish and particularly if they wish to change supplier.  Prior to these changes, credit could not be carried forward by the customer to a new supplier and this acted as an impediment to customers achieving the best value for their particular energy needs and switching supplier having regard to the best deals on offer in the energy supply market.   In relation to the changes in the Budget 2013 to the telephone allowance, Eircom has responded by providing a special package - Eircom Talktime Control - for vulnerable customers with affordability issues who are also customers of the Department of Social Protection.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-05a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030500062#WRA01600"><p>The poverty reduction effect after social transfers demonstrates that the social protection system is protecting children at risk.  From 2004 to 2010 (most recent data for children), the poverty reduction effect of social transfers for children&rsquo;s at-risk-of-poverty rate increased from 43 per cent to 62 per cent.  This reflects concerted State intervention and investment in the social protection system during this period.</p><p>  Reducing and ultimately eliminating poverty is a fundamental aspiration of Irish society.  The national social target for poverty reduction provides a key reference point for government policies and offers a tangible benchmark to measure social and economic progress.  In recognition of the life-long consequences of child poverty and the damaging effects of intergenerational transmission of poverty, the Government has committed to setting a new sub-target for the reduction of child poverty.  Discussions with Government Departments on setting the target are on-going and consultation with key stakeholders will also help to inform this process.  </p><p>  The sub-target for child poverty reduction will recognise that a multi-dimensional approach is needed to meet existing commitments and to take into account the importance of income supports, services and parental access to employment.  Children in jobless households are three times more likely to experience consistent poverty than children generally.  In 2011, almost three-quarters of all those living in consistent poverty lived in jobless households.  Almost a quarter of all jobless households are living in consistent poverty.  Over a fifth of all households in Ireland are jobless, twice the European average.  The overriding objective for the Government is to increase employment, promote activation, skills training and education and thus build real and sustainable economic growth and to protect those who are most vulnerable in our society. </p><p>  My Department provides a wide range of supports to families and their children through the social protection system.  The importance of these supports is underlined by the fact that in 2013 my Department will spend over &euro;2.8 billion on various child related payments.  This accounts for around 14 per cent of expenditure on social protection of over &euro;20 billion.  The Child Benefit payment accounts for two-thirds of expenditure on child and family income supports as it is paid on a universal basis to approximately 609,000 families in respect of some 1.16 million children.  However, it is important to note that my Department also provides child income support payments to low income families through additions to the main social welfare payments by way of qualified child increases (516,000 children), the Family Income Supplement (57,000 children) and through the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (approx. 377,000 children).  I and the Government are conscious that these payments are an important source of income for all families, particularly during a time of recession and unemployment.  Furthermore, the Government is committed to tackling Ireland&rsquo;s economic crisis in a way that is fair, balanced, and which recognises the need for social solidarity.  In addressing all aspects of the public finance, it will seek to ensure that resources are allocated fairly and that less well-off families are protected in so far as possible.</p><p>  This Department also works closely with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) in relation to these issues.  Minister Fitzgerald is overseeing the new children and young people&rsquo;s policy framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State.  Minister Fitzgerald is also overseeing a new area-based approach to child poverty, building on evidence and experiences in prevention and early intervention programmes supported by her Department and Atlantic Philanthropies.  My Department prepares a Social Impact Assessment of the main taxation and welfare changes arising from annual Government Budgets.  This includes an analysis of the distributive and poverty impacts of these changes on different family types including those with children.</p></reply>

This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  It is recognised that not all unemployed people are dependent on the State for financial support and some services (for example assistance with jobsearch activities, use of online job search tools) are also available to such people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices.  Unemployed persons not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through F&Aacute;S training, but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking such training.</p></reply>

The reformed scheme brings Ireland&rsquo;s support for lone parents in line with international provisions &ndash; where there is a general movement away from long-term and passive income support.</p><p>  The changes to the OFP scheme have placed a firm focus within my Department on the supports that lone parents require, in particular after-school child care, in order to assist them to make their transition into employment.  The joint child care initiative that Minister Fitzgerald and I announced as part of Budget 2013 will provide approximately 6,000 additional after-school child care places for low-income families who gain employment and who have children of primary school age.  Officials from my Department, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (D/CYA), and the Department of Education and Skills (D/ES) are presently working out the exact parameters of the scheme, which will be launched on a phased basis during 2013, commencing with a pilot in April 2013.</p><p>  The availability of these new child care places is a positive measure for lone parents and builds on my pledge to work to address the child care needs of lone parents as part of the reforms of the OFP scheme.  The D/CYA estimates that the cost of Scandinavian style universal after-school child care provision in Ireland would be in the region of &euro;1 billion per annum.  Given the current fiscal constraints, this level of funding is not available.  The new scheme will build on the existing supports provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (D/CYA) in the child care sector.</p></reply>

Minister for Enterprise Jobs and Innovation on 22 February 2013, outlines 333 actions to be implemented before 31st December 2013 by 16 Departments and 46 agencies.  These actions will continue to improve supports for job-creating businesses and remove the barriers to employment-creation across the economy.  Furthermore, it also outlines 7 Disruptive Reforms; these high impact measures with ambitious deadlines are to be implemented in partnership with senior industry figures.  These were selected because of their potential to have an immediate effect on job-creation.</p><p>  One such reform is the JobsPlus scheme which will replace the existing PRSI exemption and the Revenue Job assist schemes.  The objective of the new JobsPlus scheme is to provide a simple, easily understood and attractive scheme that will encourage employers to recruit from the cohort of the long term unemployed.  The incentive will be payable over a two year period and set at two levels in order to bias the incentive in favour of the more long term unemployed:</p><p> - In respect of recruits unemployed for more than 12 months but less than 24 months:  &euro;7,500,</p><p> - In respect of recruits unemployed for more than 24 months: &euro;10,000. </p><p>  The operational details of the scheme are at the design stage with a proposed launch date of quarter three 2013.  The existing schemes will remain in existence in the interim.</p></reply>

State pension reform is essential to ensure sustainability and to address the challenges of changing demographics including increasing life expectancy.  The abolition of SPT removes the retirement condition which acts as an incentive to leave the workforce and has been widely criticised as a barrier to older people remaining in employment.  Currently, a person who retires from work on reaching age 65 and who does not have sufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for SPT may apply for another social welfare payment.  This will remain the case when SPT is abolished in 2014.  Legislation provides that, subject to having paid 156 or more qualifying contributions and satisfying the general scheme conditions, a person whose job seekers benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.  </p><p>  In relation to the employment relationship, responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  However, it is recognised that the range of policy areas which influence working and retirement decisions fall within the remit of a range of departments and requires a co-ordinated responses if labour market participation rates and effective retirement ages of older workers are to improve.  In this regard, an Interdepartmental Working and Retirement Group is currently considering cross departmental policy issues that may support longer working and thereby improve the sustainability and adequacy of pensions systems.  This Group, which includes the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is considering the broad range of issues impacting on the labour market participation of older workers and will prepare preliminary proposals detailing measures which may encourage participation and retention in the labour market of older workers.</p></reply>

It also aims to increase engagement and incentivise employers to provide more jobs for people who are unemployed.    INTREO is the new integrated employment activation and supports service model delivering on the &lsquo;Pathways to Work&rsquo; policy.  The first ten Intreo offices have now opened and service performance has improved in all of these offices with claim processing times and waiting times for new claimants for group interviews and follow up one-to-one interviews reduced.</p><p>  The most significant elements of the Pathways to Work approach are:  i) Profiling of clients to inform the approach taken to activation, and in particular to target those who are most likely to become long-term unemployed and to provide appropriate interventions at the earliest possible stage; ii) Early engagement with clients through group engagement sessions; iii) One to one interviews with case managers; iv) The agreement of a personal progression plan between the client and the Department setting how the steps to be taken by the client, with the support of the Department, in order to re-enter employment; v) The signing of a social contract &ndash; known as a Record of Mutual Commitments &ndash; between the Department and the client.  This sets out the client&rsquo;s rights with regard to the type and quality of services to be provided by the Department but also sets out the client&rsquo;s responsibility to engage with these services and actively seek employment.</p><p>  Progress under each of these headings is as follows: (a) The profiling of all new claimants is now operational in all DSP offices.  Under the Pathways to Work programme, the Department had profiled 53,800 new claimants to the end of 2012.; (b) 68,600 clients had participated in group engagements by the end of December 2012; (c)158,000 one-to-one initial interviews were conducted by the end of December; in addition a further 134,000 follow-up meetings were held by the end of 2012; (d) all new clients in Intreo offices now sign the social contract.</p><p>  Enhanced engagement with employers at local level is also part of the Intreo process and this is progressing well.  A dedicated Employer Engagement Unit has been established and an Employer Engagement Manager is available in each region to support and advise employers at each stage of the employment process including the advertisement of opportunities and sourcing potential candidates from the Live Register. During Autumn 2012, a series of employer briefings were held nationwide to provide employers with practical advice and assistance on the full range of recruitment supports available from the Department.  Partly as a result of these engagements with employers, the Department developed the JobsPlus scheme, announced as part of the Action Plan for Jobs, to incentivise employers to recruit long term unemployed people from the Live Register.  It is intended to launch this scheme for availability from July 2013.</p><p>  In November 2012, following a procurement process, the Department engaged the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion London (CESIL) to provide expert advice with regard to the options for a contracted  employment services model to supplement the Department&rsquo;s own in-house services.  The Department expects to receive CESIL&rsquo;s final report shortly and will, at that stage, finalise its own proposals as to what type of contracting model, if any, should be submitted for consideration by Government.</p></reply>

In relation to the duration for which illness benefit is payable, an OECD review entitled &ldquo;Sickness, Disability and Work: Breaking the Barriers&rdquo; noted that paying illness or sickness benefit without a time limitation was very unusual across the OECD, and pointed to the risk that people in such circumstances would never return to the labour market.  Against that background, the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2008 provided that entitlement to illness benefit would be limited to two years (or 624 days) duration for claims arising after the 5 January, 2009. However, a person who has paid between 104 and 259 contributions at an appropriate class, since entering employment, is entitled to receive payment of Illness Benefit for a maximum of one year (or 312 days) in any one period of interruption of employment. </p><p>  I should point out that people who are unable to work long-term because of a disability or a medical condition, and who have exhausted entitlement to this short-term payment, may apply for continued income support through the Invalidity Pension or Disability Allowance schemes. Should they not qualify for either of these schemes they have also recourse to apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance.</p></reply>

In that regard, the Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  There were 32,558 cases finalised in 2012; there is a major programme of process redesign and modernisation currently underway in relation to many scheme areas which will reduce backlogs and will also reduce the time taken for the Department to respond to requests from the SWAO for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>  These measures will further reduce the waiting time for appellants.

The table shows the number of rent supplement recipients at end 2011 and 2012.</p><p>Revised rent limits are in place since January 2012 and are applicable to all new rent supplement tenancies from this date and existing tenancies on review. It is essential that State support for rents are kept under review and do not distort the market in a way that could increase rent prices for others, such as low paid workers and students. The central aim is to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide access to all housing in all areas.  Approximately 48,700 rent supplement claims were awarded during 2012, showing that accommodation can be secured within the new limits.</p><p>On-going analysis shows that for Dublin there are properties available within the maximum rent limits for rent supplement recipients. Over 32,500 persons in receipt of rent supplement reside in Dublin. Based on current analysis, there is accommodation available within the Fingal rent limits for both two and three bedroom properties. For the Kildare region, there are over 4,300 cases in receipt of rent supplement, with over 1,000 of these in the North Kildare area. The number of rental properties available in North Kildare is somewhat lower than the numbers available in the rest of the county and therefore impacts on the number of accommodation units available for rent supplement. Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.</p><p>Traditionally, the Bray area was permitted the use of the County Dublin rent limits. It was noted during analysis for the June 2010 Rent Limit Review that Dublin limits for the Bray area had become a significant distorting influence for the local market. It was concluded that rents were out of line with the natural supply and demand points expected for the Bray area.  The June 2010 Rent Limit Review broke the link between Bray and County Dublin maximum limits and accordingly it was decided that the Bray area was to be excluded with separate limits set for this area which are lower than the Dublin limits with the aim of returning the local rental market to a more natural price level.</p><p>The report referred to by the Deputy shows that rents have increased in  Dublin, Cork and Galway cities with rental asking rates falling in other cities and rural areas. Officials in the Department continue to examine the impact of the rent limits on those who claim rent supplement.  The next review of rent limits is being undertaken before June 2013 and any changes to the existing limits will be considered as part of this process.  Discussions regarding the use of National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) properties for social housing is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>Number of rent supplement recipients</p><p><table><tr><th>End 2011</th><th><div>96,803</div></th></tr><tr><td>End 2012</td><td><div>87,684</div></td></tr><tr><td>22/02/2013</td><td><div>86,706</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Intreo is a single point of contact for all employment and income supports.  It is designed to provide a more streamlined approach for jobseekers. </p><p>  In parallel with the development of an integrated service for jobseekers, the Department is increasing its engagement with employers.  A dedicated employer engagement Unit has been established and employer engagement teams are available in each local Division to support and advise employers at each stage of the employment process including the advertisement of job opportunities and sourcing potential candidates from the live register.  These teams also assist the employer in accessing the full range of services and incentives, such as the Employer PRSI Job Incentive Scheme and Revenue Job Assist, available to them when they recruit from the live register.  A dedicated employer call-centre is also operated from Edenderry in Offaly, the staff at this call-centre assist employers in using the Department&rsquo;s online vacancy/recruitment service &ndash; jobsireland.ie.  This is one of the most used recruitment websites in the country.</p><p>  In addition, in order to increase employer awareness of the services and supports available to them, the Department hosted a series of seven employer road-shows attended by c 2,000 employer representatives in Limerick, Sligo, Galway, Athlone, Waterford, Cork and Dublin at the end of 2012.  Partly as a consequence of feedback received at these events, the Department developed the new JobsPlus scheme to replace the PRSI Job Incentive and the Revenue Tax Assist schemes.  This new scheme will be put into operation later this year.  An Employer Information Pack has also been developed which provides information to employers on these supports and services and is available through the Department&rsquo;s website www.welfare.ie   so employers can have this information at their fingertips.</p></reply>

Under the scheme, an eligible employee is entitled to two weeks&rsquo; pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to a gross weekly salary ceiling of &euro;600.</p><p>  It is the employer&rsquo;s responsibility to pay statutory redundancy payments in the first instance.   Where an employer can prove to the satisfaction of the Department that it is unable to pay statutory redundancy to its eligible employees the Department will make lump sum payments directly to those employees.  Such payments raise a debt against the employer which the Department will seek to recover.  Lump sum payments made by the Department are from the Social Insurance Fund.</p><p>  In order to be eligible for a statutory redundancy payment, an employee must: have at least two years continuous service; be in employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts; be over the age of 16; and have been made redundant as a result of a genuine redundancy situation meaning that the job no longer exists and he/she is not replaced.  These conditions are intended to ensure that an employee has had a reasonable attachment to employment before qualifying for a statutory redundancy payment.</p></reply>

In addition it helps long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine. Community and voluntary organisations sponsor local/community projects that satisfy two essential criteria - that they respond to an identified community need, and that they provide worthwhile work and training opportunities for participants.    T&uacute;s is a scheme targeted at those with in excess of one year association with the Live Register that aims to provide short-term, quality work opportunities for those who are unemployed while also assisting in providing certain services of benefit to communities. Participants are randomly selected from the Live Register by the Department and sanctions apply to those who do not avail of offer of placements. While the scheme aims to contribute to the work readiness of the long-term unemployed, it also contributes to the management of the Live Register in highlighting those who are unemployed but may not be actively seeking work.

There were various recommendations for the reform of the two schemes to aid in the activation process such as refocusing CE on shorter-term interventions and progression (in line with Pathways to Work) and using the CE exit planning model for persons exiting T&uacute;s.  I am aware of overlap in the allocation of T&uacute;s places and CE places, in many cases sponsoring organisations accommodate both clients very well. The reforms outlined in the above report and the subsequent consultation and feedback from stakeholders will be of assistance in the re-alignment of Employment Programmes including CE and T&uacute;s within this Department.</p></reply>

From 3 May 2012, the age of the youngest child is being reduced on a phased basis and will be 7 from 2014 for individuals who first claimed OFP since May of last year and from 2015 for all other OFP recipients.   Originally, this year&rsquo;s reduction in the maximum age limit of the youngest child for receipt of the OFP was set to occur from January.  However, Budget 2013 contains a measure to provide 6,000 additional after-school child care places to low-income families who avail of employment opportunities.  It is intended to launch an initial pilot of this scheme in April with the remainder of the places coming on stream later in the year.  The commencement date of the age changes to the OFP scheme has, therefore, been deferred from January 2013, to July 2013.  As such, recipients from the three OFP claim date cohorts will now lose their entitlement to their payment as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th></th><th colspan="4"><div>Age threshold reduces to:</div></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>From 3 May, 2012</td><td>From 4 July, 2013</td><td>From 3 July, 2014</td><td>From 2 July, 2015</td></tr><tr><td>If OFP payment commenced before<br />27 April, 2011</td><td>18</td><td>17</td><td>16</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>If OFP payment commenced between<br />27 April, 2011, and 2 May, 2012<br /></td><td>14</td><td>12</td><td>10</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>If OFP payment commenced on or<br />after 3 May, 2012 </td><td>12</td><td>10</td><td>7</td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>The age changes will affect approximately 8,000 recipients in July 2013.</p></reply>

The key elements of this package are to add an additional 2,500 places to JobBridge; 2,000 places on community employment; 2,500 to T&uacute;s &ndash; the community work placement initiative - and the development of a new initiative with local authorities to provide 3,000 opportunities in 2013.  This is in line with the commitments set out in the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.  I have recently made announcements in respect to the roll-out of new community employment and T&uacute;s placements. The additional 2,000 places allocated to the CE Programme are prioritised for schemes and organisations who are involved in the delivery of community childcare services, social and healthcare services for people with a disability. This is in order to support the provision of these services and offer training qualifications and work experience to CE participants. An allocation of 500 additional places will be reserved for childcare support and 500 places for social and health related services.   The design of the local authority initiative and the nature of work to be undertaken will require consultation with a range of stakeholders, including those bodies responsible for the delivery of other schemes funded by the Department of Social Protection.  Development work on this new initiative has commenced with the local authorities.  A timetable for the roll-out of a number of pilot projects to inform the design of the scheme is currently being finalised.</p><p>  The new initiative is likely to have some of the characteristics of community employment, as do all work placement programmes.  However, the Deputy should note that community employment is designed with a work placement and training element to progress a person back to the open labour market or on to more advanced development opportunities.  Work placements are primarily hosted by community, voluntary and not-for-profit sponsors to support service delivery.  This new initiative is being developed solely with local authorities to provide work placement opportunities for those on the live register for prolonged periods.  It will provide opportunities for maintaining the skills and work readiness.  The training element will mainly relate to on-the-job skills.  A timetable for the roll-out of a number of pilot projects to inform the design of the scheme is currently being finalised.</p></reply>

The Exchequer is the residual financier of the Fund and such subventions were the norm for over 40 years.  For example, in 1967, the State contribution was 38% of SIF expenditure and almost 29% in 1985.   From 1997 to 2007 inclusive, social insurance income exceeded Fund expenditure.  In 2008, the current operating balance of the SIF moved into deficit with expenditure exceeding income by &#8364;255m.  This deficit accelerated in 2009 when it reached &#8364;2.49 billion and further rose to &#8364;2.75 billion in 2010.  In addition, the surplus carried forward from previous years was eliminated during 2010, giving rise to the need for Exchequer subvention for the first time since 1996.</p><p>  In total, the operating deficit of the Fund over the period 2008 to 2011, inclusive, was very close to &#8364;7 billion.  The Provisional Outturn for 2012 provides for a deficit of nearly &#8364;2.09<font color="#FF0000"> </font>billion in 2012.  Significant exchequer subvention will be required to meet ongoing expenditure requirements in the absence of reductions in expenditure levels or increases in PRSI income.  I am most concerned about the deficit in the SIF and one of my key goals is to reform the system of social protection and to put it on a sounder financial footing for the future.  In the context of the SIF, Budget 2011 introduced a number of changes to the PRSI system and, in Budget 2012, my colleague the Minister for Finance announced a further widening of the PRSI base from 2013 to cover rental, investment and other forms of income from 2013.</p><p>  Budget 2013 introduced significant changes to the PRSI system.  The Employee&#8217;s PRSI-Free Allowance of &#8364;127 per week (for those paying PRSI Class A, E and H) and &#8364;26 per week (for those paying PRSI Class B, C and D) was abolished with effect from 1st January 2013.<b></b>The minimum annual PRSI contribution for people with annual self-employed income over &#8364;5,000 was increased from &#8364;253 per annum to &#8364;500 per annum.  Employees who pay PRSI at Classes B, C and D (a minority of the civil and public sector) were exempt from PRSI in respect of self-employed earned income (from a profession or trade) and any other unearned income e.g. rental income.  This exemption was abolished in Budget 2013.  All such income is now liable to PRSI at the rate of 4% with effect from 1 January 2013 without gaining entitlement to social insurance benefits.  This measure is estimated to yield &#8364;12m additional income for the Social Insurance Fund in a full year.</p><p>  In 2014, it is proposed to abolish the exemption from PRSI applying to self-employed unearned income of employees (all Classes) and those with occupational pensions, which is available where they have <i>unearned</i> income only.  The payment of PRSI at 4% on this unearned income will not give entitlement to social insurance benefits.  This measure is estimated to yield &#8364;20m additional income for the Social Insurance Fund in a full year. </p><p>  In addition, I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare in 2011 in line with the commitment made in the Programme for Government.  The Group will, inter alia, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons while the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund will inform both short to medium term and long term policy development in relation to the social insurance system generally.  Any proposals to address the sustainability of the Fund will have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

It is targeted at individuals who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments (Jobseekers Allowance/Jobseekers Benefit/One Parent Family Payment/Disability Allowance) or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months (78 Days).   The JobBridge scheme has made significant progress since it came into operation. 14,888 internships have commenced as at 21 February 2013 with 5,790 participants on an internship and 2,241 internship opportunities advertised on  as of that date</p><p>  With regard to progression outcomes, the interim evaluation of JobBridge conducted by Indecon International Economic Consultants (published on 5 October, 2012) states that 61% of JobBridge finishers progressed into employment with either their host organisation or another employer within 5 months of finishing their internship.  The majority of these had gone on to employment with their host organisations while the others took the skills and experiences that they gained during their internship to gain employment in the wider labour market.  In total Indecon found that 40.3% of people who had completed their internship  were employed either in their host organisation or in another organisation from the same industry sector.  The balance of interns then in employment were employed in other sectors.  Empowering an intern to look with confidence at the wider labour market with enhanced employment opportunities is one of the key successes of the scheme.  </p><p>  Satisfaction rates for JobBridge among employers and jobseekers remains high with surveys conducted as part of the interim evaluation by Indecon finding that 89.3% of interns felt JobBridge had given them new skills and improved their chances of gaining employment and 96% of host organisations indicating that they would recommend JobBridge to other employers.</p><p>  Further information on outcomes will be ascertained in the final evaluation report. It is anticipated that this report will be available in the coming weeks. This evaluation will assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge scheme, it will provide details of the nature of the work experience of the participants; a measurement of the relevance of that experience to the labour market, analysis of age categories and further findings concerning progression into employment. It will also present recommendations on how the scheme might be improved and it is at that stage that further consideration will be given to amending the terms and conditions of the scheme.</p></reply>

Whilst it is a Government objective, as part of its public service reform programme, to reduce the numbers working in the public service, the requirement to reduce staffing levels within the Department has been &lsquo;backloaded&rsquo; over the period of the reform programme in recognition of the nature of the services provided by the Department and the scale of demand for such services. In this regard, the Department has been a significant beneficiary of the redeployment system within the public services over the last five years with over 1,000 staff redeployed from other Departments and public service agencies to fill critical vacancies and ensure continued provision of services.   The Department has sought to address the increased demand for services in a number of ways including the re-engineering of business processes, increased use of automation and systems solutions, rationalisation of services and, more recently, the integration of processes with a view to ensuring improved services to customers. Through these approaches, very significant progress has been made in addressing backlogs and improving processing times across the range of scheme areas operated by the Department.</p><p>  Operating within the overall employment control framework, the Department has directed additional resources towards the SWAO in recognition of the significant increase in demand for the services of that office in recent years.  Since January 2011 the numbers of Appeals Officers in the SWAO has increased from 21 to 43.  </p><p>  The number of appeals submitted to the SWAO has increased dramatically since 2008 with the number of receipts doubling from an average of 15,000 a year to 35,484 in 2012.  With improved processes within the SWAO, the number of cases finalised has risen from an average of 13,500 to 32,558 in 2012.  Processing times of appeals have reduced by 10.3 weeks overall in 2012 with respect to 2011.</p><p>  Of course, further improvement is needed.   In that regard: the Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012, there were 32,558 cases finalised in 2012; and the programme of process redesign and modernisation currently underway in relation to many scheme areas will reduce remaining backlogs and will also reduce the time taken for the Department to respond to requests from the SWAO for submissions in relation to appeals.</p></reply>

While the host organisation gains from the work, skills and talents of the intern, a mutual benefit exists whereby the intern also receives real workplace experience and the opportunity to demonstrate their commitment, skills and talents to a potential employer.  In addition, the host organisation is required by the conditions of the JobBridge scheme to make a significant resource commitment to the intern by appointing a mentor and ensuring that the intern receives experience and training of a high quality from their internship.  This commitment by the host organisation is subject to on-going monitoring by the Department.</p><p>  The question as to whether a host organization should make a financial contribution to the weekly payments made to interns will be considered by the Department when it receives the final evaluation report from Indecon.

The NESC provides guidance to Government on strategic issues for Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social development. Since coming into office on 9 March 2011, I have made appointments to the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) as set out in the table beneath.  The appointments are made in accordance with the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006 and S.I. No. 603 of 2010, National Economic and Social Council (Alteration of Composition) Order 2010.</p><p>I appoint members specifically on the basis of nominations from business and employer interests, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, farming and agricultural interests, the community and voluntary sector and the environmental sector.  I may also appoint up to six public servants of whom at least one shall represent the Taoiseach and one shall represent the Minister for Finance.  These appointments represent relevant Departments to ensure NESC's work is integrated with Government policy-making.  I also appointed eight independent members to the NESC in 2011, in most cases from the academic sector.  These appointments were made following careful consideration of the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise relevant to the functions of the Council as required by the legislation.</p><p>The Government has put new arrangements in place for the making of appointments to State boards.  In the particular case of the NESC, I should emphasise that most of the members of NESC are appointed on the basis of nominations received from representative organisations.  Historically, the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson posts are filled from my Department at Secretary General and Assistant Secretary level.</p><p>I am satisfied that the other appointments were appropriate, bearing in mind the key strategic role of the NESC.  However the option of utilising the new process for expressions of public interest will be considered when the next round of appointments of independent members to the NESC arises.</p><p><b>Table 1: Details of appointments made by the Taoiseach to NESC since 9 March 2011 are set out in the following table. </b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Name </div></th><th><div>Organisation </div></th><th><div>Date of <br />Appointment </div></th></tr><tr><td>Mr. Martin Fraser, Chairperson of NESC</td><td>Secretary General, Department of the Taoiseach </td><td><div>August 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. John Shaw, Deputy Chairperson of NESC</td><td>Assistant Secretary, Department of the Taoiseach </td><td><div>January 2012</div></td></tr><tr><td>Prof. Edgar Morgenroth</td><td>Associate Research Professor, Economic and Social Research Institute </td><td><div>June 2011<br /><br /><br /><br /></div><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Prof. John McHale </td><td>Economist, National University of Ireland, Galway </td><td><div>June 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Prof. Mary Daly</td><td>Professor of Sociology and Social Policy, Senior Research Fellow of Green Templeton College, Department of Social Policy and Intervention, University of Oxford</td><td><div>June 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Prof. Anna Davis</td><td>Department of Geography, Trinity College Dublin</td><td><div>June 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Prof. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Riain</td><td>Department of Sociology, National University of Ireland, Maynooth</td><td><div>June 2011<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Michael O&#8217;Sullivan</td><td>Head of Portfolio Strategy and Thematic Research, Credit Suisse, London</td><td><div>June 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Ms. Mary Walsh </td><td>Chartered Accountant</td><td><div>June 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Michelle Norris</td><td>Senior Lecturer, School of Applied Social Science, University College Dublin.</td><td><div>July 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Shay Cody</td><td>IMPACT</td><td><div>September 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. John Murphy </td><td>Secretary General, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</td><td><div>November 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; </td><td>Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills</td><td><div>February 2012<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. John Moran</td><td>Secretary General, Department of Finance</td><td><div>March 2012</div></td></tr></table></p><p>An Assistant Secretary from my Department was appointed to the National Statistics Board (NSB) on 13 September 2012.

Both Houses of the Oireachtas have previously and unanimously urged the British Government to allow access to documents relevant to these events.  Many Deputies have also raised this issue directly with their counterparts at Westminster and will continue to do so.

I am glad that Dr. Al Khatib and his colleagues ultimately chose to maintain their close engagement with the international community in support of concerted efforts to achieve the vital goal of a peaceful political solution to the Syrian crisis. The Foreign Affairs Council on 18 February, which I attended, made clear the EU&rsquo;s continuing strong support for the Coalition.   It also reaffirmed, at Ireland&rsquo;s suggestion, its invitation to the Coalition to work even more closely with the joint UN/Arab League mission of Special Envoy Brahimi in charting a peaceful way out of the current conflict. </p><p>  I also welcome Dr Al Khatib&rsquo;s recent indication of readiness to enter into dialogue with the Syrian regime.   I hope that this may prove to be a catalyst in achieving the beginning of a genuine political process and political transition within Syria.  Deputies will be aware that I have formally invited Dr. Al Khatib to travel to Dublin at a mutually convenient time to discuss the Coalition&rsquo;s vision for a new, post-Assad Syria. Our Embassy in Cairo continues to be in contact with Dr. Al Khatib and the SNC, including in relation to identifying a suitable opportunity for him to travel to Ireland.</p></reply>

Last year bilateral trade in goods with Cuba reached close to &euro;1.2 million, making Cuba Ireland&rsquo;s 155th largest trading partner.  I understand that a small number of Irish people are exploring business opportunities in Cuba and that several thousand Irish tourists visit Cuba each year.  I hope to see trade, investment and tourism links between our two countries increase in the period ahead.  </p><p>  We also engage in activity in other areas with a view to enhancing our bilateral engagement.  The Irish Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited on a concurrent basis to Cuba, has organised in recent years an Irish cultural week. This will be continued in 2013 also and will comprise, it is envisaged, a film series, a literary seminar in cooperation with the University of Havana, and musical events. In addition, the Embassy participates in a number of other events, including Celtfest Cuba, a festival of Celtic music and dance.  There have also been developments at the level of the EU&rsquo;s relations with Cuba.  In November 2012, the Foreign Affairs Council agreed that the process of elaborating negotiating directives for a bilateral agreement with Cuba will begin within the framework of the EU&rsquo;s Common Position.</p></reply>

The Electoral ( Amendment ) ( Political Funding ) Act 2012 provided for changes to the Electoral Act, 1997 and imposed new limits for donations. Donations to individual s exceeding &#8364;600 must be declared and donations exceeding &#8364;1,000 in any one year may not be accepted. Political party donations greater than &#8364;1,500 must be declared and donations greater than &#8364;2,500 in any one year may not be accepted. These limits, in themselves, should act to deter any attempts by wealthy individuals to influence political activity.   The Office of the Revenue Commissioners have provide me with the following information in relation to Revenue issues raised in the recommendations of the Moriarty Tribunal.</p><p>  Recommendation: Independence of the Revenue Commissioners</p><p>  Section 101 of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 has placed on a statutory basis the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise by the Commissioners of their statutory functions under the various taxation and customs enactments. This has given effect to the recommendation of the Report of the Tribunal into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters (that is, the report of Mr. Justice Moriarty), that the principle or convention of the independence of the Revenue Commissioners be placed on the more robust status of a legislative provision.</p><p>  Recommendation: Representations to Revenue by Office holders</p><p>  In relation to this proposal I as Minister for Finance remain of the view that this recommendation could best be considered in the context of the Government&#8217;s overall approach to political and parliamentary reform. Representations are a valid part of the political process. The Government may wish to consider whether this recommendation should be confined to Revenue, or to Office holders, or whether the Commissioners decision to publish data on the volume of representations made by each Deputy is an adequate response.</p><p>  Recommendation: Transmission to other agencies of information obtained by Revenue under bilateral agreements.<b></b></p><p>  This recommendation has been considered. These agreements are important for Irish business, for the transparency of the Irish taxation system, and for tax administration in relation to businesses and individuals which operate across 2 or more jurisdictions.  Ireland&#8217;s bilateral agreements comprise double taxation conventions and tax information exchange agreements. (TIEAs) Ireland&#8217;s agreements are based on OECD models which are considered to be best practice and which do not provide for such a protocol.  While they provide for various forms of information exchange, they contain a very strong taxpayer confidentiality provisions, and restrict the use of the information to tax assessment and collection purposes.</p><p>  Expanding Irelands Tax Treaty and TIEA Network has been a strategic objective which Revenue has successfully pursued and such agreements can only be made if the other State agrees. If opportunities arise in the future, the Commissioners will consider the matter further. </p></reply>

I am aware that Revenue attaches a high priority to combating tobacco smuggling and the illegal sale of tobacco products and has adopted a comprehensive strategy, underpinned by annual action plans, in this regard. Revenue&rsquo;s Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013), is published on www.revenue.ie. </p><p>  A key action under the 2011-2013 Strategy is, in partnership with other Government agencies, to focus on reducing demand for contraband tobacco through educating the public on the negative aspects of contraband i.e. tax loss, criminality and health risks. Revenue optimises media coverage for prosecutions, significant seizures and enforcement activities. Where large seizures are made, Revenue takes the opportunity to encourage members of the public to provide information to Revenue on the sale of illicit tobacco products.</p><p>  The confidential free phone tobacco smuggling number operated by Revenue is promoted through its website. The phone number is included in press releases relating to cigarette and tobacco seizures and is also promoted by Revenue in radio and television interviews concerning the illicit tobacco trade and on relevant trade websites and in trade publications.  Revenue is happy to accept the assistance of the public through the provision of information in the fight against the illicit tobacco trade. 	</p></reply>

While there is no specific exemption from the Local Property Tax (LPT) for houses built for wheelchair users, the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013 contains certain provisions that, if enacted, may be relevant, depending on the circumstances involved.  Section 2 of the Bill provides an exemption from LPT for a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individual as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or a court, or where a trust has been established, specifically for the benefit of such individuals.  In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption will only apply where the cost of the adaptations exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before it is adapted.  The exemption ends if the property is sold and the incapacitated individual no longer occupies it as his or her sole or main residence. </p><p>  Alternatively, section 6 of the Bill provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided by a local authority. The reduction is limited to the lesser of the market value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme. The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property that has been adapted, unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property.  Furthermore, the impact of specific adaptations on a property can be to decrease the value which may in turn impact on the LPT liability.

Combating this criminality is, therefore, a key priority for them.  Revenue employs a multi-faceted strategy to detect and intercept illicit tobacco products, at point of importation and within the country, and to identify and prosecute those involved in the illegal trade. Considerable success has been achieved in this work, with the seizure of 95.6 million cigarettes and 5,276 kilograms of tobacco during 2012. There were 132 convictions for tobacco smuggling or for the sale of illicit tobacco products in the course of the year.</p><p>  The main form of criminality in the fuel sector is the laundering of marked gas oil and the sale of the laundered product as auto-fuel, and Revenue acts against this illegal activity at all stages of the fuel supply chain. 11 oil laundries were detected during 2012, and 199,000 litres of fuel were seized in the course of those operations. A further 914,000 litres of illicit fuel were seized, the greater part from retail outlets or in the course of delivery to such outlets. In addition, 57 retail outlets were closed during the year, for trading without a licence or for breach of licence conditions.</p><p>  To facilitate enhanced control and supervision of the fuel supply chain, licensing requirements were introduced, from 1 October 2012, for persons dealing in marked fuels. As well as these licensing changes, a requirement is now in place for all fuel traders to make monthly returns to Revenue, electronically, of their fuel transactions. This will facilitate Revenue in detecting unusual or anomalous patterns of activity. Work is proceeding also, in close cooperation with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs, on obtaining an improved fuel marker.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners will continue their extensive work against the illegal fuel and tobacco trades and, in addition to ongoing enforcement activities, will continue to develop innovative ways of combating those responsible for them. This work will continue to include cooperation with representatives of the legitimate trade. As part of this process, the Commissioners would be pleased to discuss areas of possible cooperation with RGDATA, and will invite them to join the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group &ndash; a forum for the exchange of views on measures to combat the hidden economy between the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection (DSP), the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation and the National Employment Rights Agency (NERA) and representative bodies of employers, unions and industry.</p></reply>

This reports nominal SMP Irish bond holdings of &euro;14.2bn at 31 December 2012, valued by the ECB on an amortised cost basis at &euro;13.6bn.   However, a detailed breakdown of the particular bonds, and thus their coupons or maturity dates or the dates of acquisition has not been published by the ECB. It is therefore not possible to outline the interest which will accrue to the ECB in relation to these holdings. It is also not possible to outline the profits, if any, made by the ECB from the sale of any Irish Bonds in the past.  The ECB cannot legally return profits on the Eurosystem&rsquo;s holdings of a country&rsquo;s securities acquired under the SMP to the government of the country concerned. Rather these profits are recycled to all national central banks via their capital contribution keys &ndash; these are normally then transferred to governments as part of the NCBs&rsquo; surplus income.</p></reply>

There are standard rules which apply to the distribution of the assets of companies in liquidation and it would not be appropriate for me to interfere with these rules.  However the State does intervene to ensure that statutory redundancy is available through the Social Insurance Fund and that arrears of pay, sick pay, holiday pay or pay in lieu of statutory notice (limited to EUR600 per week up to a maximum of eight weeks) are payable from the Insolvency Payments Scheme.  The Minister for Social Protection will rank as a preferential creditor of IBRC in respect of any payments made to employees of IBRC from the Social Insurance Fund or the Insolvency Payments Scheme.  Any action taken by the Minister which might divert the assets from IBRC creditors to employees could be challenged in the Courts.</p><p>  The special liquidators were promptly in contact with staff on Thursday 7th February and, unlike in other liquidations, the majority of employees have now been re-hired by the special liquidators, for a minimum period of 3 months, to provide some level of assurance and to ensure an orderly wind-down of the business. In addition, some staff may, in time, be re-hired by NAMA or other purchasers of the assets. This should provide some reassurance to employees.</p></reply>

The existing SFT regime is designed to cater for relatively small numbers of individuals. The current structure and operation of the regime, which applies across all pension arrangements in the private and public sectors, would not effectively or efficiently cope with an expected minimum ten-fold increase in the numbers of individuals who would be affected by the Budget decision. A number of significant and fundamental changes to the current SFT regime may be required in order to deliver on the decision announced in the Budget. Alternatives to the use of the SFT regime to deliver on the Government&rsquo;s commitment will also be explored and consultations will be required with, among others, various Departments and this will take time.  For these reasons, I am not in a position to accede to the request in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</p></reply>

These forecasts were predicated on a number of technical assumptions, which were outlined at the time. Regarding the euro-sterling exchange rate, the technical assumption (which is a standard international approach) was that the rate would remain unchanged at levels which prevailed at the time, implying an average rate of stg &pound;0.81 during 2013. However, since the beginning of the year there has been a marked appreciation of the euro against sterling, with the bilateral rate appreciating by approximately 6 per cent between the beginning of January and the end of February.</p><p>  Exports to the UK represent about a fifth of total exports and therefore Irish exporters will naturally be sensitive to exchange rate developments. However, the substantial and continuing progress made in improving our competitiveness over recent years should provide some buffer in this regard. For example, the European Commission in its most recent forecast projects growth in wages of 0.3 per cent in Ireland and 2.7 per cent in the UK this year. That is not to downplay the significance of the euro-sterling bilateral rate, especially for the indigenous exporting sector, and I am conscious of this.</p><p>  I would also point out that a large share of Irish consumer goods are sourced from the UK, so that the recent appreciation of the euro-sterling bilateral rate should help to protect real income by depressing import prices.  Finally, I would highlight the fact that my Department will publish revised forecasts in April, taking into account all relevant information. </p></reply>

All packs of cigarettes that are offered for sale in the State are required to carry a tax stamp containing a range of sophisticated security features designed to prevent counterfeiting; a new and more secure stamp was introduced last year.

Chaired by Revenue, it is a multilateral Group comprising of representatives of IBEC, SFA, CIF, ICTU and SIPTU, Government agencies, Department of Social Protection, Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation and the National Employment Rights Agency.   Its terms of reference are:-</p><p>  &ldquo;To provide a forum for the exchange of views on the effectiveness of measures introduced in combating the hidden economy between the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection (DSP), the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation and the National Employment Rights Agency (NERA) and representative bodies of employers, unions and industry. The group is to prepare a brief report on its activities each year for presentation to the Department of an Taoiseach&quot;.</p><p>  The group met 3/4 times a year between 1990 and 2011 and contributed to the establishment of multi-agency investigation units, producing a &quot;Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals&quot;, and in 2007 sponsored legislation which provided for the exchange of employment information on the earned income of individuals between the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners, the first steps into information exchange. The &lsquo;Code of Practice&rsquo; has been used extensively by all of the above-mentioned Government Agencies to combat numerous cases of unregistered and misclassified workers since its introduction in December 2007.</p><p>  Under its terms of reference, the Group prepares a written annual report that is presented to the Department of the Taoiseach.  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in 2011 the Group reviewed its own effectiveness and ability to deliver, in accordance with its terms of reference, and reached the conclusion that its purpose would be better served by operating at a more local level, utilising resources more familiar with the difficulties that were being experienced by SMEs and unions locally and using local Government agency resources to arrive at workable solutions.</p><p>  In November 2011, the full HEMG devolved its terms of reference to four regionally based Liaison Groups, namely the Border Midlands West, Dublin, East &amp; South East and South West Hidden Economy Monitoring Liaison Groups, with a requirement that all groups meet regularly and provide reports as required to the HEMG. The constituent members of the Regional Liaison Groups nominated were locally based members of the original attendee representative bodies and agencies, with the meetings organised and chaired by Revenue officials.  The four Regional Liaison Groups met a total of 11 times during 2012.  The 2012 report of the HEMG is currently being prepared.</p><p>  On 30 January 2013 the full HEMG met to review the effectiveness of the first year of operations of the Regional Liaison Groups and to see what supports could be put in place to achieve and sustain improved outcomes from the work of the Groups.  In order to make the HEMG more representative it was expanded to include a number of other interested representative bodies such as ISME and Retail Ireland.  A schedule of meetings was agreed that requires the full HEMG to meet twice, and the Regional Liaison Groups to meet quarterly, in 2013.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners have advised that attendees at the HEMG meetings, in a representative capacity, varies from time to time, however the January 2013 meeting was chaired by Mr. Declan Rigney, Assistant Secretary, Office of the Revenue Commissioners and was attended by:</p><p>   - The Revenue Planning Division team Mr. S&eacute;amas O&rsquo;Cathasaigh, Mr. Sean Nolan, Mr. Vincent Kenrick and Mr. John Morrissey. </p><p>   - The Chairs of the four Regional Liaison Groups (also Revenue), Ms. Phil U&iacute; Bhr&oacute;ithe (Border/Midlands/West Region), Ms. Lynda Hendley (Dublin Region), Mr. Pat Murphy (South-West Region) and Mr. Thomas Keating (East/South/East Region). </p><p>   - The other Government Agencies were, Mr. Phil Cox &ndash; Department of Social Protection, Mr. Fran Power &ndash; National Employment Rights Authority and Ms. Joan Kehoe &ndash; Department of Jobs Innovation and Enterprise.</p><p>   - The Employee Group representatives (Unions) were Mr. Fergus Whelan &ndash; Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Mr. Christy McQuillan &ndash; Services Industrial Professional and Technical Union.</p><p>   - The Employer Group representatives were, Mr. Ger Brady &ndash; Irish Business and Employers Confederation, Mr. Eddie Keenan &ndash; Construction Industry Federation, Ms. Liz Carroll &ndash; Irish Small and Medium Enterprises and Mr. Jim Copeland &ndash; Hardware Association of Ireland.</p><p>   - Apologies were received from Ms. Avine McNally &ndash; Small Firms Association, Mr. Stephen Lynam &ndash; Retail Ireland, Mr. Donal O&rsquo;Keefe &ndash; Licensed Vintners Association and Mr. Patrick Cribben &ndash; Vintners Association of Ireland. </p><p>  In order to open up the Group&rsquo;s deliberations to the fullest range of hidden economy activities, the membership has been enlarged over the years most recently, to include representatives from Retail Ireland and the licensed trade.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that although the hidden economy is not defined within the Group&rsquo;s terms of reference, no restrictions have been placed on the scope of hidden economy activities discussed within the HEMG and the Regional Liaison Groups.  While the Group&rsquo;s discussions during the last decade concentrated to a large degree on the construction sector, other issues discussed within the Group included employment rights, the problem of people &ldquo;working and signing&rdquo; as well as under-reporting of income by cash businesses.  Another initiative that Revenue developed during 2011 for the HEMG was a reporting template which facilitates the provision of information by representative bodies relating to shadow economy activities being carried on in their respective sectors.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that during the course of the January 2013 full meeting of the HEMG, and in a series of bi-laterals that Revenue held with a number of representative bodies prior to the full meeting, Revenue used the opportunity to remind relevant attendees about the reporting template, they also highlighted the type of information that is helpful to them in tackling the shadow economy and drew relevant Group members&rsquo; attention to the tobacco hotline that is run by Revenue.</p><p>  I am satisfied that Revenue is taking a robust approach to tackling the Shadow Economy, and in defending legitimate traders, and I welcome their continuing productive engagement with other State Agencies and with the representative groups through the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group.</p></reply>

On maturity, the bonds attract a lump sum payment that does not form part of income as estimated in accordance with the Tax Acts and is, therefore, exempt from income tax and universal social charge and from the charge of PRSI.  Annually, a payment of interest is made to the bondholder and deposit interest retention tax (DIRT) is deducted. Interest, which is liable to DIRT, is specifically excluded from the charge to universal social charge. However, PRSI may be chargeable on such interest depending on the circumstances of an individual.  </p><p>  In addition, I announced in my Budget speech last December that Minister Burton will be bringing forward legislation to change PRSI contributions as follows: where modified PRSI rate payers have income from a trade or profession, such income and any unearned income they have will be made subject to PRSI with effect from the 1st of January 2013; and unearned income for everyone else will become subject to PRSI in 2014. This means that PRSI will be payable on such income generated from wealth such as rental income, investment income, dividends and interest on deposits and savings. </p><p>  Furthermore, I would point out that, in general, social insurance applies to persons over the age of 16 years and under pensionable age, which is currently age 66 years.  Those aged 66 years and over are not liable to pay PRSI on any of their income including their unearned income. Accordingly those over 66 years will not be impacted by the proposal to apply PRSI to unearned income such as interest on savings, shares and rents.</p></reply>

While Returns of Income for the 2012 tax year are not finally due until October 2013, Returns can be filed earlier than the final date for completion.

While the other country&rsquo;s perspective will always be fully set out in the course of negotiations, it is also necessary that the terms of Ireland&rsquo;s new tax treaties should be mindful of the interests of, and acceptable to, existing treaty partners. Several treaties may be under re-negotiation at any one time, requiring a review of the existing provisions.  While the Revenue Commissioners cannot comment in relation to any specific case, they have informed me that the Zambian tax authorities have not expressed any concerns in relation to the application of the treaty with Ireland. </p><p>  An underlying principle of tax treaty negotiation with any country is to view the agreement as a vital piece of fiscal infrastructure that should have a positive effect on both jurisdictions concerned.  In negotiating double taxation treaties, the Revenue Commissioners aim to reach a convergence of positions that will ensure that the treaty is effective and efficient, meets the interests of each side as far as possible, is acceptable in both countries and works well in practice.    </p><p>  All of Ireland&rsquo;s double taxation agreements already contain provisions for the exchange, between the tax authorities, of information necessary to give effect to the agreements and to the domestic tax law of the contracting states.  These provisions, which follow the OECD Model Convention, allow for information to be exchanged between treaty partners in three ways:  on request (in relation to a particular case), spontaneously (where one State has acquired information which it thinks may be of interest to the other State), and automatically (where the information covers many cases of a similar kind which can be transmitted systematically on a regular basis).   </p><p>  Ireland is fully involved in, and supportive of, the discussions at OECD on the extensions to the automatic exchange of information for tax purposes.  In addition, Ireland has signed up to the joint Council of Europe/OECD Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.  In response to a call from the G20 in 2009 &ldquo;to make it easier for developing countries to secure the benefits of the new co-operative tax environment&rdquo;, a Protocol was developed to amend this Convention to open it up to all countries.  Ireland signed the Convention and the Protocol in June 2011.</p></reply>

The option will be available for 3 years from the passing of the 2013 Finance Bill which is expected to become law in early April at the latest.  This is a restricted measure which will enable rather than incentivise certain individuals to access part of their pension savings beyond their regular or compulsory pension contributions.

NAMA advises that the research work will cover a number of relevant issues, including the likely pattern of economic recovery over short to medium-term horizons and the related impact on the housing market.  Research work will be overseen by a Steering Committee, on which NAMA will be represented, which will agree priorities and review outputs.  Editorial control and responsibility for the research will rest with the ESRI.  NAMA advises that its contribution to the cost of the research work has not yet been finalised and that the ESRI is also in discussion with other possible sponsors.  I am advised that the original proposal was received by NAMA from the ESRI and that the NAMA Board considered and decided to support the proposal based on the ESRI&rsquo;s experience, expertise, capacity and credibility in the area of primary economic research.  I understand that the ESRI plans to publish its reports.  The Deputy may also wish to note the commitment in the Action Plan on Jobs 2013 which states that better cross&ndash;Government co-ordination of action on the property market will be progressed under the active leadership of my Department.  The important work now being undertaken by NAMA and the ESRI will complement that process.</p></reply>

I have been informed that no listed companies in Ireland are comparable to Irish Life.  I am advised by Goldman Sachs, which acted as adviser to the State in the sale of Irish Life, that the price earnings ratio of the listed UK companies that are most comparable to Irish Life - Aviva, Old Mutual, Legal &amp; General, Standard Life and Resolution - ranges from 8.6x to 16.1x and that the average P/E multiple of this peer group is 11x.  It should be noted that the comparable companies cited operate in very different markets to Ireland, where the life assurance market is challenged.  The implied ratio implied by the Irish Life sale compares favourably with the valuation of this peer group.  I can advise the Deputy that the price achieved represents a 30% premium to the net assets of Irish Life.</p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that the &euro;1.3 billion consideration agreed for the sale of Irish Life is a 30% premium to the price that was achievable when the previous bid process was suspended in November 2011.  As the Deputy is aware, since November 2011 valuation multiples in the life insurance sector have improved, as has sentiment towards Ireland and the Eurozone, while the underlying life assurance industry in Ireland has remained challenging.  These circumstances allowed the State to recoup in full the investment made by the taxpayer in Irish Life and at a price which was significantly better than could have been achieved in November 2011 . A fair value opinion which supported the decision taken by the State was received from our advisors Goldman Sachs.  I believe the price achieved for Irish Life represents a very good deal for the Irish taxpayer.</p></reply>

Of this total amount, &euro;625 million was by way of two separate subscriptions for Special Investment Shares, while &euro;250 million was provided by means of a Promissory Note.  The terms of the EBS Promissory Note provide, inter alia, that ten per cent of the amount outstanding as at the end of 2010 shall be paid each year until the note is paid off in full.  This equates to &euro;25 million per annum, with the next annual payment to be made on 17 June 2013.</p><p>  Given that the EBS Building Society was acquired by Allied Irish Banks (AIB) which is a systemically important bank to the Irish economy, compared to the wind-down situation at IBRC, the Government is not currently considering a restructuring of the EBS Promissory Note.  As the Deputy is aware, the annual repayments of the EBS Promissory Notes are made up of capital and interest elements.  Any changes to the repayment scheduling of the capital balance will have an impact on the interest payments as would any assumptions around how the funding was replaced, interest rate changes and other funding considerations.  Differing assumptions around these metrics can have a material impact on the ultimate valuation and it is subject to a wide range of possible outcomes.  As detailed above, the Deputy will be aware that the EBS Promissory Notes are significantly smaller in scale that the previous Promissory Note arrangement for IBRC.</p></reply>

This was the second most common condition with the need to provide regular management accounts/debtors &amp; creditors listing to the bank being the most common requirement at 57%.  This survey covered over 1,500 SMEs.  The Eurostat 2007-10 survey on access to finance asked about the need for guarantees in obtaining loan finance.  The results showed Ireland at 39% in 2010, almost exactly at the average figure.  The Irish figure had reduced slightly from 40% in 2007, which was slightly above the average then of 38%.</p><p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises provides that a regulated entity must not impose unreasonable personal guarantee requirements on borrowers.  In addition, where a regulated entity seeks collateral or a personal guarantee to support a lending proposition it must explain clearly the possible implications for the guarantor of giving such collateral or personal guarantee.  Any enforcement of a personal guarantee over a principal private residence must be in accordance with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.  A SME is entitled to apply for a review by the Credit Review Office where the borrowers considers that the terms or conditions attached to a credit facility or its price are so onerous as to amount to a constructive refusal.  This could include unreasonable personal guarantees.  Personal guarantees make the guarantor liable in the event of the SME being unable to meet its liabilities and may make the guarantor personally liable for the debts of a limited company.  I would strongly advise SMEs to ensure they have independent expert advice on the possible consequences of giving personal guarantees.</p></reply>

The LPT Return must be submitted and payment details provided to Revenue by 7 May, if using the paper return, and by 28 May if using Revenue&rsquo;s online facility.  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a wide range of payment options is available to liable persons, which will allow them to pay their LPT liability in full or to pay the tax for 2013 in equal instalments over the period 1 July to 31 December 2013.  For a significant number of property owners, the easiest and most convenient way to pay LPT is to have the tax deducted at source on a phased basis from their salary or occupational pension or from certain payments from the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The Revenue Commissioners also advise that where deduction at source is chosen, there is no additional administration or interest charge imposed by Revenue.  Other payment options include Single Debit Authority, debit/credit card, direct debit and cash.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their offices are not equipped, from a security point of view, to accept cash.  As an alternative, for those who wish to pay their LPT in cash, I am advised that the Revenue Commissioners are currently negotiating with a number of payment service providers, including An Post, to allow LPT cash payments to be made at their premises and Revenue will shortly be publishing details of these service providers and the relevant premises.  The Revenue Commissioners also advise that the option to pay LPT in cash through these service providers will be available nationwide.  Normal transactional charges may be levied by the payment service provider.  I am satisfied that the range of payment options available to facilitate single or phased payment of the tax, and the manner in which those options are accessible to property owners, will allow property owners choose whatever option suits their own particular circumstances.</p></reply>

The Bank is working with Ulster Bank to ensure that all impacted consumers are treated fairly.   The error resulted from a failure to move consumers to full capital and interest payments after the initial interest only period on their mortgage expired. Where there has been an under-collection, impacted consumers will be afforded ample time to make repayments and will have the opportunity to choose from a number of repayment options. Any impacted consumers who experience difficulty making revised repayments will be treated sympathetically; this will include all protections afforded by the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) where relevant.</p><p>  The error affects approximately 1,300 accounts with a total of approximately &#8364;41 million under-collected from these customers. Impacted customers, who are currently in arrears, will also be afforded the protections of the CCMA where relevant.  Ulster Bank will write to impacted customers regarding their own specific circumstances and what action they need to take. For further information, customers may contact Ulster Bank&#8217;s specialist team on 1800 303 352.</p><p>  On the issue of the IT systems collapse the Central Bank has further advised me that they encourage all Ulster Bank customers to contact Ulster Bank to ensure that their issues (as a consequence of this incident) are properly addressed. Customers of other banks who were affected should get in touch with their own bank in the first instance to seek redress for loss and inconvenience. If customers are not satisfied with the outcome, they can make a formal complaint to their bank.</p><p>  While Ulster Bank is required to reimburse and make good any actual losses suffered by customers, the level of any payment for inconvenience suffered is not subject to the Central Bank&#8217;s regulatory standards or approval. This is a commercial decision for Ulster Bank. Where customers are not satisfied with how Ulster Bank has dealt with them, they may refer their complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman.

However, the banks in Ireland, including those in which the State has a significant shareholding, are independent commercial entities and decisions on the handling of their individual mortgages and other loans, including distressed loans, are solely a matter for the Boards and management of individual institutions in the exercise of their commercial and fiduciary responsibilities.  As Minister for Finance I have no role to play in the decisions the covered banks make on the treatment of individual loans.  The most recent capital injection in the covered banks took place in 2011 and it arose from the March 2011 Central Bank PCAR assessment.  This assessment, which was based on certain macro economic and loan loss assumptions on all parts of the loan books, including mortgages, of the covered banks identified a further capital requirement.  The Central Bank has clearly stated that banks now have a substantial capital buffer with which to absorb losses on their mortgage portfolios and the State authorities now require determined action by banks to identify and resolve unsustainable mortgages.  While I cannot be prescriptive as to what decisions banks should make in individual cases, it is now necessary for the covered banks, and indeed all banks, to work through individual cases of debt difficulty and to ensure that unsustainable debts are appropriately restructured.</p><p>  From an overall policy perspective, the role of the public authorities is to encourage and put in place the most appropriate framework that will allow both debtors and creditors, including the covered banks, to recognize and address genuine mortgage and loan difficulty.  In that regard, the fact that the Central Bank will shortly be setting targets to work through problem cases and to put in place durable solutions is most welcome.  However, if it does not prove possible for creditors and debtors to reach mutually acceptable agreements to deal with problem debt, there is then an onus on the State to provide for a fair and effective personal insolvency regime.  Indeed, the &ldquo;Keane Report&rdquo; clearly stated that, without effective personal insolvency legislation, the mortgage arrears problem will not be resolved.  The new Personal Insolvency Act, which provides for a very significant modernization of bankruptcy law and introduces new and more easily accessible frameworks for the statutory resolution of problem debt, will meet that requirement.  It is clear that effective action to deal with unsustainable personal debt will not only be of benefit to the individual borrower in difficulty but will also be in the best interests of the wider economy.</p></reply>

This is in order to ensure that an accurate picture of take up levels over a full tax year could be provided.  Therefore, given that 2012 was the first year of the programme, reliable statistics on its uptake will not be available until later this year when the returns have been analysed.  Corresponding returns in relation to SARP relief claimed in 2013 will not be due until after the end of the 2013 tax year, therefore the relevant statistics for 2013 cannot be compiled until after that time.</p><p>  As regards preliminary tax payments for 2013, I assume the deputy is referring to preliminary tax payments due for 2013 under the self&ndash;assessment system.  Preliminary tax for 2013 is not due for payment until autumn 2013; therefore statistics in relation to preliminary tax for 2013 are not yet available.  Preliminary tax is only due in respect of non-PAYE income and, as most of the individuals who avail of SARP have solely PAYE income, they do not have an obligation to pay preliminary tax. In any event, any preliminary tax paid by self-assessed individuals who also avail of SARP will not reflect tax paid through the PAYE system or the amount of SARP relief claimed.</p></reply>

As a result the first &euro;100,000 of any claim from these depositors is covered under the DGS Scheme. I have been advised that the Liquidator is aware of a number of depositors who fall outside the eligibility criteria for the ELG Scheme due to the nature of the investment product. Unfortunately, if a deposit is not eligible under the ELG scheme the depositor will rank as an unsecured creditor in the liquidation.   At the time that this product was purchased by Credit Unions, there was no additional guarantee provided by the State.  It was always the case that the ELG scheme covered only those liabilities which were entered into during the issuance window.</p><p>  Pursuant to a Transfer Order made by the High Court under CISA on 24 February 2011, Anglo Irish Bank transferred the vast majority of its Irish and UK customer deposits to Allied Irish Banks, together with its NAMA senior bonds and its Isle of Man subsidiary.

Currently, all primary and second-level schools provide PE as part of the curriculum and there are approved syllabuses for the subject.  The new Framework for Junior Cycle which I published last October will, inter alia, aim to increase the importance of physical wellbeing in several ways:</p><p>  - The Framework is based on eight Principles. The Principle of &quot;Wellbeing&quot; undertakes to ensure that &quot;the student experience contributes directly to their physical wellbeing.&quot;</p><p>  - In addition, eight Key Skills are required for successful learning across the curriculum and beyond the school.  This is in recognition of the fact that learning takes place both inside and outside of the formal school environment.  One of these Key Skills is &quot;Staying Well&quot;, which adopts a holistic approach to wellbeing and includes &quot;Being healthy, physical and active&quot;.</p><p>  - Contained in the Junior Cycle's Statements of Learning is the stated aim that the student is &quot;confident and competent in physical activity and is motivated to be physically active&quot;, and that he/she &quot;understands the importance of food and diet in making healthy lifestyle choices&quot;.</p><p>  - Perhaps most importantly in this respect, the new junior cycle will enable schools to offer Physical Education as a short course, which means that, for the first time, it can be certified.</p><p>  The issue of obesity is addressed in schools not only in the teaching of Physical Education, but also in Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), and Home Economics.  As part of the revised Junior Cycle, short courses are being prepared by the NCCA not only in PE but also in SPHE and will be available for schools from September 2014.  These courses may be assessed as a part of the School Certificate in the new Junior Cycle.</p><p>  The Active School Flag, funded by my Department, was officially launched in 2009 to motivate and award schools which strive to achieve a physically active and physically educated school community.  The funding provided to the ASF was &euro;116,000 per year for the past 3 years, and &euro;80,000 in 2012.  Since September 2009, just over 1000 primary schools and 128 post-primary schools have registered for the programme.  Some 180 schools have already been awarded their flags.  The ASF rewards schools in their efforts in this area and the Department sees it as its initiative to enhance a student's healthy lifestyle.  More schools are registering to participate each year.</p><p>  In 2009 my Department carried out a Lifeskills Survey in primary and post primary schools.  They found that in addition to formal PE provision that some 90% of schools encourage not only physical activity and regular exercise during school breaks but they also encourage the young people to participate in sport outside schooltime.  The work in the school has to be complimented and reinforced by the families and the communities of our young people if the spread of childhood obesity is to be reduced. </p></reply>

There were a plethora of long-standing clustering arrangements in place which were not the most practical, efficient or cost effective way to allocate resources.  The new arrangements introduced in the current school year are designed to address the limitations of the previous arrangements.  Under the reforms to the teacher allocation process introduced for the current school year, schools were empowered to cluster and arrange their General Allocation Model resources in a manner that best suits their local needs, including in a manner that reduces travel between schools.  This school led process has resulted in over 97% of the overall GAM allocation being in full-time stand-alone or shared posts.</p><p>  Aside from the reforms to the GAM, the allocation of resource hours for individual pupils vary from year to year.  This is because of the ongoing individual assessment of pupils through the NCSE must operate on a later timescale.  The new arrangements involve the allocation of a network of permanent posts in base schools and again are designed to make the system work more smoothly at school level.  85% of all NCSE approved resource teaching hours in the 2012/13 school year were allocated to schools that had resource base posts.</p><p>  The staffing arrangements for the coming school year 2013/14 are outlined in Circular 0013/2013 which is available on the Department website.  When the allocation and redeployment process is completed later in the Summer schools that have complied with the arrangements outlined in the Circular will be given some discretion to operate, where possible, their own temporary local arrangements in relation to the day to day work arrangements of teachers in full-time shared posts.  These arrangements are aimed at minimising any time lost in travelling between schools.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012.  All schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, have been advised by the NCSE of their resource teaching and SNA staffing allocation for the current school year. Details of the allocations which have been made to each school are available at www.ncse.ie.  All primary schools receive a quantum of resource hours for children with special educational needs through the General Allocation Model and also through individual allocations for children with low incidence special needs.</p><p>  The NCSE allocates a level of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school. SNAs should then be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  Where schools have enrolled new pupils with special educational needs who were not considered at the time that the allocations for the 2012/13 school year were made, or where schools are in a position to demonstrate that they cannot cater for the care needs of qualifying children from the level of SNA support which has been assigned to them, they may apply to the NCSE for additional SNA support or for a review of their SNA allocation.  Similarly where SNA support was not initially allocated for a child in a junior infant class, but where it can be demonstrated that the child requires SNA assistance in the classroom environment, the school may apply to the NCSE for additional SNA support or for a review of their SNA allocation.</p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p></reply>

The NEWB guidelines were issued to schools in 2008 and make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable. The guidelines further state that as well as making explicit that bullying is prohibited in the school, and having an anti-bullying policy, the code of behaviour should indicate what action the school will take in relation to alleged breaches of the school's bullying policy.  Every school therefore must have in place a policy, within the framework of the school's overall school code of behaviour, which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</p><p>  I am fully aware of the seriousness of the issue of bullying and it was for that reason that an Anti-Bullying Forum was held in May last year.  The Deputy will be aware that I established a working group to address the issue of tackling bullying in schools, including cyber-bullying.  The Group produced an Action Plan recommending further measures that can be taken to effectively tackle bullying, including cyber bullying, in schools. I broadly accept the proposed actions in the Action Plan which was published in January. I have asked officials in my Department to commence work on implementing the Action Plan in consultation with teachers, parents and management bodies at first and second-level schools. </p><p>  My Department's role is to clarify for parents and students how their grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed. Guidance to parents on progressing a concern in relation their child's school is available on my Department's website at<i> www.education.ie.</i>  Where a parent feels that the school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should contact the Ombudsman for Children. </p><p>  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures.  The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the action of the school has had a negative effect on a child.  The office can be contacted at Ombudsman for Children's Office, Millennium House, 52-56 Great Strand Street, Dublin1, (Ph) 1800 20 20 40 or (01) 8656800, E-mail <i>oco@oco.ie</i>.</p></reply>

It is the board of management of each individual school that decides the number of places available to students on programmes such as Transition Year. In cases where restrictions apply, schools should have clear procedures regarding how places are allocated to students.</p></reply>

This Programme was extended in 2012 and there were over 2,200 beneficiaries. RAPS will continue in 2013.</p><p>  4) Skillnets</p><p>  Skillnets which is an enterprise-led body funded through the National Training Fund (NTF) to provide companies with new opportunities to develop relevant, effective answers to their training and development needs was set ambitious targets for 2013 to train 40,000 persons, of which up to 8,000 will be unemployed.</p><p>  5) Momentum</p><p>  &quot;Momentum&quot; has been designed to provide targeted interventions to tackle the skills shortages in particular sectors of the Irish economy where vacancies have been identified and will provide up to 6,500 training places for the long term unemployed. Some of the places have been targeted specifically at young unemployed people. Momentum will be co-financed by the European Social Fund.</p><p>  6) National Strategy for Higher Education</p><p>  National Strategy for Higher Education is a detailed framework and range of recommendations that ensures the system continues to respond to enterprise needs.

I am advised that current plans in relation to the two schools involve developing a site of approximately 6 acres.  My officials were recently made aware that some opposition in relation to the proposal has arisen locally.  I understand that my officials and South Dublin County Council are continuing to discuss the matter.  </p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012.  All schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, have been advised by the NCSE of their resource teaching and SNA staffing allocation for the current school year. Details of the allocations which have been made to each school are available at www.ncse.ie.  All primary schools receive a quantum of resource hours for children with special educational needs through the General Allocation Model and also through individual allocations for children with low incidence special needs.</p><p>  The NCSE allocates a level of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school. SNAs should then be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  Where schools have enrolled new pupils with special educational needs who were not considered at the time that the allocations for the 2012/13 school year were made, or where schools are in a position to demonstrate that they cannot cater for the care needs of qualifying children from the level of SNA support which has been assigned to them, they may apply to the NCSE for additional SNA support or for a review of their SNA allocation.  Similarly where SNA support was not initially allocated for a child in a junior infant class, but where it can be demonstrated that the child requires SNA assistance in the classroom environment, the school may apply to the NCSE for additional SNA support or for a review of their SNA allocation.</p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p></reply>

The NEWB guidelines were issued to schools in 2008 and make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable. The guidelines further state that as well as making explicit that bullying is prohibited in the school, and having an anti-bullying policy, the code of behaviour should indicate what action the school will take in relation to alleged breaches of the school's bullying policy.  Every school therefore must have in place a policy, within the framework of the school's overall school code of behaviour, which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</p><p>  I am fully aware of the seriousness of the issue of bullying and it was for that reason that an Anti-Bullying Forum was held in May last year.  The Deputy will be aware that I established a working group to address the issue of tackling bullying in schools, including cyber-bullying.  The Group produced an Action Plan recommending further measures that can be taken to effectively tackle bullying, including cyber bullying, in schools. I broadly accept the proposed actions in the Action Plan which was published in January. I have asked officials in my Department to commence work on implementing the Action Plan in consultation with teachers, parents and management bodies at first and second-level schools. </p><p>  My Department's role is to clarify for parents and students how their grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed. Guidance to parents on progressing a concern in relation their child's school is available on my Department's website at<i> www.education.ie.</i>  Where a parent feels that the school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should contact the Ombudsman for Children. </p><p>  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures.  The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the action of the school has had a negative effect on a child.  The office can be contacted at Ombudsman for Children's Office, Millennium House, 52-56 Great Strand Street, Dublin1, (Ph) 1800 20 20 40 or (01) 8656800, E-mail <i>oco@oco.ie</i>.</p></reply>

It is the board of management of each individual school that decides the number of places available to students on programmes such as Transition Year. In cases where restrictions apply, schools should have clear procedures regarding how places are allocated to students.</p></reply>

In excess of &euro;42million has been allocated for this initiative of which &euro;19.7 million has been paid to date.  Funding is provided in two traunches, 70% when the project goes to construction and the remaining 30% on completion.  A total of 104 schools have already gone to construction and 10 of these have been completed.  The rental savings achieved by the 10 completed projects are in the region of &euro;118,000.00.  These figures will be subject to change as further projects are completed.  This funding is being provided to schools to replace rented prefabs that are currently providing mainstream classroom and resource rooms for an estimated 6,000 pupils. In total 286 mainstream classrooms currently in rented prefabs will receive permanent buildings. Resource rooms and other ancillary accommodation will also be replaced as part of this initiative and a rental saving of up to &euro;5m will be achieved when all the projects are completed.</p></reply>

Significant work was undertaken by those bodies on the necessary core administrative preparations for the establishment of the new Authority, such as the establishment of a new organisational structure, change of accommodation and integration of ICT infrastructure.  In addition, the establishment of QQI has also involved the amalgamation of processes, including ones that have operated differently in the different agencies due to the history and nature of the different sectors.  This requires the reconfiguration of current services such as the registration process for new providers, the validation and accreditation of programmes, the monitoring and review of providers and the development, review and certification of awards.  It also includes the development of formal guidelines, criteria and procedures pursuant to the new Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012.</p><p>  QQI is currently developing those guidelines, criteria and procedures and it is expected that new applications will be accepted by QQI in the near future.  However, it should be noted that QQI continues to provide services to more than 1,000 providers which were registered with FETAC and HETAC and continues to make awards to learners.</p></reply>

The terms of some pension schemes also envisaged circumstances where a pension might be forfeited.  However this  concept of forfeiture  has been the subject of significant legal developments in the past 20 years or so - e.g. provisions within pension schemes relating to forfeiture being found to be ultra vires (Lovett .v. the Minister for Education: 1996), the striking down of relevant sections of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 as unconstitutional  (Cox .v. Ireland: 1992), the repeal of the Forfeiture Act 1870 (Criminal Law Act 1997), earned pension being considered as a property right within the terms of the Constitution.  It must also be recognized that the executive/administrative arm of the State cannot take actions which would effectively usurp the judicial function.  I do not propose to request Government to hold a referendum on any amendment to the constitution.</p></reply>

All public servants, including front-line workers, will be able to consider the full set of proposals by the LRC which have been published and the public service staff representatives who remained in negotiations have indicated that these proposals will be subject to ballot by members.</p><p>  Both the Government and I are acutely aware of the very significant contributions made to date by all public servants by way of pay reductions, imposition of the pension related deduction, non-payment of pay increases and the significant productivity arising over recent years facilitated by the Public Service Agreement.  Regrettably, the scale of the fiscal crisis inherited by the current Government and the absolute requirement to address and reduce the current deficit of 8% to less than 3% in 2015, requires a further contribution of &euro;1bn from the public service pay and pensions bill which accounts for some 35% of current expenditure.  Undoubtedly the impact of the proposals made by the Labour Relations Commission will add to the financial pressures on public servants who also carry the burden of increased taxes which apply to all workers.  They represent a balanced set of proposals across all public service sectors to secure the savings required by the Exchequer while ameliorating the impacts for public service staff on low and middle incomes to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

A commitment was given to the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) in 2006 by the Minister for Finance at that time that a review would be conducted by the Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC) at an appropriate time when adequate experience had been obtained in the use of the new contracts by contracting authorities.  Consideration was given to a review in 2010 but at the time it was agreed that insufficient numbers of contracts had reached final account stage to provide material for a review.</p><p>  I am satisfied that sufficient projects have now reached agreed final account stage to conduct a review of the performance of the contracts.  The CIF&rsquo;s most recent request for a review is currently being considered and the arrangements about which the Deputy is enquiring will be decided shortly.  The Government Construction Contracts Committee (GCCC) was set up under Section 11 of Circular 40/02 &lsquo;Public Procurement Guidelines - revision of existing procedures for approval of certain contracts in the Central Government sector&rsquo;, which reconfigured the existing arrangements for the Government Contracts Committee.  The GCCC deals with public works procurement and related issues.  The GCCC has key representatives from the main construction-related Departments and agencies including civil, building and administrative representation.  Representatives on GCCC change from time to time, and the current list of members is set out in my reply to Parliamentary Question Ref. No. 7701/13 of 13 February 2013.</p></reply>

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform can, if appropriate, waive his interest in property under Section 28 of the Act. </p><p>  Under Section 28(2) of the State Property Act, 1954, personal property and land vested in or held in trust by a body corporate immediately prior to its dissolution, (other than personal property or land held by such body upon trust for another person) becomes property of the State in the person of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform until such time as the company is restored to the Register or the Minister waives (under Section 31 of the Act) the interest vested in him.  This mechanism acts as a failsafe so that property is never ownerless.  The Minister acquires an interest in property in the following circumstances:-</p><p> - the voluntary winding-up of companies; </p><p> - the involuntary liquidation of companies; and </p><p> - the striking off of companies from the Register of Companies.</p><p>  The interest acquired by the Minister is described as a defeasible interest as it may be defeated by restoration of the company.  Neither company nor property law require comprehensive and fully up-to-date asset records to be lodged with the Company Registration Office and the Property Registration Authority.  Consequently, the only persons with a complete view of the assets held by a company at the time of its dissolution are the directors and officers of the company.  As a result, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform only becomes aware that assets have vested in him by virtue of the State Property Act once an interested party has notified him.</p><p>  In order to confirm that this land is vested in the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform a formal application should be forwarded to the Office of Public Works, in the first instance.  This application will be referred to the Chief State Solicitor's Office who in order to assess the legal issues of the application will request all necessary information from the applicant/s.  The Chief State Solicitor's Office will then advise the Minister.  Finally, the Minister having regard to the legalities and merits of the application will then at his discretion decide whether to waive his interest or not.</p></reply>

Separately I intend to bring forward proposals to reduce, with effect from 1 July 2013, pensions in payment above &euro;32,500 through amendments to the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR).  For serving staff, therefore, who will retire before end August 2014 on pensions of &euro;32,500 or more, the effect of these measures will be to reduce their pension by the amount of the new Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) but their pension and lump sum will be unaffected by the pay reductions.</p><p>  For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, I can confirm that, in the context of the preparation of PSPR legislation legal advice obtained from the Attorney General indicated that it is possible to apply proportionate reductions to a broad class of existing pensions.  Such a measure would, of course, have to accrue sufficient funds and take account of the fact that pension benefits are generally regarded as vested property rights, which must be considered in the public interest when taking action.  The Office of the Attorney General will be consulted in the context of the preparation of amending legislation to give effect to the revised PSPR arrangements.</p></reply>

This is an important piece of legislation aimed at creating a more level playing field between contractor and subcontractor in the construction sector.

Two of the appointees were nominated by An Post and, in light of the fact that the term of the National Lottery License being due to expire in late 2013, two directors were re-appointed.

The purpose of the scheme is to aid Government in implementing restructuring and reform in a strategic and targeted manner.  It is not proposed to introduce a general scheme open to all public servants to apply.  As announced recently, voluntary redundancy is shortly being introduced in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and certain parts of the Health and Education Sectors where staff surpluses are identified by management.  These Departments estimate that there will be scope to effect about 2,000 exits from their areas over time and are currently drafting plans detailing the locations and surplus posts to be targeted and the timing of exits. </p><p>  There will be no automatic right to redundancy and all applications will be considered in the context of ongoing business needs and service provision priorities.

This Bill was published on 21 December 2012.

As set out in the Table of Actions that was launched on 22 February 2013 with the Action Plan, the Policy Statement will be published in quarter 4 of 2013.  To deliver on this commitment, the work programme will involve research and consultation with interested parties and relevant stakeholders.  I will shortly be launching a public consultation as part of an assessment of the current environment for entrepreneurship activity.</p><p>  This focus on entrepreneurship is particularly timely given the work currently being undertaken to restructure the County Enterprise Boards and establish Local Enterprise Offices in Local Authorities to reform the system for delivery of support to start-ups and micro enterprises.  A National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement will complement this major reform programme, to ensure that the operating environment is more coherent, responsive and conducive to entrepreneurship.  Several Government Departments have a role to play in enhancing the entrepreneurial dynamic.  Given the whole of Government approach to the Action Plan for Jobs, this is an ideal opportunity for a National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement to underpin the importance of entrepreneurship as an explicit policy priority for fresh job creation.</p></reply>

In the 1970s it was the prevailing view that to facilitate widely dispersed job creation and regional development it would be beneficial to have IDA-built advance factories available throughout the country.  That view changed and throughout the 1980s partnership arrangements between public and private organisations were put in place to provide additional advance factory buildings.  From the 2000s on, IDA has been disposing of its landlord interests in selected legacy buildings and its ownership of lands throughout the country.  To fully align with IDA&rsquo;s&lsquo; strategic objectives for the period 2010 to 2014, as outlined in its strategy document &ldquo;Horizon 2020&rdquo;&rsquo; the Agency is now primarily focussed on maintaining its Gateway Business and Technology Parks and strategic sites while simultaneously, disposing of its non-core property assets located in hub and other legacy locations around the country.</p><p>  However, IDA has identified a marketing requirement for advanced technology building designs to assist with current and future project opportunities.  Based on market feedback and experience, the type of building which offers the best solution is an approximately 2,300m&sup2; technology building, capable of expansion.  This building type can serve the needs of both manufacturing and serviced based projects.  Accordingly, IDA has lodged planning application for one such unit to be located in the IDA Business and Technology Park in Waterford and is in the process of making a submission to Westmeath County Council in respect of IDA Business and Technology Park in Athlone.</p></reply>

There were 26 such visits during 2012 and 11 during 2011.  This compares with a total of 19 visits in the previous two year period (11 in 2010 and 8 in 2009).  These site visits were from new companies visiting the location for the first time and also from senior executives of existing client companies.  For reasons of client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity IDA does not comment on site visits by individual companies or on site visits to specific locations. </p><p>  As Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  I am, however, mindful of the concerns that have been expressed by Deputies on all sides of the House about the relatively low level of site visits to certain regional locations and I have raised this matter with the CEO of IDA Ireland with a view to exploring what further initiatives can be taken to influence potential investors to invest in such locations. </p><p>  I am mindful, also, that in order to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for FDI, it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014.  This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development.  In the meantime, IDA Ireland has assured me that it will in 2013, in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s recently announced 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, seek to target more than 130 new investments, secure &euro;500 million of R&amp;D expenditure and create 13,000 new jobs in its client companies.</p></reply>

These site visits were from new companies visiting the location for the first time and from senior executives of existing companies.  For reasons of client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity IDA does not comment on site visits by individual companies or on site visits to specific locations. </p><p>  As Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  County Galway has been particularly successful in recent years in terms of attracting inward investment from FDI companies, particularly in the areas of Medical Technologies and ICT.  There are currently 59 IDA Ireland client companies employing some 12,900 people in Galway, city and county.  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites. </p><p>  I am, however, mindful of the concerns that have been expressed by Deputies on all sides of the House about the relatively low level of site visits to certain regional locations and I have raised this matter with the CEO of IDA Ireland with a view to exploring what further initiatives can be taken to influence potential investors to invest in such locations.  I am mindful that in order to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for FDI, it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014. This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development. </p><p>  In the meantime, IDA Ireland has assured me that it will in 2013, in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s recently announced 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, seek to target more than 130 new investments, secure &euro;500 million of R&amp;D expenditure and create 13,000 new jobs in its client companies.</p></reply>

It is an offence under the above mentioned legislation for both an employer and an employee to be party to the employment of a non-EEA national without a valid employment permit. Either the employer or employee may apply for an employment permit. The issue of an employment permit requires a job offer from a prospective employer. </p><p>  In terms of general eligibility new employment permit applications are normally only considered for highly skilled, highly paid positions or for positions where there is an officially recognised scarcity of supply in relation to a particular qualification or occupation type. Irish labour market policy is to ensure that general labour and skills needs are met from within the workforce of the European Economic Area (EEA). Current Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand for strategic skills and labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors such as healthcare, information technology and financial services. Eligibility criteria are set out on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  The holder of an employment Permit is permitted only to work for the employer and in the employment stated on the permit. Should the employee named on the permit, for any reason, cease to be employed by the employer and in the employment stated on the permit during the period of validity specified, the permit and any copies thereof must be returned immediately to the Employment Permits Section  . </p><p>  There are four main Employment Permit categories, i.e. Work Permits, Green Cards, Spousal Dependent Permits, and Intra Company Transfer Permits. While requirements vary from one employment permit category to another, in general terms each employment permit application must be made on the appropriate application form, include the appropriate processing fee, details of the employer&rsquo;s registration with Revenue and Companies Registration Office, colour copies of the employee&rsquo;s passport, and finally, confirmation of the employee&rsquo;s immigration status in cases where the employee is residing in the State.  When a third country national who has been issued with an employment permit arrives in this State they must produce their valid employment permit at the point of entry. They are then given a landing stamp facilitating entry. However the onus lies on the permit holder to contact INIS (the Irish Naturalisation Service) with a view to finalising their immigration status. </p><p>  Finally, I should advise the Deputy that in response to changes in the Irish labour market, the desire to enhance the user friendly profile of the process and in particular to address shortages in certain employment categories my Department is finalising a review of all Employment Permit related practice and procedures. This review addresses all aspects of Employment Permit policy and administration, its rules in respect of the processing of permits as well as a reappraisal of the eligible categories of employment in respect of which permit applications will be considered. I will be making a statement shortly with regard to the improvements to be made.</p></reply>

A contract of employment may stipulate a compulsory retirement age and this is generally a matter of contract law between the relevant parties.  </p><p>  The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has made rulings in a series of age-discrimination cases concerning Directive 2000/78/EC, which prohibit work-related discrimination on various grounds, including age.  The CJEU has clarified that mandatory retirement ages may be set down within the context of national law, whether by contract, custom and practice or other means, which must be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim, with the means of achieving that aim being both appropriate and necessary.  Directive 2000/78/EC is given effect in national law by the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2011, which come within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Mr Alan Shatter, T.D.</p><p>  As regards my Department&rsquo;s interaction with employer groups on this issue, my Department participated in a Working and Retirement Forum in Croke Park on 12 December 2012, which was organised and chaired by the Department of Social Protection, which has lead responsibility for the State pension and pension age policy.  Employers were among the stakeholder groups represented at the Forum, at which there was a discussion of issues relating to the alignment of mandatory retirement age practices with the new State pension age.  My Department will continue to interact on this issue with the Department of Social Protection, in the context of its on-going outreach initiatives with relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

The sector also supports employment in other related services, such as transport and logistics.  The retail sector has a diverse profile, encompassing large international players, some large indigenous companies and a sizeable number of small businesses and franchises, often family owned and owner-managed.  It is an employment-intensive sector, and covers every community in the country, creating local jobs.</p><p>  In recognising the importance of the retail sector to the economy, the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs contains a number of measures aimed at supporting the sector.  These include an initiative to increase the number of small businesses trading on-line and an initiative to streamline business licence application procedures.  The retail sector has been chosen to pilot the licensing initiative as it is one of the sectors which requires a multiplicity of licences and where the positive impact of streamlining the application process can be realised.  The intention is that an integrated licensing application system, incorporating up to 25 licences in the retail sector, will be developed in 2013.</p><p>  Employers in the retail sector can also avail of the JobsPlus initiative which will provide financial assistance to employers who recruit people who have been out of work for 12 months or more.  The Government has also committed, in the Action Plan for Jobs, to establishing an Interdepartmental Group to consider further possible measures to assist the retail sector.</p></reply>

This will change in 2014 as provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011. SPT will cease to be paid from 2014 which will standardise the payment of State pension at age 66.   In addition, the age at which State pension (contributory) (SPC) will be payable will increase to 67 years from 2012 and to 68 years from 2028.  </p><p>  The decision to increase State pension age was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.  The abolition of SPT removes the retirement condition which acts as an incentive to leave the workforce and has been widely criticised as a barrier to older people remaining in employment.  There is no retirement condition attached to SPC.  Currently, a person who retires from work on reaching age 65 and who does not have sufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for SPT may apply for another social welfare payment, depending on their individual circumstances.  This will remain the case when SPT is abolished in 2014.  The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system. These reforms are essential to ensure its sustainability and to address the challenges of changing demographics such as increasing life expectancy.  There are no plans to change the date of implementation.</p></reply>

If a person does not qualify for JB they may qualify for means tested jobseeker's allowance. In 2012 my Department spent some &euro;737 million on the scheme and at the end of 2012 there were some 85,000 persons in receipt of a JB payment.  Budget 2013 provided that the duration for which JB is paid will, with effect from April 2013, be reduced from 12 months to 9 months for recipients with 260 or more contributions paid and from 9 months to 6 months for recipients with less than 260 contributions paid. </p><p>  The reduction in duration from 12 months to 9 months will apply to new claimants from April, 2013, and existing recipients who, in April, 2013, have been getting JB for less than 6 months. The reduction in duration from 9 months to 6 months will apply to new claimants from April, 2013 and existing recipients who, in April, 2013, have been getting JB for less than 3 months.  Legislation provides that, subject to the person having paid 156 or more qualifying contributions and satisfying the general scheme conditions, a person whose JB expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66. On this basis, workers who suffer a substantial loss of employment at age 65 will not be subject to the reductions in duration provided they have paid at least 156 qualifying contributions.</p></reply>

With regard to progression into employment, the interim evaluation of JobBridge conducted by Indecon International Economic Consultants (published on 5 October, 2012) found that 61% of all JobBridge finishers progressed into employment with either their host organisation or another employer within 5 months of finishing their internship. This suggests JobBridge is an appropriate labour market intervention.  Further information on outcomes will be ascertained in the final evaluation report.

There were 68,000 young unemployed, on average, in 2012, made up of 18,500 aged 15-19 and 49,500 aged 20-24. Overall, the under-25 age group had an unemployment rate of 30% (40% for 15-19 year-olds and 28% for 20-24 year-olds). This compares to an unemployment rate of 13.5% for prime age workers (ages 25&#8211;54). Of particular concern is the continued increase in the share of youth unemployed who are out of work for more than one year. They now account for 2 out of 5 all youth unemployed.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO this week indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, showed a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier. It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.</p><p>  The Government&#8217;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.</p><p>  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies.</p><p>  Looking specifically at my Department, the Back to Education Allowance scheme run by my Department provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated in the BTEA in the last academic year.</p><p>  In terms of job-search assistance, some 25,500 young people registered with Employment Services in 2012, representing 36% of all registrants.  Registering with Employment Services gives job-seekers access to guidance interviews, job search assistance, and training courses, as well as self-service job-seeking options.</p><p>  Under the National Employment Action Plan (EAP) persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social Protection and referred to Employment Services for interview with the aim of assisting them to enter/re-enter the labour market.  In 2012, there were some 33,000 referrals of under 25s to the EAP, affecting approximately 26,000 individual jobseekers (those who do not attend initially are referred again). Of those referred, 68% of clients had signed off the Live Register by the end of the year.<font color="#FF0000"> </font></p><p>  The Pathways to Work initiative has specific targets for increasing the number of people who are long-term unemployed moving into employment and reducing the average length of time spent on the Live Register.  As two out of five young unemployed are long-term unemployed, these targets are pertinent to young people.</p><p>  There are a number of schemes/programmes available that are focussed on work experience.  The most relevant for young people are JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme), and its predecessor the Work Placement Programme. Over 1,500 young people are currently participating on these schemes. The total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 was 2,700. </p><p>  Young people will also continue to benefit from the reduced rate of employer&#8217;s PRSI, the purpose of which is to support job creation, as well as from the upcoming JobsPlus initiative which will replace Revenue Job Assist and the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme. </p><p>  In the December Budget, funding was secured for an additional 10,000 places this year across a range of programmes -- including JobBridge, T&Uacute;S and Community Employment. About a quarter of these places will be earmarked to be taken up by unemployed young people.</p><p>  Finally the European Commission has proposed a Council Recommendation on a European-wide approach to a &#8220;youth guarantee. The Council Recommendation -- which received political agreement from EU employment ministers last week -- recommends that each Member State should ensure that young people receive a quality offer of employment or of continued education, an apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed. The Recommendation will also need to be adopted formally by the Council at a later stage in Ireland's Presidency -- most likely in May.</p><p>  While Member States are encouraged to implement the Recommendation as soon as possible, it is recognised that implementation will need to be more gradual in countries with higher levels of youth unemployment and particularly severe budgetary problems. In advance of the anticipated adoption of the Recommendation, the government will review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.</p><p>  Funding for measures needed to implement the guarantee &#8211; as is the case with existing programmes &#8211;  will come largely from countries' own budgetary resources, supplemented by EU funding such as the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Youth Employment Initiative which has been included in the Multiannual Financial Framework for the EU agreed recently by the Council, and will provide &#8364;6 billion for youth employment measures across the 27 Member States over the seven-year period 2014-2020.</p></reply>

The package is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  The package is currently paid to approximately 410,000 customers.  The allocation for 2013 is &#8364;284 million and the estimated expenditure on the scheme in 2012 was &#8364;372 million.  The following changes were made to the household benefits package in recent Budgets:</p><p><i>Budget 2011</i></p><p>  A saving in the household benefits budget allocation was provided for by the previous Government in Budget 2011 but the measures were not specified at the time:</p><p>- The number of free units provided under the electricity and gas allowance was reduced to the level at the start of 2007 (from 2,400 to 1,800).  This change was effective from September 2011.</p><p>- The telephone allowance was reduced to &#8364;22.22 per month (from &#8364;25.91 per month). However customers continued to receive &#8364;26.86 of value on their bills. This change was effective from September 2011.</p><p><i>Budget 2012 </i></p><p>- New applicants for carer&#8217;s allowance, who are not living with the person for whom they are providing care, are no longer entitled to household benefits. The person receiving care may be entitled to household benefits in their own right.  This change was effective from April 2012.</p><p><i>Budget 2013</i></p><p>- Electricity allowance was restructured and is now based on the average best rate (minus the PSO) available for 150 units per month from Electric Ireland, Bord Gais Eireann and Airtricity. The new rate for both the electricity and gas allowances is &#8364;35 per month. The change is effective from January 2013 and will generate savings of approximately &#8364;37.6 million in a full year.</p><p>- Telephone allowance reduced from &#8364;22.50 to &#8364;9.50 per month. This change is effective from January 2013 and will generate savings of approximately &#8364;61 million in a full year.</p><p>  The change to the electricity and gas elements of the household benefits package in Budget 2013 will bring significant savings while aiming to encourage customers to achieve better savings through greater mobility and access to the most competitive rates.  The cost of the electricity and gas allowances has risen from &#8364;110 million in 2005 to an estimated outturn of &#8364;201 million in 2012, an increase of 83% over seven years.  In the current economic climate these increases were unsustainable.  </p><p>  The Affordable Energy Strategy drew attention to the fact that customers in receipt of household benefits were much less likely than other customers to switch energy supplier to obtain better value. Only 16% of social welfare customers have switched companies compared to 42% nationally.   There will also be some administrative efficiency gained through simplification of the scheme with one payment rate instead of five.  The change to the telephone allowance is a cost saving measure. The numbers in receipt of the telephone allowance has also increased significantly in recent years, while the nature of the telephone market has been transformed with deregulation, mobile services and bundled services including television, broadband and telephone.  There is a wide variety of deals available, for example, it is possible to get a standard pay-as-you-go brand name mobile telephone for as little as &#8364;19.99 in large retailers.</p></reply>

Mr. Eugene Mc Erlean was appointed with effect from 7 September 2011 following a public request for expressions of interest from suitably qualified and experienced individuals in line with the procedures for appointment to State Boards and bodies agreed by Government in May 2011.  This appointment was processed by the Public Appointments Service (PAS), who had received a curriculum vitae from the successful applicant.  The other two appointments did not require public advertisement as one was the Department&#8217;s representative to the Board, Ms. Fiona Ward, first appointed on 1 November 2011, and the other was the CIB&#8217;s staff representative to the Board, Mr. David Stratton, who was appointed on 5 November 2012.  This was in accordance with the governing legislation: the Comhairle Act 2000, as amended by the Citizens Information Act 2007.

The Public Service Reform Programme provides for a critical review of the integration of the regulatory functions of the Pensions Board with the Financial Regulator and the merging of the Pensions Ombudsman with the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The Critical Review Group, established to carry out this review, is finalising a draft report with recommendations. </p><p><b>Social Welfare Tribunal</b></p><p>  The Board of the Social Welfare Tribunal is appointed for a three year term.  It consists of a Chairperson and four ordinary members.  Legislation provides that the four ordinary members of the Tribunal are appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) and the Irish Business Employer Confederation (IBEC), with two nominations from each. There have been 6 appointments to the board since March 2011. One of the ICTU members of the Tribunal resigned in 2011 and on ICTU&#8217;s nomination, a replacement member was appointed from 24 October 2011.  All appointments were due for renewal on 4th October 2012.

This programme has led to a significant reduction in the number of invalidity pension claims awaiting decision, down from 7007 claims at end May 2012 to 2593 claims at end Feb 2013.  In addition, new claims are now processed on receipt with a decision being made based on information provided or, if this is not possible, further medical evidence or additional information is requested and a decision is made on receipt.  </p><p>  As a consequence of the very high number of decisions made in the last 9 months, there has been a corresponding substantial increase in the number of appeals being received.  Delays in the preparation of claims for appeal are arising as a consequence and this is regretted. Invalidity pension section is now focussed on reducing the backlog in the appeals area.  In addition, delays have developed in the processing of medical assessments and reviews due to a combination of factors including the increased workload for medical assessors and the reduced number of medical assessors due to retirements. The Department is addressing this issue and has recently run a competition to establish a new panel of medical assessors.  Three new medical assessors were appointed from this panel and all commenced work in November 2012.  It is expected that a further 8 medical assessors will be appointed from the panel in the near future.  </p><p>  With regard to the specific claim mentioned; this department received a claim for invalidity pension for the person concerned on 11 August 2011.  The claim was disallowed on medical grounds and the person in question was notified of this decision and the reason for it on 13 February 2012. </p><p>  The person concerned appealed the decision and sent in further medical evidence in support of the claim.  This additional evidence, along with the original information, was referred for medical opinion on the 24 May 2012. It was evaluated by a different medical assessor on 21 January 2013 who has confirmed the opinion that the person concerned does not satisfy the medical criteria.  Upon receipt of this opinion, the deciding officer forwarded all the relevant claim papers to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) for determination on 11 February 2013.  The SWAO will be in touch with the person in question directly regarding the progress of their appeal.</p></reply>

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).  </p><p>  In 2011 I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.  The Advisory Group is charged with, inter alia, examining and reporting on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed.  </p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.  The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&ndash;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.  The report of the Actuarial Review found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  Therefore in terms of the pension entitlements, the report concludes that the self-employed achieve very good value for money in terms of the PRSI contributions paid.   </p><p>  The Review also addressed the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contributions rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.  The Review found that an incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.</p><p>  Any proposals to revise the social insurance system for self-employed persons by extending social insurance entitlements will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  </p><p>  Self-employed workers whose businesses fail or suffer from reduced demand or who do not have constant or continuous employment, may access social welfare support by establishing entitlement to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. </p><p>  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the unemployed and keep jobseekers close to the labour market. These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies. Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy is to keep those on the Live Register close to the labour market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. Persons from the Live Register availing of activation measures will get an opportunity to engage in employment, training and work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves. As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time</p><p>  In this context, the major elements of this Department&#8217;s response are set out in the Pathways to Work policy which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created are filled by people from the Live Register, with a particular focus on those who are long term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment. </p><p>  There are a number of schemes/programmes available that are focussed on work experience<b>.</b>  The most relevant for young people are JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme), and its predecessor the Work Placement Programme. Some 5,800 people are currently participating on these schemes. The total number of starters on JobBridge during 2012 was 9,575. The findings of the interim evaluation of JobBridge, The National Internship Scheme by Indecon International Economic Consultants (published &#8211; 5th October 2012) found that 61% of finishers secured employment within five months of completing their internship. These progression rates compare favourably with European averages in this area and represent very significant progress in a short period of time.  </p><p>  The JobsPlus incentive scheme will encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. The new incentive will be payable monthly in arrears, over a 2-year period. There will be 2 levels of incentive: &#8364;7,500 for recruits unemployed for more than 12 but less than 24 months and &#8364;10,000 for recruits unemployed for more than 24 months. This new incentive will replace the Revenue Job Assist and the Employer PRSI Incentive schemes.</p><p>  In addition, the Department also manages a number of schemes providing temporary employment for the long-term unemployed on works and services of value to the community. There are currently 26,000 people participating on Community Employment and T&uacute;s. As part of Budget 2013, the Government approved 10,000 new places across CE, T&Uacute;S, JobBridge and a new social employment scheme with the Local Authorities.</p><p>  In terms of up-skilling, the Back to Education Allowance scheme run by my Department provides income maintenance, along with a contribution to education costs, for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 25,800 people participated in the BTEA in the last academic year.  Some 61% of recipients pursued third level courses while 39% pursued courses described as being at second level. A majority of the second-level courses are Post Leaving Cert (PLC courses) undertaken in the further education sector. Just under 6% of the second-level option group (or 2% of all BTEA participants) were pursuing courses at or below Leaving Certificate level.</p><p>  Up-skilling options are also available under TESG (Technical Employment Support Grant) and TATS (Technical Assistance and Training scheme). There were just under 17,000 beneficiaries of TATS/TESG in 2011. Both TESG and TATS are designed to allow DSP to offer flexible additional help (in the form of access to training, advice, or support for the purchase of certain goods and services) to a number of categories of unemployed people. TESG support can be for purchase of training (where this cannot be provided by a state provider within a reasonable time) or for certain other expenditures such as purchase of tools, travel costs to job interviews. Training, with limited exceptions, must be on certified courses. TATs is more focused on jobseekers with an interest in self-employment, and can assist with the purchase of training/education/mentoring, equipment, advertising, and public liability insurance. </p><p>  Two further up-skilling options available are the Part-time Education Option (PTEO) and Education Training and Development Option (ET&amp;D). Both PTEO and ET&amp;D are designed to facilitate jobseekers who wish to engage in part time day, evening or weekend courses or more intensive short duration courses of education and training while retaining their jobseeker&#8217;s payments. </p><p>  The PTEO allows participants to attend part-time day/evening or weekend courses of education or training and retain their jobseeker&#8217;s payment while an entitlement exists provided that they continue to satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking employment on an on-going basis. Payment is made at the same rate as the primary payment and no maximisation of payments occurs. The ET&amp;D allows participants to attend certain courses of education, training or development of short duration and retain their jobseeker&#8217;s payment while an entitlement exists. Participants are exempt from engaging in job search but must be available for employment should an opportunity arise.</p></reply>

The decision to increase State pension age was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.  The standardisation of State pension age to age 66 is one of the measures planned which aims to improve the sustainability of the Irish pension system. As provided for in legislation, State pension age will further increase to age 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  These changes were provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011.  Estimates at that time indicated that the gross estimated savings in 2014 were expected to be in the region of  &euro;30 million with a full year savings in 2015 of approximately &euro;60 million.  These savings take into account claimants who would instead receive various other social welfare payments, including jobseeker benefits.</p></reply>

It also aims to increase engagement and incentivise employers to provide more jobs for people who are unemployed.  One of the most significant elements of the Pathways to Work approach is the profiling of the Department&rsquo;s clients to inform the approach taken to activation, and in particular to target those who are most likely to become long-term unemployed and to provide appropriate interventions at the earliest possible stage. Profiling of new claimants is now operational in all DSP offices;  53,800 new claimants were profiled to the end of 2012. </p><p>  Further information about the Department&rsquo;s clients is captured in follow up one-to-one meetings and in group engagement sessions with the Department. All of the information gathered about a client can be used to connect a client of the Department to the activation measures that will best suit their circumstances, including access to one of the Department&rsquo;s schemes or assistance in getting a job.</p><p>  The Department is also committed to increasing and enhancing its direct engagement with employers at local level and as part of the development of Intreo. A dedicated Employer Engagement Unit has been established and an Employer Engagement Manager is available in each region to support and advise employers at each stage of the employment process including the advertisement of opportunities and sourcing potential candidates from the Live Register. During Autumn 2012, a series of employer briefings were held nationwide to provide employers with practical advice and assistance on the full range of employment and financial supports available from the Department.  Partly arising from feedback received at these briefings, the Department has developed a new recruitment incentive to encourage employers to recruit employees from the live register. This new incentive &ldquo;Jobs Plus&rdquo; was announced as part of the Action Plan for Jobs and will be launched for availability in July 2013.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are approximately 87,000 recipients of rent supplement for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million in 2013.  </p><p>  It is essential that State support for rents are kept under review and do not distort the wider rental market in a way that could increase rent prices for others, such as low paid workers and students. Approximately 48,700 rent supplement claims were awarded during 2012, showing that accommodation can be secured within the current limits. Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.  The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country. The next review of rent limits will be undertaken before June 2013 and any changes to the existing limits will be considered as part of this review. </p><p>  The Government has two initiatives to deal with long term reliance on rent supplement, the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) which has been in operation since 2005  and the new Housing Assistance Payment which will be piloted later this year. These initiatives will reduce the numbers of persons who are in receipt of long term rent supplement and will return the rent supplement scheme to its original purpose, that of a short term income support for those who have become temporarily unemployed.

It is the Department&rsquo;s policy that every effort is made to prevent overpayments but, where they occur, they should be regarded as a debt to the Exchequer and every effort must be made to recover the amounts through all available means.  Those clients who are aware that they are being - or have been - overpaid by my Department should contact their local social welfare office immediately.  An overpayment recovery plan, acceptable both to the customer and to the Department, will then be agreed.  The general approach is that the recovery amount proposed will be the maximum repayment that the debtor can afford in order to recover the overpayment as quickly as possible.</p><p>  My Department is fully committed to recovering 100% of overpayments.  Debt holders should be aware that a departmental debt will remain on their records until fully recovered and will result in a reduction of all future entitlements up to and including state pension.  Following the death of a customer who owes a debt, the Department will have a claim on any estate remaining. </p><p>  In the context of the Fraud Initiative 2011 &ndash; 2013, the Department is reviewing its overall approach to debt recovery.  Effective debt recovery is seen as an integral part of the deterrent to fraudulent claiming.  In this regard, section 13 of the Social Welfare Act, 2012, allows for a deduction of up to 15% from a person&rsquo;s weekly personal rate to be deducted for the purposes of recovering an overpayment.  It is not the Department&rsquo;s intention to make deductions that are likely to visit hardship on beneficiaries.  The new provisions preserve a minimum entitlement of up to 85% of a beneficiary&rsquo;s personal payment in all cases of overpayment, leaving increases for dependants intact.  It is envisaged that this measure, along with a range of other options that are currently being considered by the Department, will serve to minimise overpayments in the future, as well as increasing the rate of recoveries where overpayments arise.</p></reply>

There were 68,000 young unemployed, on average, in 2012, made up of 18,500 aged 15-19 and 49,500 aged 20-24. Overall, the under-25 age group had an unemployment rate of 30% (40% for 15-19 year-olds and 28% for 20-24 year-olds). This compares to an unemployment rate of 13.5% for prime age workers (ages 25&ndash;54). Of particular concern is the continued increase in the share of youth unemployed who are out of work for more than one year. They now account for two out of five all youth unemployed.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO last week indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, showed a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier. It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.</p><p>  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies.</p><p>  Looking specifically at my Department, the Back to Education Allowance scheme run by my Department provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated in the BTEA in the last academic year. The qualifying period for BTEA is 3 months on the live register for second-level courses and 9 months on the live register for third-level courses.</p><p>  In terms of job-search assistance, some 25,500 young people registered with Employment Services in 2012, representing 36% of all registrants.  Registering with Employment Services gives job-seekers access to guidance interviews, job search assistance, and training courses, as well as self-service job-seeking options. </p><p>  Under the National Employment Action Plan (EAP) persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social Protection and referred to Employment Services for interview with the aim of assisting them to enter/re-enter the labour market.  In 2012, there were some 33,000 referrals of under 25s to the EAP, affecting approximately 26,000 individual jobseekers (those who do not attend initially are referred again). Of those referred, 68% of clients had signed off the Live Register by the end of the year. </p><p>  The Pathways to Work initiative has specific targets for increasing the number of people who are long-term unemployed moving into employment and reducing the average length of time spent on the Live Register.  As two out of five young unemployed are long-term unemployed, these targets are pertinent to young people.</p><p>  There are a number of schemes/programmes available that are focussed on work experience.  The most relevant for young people are JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme), and its predecessor the Work Placement Programme. Over 1,500 young people are currently participating on these schemes. The total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 was 2,700. </p><p>  Long-term unemployed youth will also benefit from the JobsPlus initiative which is designed to encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. Under this scheme the State will pay &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the employer to recruit a person off the Live Register. This new incentive will replace the Revenue Job Assist and the Employer PRSI Incentive schemes.</p><p>  In the December Budget, funding was secured for an additional 10,000 places this year across a range of programmes -- including JobBridge, T&Uacute;S and Community Employment. About a quarter of these places are expected to be taken up by unemployed young people.</p><p>  Finally the European Commission has proposed a Council Recommendation on a European-wide approach to a &ldquo;youth guarantee&rdquo;. The Council Recommendation -- which received political agreement from EU employment ministers last week -- recommends that each Member State should ensure that young people receive a quality offer of employment or of continued education, an apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed. The Recommendation will also need to be adopted formally by the Council at a later stage in Ireland's Presidency -- most likely in May.</p><p>  While Member States are encouraged to implement the Recommendation as soon as possible, it is recognised that implementation will need to be more gradual in countries with higher levels of youth unemployment and particularly severe budgetary problems. In advance of the anticipated adoption of the Recommendation, the government will review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.</p><p>  Funding for measures needed to implement the guarantee &ndash; as is the case with existing programmes &ndash;  will come largely from countries' own budgetary resources, supplemented by EU funding such as the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Youth Employment Initiative which has been included in the Multiannual Financial Framework for the EU agreed recently by the Council, and will provide &euro;6 billion for youth employment measures across the 27 Member States over the seven-year period 2014-2020.</p></reply>

This includes approximately 800 cases which are being investigated under EU regulations or bi-lateral agreements. These cases are more complex and take longer to decide.  A targeted plan was put in place to clear the backlog, which is steadily decreasing - from 7,007 at end May 2012 to 4,561 at end of October 2012 and to 2,593 at the end of February 2013.  Approximately 220 new invalidity pension claims are received in the Department each week. These are examined on receipt and a decision is completed where all information is available. If a medical assessment and/or further information is required, it is requested without delay.  Once all the necessary information is received, the claim is processed.  Where a claim is disallowed and the customer requests a review of the decision or appeals the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, this requires an additional amount of time to finalise.</p></reply>

Where an adverse decision is made by a deciding officer, the option of such a review is offered to the customer in addition to the statutory right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).  Where a case is pending appeal and there is a change of circumstances or additional evidence available, a deciding officer will first review the claim to see if a revised decision is warranted before the case is sent to the SWAO for determination.  A total of 474 invalidity pension cases were decided in this way in 2012; 345 in 2011 and 185 in 2010.</p><p>  In addition a customer may, following disallowance, request that the decision be reviewed by a deciding officer instead of or prior to submitting an appeal.   I am informed that many customers avail of this option and decisions are often reviewed in this manner without the need to proceed through the formal appeal process.  However, statistics of these revised decisions on invalidity pension claims are not maintained.</p><p>  A structured programme to address significant backlogs in claim applications has been underway in this scheme area over the last number of months.  The term &lsquo;special projects&rsquo; is a temporary one in use during this period to reflect cases which had been at least 1 year on illness benefit but which were initially disallowed invalidity pension because they were deemed not to satisfy the condition of being expected to be incapable of work for a further year.  Because of the backlogs in place and the consequent delays involved in claims proceeding to review or appeal, a number of these cases can now be deemed to have fulfilled the condition of being incapable for work for 1 year.  These cases are being reviewed by deciding officers with a view to possible revised decision.  These cases arose as a direct result of the backlog elimination and will not continue to occur once the backlog of appeals cases has been cleared.  It is expected that the backlog of invalidity pension cases awaiting appeal submission will be cleared by end Q2 2013.</p></reply>

IFI&rsquo;s research indicates that CS No. 61 of 29 June 1910, set the close season for salmon fishing by single rod and line, in all rivers and their tributaries flowing into the sea between Dunmore Head and Dromgorm Point, both in &lsquo;No.7 or Killarney District&rsquo;, in Co. Kerry.  This closed season was set from the 1 November each year to the 16 March in the following year, inclusive.  The opening date would therefore appear to be 17 March each year. </p><p>  IFI further advise that Under the Salmon and Trout Conservation Bye-Law No.623 of 1981 the beginning of the annual close season was amended to 1 October in each year.  The closed season for salmon fishing by rod and line in the River Maine/Brown Flesk and its tributaries is 1 October each year until 16 March in the following year, both dates inclusive.  This bye-law did not affect the opening date which remained at 17 March.  I can therefore clarify for the Deputy that it would appear that the opening date of the River Maine/Brown Flesk and its tributaries has not changed for more than 100 years.  IFI&rsquo;s advice on this matter is that in practice there is little point in this fishery opening before the 17th March due to the late run nature of the fish in the river and the risk of early anglers harming recovering kelts on their return to the sea.</p></reply>

In line with this commitment, my Department is involved in the ongoing analysis and policy development work that is necessary in advance of the implementation of any changes that may be required.</p><p>  The replacement of the existing funding system based on the collection of television licence fees with one based on the imposition of device-independent charge on eligible households and businesses is a complex process and the logistics involved require thorough attention.  Issues such as identifying the most appropriate collection method, exemptions and enforcement mechanics require detailed consideration and all have a bearing on the timeframe for implementation.  My Department is currently carrying out a Value for Money Policy Review conducted by an independently chaired group on the proposed policy.  I expect to receive a copy of the group&rsquo;s recommendations and report for my consideration by the end of March.</p><p>  It should be noted that although subject to a degree of evasion, the existing TV licence fee system has provided a stable funding base for our public service broadcasters.  The rationale for providing State funding for public service broadcasting is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their public service objects while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence.  This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.  The overall aim of Public Service Broadcasting is to provide services and content which cater for all interests in society, while ensuring that the varied elements of Irish culture and its intrinsic values are protected.</p><p>  Through the statutory obligations placed on the Public Service Broadcasters and the criteria set for the funding of content through the Sound &amp; Vision Scheme, which is funded from licence fee revenue, the production of quality indigenous programming and the production of minority interest programming is strongly promoted via the current funding regime.  Whatever the system of funding, the rationale for providing funding will continue to apply and any changes that may be implemented must continue to provide a secure funding base for public service broadcasting and content.  It is also important that any changes to the system of funding should take account of the reality of new mechanisms to access such content and services and the pervasiveness of such content in today&rsquo;s society. </p><p>  Publicly-funded public service broadcasting and content are now available to everyone on an ever-increasing range of platforms and devices and, in fact, access is not dependent on the ownership of a device.  In short, everyone benefits from the availability of these services, regardless of how content is accessed or relayed to the public, and, therefore, it is my view that the cost should be borne by society as a whole.  This underlines the rationale for a household based broadcasting charge.  All households and businesses will be subject to the charge, except for those that are specifically exempted.  The issue of exemptions under any new Irish system is one which will have to be given detailed consideration when the type of model to be developed is agreed.  That said, it is my expectation that the current exemptions in relation to pensioners and those entitled to the Household Benefit Package will continue to apply.</p></reply>

Decisions relating to the provision of broadband services in any particular area, including the upgrading of telephone exchanges, are commercial decisions for the commercial service providers.  I have no statutory power to compel any service provider to offer higher levels of broadband service at any particular location.  The State only becomes involved in the provision of services in instances of clear market failure, such as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS).</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  Ireland is now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband in Ireland which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.</p><p>  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  This will ensure that citizens or businesses, wherever they are located, have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business in a global digital environment.  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to in the Plan, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including Ardagh, County Longford, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

The objective of the NBS is to deliver broadband to certain target areas in Ireland in which broadband services were deemed to be insufficient.  Since October 2010, &#8220;3&#8221; has made broadband services available in all of the 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) designated to be covered under the Scheme.  Lauragh, Co. Kerry is included in the NBS and broadband services are available to all residents and businesses who seek a service in the area.</p><p>  Following the recent contractual upgrade to the NBS mobile broadband product specifications, the minimum download speed increased from 1.6Mbps to 2.3Mbps while the minimum upload speeds increased from 1.2Mbps to 1.4Mbps, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 18:1.  The combined data allowance increased from 25GB to 40GB.  As foreseen in the NBS contract, &#8220;3&#8221; may, for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, deploy a satellite solution in a limited number of cases.</p><p>  My Department has put in place robust monitoring arrangements to ensure that the NBS network delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  Performance delivery data, which is submitted to my Department on a monthly basis, or as required, is critically analysed.  The monitoring arrangements provide information on a wide range of key indicators including, the broadband excess availability in each cell of the network, the number of customers resident in that cell and actual contention and latency values.  Utilisation thresholds are set for each element of the network and upgrades of the network and its capacity are automatically triggered at contractually agreed levels of traffic to ensure that the quality of the broadband service is maintained.</p><p>  My Department is satisfied that the NBS service supplied by &#8220;3&#8221; in the Lauragh area, is within the contractually agreed specification of the scheme.  &#8220;3&#8221; have advised my officials that there are no current plans for additional infrastructure or network upgrades in the area.  Any NBS customer experiencing problems with the NBS service, in the Lauragh area, can contact 3&#8217;s customer care centre 24 hours a day 7 days a week by phone at 1913 (free of charge) or via email to .  A team of field engineers has been established to address NBS specific maintenance issues at customers&#8217; premises.</p><p>  My Department has a role where customers have fully utilised the established complaints process and consider that their complaint has not been resolved.  My officials operate a dedicated NBS mailbox, which NBS customers can contact by email at , with any comments or complaints they may have about their NBS service.</p><p>  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&#8217;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013, and the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&#8217;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&#8217;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&#8217;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.</p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to in the Plan, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including Lauragh, Co. Kerry, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

In that regard, I was pleased to launch the first Carbon Monoxide Awareness Week on the 24th September 2012.  The Awareness Week saw a sustained, multi-media publicity campaign to alert people to the dangers posed by carbon monoxide and to give them advice as to what they should do to be safe.  The issue was widely reported on television, on national and local radio and in both national and local press.

It goes beyond this recommendation by providing that the expenditure of parties is also reported and open to public scrutiny.  The Tribunal recommended that all political donations, apart from those under a modest threshold, be disclosed.  The threshold at which donations must be declared by a political party to the Standards in Public Office Commission will fall from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;1,500 for donation statements made on or after 1 April 2013. The declaration threshold for a donation received by a candidate or elected representative has been reduced from &euro;634.87 to &euro;600 for donation statements made on or after 1 February 2013.  There is a reduction from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;200 in the threshold at which donations must be reported by companies, trade unions, societies and building societies in their annual reports or returns made on or after 7 November 2013.  In addition, with effect from 1 February 2013, the threshold for donors other than companies, trade unions, societies and building societies, in reporting donations to the Standards in Public Office Commission, has been reduced from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;1,500 for aggregate donations given in the same year.</p><p>  The Moriarty Tribunal in its Report noted that the desirability and feasibility of a complete ban on private political funding is pre-eminently a matter for the Oireachtas, and for public debate and consideration, having regard to constitutional issues that might arise and to the national financial exigencies.  With reference to this comment in the Tribunal Report, a noteworthy provision in the Act is the introduction of a ban on the acceptance of donations over &euro;200 for political purposes from a corporate donor unless the donor has registered with the Standards in Public Office Commission.  This came into effect on 1 January 2013.  The Government&rsquo;s objective is to restrict the influence of corporate donors.  Such donations also need to be accompanied by a statement confirming that the donation has been approved by a general meeting of the members of the body, or by its trustees.</p><p>  The Act provides for a reduction in the maximum amount that can be accepted as a political donation by an individual from &euro;2,539.48 to &euro;1,000.  This &euro;1,000 limit will apply in respect of donations to a member of either House of the Oireachtas, a Member of the European Parliament or a member of a local authority, as well as a candidate at a Presidential, D&aacute;il, Seanad, European Parliament or local election.  The maximum amount that can be accepted as a donation by a political party, an accounting unit of a political party or a third party has been reduced from &euro;6,348.69 to &euro;2,500. These new limits came into effect on 1 January 2013.  This Act significantly enhances the openness and transparency of political funding in Ireland, issues that were central to the recommendations made in the Moriarty Tribunal Report.</p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.  However, in recent years local authorities have been urged by my Department to exercise restraint or, where possible, to reduce commercial rates.  Local authorities have responded well to such requests.  The latest available figures indicate that ARVs for 2013 have decreased nationwide on average by 0.33% compared to 2012.  This follows a similar decrease of 0.31% in 2012, 0.64% in 2011 and 0.62% in 2010.</p><p>  Local authorities have a leading role at local level in creating a pro-enterprise supportive environment to generate new jobs and sustain existing ones.  They are committed to local economic development, and are well placed to respond to many of the needs of businesses, in terms of infrastructure, local promotion and other key enabling measures.  Under the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>, the local government sector has developed a sectoral strategy, <i><i>Supporting Economic Recovery and Jobs &#8211; Locally,</i></i><b></b>to promote employment and support local enterprise, including measures in the area of business charges, local enterprise and business support arrangements, procurement support, local development and community based initiatives, the Green Economy and participation in employment support schemes.  I recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and I am continuing to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration in my Department.</p></reply>

The Government's housing policy statement published in June 2011 marked a radical departure for housing in Ireland.  The statement clearly recognises the economic consequences of an over reliance on the property sector.  It signalled a shift to a tenure neutral high level objective, and a clear commitment to restoring balance to the housing sector generally through a lesser reliance on home ownership.  The statement also announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes on the basis that these had been symptoms of, rather than solutions to, an overheated property market.  A consultancy study for purposes of a review of Part V of the Planning and Development Acts has been carried out and I will publish the strategy in the near future.</p><p>  In terms of planning, I recently issued guidance to planning authorities to update the way in which development contributions schemes are used to capture planning gain.  The Government is also keenly aware of the strong synergy between a balanced, evidence based approach to forward planning and overcoming our economic challenges to prepare for recovery.  In this regard, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act, 2010 has strengthened regional co-ordination and the alignment of planning policies from national to local level, with the integration of core strategies; local authorities are engaging with the legislation and recognise the need for a plan-led approach for all proposed development.  The requirement to include evidence-based core strategies in development plans is essential in rationalising the excessive zoning in some parts of the country, and moving to a position where all zoning is based on a quantifiable need that is community based rather than developer-led.</p><p>  I am committed to a physical planning system that is better supported by: evidence-based requirements linked to key Government strategic policies e.g. through the National Spatial Strategy and capital allocations; a coherent basis to ensure planning and investment in infrastructure and services are focused on the most suitable locations; tackling the legacy of over-zoning and moving towards a more joined up approach to the delivery of critical services such as schools, public transport, water services and social housing; refocusing on revitalising city and town centres, and discouraging urban sprawl; engaging more directly with elected members at a strategic level by requiring them to bring together, in a concise manner, the key priorities of their development plan; and providing the necessary certainty about where development will take place.</p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants in the private rented residential sector.</p><p>  Following a review of the Act in 2009 the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No 2) Bill 2012 was published on 19 July 2012 and Second Stage in the D&aacute;il concluded on 24 January 2013.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012 builds on what has been achieved by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and by the PRTB and provides for the further development of the rental sector into the future.  Among the main issues addressed by the amending legislation are the extension of the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act to Approved Housing Body tenancies; the Board of the PRTB to be reduced from 15 to 12 members; the separation of the governance and quasi-judicial functions of the Board; the merger of the PRTB and the Rent Tribunal; the simplification and streamlining of the mediation process.</p><p>  While the Bill addresses a wide range of issues, there are some other aspects still under development which I hope to bring forward for consideration during the Bill's passage through the Oireachtas.  In particular, I intend to provide for the establishment of a deposit protection scheme to address the illegal retention of tenants' deposits by landlords.  I also hope to address a number of other key on-going concerns within the sector such as the over holding of rented property by tenants.</p></reply>

For national road schemes, potential noise emissions are addressed as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment process undertaken by, or on behalf of, the National Roads Authority.  In addition, the Environmental Noise Directive (END) 2002/49/EC sets out certain requirements for the assessment and management of environmental noise from transport sources, including the making of strategic noise maps and action plans.  It is important to note, however, that the Directive does not set binding limit values, nor does it prescribe the measures to be included in the action plans, leaving those issues at the discretion of the national competent authorities.</p><p>  The END was transposed into national law by the Environmental Noise Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 140 of 2006).  The Regulations set out a two-stage process for addressing environmental noise.  Firstly, noise must be assessed through the preparation of strategic noise maps for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria.  Secondly, based on the results of the mapping process, the Regulations require the preparation of noise action plans for each area concerned.  The fundamental objective of action plans is the prevention and reduction of environmental noise.  The Regulations designate noise mapping bodies and action planning authorities for the making of strategic noise maps and action plans.  Primary responsibility for both noise mapping and action planning is assigned to local authorities.  For the Dublin Agglomeration, distinct noise maps have been produced for all roads as well as <font color="#263137">a related</font>   noise action plan for the period July 2008 to November 2013.  The Regulations require noise mapping bodies to periodically review and revise noise maps.  A new round of noise mapping was conducted during 2012. Individual maps, along with details on the revised population exposure statistics, can be viewed at the following link: .</p><p>  The production of the revised noise maps is the first step in the review of the noise action plan for the Dublin Agglomeration, which is to be completed by July 2013.  The draft Noise Action Plan will shortly be made available for public consultation on the websites of the Dublin-based local authorities, with notices being placed in newspapers, inviting submissions from interested parties for consideration before the Plan is finalised.  Further information in respect of the Palmerstown area may be obtained from the Environmental Health Section of South Dublin County Council, by email at or phone (01) 4149000.</p></reply>

Irish Water will be working in partnership with local authorities to achieve its aims.  It is envisaged that in developing investment plans for public water services, Irish Water will take account of the requirements flowing from the programmes of measures in River Basin Management Plans, and the need to support economic and regional development. The relationship between Irish Water and local authorities in the water services investment planning process and in relation to local economic development will be addressed under the Implementation Strategy.

No. 326 of 2012) provide for a ban on the marketing, sale distribution and burning of bituminous fuel inside specified ban areas. The main legislative provisions of the Regulations that apply inside such ban areas include:   </p><p><b>- a ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous fuel;</b></p><p><b>- a requirement to sell solid fuel in sealed bags with a printed notice;  </b></p><p><b>- a requirement to maintain a register, if storing bituminous fuel for the purpose of placing on the market or on sale at a separate location outside the ban area;</b></p><p><b>- transportation of bituminous fuel in minimum quantities of 3 metric tonnes in Dublin or 1 tonne inside other ban areas; and</b></p><p><b>- retention of records by drivers of vehicles transporting bituminous fuel, detailing the type of fuel on board, who supplied it and where it is being transported to.</b></p><p>  The sale of prohibited fuels within the ban area is strictly forbidden and there are no circumstances that allow for exceptions.  The Regulations do not permit sales from a premises inside a ban area to customers who claim to live outside the ban area.  Allowing for such a practice would completely undermine the effectiveness of the Regulations and enforcement efforts.  The provisions allowing for storage and transport of bituminous fuel inside ban areas facilitate the upstream movement of product within the supply chain.  A person or body storing bituminous fuel inside a ban area may only place such fuel on the market, provided that the point of sale to the end user (i.e. where the product is exchanged and paid for) is at a location outside the ban area. </p><p>  My Department issued a circular letter to all local authorities on 14 February 2013 in respect of consistent implementation of the Regulations.  The circular advised local authorities on the conditions applying to storage and transport of bituminous fuel inside ban areas and that these conditions do not permit retail sales of bituminous fuel to residential customers from premises inside the ban areas.</p></reply>

The water metering programme will cover households connected to a public water supply.  Households in group schemes will not be metered under the programme.  Some group water schemes currently purchase water from water services authorities.  In such cases the distribution network remains under the control of the group scheme.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-05a.845.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030500075#WRR03200"><p>The ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous fuel (or &#8216;smoky coal ban&#8217; as it is commonly known) was first introduced in Dublin in 1990 in response to severe episodes of winter smog that resulted from the widespread use of smoky coal for residential heating.  Air quality monitoring carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows that the ban proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in Dublin.  The ban was subsequently extended to other urban areas and currently applies in twenty cities and towns. <font color="#333333"> </font></p><p>  On 31 August 2012, following a public consultation process, I gave effect to new consolidating solid fuel regulations, the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012.  Some improved and updated provisions were introduced that will help to ensure that the Regulations remain fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of residential fuels.  These are as follows:   </p><p>- most existing smoky coal ban area boundaries were revised to take recent urban development into account;     </p><p>- seven new  towns are being added to the ban from May 2013 - Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge, Portlaoise and Wicklow Town; and  </p><p>- a prohibition on the burning of bituminous fuel was provided for to complement the established ban on its marketing, sale and distribution.    </p><p>  In addition to the recent regulatory improvements, a closer alignment of solid fuel policy and legislation on an all-island basis would aid enforcement, protect air quality standards and allow the benefits derived from the ban to potentially be further extended.  This is an issue that I am discussing further with my Northern Ireland counterpart through engagement under the North South Ministerial Council. </p><p>  Products offered for sale in breach of the Regulations may often be of inferior quality, creating more pollution within a person&#8217;s home and in their community.  The burning of solid fuel for residential heating makes a disproportionate contribution to air pollution, which generally occurs within communities where exposure, including to vulnerable groups, can be highest.  In addition to gas and oil, there is a wide range of modern smokeless coals and other products available that are cleaner, easy to burn, and which generally provide more energy per bag and more consistent heat over a longer period with both consumer and environmental benefits. </p><p>  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources publication, <i><i>Warmer Homes: Strategy for Affordable Energy in Ireland</i></i><i>, </i>recognises that there is a greater incidence of energy poverty in<i></i>those households reliant on solid fuel.  Accordingly, the <i>Warmer Homes</i> programme aims to alleviate<i></i>energy poverty by funding social enterprises to upgrade insulation in low-income households<i></i>with benefits for air quality, climate policy and the social economy, as well as cost savings to<i></i>the consumer as a result of the more efficient use of fuel.   </p></reply>

I hope to bring the Heads of a new Bill, provisionally entitled the Gambling Control Bill, to the Government soon, for its approval and for authorisation to have a Bill drafted. I am proposing that the new Bill should replace current systems. It will be a comprehensive measure, establishing a single regulatory regime to cover betting and gaming, whether by terrestrial or remote means and will include gambling on virtual and actual events.</p><p>  My plans to reform the law on gambling arose from the realisation that the current laws are seriously outdated and need replacement by new statutory provisions that address current practices and lifestyles. The new legislation will have consumer protection as its  core objective, with particular emphasis on the protection of vulnerable persons, which, of course, includes young persons.  I will be including measures that will require licence holders to act in a socially responsible way. The measures will include controls on advertising, promotions and sponsorship.  I envisage the creation under the new legislation of, in effect, a new inspectorate to promote compliance and it will have a full range of enforcement powers.  I plan to make the Heads available on my Department's website following their approval by the Government, while formal drafting is under way.</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and have been informed that the Courts Service has been reviewing all aspects of its organisational and operational structures throughout the country with the specific objective of ensuring that the Service can continue to maintain the delivery of front line court services and an appropriate level of service to court users.  I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review and that Birr courthouse has been identified as a venue to be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case.</p><p>  In this context the Courts Service has established a general framework within which such venues are being assessed taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue which has now commenced.  However, the Courts Service has assured me that no decision in relation to the future of Birr Courthouse will be taken without prior consultation with local interested parties and court users.  This consultation has commenced and the views received will be taken into account in the decision making process which will be a matter for the Courts Service Board.</p></reply>

My Department has, meanwhile, being preparing Heads of a new Bill, provisionally entitled the Gambling Control Bill, and I am pleased to tell the  Deputy that I hope to bring those Heads to the Government soon for approval and for authorisation to have a Bill formally drafted.  It is my intention, subject to the agreement of the Government, to publish the Heads on my Department's website following their approval by the Government and while formal drafting is underway.</p><p>  On the specific question about the regulation of casinos, the Government agreed that the new legislation should provide for the licensing of modest sized casinos: it decided against permitting the larger 'resort' style casinos.   The new Gambling Control Bill will therefore include arrangements for the licensing and operation of casinos. It is my intention that the new Bill should establish a comprehensive inspection and compliance regime. The Bill will indicate the maximum number to be permitted as well as determining the maximum permitted size.</p><p>  The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that, currently, casino gaming is prohibited by section 4(1) of the Gaming &amp; Lotteries Act 1956, as amended. As a result, casinos cannot be licensed. Nevertheless, there are numerous 'private members clubs' offering, in effect, casino gaming. Prosecutions for breaches of section 4(1) have been brought but have been unsuccessful. The 'clubs' therefore continue to exploit ambiguities in the present law but the new Bill will address these and other matters that have come to light. Following its enactment, only casinos holding a licence under the new law will be permitted.  Although not licensed, the private members clubs are required by the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 to register with my Department's anti-money laundering compliance unit. That unit conducts inspections of these premises to assess compliance with the 2010 Act.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that a degree of flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is essential to the efficient management of the Garda fleet.  The detailed allocation of vehicles is determined through a process of ongoing analysis of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's operational requirements and of current policing strategies in place at both Divisional and Regional levels. This process enables Garda management to deploy available resources in the most effective manner to ensure that the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p></reply>

These undertakings complement those structural reforms in the EU/IMF/ECB Troika Programme of Financial Support for Ireland aimed at removing restrictions to trade and competition in the provision of legal services and at the reform of the legal costs regime.</p><p>  Effect is being given to these structural reform commitments in the form of the extensive provisions of the Legal Services Bill 2011 which remains a priority under the Government Legislation Programme, has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il  and is currently awaiting Committee Stage - the Deputy will recall that priority also had to be given to the enactment of the Personal Insolvency Bill by the end of last year as a competing Troika programme objective.  In meeting the concerns raised by the Deputy, the Legal Services Regulation Bill has four main levers of modernisation and reform, namely,</p><p>- a new, independent, Legal Services Regulatory Authority with responsibility for oversight of both solicitors and barristers.</p><p>- an independent complaints system to deal with public complaints including those relating to professional misconduct. There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners&#8217; Disciplinary Tribunal to deal with both legal professions.</p><p><b>-</b> an Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator that will assume the role of the existing Taxing-Master. The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated and two new Taxing-Masters have already been appointed in anticipation of this reform. Determinations of costs made by the Adjudicator will be made public and the Adjudicator may also publish legal costs guidelines. Separately, the Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a set of Legal Costs Principles. It also imposes greater obligations on legal practitioners to disclose the actual or potential costs of legal proceedings to their clients.</p><p>-  a framework for Alternative Business Models. The Bill facilitates new forms of legal services provision that take account of the emergent new business models in other common law jurisdictions and the huge advances made in business technology.  These new or &quot;alternative&quot; business structures will be optional alongside current forms of practise and their availability will address a growing competitive disadvantage for our legal services sector.</p><p>  Detailed preparation of the Legal Services Regulation Bill is ongoing at my Department in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel.  As I have previously indicated, amendments to the Bill will be made available for consideration prior to the commencement of Committee Stage which is anticipated during the coming Session.</p></reply>

The Deputy will recall that, following extensive consideration of this matter, the Government announced in December 2011 that it had decided not to proceed with such legislation.  There was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Government was strongly of the view that payment of compensation to landlords in such circumstances could not be justified in the current economic climate.</p><p>  Although legislative intervention may not be feasible, NAMA is playing a role in dealing with problems caused by upward only rent reviews applying to NAMA properties.  I have been advised that, by the end of 2012, the Agency had granted 212 applications for rent abatement with an aggregate annual value of &euro;13.5 million. A further 56 applications are currently under review. Of the 276 eligible applications received to date only 8 have been refused representing a 97% approval rate by NAMA.</p><p>  I would also mention that the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a Commercial Leases Database by the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  This Database will assist in providing readily accessible, accurate information in order to determine the market rent payable in respect of comparable commercial properties.  Work is underway to ensure that the Database will be operational at an early date.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to highlight the existence of a rent review arbitration code which was drawn up by a group of experts whose membership was drawn from all stakeholders in the commercial property arena.  The code, which can be found on www.justice.ie, provides a mechanism to deal with the resolution of rent review disputes in the commercial property sector.  The effectiveness of the Code and the extent to which it is utilised by stakeholders will be reviewed and assessed over the next coming months.</p></reply>

This streamlining included the rationalisation of 48 bodies by the end of 2012, as well as the critical review of a further 46 bodies to take place by the end of June 2012.  Details of the bodies involved are set out in Appendices IIa and IIb of the Plan which can be found at:  .</p><p>  On 31 October 2012, my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, announced an update in relation to the programme of rationalisation of State bodies.  With regard to State bodies under the aegis of my own Department, the bodies which were scheduled to be rationalised, amalgamated or abolished in 2012 are:</p><p><b>Equality Tribunal </b>(Rationalise the industrial relations/employee rights institutions - Labour Court, Labour Relations Commission, Employee Appeals Tribunal, National Employment Rights Authority and Equality Tribunal into single agency).  This overall rationalisation of industrial relations  institutions is being lead by my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The General Scheme of a Bill to provide for this measure has been approved by Government.  Administrative responsibility for the Tribunal transferred to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with effect from 1 January 2013.</p><p><b>Equality Authority, Human Rights Commission </b>(Merge to form new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission).  I published the General Scheme of a Bill to replace the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission with a new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission on 5 June 2012.  The Bill is currently being drafted and it is intended to have the legislation in place later this year.  In parallel, arrangements are being made to select members of the new Commission.  This is being handled by an independent Selection Panel set up for that purpose.  The successful applicants will be appointed to the two existing bodies pending enactment of the necessary legislation to effect the merger.  This will ensure that the two organisations can start to operate as a cohesive whole, with a transition programme being prepared and put in place, so that the board(s) can commence preparing a Strategic Plan for the new body and that work can be taken forward rapidly on the staffing review envisaged in the Working Group report.  I consider that these proposals  and this process is fully consistent with the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>  With regard to those bodies under the aegis of my Department, which were subject to critical review during 2012 and in respect of which the Government has decided to proceed with the measure (i.e. to be achieved by end 2013), these are as follows:</p><p><b>Forensic Science Laboratory: </b>The Forensic Science Laboratory is to be brought within the ambit of the State Laboratory.   A working group will be established to develop and work through areas of savings and future synergies.</p><p><b>Prison Visiting Committees </b>(Reduce or merge Visiting Committees as there is now a Prison Inspectorate).  The Government has approved the drafting of a General Scheme of an Inspection of Places of Detention Bill, which will include provisions to make Visiting Committees more effective, while they continue their role of visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners,  and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities.  A link will be established between the Visiting Committees and the Inspector of Prisons . As part of these plans, it is intended to expand the role of the Inspector of Prisons.  Under the proposed arrangements, it is my intention that Visiting Committees would be able to report any urgent or major matter to the Inspector at any time.</p><p><b>Property Registration Authority </b>(Merge the Valuation Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Property Registration Authority).  Following the Government approval of the recommendation of the Critical Review on this proposal that a merger should proceed, work has commenced to advance this proposal.</p><p><b>Reception and Integration Agency, Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and Refugee Appeals Tribunal </b>(Rationalise various Refugee Structures). Consolidation of refugee structures will be addressed through the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  The Bill will provide for the Office of the Refugee Applications Commission (ORAC) to be subsumed into INIS - the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  The Bill will also provide for the replacement of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal with the new Protection Review Tribunal.</p></reply>

The Act will be commenced in due course as the necessary preparations for administration of its provisions are finalised.  The Act provides for the introduction of three new debt resolution processes, which though requiring approval by the court, are essentially non-judicial in nature:</p><p> - The Debt Relief Notice (DRN) will allow for the write-off of qualifying unsecured debt up to &euro;20,000, subject to a three year supervision period.</p><p> -  The Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) provides for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt, with no limit involved, normally over five years.</p><p> -  The Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) will enable the agreed settlement of secured debt up to &euro;3 million, although this cap may be increased with the consent of all secured creditors, and unsecured debt without limit, normally over six years.</p><p>  The Act also continues the reform of the Bankruptcy Act 1988, begun in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 and will include, critically, the introduction of automatic discharge from bankruptcy, subject to certain conditions, after 3 years in place of the current 12 years.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that we have to see how the new legislation works, for some months at least. It is not for me to speculate as to the future conduct of any of the participants in an insolvency process. However, I am of the view that new personal insolvency laws, including the bankruptcy law reform, should provide a significant incentive for financial institutions to develop and implement realistic agreements to manage or settle debt with their customers. Such agreements should in time become the norm as the most sensible and cost-effective arrangements, particularly where the issue is one of dealing with repayment difficulties for a single major debt, secured or otherwise. These agreements could include measures to address mortgage arrears.</p><p>  However, let there be no doubt that financial institutions must constructively engage under this legislation in the public interest, the interest of those in financial difficulties and the interest of their own institutions and credibility. If I find within a short period during the operation of this legislation that all or some of the financial institutions are intent on not engaging constructively with the personal insolvency arrangement provisions for whatever reason, I will not be slow to bring proposals to Government to amend the legislation.</p><p>  The Government has engaged with the financial institutions in the lead-in to the enactment of this legislation. They understand exactly where the Government is coming from, what our concerns are and what they should do in the context of operating the legislation constructively and sensibly, engaging with personal insolvency practitioners and the circumstances of their customers and ensuring appropriate and sensible arrangements are made&quot;.</p><p>  I have nothing further to add to that reply at this point in time other than to inform the Deputy that Part 6 of the Act was commenced on 18 January 2013 and the provisions of Part 1 (other than section 6), Part 2 (other than section 13), sections 25 and 47, sections 126 to 141, Part 5 and Schedules 2 and 3 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 came into operation on 1 March 2013.</p></reply>

This has reduced the levels of paid training that was available for members of the Reserve and recruitment to the Reserve was restricted accordingly.  The recently published Value for Money Review of the Reserve Defence Force recommended the retention of a Reserve of approximately 4,000 personnel. In order to ensure the sustainability of this strength level it recommended withdrawing gratuities from members of the Reserve and re-directing this funding to increase the number of paid training man-days. This will facilitate appropriate levels of recruitment to sustain the new Reserve strength ceiling.</p><p>  New Reserve organisational structures are currently being implemented. As part of this process the military authorities will assign existing members of the Reserve to posts within the new organisational structures. When this process in complete, the military authorities will identify if any vacancies exist and what level of recruitment may be required.  Applicants to the Reserve Defence Force are vetted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit as part of the recruitment process.  I understand that the processing times for vetting of applications is currently 8 to 10 weeks and this will be taken into account in the context of any future recruitment. </p></reply>

I accepted these recommendations and subsequent proposals for a major re-organisation of the RDF, which were brought forward by the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General.  The new organisational structures will see Defence Forces Units having both Permanent and Reserve elements, which differs from the current approach.  These new structures are scheduled to come into effect from the end of March 2013. </p><p>  In order to achieve the required levels of interoperability, Reserve Combat Support elements (including Artillery) and Combat Service Support elements will be co-located with their Permanent Defence Force (PDF) counterparts in PDF installations.  This will ensure access to equipment, expertise and facilitate appropriate training.  In 2 Brigade, Reserve Artillery elements will be co-located with their PDF counterparts in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  In 1 Brigade, Reserve Artillery elements will be co-located with their PDF counterparts in Collins Barracks, Cork.  Members of the Reserve who are currently serving in existing Reserve Artillery Units may apply for a position in these locations or they may opt to apply for a position in an alternative Unit. </p><p>  Reserve Infantry Units will be located in PDF installations and in sixteen other locations throughout the State. Mullingar was selected as one of these sixteen locations.  Members of the Reserve who are currently serving in the Reserve Artillery Unit in Mullingar may opt to apply for a position in the new Infantry Rifle Company.  Every effort will be made to facilitate members of the Reserve with their preferred choice. </p><p>  Training will be provided to underpin and facilitate the re-organisation.  This will be met from within the existing Reserve training budget.  The implementation of the recommendations of the VFM Review, including new organisational structures, will reduce direct expenditure on the Reserve by approximately &euro;11 million in 2013.</p><p>  The consolidation of the Defence Forces Units into a smaller number of locations was a key objective in the defence modernisation programme and was recommended in many reports.  The closure of Columb Barracks in Mullingar in March 2012 was a part of that programme and has realised direct cash savings in utilities, maintenance and security duty allowances, of approximately &euro;400,000 per annum.  The premises occupied by the Reserve in Mullingar are currently leased at a cost of &euro;30,750 per annum and this is more cost-effective than maintaining Columb barracks as the training centre for the Reserve in that location.  I remain committed to ensuring that we have a sustainable and fit for purpose Reserve Defence Force. I am satisfied that the changes that are being introduced will assist in achieving this goal.</p></reply>

While the Bill is for the most part general in its application, its provisions do apply during the transport of animals. </p><p>  In view of the fact that the transport of animals is governed by Council Regulation No 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport, which is implemented in Ireland via Statutory Instrument No 675 of 2006, the Bill, when enacted, will not have any immediate or direct effect on live exports. These regulations allow Member States to operate stricter rules than those applied by the EU regulation in relation to the transport of animals by sea. In that context, my Department has retained the rules that it has applied in relation to sea transport of animals since 1996. These are significantly stricter than the EU rules and set a higher standard than that which applies in other EU Member States. This is justified not only on sound animal welfare reasons but also because it reflects the nature of the shipping routes from this island. </p></reply>

All applications in 'Natura 2000&rsquo; areas are required to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of environmental compliance with the EU Habitats/Birds Directives. An additional factor is that all aquaculture applications now undergo Environmental Impact pre-screening assessment which requires significant input from my Department's scientific and technical advisors. </p><p>  The average timeframe for processing each particular application varies depending on location, species, scale and intensity of production, statutory status of sites, potential visual impact etc. Other factors include consideration of any submissions or observations raised during the public consultation period.  There were 115 Ministerial determinations in 2012 in relation to aquaculture licence applications.  At present there are in the order of 580 aquaculture licence applications awaiting determination.  My Department continues to make every effort to expedite the determination of all aquaculture applications having regard to the complexities of each case and the need to comply fully with all national and EU legislation.</p></reply>

Payments in respect of the 2012 Scheme year are subject to a similar administrative checking process which includes verification of capital investments through checks on receipts. These checks have now been completed and following the payment for 2011, the payment in respect of 2012 will be finalised.</p></reply>

Subsequent measures were established by Regulation (EU) No 579/2011 of 8 June 2011 for the period 1 July, 2011 to 31 December 2012. In June 2012, the EU Commission brought forward a proposal to extend the provisions of the Regulation.  In October 2012, following triologues on the issue facilitated by the Cyprus Presidency, the PECHE Committee of the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers agreed to the adoption of the Commission proposals with a number of amendments. The European  Parliament voted in early February on the adoption of the new extension and it was also adopted by the Council in February.  It will be formally  signed by the Council and Parliament this month.  The provisions of the Regulation will come into force on the third day following it s publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.  </p><p>  The main changes in the regime of importance to Irish fishermen are: the introduction of a closed area at EU level  off  north Donegal, known as the &ldquo;cape&rdquo; to protect juvenile cod.  This closure covers the period 1 October to 31 March each year.  It replaces a closure in place at national level in previous years: a saithe fishery by means of mechanised jigging will be permitted; new arrangements to allow for a lesser spotted dog fishery off the north Donegal coast are being introduced.  The fishery  is subject to a number of technical restrictions including a restriction on the area, length of gill net that may be deployed, maximum period of soak time, restrictions on by-catches and a gill net fishery sought of 59 degrees north, subject to specified conditions.   </p><p>  In  the eastern part of Area VIa, an effort regime, restricting the number of days at sea each year in the area is in place to protect cod.  The effort levels available for 2013 were rolled over from 2012 and a reduction was not applied.  Gill net fishing and trawl fishing for whitefish stocks and for nephrops are subject to the effort regime.  Vessels must have access to fishing effort under the Cod Recovery Plan which is based on historic track record.</p></reply>

This would result in significant transfers between farmers in a number of Member States, including Ireland.  These Member States are seeking a solution that will mitigate this impact. Indeed, Ireland has been to the forefront in developing an alternative model of partial convergence which, while consistent with the overall thrust of the Commission's proposal, results in a more measured outcome. We have been formally supported by five other Member States in this regard, while a number of others are also sympathetic to this approach. Other Member States - such as the newer Member States who already implement an area-based system - are seeking alternative solutions, while others still (including Germany) are happy with the flat rate system.</p><p>  Last week&rsquo;s Council of Agriculture Ministers broadly endorsed a package of measures tabled by the Irish Presidency aimed at achieving a compromise on this very difficult issue. This package included the option to implement the Irish model. The Council&rsquo;s endorsement represented a considerable success for Ireland, which twelve months ago was alone in suggesting such an alternative approach. Further work remains to be done, but I hope that a final set of proposals can be agreed by the Council later this month.</p><p>  There has been a good deal of comment in recent weeks about the state of play on this issue, and particularly in the aftermath of last week&rsquo;s Council meeting. Much of this comment has been misinformed, and has been characterised by unhelpful speculation about the potential impact of the proposals on Irish farmers and on the agri-food sector generally.  We need to retain a little bit of perspective. I would remind farmers - and commentators - that we are in the early stages of a two-phase negotiating process. We need to reach a compromise not just within the Council of Ministers but also, subsequently, with the European Parliament and the Commission. Ultimately, I believe we will find a solution that lies somewhere between the extreme of the Commission flat-rate proposal and the more measured Irish approach, because that is where the common ground between 27 Member States will lie. I will be working to ensure that that solution is as close to the Irish model as possible.</p></reply>

Farmers can keep grassland in GAEC by conducting an agricultural activity on it such as grazing, harvesting forage crops, or by topping. Grasslands continue to be eligible where it is evident that the stocking rate used by the applicant on the land is sufficient and, for example, can keep rushes under control and avoid their proliferation. In such situations, the reality is that there may not be a necessity to cut rushes. Where a farmer cuts rushes as part of management practice, with the exception of certain designated lands, there are no restrictions on when this is done, enabling the task to be carried out at any time throughout the year once conditions are suitable.</p></reply>

These checks are carried out to verify that the actual area claimed in the application form corresponds to the area farmed and to ensure that any ineligible land or features are not included for aid purposes.  Currently, around two-thirds of these inspections are carried out in the first instance without the need for a farm visit, as the information needed is acquired using the technique of remote sensing via satellite. When the available images do not permit a satisfactory verification of the land use or area of a parcel(s) applied for by an applicant, perhaps due to cloud cover, it is an EU requirement that a ground inspection must take place. These inspections are generally limited to verifying the area of the particular parcel(s) where the position is unclear from the imagery available (unless 80% or more of the area was unclear).  The results obtained are used, in combination with the clear satellite imagery, to finalise the eligibility inspection of the entire areas declared.</p><p>  As regards the timing of inspections, the annual inspection cycle can only commence following completion of a structured risk analysis selection process which includes the analysis and evaluation of data from the previous year&rsquo;s inspections. Eligibility inspections, as such, can only commence following the initial stages of processing of the current year&rsquo;s Single Payment Scheme applications. All eligibility inspections must take place before any payments can issue to any farmers in the country in a given year. It is a regulatory requirement that Cross Compliance inspections must take place throughout the calendar year to take account of specific requirements at individual Statutory Management Requirement level.</p><p>  Provided the purpose of the control is not jeopardised, relevant EU Regulations enable my Department to give up to 14 days notice for land eligibility inspections.  This also applies for cross compliance inspections involving Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs), other than those related to animal identification and registration, feed, food and animal welfare. For checks involving animal identification and registration, the maximum advance notice permitted under EU regulations is 48 hours, provided the purpose of the inspection is not jeopardised. For SMRs dealing with feed, food and animal welfare, no advance notice is permitted under governing EU Regulations.</p><p>  As a general rule and following requests from the farming organisations, my Department tries to integrate inspections, including all of the cross compliance inspection elements, with a view to avoiding more than one visit to a farm; this, however, has implications for the degree of flexibility available to my Department to give advance notice. Nonetheless, in respect of those elements of an integrated inspection for which advance notice is possible, the farmer can request deferral of those particular elements to a separate inspection.</p></reply>

In his report on 25 May 2012, the District Inspector recommended refusal of the licence because the plantation is not ready for thinning and there was a high risk of wind-throw. Following discussions between the Inspector and the applicant&rsquo;s forester, on 7 August 2012 the applicant was asked to provide a wind-throw hazard risk assessment and a mitigation plan to offset any risk. To date, the Forest Service has received no reply.  However, the applicant submitted a second felling licence application, no. GFL12488, which was received by the Forest Service on 10 May 2012. This second application appears to be for the same site as that applied for under GFL12173 but with a different age profile for the trees to be felled. On this basis, the Forest Service is currently clarifying the situation with GFL12488.</p></reply>

The purpose of foster care inspections is to review compliance with regulations and standards for all children.  HIQA's inspection methodology includes interviewing HSE managers and social workers, a sample of children, carers and birth parents and review a range of files, including complaints.  Foster care services in HSE Dublin North West Area have been inspected by HIQA on three occasions since September 2009, the most recent of which took place in October 2012.  Progress was noted particularly in the area of foster care assessment, approval and training with all general foster carers approved and significant improvements in the area of relative foster carers.  Some 96% of children in foster care had been visited by a social worker within the preceding six months.</p><p>  Notwithstanding such progress, I was concerned to note that inspectors found that some deficits identified previously had not been rectified.  Allegations made against a small number of foster carers had not been fully resolved. Inspectors found that there were inadequacies in systems to assess risk and to investigate and take timely action in response to concerns.  File keeping, data collection and analysis were also found to be lacking.  The inspection also found that sufficient foster carers have not been recruited within the area and this has provided difficulties in making placements and matching children with particular needs with the most suitable carers.  Recruitment of foster carers is of concern more generally and it is intended to conduct a national recruitment campaign in the coming months.    </p><p>  An Action Plan to address the weaknesses identified was prepared by HIQA.  In order to ensure that the Action Plan is fully implemented, I have requested that the HSE set up a high level oversight process to be lead by the Head of Quality Assurance to ensure implementation of all the HIQA recommendations.   I intend that this oversight process will provide regular updates to both me and HIQA on the implementation of the Action Plan.  Last week I met with Mr Gordon Jeyes Chief Executive Designated of the Child and Family Support Agency to review the actions underway to address the critical issues identified.</p></reply>

The main objective of this project is to meet the Programme for Government commitment to end the practice of detaining children in St Patrick's Institution. </p><p>  My officials in the Irish Youth Justice Service continue to work closely to progress this project with the Office of Public Works (OPW) which is providing the relevant project management services for my Department.  The tender process for the award of a contract for the project is currently ongoing and the current projected timeline estimate from the OPW indicates that the first new residential units, to provide sufficient capacity to end the practice of  sending 17 year old boys to St. Patrick's Institution, will be available for use by mid 2014.  My aim is to deliver suitable detention facilities on the earliest possible date, in a manner that complies with all design, planning and heath and safety requirements.  I  am also conscious that the Oberstown campus is already the location of the existing children detention facilities and these must remain in operation during the construction project.  The overall  project for the campus, which will also replace some existing outdated buildings and deliver education, visiting and other ancillary facilities, is currently scheduled for completion by mid 2015.  </p><p>  I assume the second part of the Deputy's question relates to when it will be possible to cease detaining 16 and 17 year old boys in St Patrick's Institution in totality.  In relation to 16 year old boys, I announced the ending of the practice of detaining 16 year old boys in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution from 1 May 2012 by using existing capacity that was available on the Oberstown campus.  Since July 2012, there have been no 16 year old boys detained in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. On foot of legal changes that I have made, all 16 year old boys are now detained at Oberstown and for the first time are no longer sent to St. Patrick's Institution.</p><p>  Ending the practice of detaining 17 year old boys in St Patrick's Institution will be achieved through the provision of further capacity in Oberstown by mid 2014 under the capital project now underway.  In relation to the 17 year old boys who will be detained at that time on the Oberstown campus, I will have to consider the required practical, security and legal issues involved in the transition from the prison model to the children detention model, which will also  involve consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality. </p><p>  I also intend to examine the feasibility of accommodating some categories of the 17 year old age group in Oberstown before mid 2014.  In October of last year, I asked the Oberstown Board of Management and the Irish Youth Justice Service to keep this matter under review based on the trend of occupancy in Oberstown under the recent change in age categories, and  I understand that their report will be available to me within the coming weeks.  I will consider the information provided at that time, as well as relevant advices from the Office of the Attorney General.</p></reply>

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI); the Family Support Agency (FSA); the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) and the Ombudsman for Children.    With effect from 1 January 2012, I have taken responsibility for the Children Detention Schools as provided in Part 10 of the Children Act 2001. </p><p>  Apart from the Ombudsman for Children's Office which does not have a board, I am responsible for all Board of Management appointments.  Since I took office in March 2011,  I have directly appointed 35 persons to the Boards of Management under the aegis of my Department. </p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in line with the Government decision of April 2011, new arrangements were put in place for the making of appointments to State Boards and bodies.  Following this Government Decision, on my Department's website I have invited expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to the boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under the Department's aegis. The notice indicates the vacancies in the boards of the respective bodies. My officials acknowledge all expressions of interest received and maintain a database of those expressions. My Department&rsquo;s website is monitored and updated on a regular basis to reflect the number of vacancies as they arise.  </p><p>  The appointment of members to each of these bodies is not a competency-based process. The governing legislation in relation to each of these bodies sets out the composition of the Board either in terms of their qualifications and experience, or the Government Minister or body that is responsible for nominating representatives on them or who must be consulted in the nomination process.  For example, the Adoption Act, 2010 requires that the Adoption Authority of Ireland consists of  7 members &ndash; the chairperson must be a Judge, barrister or solicitor and the ordinary members must include a social worker with experience in adoption practice, a social worker with research expertise in child welfare, child protection or both, a barrister or solicitor with experience in the practice of law in relation to families and children, a medical practitioner and a person with appropriate training in psychology.  On the other hand, the Education Welfare Act, 2000 provides that the Minister shall make appointments to the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) from among persons who in the opinion of the Minister have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Board. </p><p>  There are also prescribed bodies to be consulted in appointing ordinary members. The Family Support Agency Act, 2001 provides that the Minister may appoint individuals to the Board who have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Agency.  Between March 2011 and January 2013, 9 of the FSA Board members appointed by me had submitted an expression of interest.  One other member appointed was a Departmental representative.  </p><p>  The Children Act, 2001 outlines the different Ministers and organisations that nominate persons to serve on the board of management of the children detention schools.   </p><p>  In making my decisions on appointments to Boards, subject to the governing legislation, I consider the most suitable persons for the positions available with due regard to the body or agency in question and its particular responsibilities and I seek to ensure that the appropriate mix of skills and experience is in place to achieve the best result.</p></reply>

During my visit I met with my counter part, Minister Dmitry Livanov, Minister of Education and Science of the Russian Federation. This meeting was productive and allowed for an exchange of views on the possibility of Ireland entering into a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption with Russia. I emphasised the success of over 1600 Russian/ Irish adoptions and the Irish Government&#8217;s willingness to find solutions to address the constitutional difficulties in relation to post placement reporting, which the current draft agreement presents. </p><p>  The Russian authorities acknowledged the satisfactory outcomes for Russian children adopted in Ireland and expressed a willingness to conclude an agreement with Ireland which will be subject to the approval of the Russian parliament. My Department, together with the AAI, will continue efforts to develop proposals in this regard with a view to a possible visit by Russian officials to Ireland in the coming months.  I also met with Mr <font color="#2F2F2F">Pavel Astakhov, the </font>Russian Commissioner for Children&#8217;s Rights.

The then Government accepted all of the recommendations. Many of the recommendations related to the provision of services and accordingly, from a child welfare and protection perspective, were taken forward by the HSE given its statutory responsibilities in this area.  In this context the HSE established five working groups to address the various recommendations made by the Inquiry team.</p><p>  The Ferns 4 Working Group was established to examine the needs of children and young persons and their families who have been affected by sexual abuse. This working Group produced its report in 2009 and one of the key recommendations was the establishment of a National Steering Committee. </p><p>  The Ferns  5 Working Group was tasked with advising the HSE on the strategic direction and level of need in the area of assessment and treatment for children, adolescents and adults who have exhibited sexually harmful  behaviour.  The Ferns 5 Working Party completed a report in 2007. </p><p><b>National Review of Sexual Abuse Services for Children and Young People. </b></p><p>  In order to update the work of the Ferns 4 and Ferns 5 Working Groups the HSE in 2010 commissioned a National Review of Sexual Abuse Services for Children and Young People to include Forensic Examination services, Joint Interviewing, Assessment of Need and Therapeutic Services. This Review considered services across all four HSE Regions including the specialist services located at Our Lady&#8217;s Hospital Crumlin and the Children&#8217;s University Hospital, Temple Street.  Mott McDonald Consultants were commissioned to carry out the review and completed the Report in June 2011.</p><p><b>Implementation process.</b></p><p>  The HSE established the Ferns 4 Steering Committee and the Ferns 5 Steering Committee in 2011. The role of these Committees is to examine the assessment, therapy and counselling needs of children who have been sexually abused and their families, as well children and adults who have exhibited sexually harmful behaviour and to make recommendations concerning service requirements.  The Committees are multidisciplinary and multiagency with representation from all sectors including Children and Family Services, Acute Services, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Probation Service, Psychology Service and the voluntary sector.</p><p>  The Ferns 4 and Ferns 5 National Steering Committees are currently reviewing the recommendations of the Ferns 4 and Ferns 5 Reports as well as the recommendations of the National Review of Sexual Abuse Services for Children and Young People.  The objective of the Committees is to develop national models of service which ensure that all available resources are effectively deployed within a national, standardised service providing ready access to assessment and treatment for children and families across the country.</p></reply>

This submission was received following a consultation process held in 2012 in relation to &ldquo;Your Health is Your Wealth &ndash; Health and Well-being Framework 2012-2020&rdquo;.  The submission refers to the fact that plain packaging of tobacco products was identified during the consultation process as a legislative gap in Ireland.  This measure was just one of eight measures identified in feedback from the consultation process in relation to legislative proposals specifically related to Tobacco and was outlined in the technical supplement &ldquo;A discussion paper on public health and the law, including proposals for a new Public Health Act &ndash; Draft document for consultation&rdquo;.  As the Deputy is aware last December the European Commission published a proposal for a new EU Tobacco Products Directive, the ultimate purpose of which is to reduce the numbers of people smoking. </p><p>   Areas covered by the new proposal include labelling and packaging.  The proposal foresees combined warnings (pictures plus text) of 75% to be displayed on both sides of the pack   In addition under the proposal Member States would be free to regulate the area of the packet not regulated by this Directive or other Union legislation, including implementing provisions for full standardisation of tobacco products.  This proposal is being discussed in the European Parliament and Council of Ministers and the Commission has expressed the hope that it will be adopted in 2014.  I am fully supportive of the measures outlined in the proposal.  My objective is to build consensus, facilitate agreement among the Member States and significantly progress the Commission&rsquo;s proposal during Ireland's Presidency.</p><p>  My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is at the forefront of ensuring that Ireland pursues a strong intellectual property regime as part of its policy to encourage new and continued investment into Ireland.  However, the issue which is the subject of the Deputy's question raises essential issues in terms of public health policy and therefore, the public interest focus must be strongly and to the fore in considering these proposals.</p></reply>

Minister Reilly and I considered the recommendations of the Ombudsman in relation to both schemes carefully and in particular, we looked at the potential cost of implementing the recommended changes.  Any additional cost incurred by expansion of the schemes would have to be met from current expenditure and result in a reduction of front-line specialist disability, older people and mental health services for people who need them.  It is clear that an extension of either scheme would create serious financial pressure on the health budget in the current climate and would be unsustainable.  </p><p>  Following detailed consideration of issues involved with Cabinet colleagues, the Government decided on 26th February that it is no longer possible to allow the two schemes to continue as they presently operate and to devise an alternative solution for meeting people's needs.  A special review group, which will be independently chaired, has been established to seek an alternative method to provide for the needs of people in a manner that does not run counter to the Equal Status Acts.  Following the initial phase of the group's work, which will concentrate on issues around Mobility Allowance and the Motorised Transport Grant, a key concentration of the group will be to look at opportunities for the enhancement of the transport options provided to the relevant persons in need.  As part of the review, the Health Service Executive will examine the circumstances of all those currently benefiting from the schemes to ensure the identified solutions will encompass their priority mobility needs.  In addition, the Minister for Health has instructed the HSE to contact each individual in receipt of the payments to notify them of this decision.</p><p>  It is important to note that, although the Government's decision ends both schemes to new applicants with immediate effect, the payment of mobility allowance to those currently in receipt of it, will continue for another four months.  It is also important to note that the decision is in no way intended to save costs and the funding involved in the two schemes (&euro;10.6 million) remains committed to meeting the priority transport needs of people with a disability.</p></reply>

In line with a recommendation of the National Working Group, the Department of Health supports greater voluntary self-regulation of complementary therapy.  While persons providing complementary therapies, including homoeopathy, are not subject to professional statutory regulation, they are subject to a range of legislation and regulation, similar to other practitioners including consumer legislation, competition, contract and criminal law.  My Department also makes available an information leaflet on complementary therapy to assist consumers in making an informed health choice - a copy of which is available at .</p></reply>

Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.</p><p>  Medical card holders are required to pay prescription charges.  Charges are not payable in respect of items supplied under the Long Term Illness Scheme.  In the case of persons who have both the medical card and LTI, the HSE policy is that they should use their medical card to access medicines. The main reason for this is that the supply of medicines under the LTI costs the HSE considerably more than under the medical card scheme. A retail mark-up of 20% is payable to pharmacists for items supplied under the LTI scheme but there is no mark up for items supplied under the GMS scheme.</p></reply>

Calories on menus help people make healthier choices. My Department requested the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) to carry out a national consultation on this issue, which found that over 95% of consumers in Ireland want calories on menus. Following the national consultation, the FSAI have published a step-by-step guide on how to do this:  <i>Putting Calories on Menus in Ireland - Technical Guidance for food.</i></p><p>  I also wrote personally to a range of fast food restaurants requesting that they display calories on menus on a voluntary basis. Recent monitoring information from the FSAI, found that almost half of the 19 fast food restaurants, coffee shops and catering companies are currently displaying calories on menus.  The FSAI are currently conducting a large telephone survey and quality assessment evaluating the uptake of calorie menu labelling by Food Service Businesses in Ireland. The final survey results will be ready for publication in March 2013. I welcome the progress that has been made so far and will use the FSAI survey results to inform my decision regarding further progress in this area.</p></reply>

The professionals concerned are General Practitioners, Pharmacists, Dentists, Ophthalmologists, Optometrists and Dispensing Opticians who hold contracts with the HSE, Smeartakers contracted under the CervicalCheck programme and Consultant Psychiatrists who hold contracts with the Mental Health Commission.  On 13 December 2012, the Department of Health placed a notice in the National newspapers and on the Department&rsquo;s website advising that a review of payments to the above health professionals was being carried out under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  Interested parties were invited to provide written submissions by Friday, 4 January 2013.  The consultation period ended on 11 January 2013.</p><p>  Detailed consideration of the various submissions is still ongoing.  Following careful consideration of submissions made during the review and having due regard to Section 9 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009, the Minister for Health will decide whether any reductions in fees/allowances will be made, and, if so, the scale of reductions that would be fair and reasonable in the circumstances.  Should the Minister decide that reductions are warranted, Regulations will be made under the FEMPI Act with the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

In order to deliver on this commitment, the preparation of a new General Medical Services (GMS) contract with GPs will be required.  The Department and the HSE are currently examining the changes that need to be made to the GMS contract to facilitate the introduction of Universal Primary Care.

Priority initiatives will include the further development of existing National Mental Health Awareness campaigns to promote help seeking; increased training for GPs and practice staff; the training of acute hospital staff on suicide and self harm intervention; the development of the SCAN (Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse) model which allows for crisis interventions at primary care and continued investment in voluntary agencies providing frontline services.</p></reply>

The intern year is an integral part of medical training and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  Under the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 it is a matter for the HSE to assess, on an annual basis, the number of intern training posts required by the health service.  There were 572 intern posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007.  All 2012 EU graduates from Irish medical schools who sought an intern post here that year and met the HSE eligibility criteria were successful in securing a post. Indeed, to date there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools and a number of additional posts for some non-EU applicants.</p><p>  My Department is in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  It should be noted that under EU law intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying.  The HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July 2013.  In total there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013.  Furthermore, my Department and the HSE are working towards providing an adequate number of intern posts for the 2014 intake to cater for the increased number of Irish/EU graduates from Irish medical schools that year.  The HSE consider that there will be sufficient capacity and funding to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship both years.</p></reply>

The screening test, known as a Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT), is a home based test and approximately 94 to 95 per cent of people will receive a normal result and will be invited for routine screening again in two years time.  A small number, in the region of five to six per cent, will receive a not normal result and will require an additional test.  They will be referred for a colonoscopy to a Screening Colonoscopy Unit within a hospital contracted by the HSE&rsquo;s National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) for provision of this service.</p><p>  Over half of the initially selected fifteen candidate screening colonoscopy units have been accredited to date, giving geographic spread to support the screening programme, and maintaining service requirements for symptomatic patients within national targets.  The remainder of units continue to work to achieve this benchmark.  Also a number of additional units, including Roscommon County Hospital, are pursuing NHS Joint Advisory Group (JAG) accreditation and the NCSS continues to work in close partnership with Roscommon County Hospital in this regard.

These rules will not take effect until later in 2013, after primary legislation has been enacted. The implementation date will be announced and publicised in advance by the Department and HSE.  As is the current situation, the revised thresholds will apply to gross income. There is provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a medical card in cases of &quot;undue hardship&quot; where income guidelines are exceeded and this provision will not be effected.</p><p>  In the case of all reviews and renewals of medical cards, the HSE offer assistances to individuals in assessing their situation under income limit thresholds, as some may be unsure about their gross income or have concerns or difficulties in relation to self-assessment.  This will continue to be case after the legislation is enacted and will be further bolstered by staff in local health offices who provide information, support and assistance to individuals in relation to their eligibility on an ongoing basis.  They can also provide information on the current status of a review, being in a position to track the application on the centralised Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) office in Finglas.</p></reply>

Under the Acute Coronary Syndrome Programme, patients with symptoms and ECG findings indicative of a STEMI-type acute heart attack are treated according to the National STEMI Protocol, which was officially launched in October 2012.  It has been in use in the west of Ireland since July 2012.  Under the protocol, if patients can be transported to a primary PCI centre providing 24/7 treatment of STEMIs, then they are brought directly to that centre.  The primary PCI centre in the west of Ireland is the cardiology centre in University Hospital Galway.  This unit has 2 cardiac catheter laboratories and a dedicated team of interventional cardiologists, nursing, technical and radiography staff on call 24/7.  Based on international best practice, a unit such as this will serve the population of the west of Ireland for management of STEMI.</p><p>  If transport to Galway within 90 minutes is not feasible, then STEMI patients are taken to the nearest emergency department equipped to stabilise patients, such as Mayo General or Portiuncula, for thrombolysis (administration of clot-bursting drugs) to stabilise the situation.  They are then transferred to UHG for assessment as to whether further immediate intervention is needed.  This is accepted international best practice for management of STEMI patients, particularly in remote areas.  In addition to the national protocol, the Code STEMI Protocol, approved by the Medical Director of the NAS and through the HSE Clinical Care Programmes, outlines the actions required by hospital and NAS staff when a hospital STEMI patient is to be transferred to a PCI centre.</p><p>  The incident raised by the Deputy was reported to the National Incident Management Team at national and regional level for review.  The Ambulance Service also carried out an internal review and in parallel requested an independent review, which was conducted by the State Claims Agency.  A review was also conducted between the Ambulance Service and Mayo General Hospital to ensure that the CODE STEMI protocol is followed for this type of incident.</p><p>  The outcomes of the reviews have been raised with Prof Kieran Daly, project lead of the Acute Coronary Syndrome Programme, and the Director of the National Ambulance Service, Robert Morton and actions highlighted by these reviews have been implemented.  These include training of staff, a written protocol between Mayo General Hospital and the NAS, additional auditing of calls within the Ambulance Control and the recirculation by the NAS of the Code STEMI protocol.  Since this incident, all such transfers are treated as an emergency and six STEMIs have occurred in Mayo General, all following the protocol.</p><p>  In relation the incident itself, the HSE National Ambulance Service has informed me that, at 19:30 on 17 August 2013, the patient began to experience symptoms and, about an hour later, self-presented to Mayo General Hospital Emergency Department, where an ECG was carried out.  At 21.06 the National Ambulance Service received a call from Mayo ED to organise an emergency transfer from Mayo to Galway for a patient with a myocardial infarction.  However, the patient was described as for angioplasty, not as a Code STEMI, and the CODE STEMI protocol was not initiated.  At 21.20, an ambulance was assigned. Mayo ED was notified that an ambulance was en route, but the ED advised that the patient was being thrombolysed and the ambulance was not required.</p><p>  The NAS has confirmed that there were two ambulances at Mayo General ED at the time of the incident.  An ambulance is not available for further duty until the patient is transferred to medical staff in the ED and the ambulance is reported as available.  Depending on the previous call, once the hand-over is completed, the ambulance may need to be restocked, refuelled or cleaned before being ready for duty. Both ambulances had responded to previous calls and the hand-over of patients had not been completed at that point.  The ambulance based in Castlebar was available and was tasked, in line with the transfer request from the hospital, but was stood down on advice from the hospital.</p></reply>

This is accepted international best practice for management of STEMI patients, particularly in remote areas.  Unfortunately, STEMI incidents are extremely serious and some STEMI cases have poor outcomes, irrespective of treatment.</p><p>  The national STEMI protocol was launched in Oct 2012.

Following detailed consideration of the issues involved, the Government decided on 26th February that it is no longer possible to allow the two schemes to continue as they presently operate and to devise an alternative solution for meeting people's needs.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners operate a Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme, whereby a family member of a disabled passenger can qualify for tax relief linked to the purchase of vehicles, provided he/she is living with and is responsible for the transport of the disabled person in question, has acquired the vehicle for that purpose and the disabled passenger is the holder of a Primary Medical Certificate.  Applications for Primary Medical Certificates are processed by the Health Service Executive (HSE) through local offices.  Determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE.  I have referred this aspect of the Deputy's question to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Department of Health and Atlantic Philanthropies commissioned a research review to create the evidence that will help to lay the foundations for the Strategy and to provide guidelines as to the future direction of public policy in Ireland.  The research review, titled <i>Creating Excellence in Dementia Care, A Research Review for Ireland&#8217;s National Dementia Strategy</i>, has been completed and is available on the websites of Trinity College at livingwithdementia.tcd.ie and on the Department of Health website at www.doh.ie</p><p>  A public consultation process which sought the views of interested parties to help inform the development of the strategy concluded at the end of August 2012. Submissions received were analysed and a report was published in February 2013. A working group to develop the Strategy will be established shortly with a view to finalising and publishing the Dementia Strategy by the end of this year.</p></reply>

There are no proposals to publish an implementation plan in respect of this report as the report includes proposals for a framework for the future of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland and proposals on implementing the report including key elements such as:</p><p>  -guiding principles;</p><p>  -implementation structure;</p><p>  -methodology for implementation; and</p><p>  -information and communication.</p><p>    The report recognises that given the current economic climate, the focus in the short to medium term has to be on re-configuration of services, structures and resources and the enhancement of the skills and competencies required to meet the changing context.  With regard to funding agencies, this Government currently provides over &#8364;1.5 billion to the Disability Services Programme through the HSE's National Service Plan for 2013. We are committed to protecting frontline services for people with disabilities to the greatest possible extent.  The Minister for Health is working to ensure that protection is afforded to the disability sector and the Social Care area as a whole.  While the allocation for disability services in 2013 will be reduced by 1.2%, its share of the estimate reduction, the HSE is seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources and to maintaining a consistent level to that provided in 2012.</p></reply>

When fully implemented the programme will offer free screening to men and women aged 55-74 every two years.  The screening test, known as a Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT), is a home based test and approximately 94 to 95 per cent of people will receive a normal result and will be invited for routine screening again in two years time. A small number, in the region of five to six per cent, will receive a not normal result and will require an additional test. They will be referred for a colonoscopy to a Screening Colonoscopy Unit within a hospital contracted by the HSE&rsquo;s National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) for provision of this service.</p><p>  Over half of the initially selected fifteen candidate screening colonoscopy units have been accredited to date, and the remainder of units continue to work to achieve this benchmark. Also a number of additional units are pursuing NHS Joint Advisory Group (JAG) accreditation and will come into the programme in time.  The units accredited to date are St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital; St. James&rsquo; Hospital; Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown; Louth County Hospital; Sligo General Hospital; Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore; Ennis General Hospital; Mercy Hospital, Cork and Wexford Hospital.</p><p>  The NCSS continues to work closely with the remaining initially selected screening colonoscopy units to support them achieving accreditation.  These are Cavan General Hospital; Kerry General Hospital, Tralee; Letterkenny General Hospital; Mayo General Hospital, Castlebar; South Tipperary General Hospital, Clonmel and Tallaght.  The accredited screening colonoscopy units provide good geographic coverage and are appropriate for the invited population to date. The programme is being rolled-out on a phased basis and is providing screening colonoscopies as required.</p></reply>

Within these governing EU Regulations and the Department of Health and Children's Guidelines, the TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland through the issue of form E112 (IE).  </p><p>  The TAS allows for an Irish based consultant to refer a patient that is normally resident in Ireland for treatment in another EU member state or Switzerland, where the treatment in question meets the following criteria:</p><p><i>(a) The application to refer a patient abroad has been assessed and a determination given before that patient goes abroad.</i></p><p><i>(b) Following clinical assessment, the referring consultant certifies the following:</i></p><p><i>    - They recommend the patient be treated in another EU/EEA country or Switzerland;</i></p><p><i></i>- <i>The treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient's needs;</i></p><p><i></i>- <i>The treatment is a proven form of medical treatment and is not experimental or test treatment;</i></p><p><i></i>- <i>The treatment is in a recognised hospital or other institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner;</i></p><p><i></i>- <i>The hospital outside the state will accept EU/EEA form E112 (IE).</i></p><p>  In recent past months the TAS has had a number of applications for the Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy procedure for which there is an emerging evidence base.  The British National Health Service (NHS), which provides the treatment for patients that have received approval under the TAS, has published guidance for the provision of same.  This guidance states &quot;<i>Current evidence on selective dorsal rhizotomy for spasticity in cerebral palsy shows that there is a risk of serious but well-recognised complications.  The evidence on efficacy is adequate.....During the consent process parents or carers should be informed that selective dorsal rhizotomy....is irreversible...&quot;</i> .  All applications to the TAS are independently assessed by the HSE Health Intelligence Unit.  In consideration of the NHS guidelines for referral for this procedure, the HSE worked with leading paediatric consultants to establish an assessment procedure in Ireland for patients seeking referral for the procedure, prior to the patients' applications being submitted to the TAS to ensure the patient is a suitable candidate for the procedure and to ensure the parent(s) or carer fully understands the procedure and the implications of same.</p><p>  The HSE&#8217;s Treatment Abroad Scheme and Health Intelligence Unit met with relevant consultants in May 2012 to review the matter of referrals for selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) and agreed on the need for  a rigorous assessment procedure in Ireland and that patients seeking this treatment must attend the assessment team in order to have recourse to the TAS for the treatment. Subsequently, an assessment team was established in the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC) and all applications for SDR are now independently reviewed by the CRC team who therefore act as the independent medical advisors to the TAS on SDR applications.  The team follow strict assessment criteria for the approval or otherwise of applications for SDR procedures.  </p><p>  The procedure abroad includes three weeks of inpatient physiotherapy and parents are trained in providing the subsequent required physio for the post op period in the home.  Aftercare services in Ireland are provided in line with the clinical management of the patient by the referring consultant upon the patient's return to Ireland.  </p></reply>

The view of the Review Group, giving rise to Action 40 of the Review Report, is that it is necessary to have a system that links SPSV licenced drivers to specific small public service vehicle (SPSV) licensed vehicles so that the identification of the authorised driver of an SPSV vehicle is available in real time. This is in the general interest of consumers who use taxis and for enforcement officers regulating the taxi industry. </p><p>  From the end of January 2013 it became a requirement that all SPSV operators notify the National Transport Authority (NTA) about the vehicles they are operating at any time. This is a once-off notification in the case of SPSV drivers who own their own vehicle. Any changes such as with respect to rental agreements or change of vehicle will also need to be notified. </p><p>  I understand that the NTA has made available free IT tools to facilitate the notification process - the &quot;Taxi Industry Portal&quot; smartphone application can be downloaded onto both Apple and Android smartphones. In addition, SPSV operators can use any PC or laptop to access the Taxi Portal over the Internet. A call centre also operates all-day every-day to take notifications by telephone.</p><p>  The Taxi Review Report envisages that more work is required to facilitate transport for people with disabilities including those in rural areas. For example Action 19 of the Taxi Regulation Review recommends that the NTA, in conjunction with the National Disability Authority, produce a website and smartphone application that facilitates self-ordering of wheelchair accessible vehicles (WAVs). The development of a simple database of SPSV operators of WAVs with telephone contact details on a geographical basis is in planning phase.</p><p>  The regulation of the small public service vehicle (SPSV) industry is a matter for the NTA under the Taxi Regulation Act, 2003. The NTA is responsible for the implementation of the recommendations of the Taxi Regulation Review Report. I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA in this regard.</p></reply>

That decision is currently the subject of a judicial review and therefore cannot proceed at present.
