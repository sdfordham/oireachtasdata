The Action Plan sets out a number of actions in relation to the heritage and arts sectors.</p><p>The nature of employment within these sectors encompasses a wide range of activities, from theatre and music to archaeology and tourism. It may also embody the industrial creative sectors, including audio-visual production. </p><p>For example, it is estimated that the audio-visual sector provides 6,000 full-time job equivalents. Last year, 53 feature films were made. Many of those employed in the industry are graduates. Some 65% of investment in the sector is inward investment. My Department is working with other Government Departments and agencies to examine ways in which further support can be provided to the industry.</p><p>Many people in the creative sectors will benefit from the additional funding which my Department is providing for the Decade of Commemorations, in particular the investment in the <i>Ireland 2016</i>programme. This comprises &euro;4m current and &euro;22m capital funding in 2015. </p><p>This includes a &euro;2 million allocation directed through the Arts Council for artistic projects and &euro;1m directed towards our key national cultural institutions.  There are also considerable employment benefits arising from the capital projects under way or being planned. For example, some 200 jobs have been created in the construction stage of the new interpretative centre in the GPO.  In addition, some 300 high-level jobs have been created in the construction work on the National Gallery of Ireland as part of a joint project funded by my Department, the OPW and the National Gallery.</p><p>The built heritage jobs leverage scheme was a funded by a special &euro;5 million stimulus package in 2014.  It was very successful and leveraged a further &euro;10 million in private funding and many projects benefited from it.  Funding for the protection of heritage sites and buildings will continue to be provided by my Department in 2015 via a number of schemes, which will be either directly administered or delivered through local authorities or through the Heritage Council.</p><p>I will continue to invest across the arts and heritage sector within the resources available to my Department.</p></reply>

In addition, there already has been very beneficial co-operation between the National Museum and the Imperial War Museum, including in relation to existing exhibitions in Collins Barracks.</p>  <p>  I also recently visited the Imperial War Museum in London and discussed the general issue of loans. The Director of the Museum stated that she was happy to work with authorities here in Ireland in relation to the loaning of material between relevant institutions. </p>  <p>  To ensure better coordination on issues of loans, my Department has now requested the National Museum to act as the central contact point to deal with loans between cultural institutions in Ireland and Britain during the course of the Decade of Commemorations.</p></reply>

It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated, having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.</p>  <p>  However, my Department will continue to provide funding for the protection, conservation and development of our built and natural heritage, in so far as resources allow.</p></reply>

While my Department provides funding to the national cultural institutions, the management and board of each institution are responsible for all operational matters, including storage, security and conservation, and I do not have a statutory function in respect of such day-to-day matters.  It is the responsibility of the management and the board of each institution to determine the spending priorities for their individual institutions, based on the resources available to them and the need to ensure the appropriate conservation and protection of collections.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the issues at the National Library regarding storage and the Library has been in communication with my Department in this regard.  The National Library has also placed its concerns on the record at Oireachtas Committee hearings. In this regard, I would be happy to make relevant documents available to the Deputy, following consultation with the National Library and subject to any issues of confidentiality or security which arise. I will revert to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  In regard to resources, I was pleased, at the conclusion of the recent Estimates processes, not only to have ensured there would be no reduction in funding for the arts and culture areas of my Department for 2015, but also to have secured an additional &euro;2 million in funding for the national cultural institutions. This included an increased allocation of &euro;600,000 for the National Library in 2015.  I was also pleased to recently approve a new post in the National Library for a security and facilities manager, which will be key to managing and planning the storage and security of the Library&rsquo;s collection.</p>  <p>  The overall funding secured for 2015 gives more certainty to the institutions and will allow them to continue to deliver on their core objectives, including the protection and conservation of their collections.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-18a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/973" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015061800060#WRA01400"><p>The report entitled <i>Nuashonr&uacute; ar an Staid&eacute;ar Cuimsitheach Teangeola&iacute;och ar &Uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht 2006-2011</i>was published by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta on 29 May. The report provides an update on statistical information contained in the <i>Comprehensive Linguistic Study of the Use of Irish in the Gaeltacht 2007 </i>and<i></i>takes account of Census data from 2006 and 2011. I understand that the report was commissioned by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to provide up-to-date information for use by organisations engaged in the preparation and implementation of language plans in Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas under the Gaeltacht Act 2012.  While acknowledging that the report points out the serious challenges facing the Irish language in the Gaeltacht, it is important to understand the overall context. The <i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030</i>is the corner stone of the Government&rsquo;s policy with regard to the language and the Strategy is being systematically implemented by a range of stakeholders, including Government Departments, Foras na Gaeilge and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. The Strategy was published in 2010, following cross-party support in the Houses of the Oireachtas and a comprehensive consultative and research process, including the Gaeltacht Commission report 2002 and the Comprehensive Linguistic Study<i></i>2007. A holistic, integrated approach to the Irish language underpins the Strategy and it is evident from the progress reports that have been published to date that significant progress is being made in implementing the key areas for action identified in it. </p><p>I am very aware of the dynamics of language change and the pressure minority languages face as a result of the ever-increasing dominance of English. In this context, it is important to note that the Irish language has been afforded significant constitutional and legislative protection by the State since its foundation. In addition, the Government&rsquo;s policy is to support parents raising their children through Irish in the Gaeltacht. My Department and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta fund a number of schemes in the Gaeltacht which support the implementation of that policy. </p><p>Finally, it is important to recognise the practical steps that are being taken by the State to improve matters. For example, the draft policy proposals for educational provision in Gaeltacht areas set out a range of potential interventions and are the basis of a consultation process currently being undertaken by the Department of Education and Skills in conjunction with my Department.</p></reply>

As a result, storage and increasing demands on space are ever-present issues for the National Archives. The use of off-site storage responds to this demand.</p>  <p>  The Government has recognised the demands facing the National Archives and, in December 2014, approved phase one of a building development plan at the National Archives&rsquo; Bishop Street premises.  </p>  <p>  The OPW has recently gone to tender for the first phase of the project with an estimated start date of late 2015. It is anticipated that the overall three-phase development plan will cost some &euro;20m in total.  </p>  <p>  This project will provide a significant amount of additional on-site storage for the National Archives and will address a number of longstanding problems with the building at Bishop Street.  It will also, in the longer term, reduce significantly the reliance on private storage.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s decision to step in to safeguard the monument will bring it into public ownership, will facilitate the restoration of the buildings and will ensure the proposed 1916 Commemorative Centre will be up and running as a public facility as speedily as possible.     Following on from the Government&rsquo;s decision, my Department and other relevant parties, including the monument owners, NAMA and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office, are actively engaged with the aim of completing the transfer of the property to the State as quickly as possible. My Department is also examining options for the restoration of the buildings with a view to having them open to the public at the earliest possible date.</p></reply>

This includes making &euro;624,000 available this year under the Structures at Risk Fund to support properties protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration. Since 2011, over 100 structures have been safeguarded for the future as a result of the Structures at Risk Fund. The remainder of my Department&rsquo;s built heritage capital budget for 2015 will be focused on the conservation and presentation of the State's heritage portfolio, which is managed by the Office of Public Works.</p>  <p>  The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage. For 2015, the Council is administering a community-based heritage grants scheme with funding of &euro;600,000 available for projects that contribute to particular heritage themes. </p>  <p>  In 2014 my Department was provided with a special allocation of &euro;5m from Capital Stimulus funding for a new Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme (BHJLS) to assist with works to safeguard structures, in private and civic ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  The BHJLS has successfully encouraged the investment of private capital in a number of small-scale, labour-intensive projects to repair and conserve historic structures, and has supported employment in this niche sector of the construction industry throughout 2014.  The scheme also facilitated the up-skilling of construction workers in traditional, conservation-related building skills.  </p>  <p>  540 historic structures, mainly privately owned, across the country benefited from conservation works under the BHJLS in 2014, and statistics gathered by the local authorities show that 175 full-time equivalent jobs were generated by the scheme. The operation of a similar scheme in the future would be contingent on dedicated funding being made available to my Department. </p>  <p>  The scope for financial support for the conservation of the built heritage is currently constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances. Nonetheless, I keep the competing priorities regarding the preservation and enhancement of the national heritage under on-going review, having regard to the resources available to my Department.</p></reply>

I asked the Chair if it would be possible to delay the sale, or to consider withdrawing the paintings from auction, to provide some time to explore all other possible options that would involve my Department and the Office of Public Works.

The programme is underpinned by five intersecting and overlapping themes; <i>Remembering</i>, <i>Reconciling</i>, <i>Presenting</i>, <i>Imagining</i>and <i>Celebrating</i>. These are intended to give people scope to think about the events of 1916 and its legacy in a way that is personal and meaningful to each individual.  I am committed, together with my Government colleagues, to ensuring that the commemorations to mark the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising will be inclusive, appropriate and respectful.</p><p>The programme will be an invitation to everyone on the island of Ireland and to the global Irish community to shape and engage in a diverse range of historical, cultural and artistic activities &ndash; all designed to facilitate reflection, commemoration, celebration, debate and analysis and an active imagining of our future.  The programme comprises seven strands; <i>State Ceremonial</i>; <i>Historical Reflection</i>; <i>An Teanga Bheo</i>; <i>Youth and Imagination</i>; <i>Cultural Expression</i>; <i>Community Participation</i>; and <i>Global and Diaspora</i>.  Further details in relation to the programme strands and the full range of varied events, initiatives and activities outlined in the <i>Ireland 2016</i>Centenary Programme, can be found on the website .</p><p>One of the core objectives of the <i>Ireland 2016</i>Centenary Programme is to encourage and facilitate participation by, and the inclusion of, the citizens of Ireland to the greatest extent possible.  Under the <i>Community Participation</i>strand of the programme, my Department&rsquo;s 2016 Project Team has been working with local authorities and local steering committees to maximise engagement with and participation by members of the public, young people, community organisations, historical societies, artists, writersand other interested parties within their areas to determine how they would like to see this significant centenary commemorated.</p><p>The <i>Community Participation</i>strand of the programme is being led by local authorities across the country and I have been working closely with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Alan Kelly, T.D., in this regard.  A widespread public consultation process has been underway for a number of months now in order to encourage and facilitate the involvement of national and local, ground-up, initiatives in the wider commemorative programme.  Each local authority has appointed a steering committee and a dedicated &lsquo;<i>Ireland 2016</i>Centenary Programme&rsquo; co-ordinator, to support engagement and facilitation within local communities. This is intended to generate awareness of the national programme; and to develop and deliver a plan for a suitable programme of events and initiatives to take place at a county level in line with the national plan for <i>Ireland 2016</i>.  Local authorities have been requested to submit their draft plans by end-June and they will then receive their funding allocations for 2015.  It is anticipated that the finalised plans will be submitted in October 2015.  </p><p>I believe that the work of the local authorities will be central to the commemorations programme for 2016.  The response from the local authorities to date has been extremely encouraging and I very much appreciate the energy and enthusiasm with which the local authorities and local communities have been engaging in this process.</p><p>In addition, the GAA will participate in the commemorations of the Rising through its network of clubs across the island of Ireland and the 2016 World Games will be held in Ireland.  The Heritage Council will also co-ordinate an inclusive community-based <i>Ireland 2016</i>Centenary Programme.</p><p>Full details of community initiatives will be available on as plans and initiatives are finalised.</p></reply>

Nonetheless, I keep the competing priorities regarding the preservation and enhancement of the national heritage under on-going review, having regard to the resources available to my Department. Funding for the protection of built heritage will continue to be provided by my Department in 2015 via a number of schemes. This includes making &euro;624,000 available this year under the Structures at Risk Fund to support properties protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration. Since 2011, over 100 structures have been safeguarded for the future as a result of the Structures at Risk Fund. The remainder of my Department&rsquo;s built heritage capital budget for 2015 will be focused on the conservation and presentation of the State's heritage portfolio, which is managed by the Office of Public Works.</p>  <p>  The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage. For 2015, the Council is administering a community-based heritage grants scheme with funding of &euro;547,000 available for projects that contribute to particular heritage themes. </p>  <p>  In 2014 my Department was provided with a special allocation of &euro;5 million from Capital Stimulus funding for a new Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme (BHJLS) to assist with works to safeguard structures, in private and civic ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. </p>  <p>  This scheme was administered directly through the local authorities and sought to encourage the investment of private capital in a number of small-scale, labour-intensive projects to repair and conserve historic structures and to support the employment of skilled and experienced conservation professionals, craft workers and tradespeople. My Department's allocation of &euro;5 million leveraged a further &euro;10 million in private funding, which led to a total of &euro;15 million being invested in 540 historic structures across the country.  Statistics gathered by the local authorities show that 175 full time equivalent jobs were generated by the scheme in 2014. The operation of a similar scheme in the future would be contingent on dedicated funding being made available to my Department.   </p>  <p>  The conservation and protection of Ireland's built heritage, both for its intrinsic value and as a support to economic renewal and sustainable employment, will continue to be a priority for my Department. </p></reply>

The wider objective is to help stall and, ultimately, reverse the trend towards depopulation, loss of vibrancy, vacancy and dereliction which currently exists.  This approach has been successfully used throughout Europe as a means of creating vibrant urban quarters with integrated historic buildings; transforming the public realm; and conserving historic cores, to positive advantage for residents and visitors.   During 2013 and 2014, my Department, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Heritage Council and three local authorities, ran a pilot HTI programme in Youghal, Listowel and Westport.   Central to the programme was that it was driven at local level, with guidance by a national steering group comprising officials from each local authority, my Department, the Heritage Council and F&aacute;ilte Ireland. An HTI guidance manual was also developed to assist each town in the pilot programme.</p>  <p>  A capital investment from my Department consisting of &euro;240,000 in 2013 and &euro;101,500 in 2014, supported by investment by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, and with additional funds from the local authorities, chambers of commerce and private individuals, funded the pilot initiative, which, in total, supported over 38 projects for the three towns. A preliminary review, undertaken by my Department, of the pilot programme concluded that a roll out of the HTI could bring substantial benefits in terms of the economy, employment, and the social and cultural fabric of our historic towns.   </p>  <p>  A national roll-out of the HTI is currently under consideration but will be contingent on the level of funding available to my Department.</p></reply>

The post office is seen as a key piece of financial and social infrastructure for both urban and rural areas.  Part of the strength of the post office brand, and one of its chief selling points, is that it reaches all parts of the country and can be accessed by anyone. It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices in the community.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s continuing support for An Post is apparent, both in terms of the cost of postage services and the value of the contract for welfare payments.  In this regard, we anticipate this year that we will pay over &euro;50 million to An Post under a contract for cash payment services to welfare customers.  This contract is very substantial in terms of its reach, value and impact.</p>  <p>  As you are aware my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Mr Alex White, T.D., formally launched the Post Office Network Business Development Group under the independent Chairmanship of Mr Bobby Kerr in February, 2015 to explore potential commercial opportunities available to the post office network.  I look forward to viewing the report from this Group.</p>  <p>  I understand An Post is anxious to grow its existing levels of services in the light of emerging market pressures which extend beyond the delivery of welfare payments.  In this context I am pleased to note An Post has tendered for the provision of a new payment and transaction account.  I look forward to that becoming available in the not too distant future as it will provide alternative payment opportunities for my Department&rsquo;s customers.  In order to recognise the general societal trend to electronic payments the Department has been changing some of its application forms.  The option to be paid at the post office remains on the forms.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the amendments do not remove the option to be paid at the post office. This option will remain on the forms.  Therefore, customers are free to opt to receive their payment at the post office if they wish. I also want to emphasise that the department continuously reviews its forms to ensure that they are amenable and relevant to all customers.  I have asked the department to review forms and update them to ensure that a more neutral wording in relation to payment options is provided.</p>  <p>  The Department is conscious of the important role of the post office around the country, not only in respect of social welfare payments but also in offering other financial services such as paying bills and carrying out a range of banking services.  The Government has consistently stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network as set out in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s priority in supporting CE is having access to schemes that can provide jobseekers and other vulnerable groups with good quality work experience and training qualifications to support their progression into employment. The proportion of participants over 60 years of age is currently 10.9% (May 2015).</p>  <p>  Persons of 60 years of age or over can participate for a cumulative maximum of 6 years on CE, with one additional year being available for persons who were in receipt of a disability-linked social welfare payment.</p>  <p>  Participation on CE ranges from 1 year up to 6 years for participants depending on their eligibility and 7 years for people with a disability.  I believe that this is extensive for an active labour market programme. However, I am currently examining this issue.</p></reply>

There are approximately 68,000 rent supplement recipients, with over 2,060 recipients in the Wicklow area. The Government has provided over &euro;298 million for the scheme in 2015.</p><p>I fully acknowledge the difficulties that people are experiencing, including rent supplement recipients, in maintaining suitable affordable accommodation in the current market as a result of increasing rents, as set out in the research referred to by the Deputy. The Department&rsquo;s recent review of the maximum rent limits found that market rents have been increasing significantly over the past 18 months, especially in major urban areas, with this increase in rents fundamentally attributable to a reduced supply of housing. The implementation of the range of actions under the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy will support increased housing supply.  </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s review also found that increasing rent limits at this time could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not alone rent supplement recipients, but lower-income workers and students.  Between the rent supplement scheme administered by this Department and the Rental Accommodation Scheme administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market. The State is, therefore, a very significant player in the sector.</p><p>In response to these difficulties, the Department has put in place a number of preventative measures to ensure that people at risk of homelessness or loss of their tenancy are supported under the rent supplement scheme where increased rental payments are required. The Department&rsquo;s preventative policy allows for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; individual accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework. Under this approach, each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis, and rents are being increased above prescribed limits throughout the country, as appropriate. Staff in the Community Welfare Service of the Department who administer the rent supplement scheme have a statutory discretionary power to award or increase a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are risk of losing their tenancy. This flexible approach has already assisted over 2,100 rent supplement households nationwide to retain their rented accommodation through the payment of increased rent payments.</p><p>A Tenancy Sustainment Protocol in conjunction with Threshold was introduced in the Dublin region and Cork city where supply is particularly acute. The primary objective of the Protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families and persons at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance.  Of the 2,100 households referred to above, almost 700 households in Dublin have been supported as a result of engagement under the Protocol and over 20 households in Cork City.</p><p>The Department has also undertaken a communications campaign which seeks to encourage people at risk to contact the Department or the Threshold Tenancy Protection service as early as possible to prevent an unnecessary episode of homelessness.<b></b>The actions undertaken include issuing text messages to over 50,000 rent supplement recipients, issuing monthly tweets to Department followers, updating the Department&rsquo;s website and the distribution of posters to Department Offices, Post Offices, Citizen Information Centres, MABs offices and Oireachtas members. The Department&rsquo;s response to the current housing difficulties remains under review to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided.</p><p>The issue of social housing lists is a matter for my Government colleague, Alan Kelly T.D., Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

Under the Flood Re programme insurers will transfer into the fund those homes at high risk of flooding which they feel unable to insure themselves.  Under the scheme, the flood risk element of house insurance premiums for these homes will be capped according to UK council tax bands.  Flood Re will charge member insurance firms a total annual charge of &pound;180 million for providing this service.  The insurers will then pass this charge back to all their customers, resulting in an estimated levy of &pound;10.50 on annual household premiums.  Ireland, being a smaller pool could see significantly higher impact on premiums from a pooling arrangement.  The UK Flood-Re scheme is only due to go live in April 2016 and so it would be premature to carry out a review of its impact at this stage. </p><p>The current Government approach to address the availability of flood insurance is to address the underlying problem through appropriate remedial works.  This involves:</p><p>(a) prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the OPW and relevant local authorities to address those areas of greatest need including areas where the insurance industry is finding it most difficult to provide cover - so that flood relief programmes can have maximum impact, where economically feasible,</p><p>(b) improving channels of communication between OPW and the insurance industry with the objective of ensuring that appropriate and relevant information on completed OPW flood defence schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.</p><p>This coordinated whole-of-Government approach is led by OPW, under the aegis of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with further involvement from the relevant local authorities and other bodies in order to maximise the level of resources available to address flood relief works.  Because of cost and scale of these types of flood defence works, it is an approach which will see benefits over the medium and long term.</p><p>A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Insurance Ireland and the OPW on the sharing of information in relation to completed flood defence works came into effect in on 1st June 2014 and the first full renewal cycle following the MoU has not yet been completed.  In January 2015, Insurance Ireland provided a report to OPW on progress so far.  While this report showed some improvements, it is expected that a fuller and more detailed report on progress under the MoU will be made available to OPW after June 2015.  I will assess the progress reported to OPW in the coming months and will consider whether the current approach is delivering the expected results and whether other approaches need to be considered.</p><p>In cases where individuals are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance and believe that they are being treated unfairly it is open to them to contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.  Their service can be contacted at (01) 676 1914 or by email at </p></reply>

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. </p><p>For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the &quot;Group threshold&quot; below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.</p><p>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.</p><p><b>The Group A tax free threshold of &euro;225,000, </b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p><p><b>The Group B tax free threshold of &euro;30,150, </b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p><p><b>The Group C tax free threshold &euro;15,075, </b>applies in all other cases.</p><p>Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold.  In recent years these thresholds were reduced and the rate has been increased in order to maintain the yield from capital taxes in the face of falling asset prices and as part of our fiscal consolidation efforts.  In addition, taxes on certain capital are less harmful from an economic perspective than taxes on employment.</p><p>I am aware that property values have increased, with developments which had been restricted to the Dublin area now manifesting in other areas of the country, though not to the same extent in terms of price rises.  I recognise that the increase in property values has a bearing on taxation of the inheritance and gifting of property with respect to CAT thresholds.  In this light, I will be keeping Capital Acquisitions Tax thresholds, rates and other aspects of the tax under review, particularly in the context of preparations for Budget 2016 and the consequent Finance Bill.</p></reply>

In 2014 the Better Energy programme provided &euro;53m grant support towards &euro;118m energy upgrade works.</p><p>The carbon tax, as part of the overarching energy strategy, is a key tools to reduce emissions towards meeting our climate change commitments.  It is well established that, in the long term, environmental damage caused by emissions of greenhouse gases will have a negative economic impact.  The cost of this damage is substantial for society. The introduction of the carbon tax is aimed at internalising these externalities and the report of the SEAI shows, is having the desired impact.</p><p>Further to positively influencing behaviour, the carbon tax has generated much needed revenue for the Exchequer.  </p><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the yield from the Carbon Tax levy in each year 2011 to 2014 is as shown in the table following. <table><tr><th>Carbon Tax</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>Auto Diesel </td><td>97.53</td><td>130.78</td><td>137.23</td><td>144.86</td></tr><tr><td>Petrol </td><td>60.11</td><td>74.62</td><td>69.59</td><td>65.69</td></tr><tr><td>Aviation Gasoline</td><td>0.04</td><td>0.05</td><td>0.03</td><td>0.02</td></tr><tr><td>Kerosene</td><td>40.52</td><td>40.41</td><td>47.32</td><td>42.28</td></tr><tr><td>Marked Gas Oil</td><td>48.95</td><td>54.72</td><td>60.39</td><td>54.17</td></tr><tr><td>Fuel Oil</td><td>2.33</td><td>2.32</td><td>2.31</td><td>1.78</td></tr><tr><td>LPG (Other)</td><td>5.43</td><td>6.52</td><td>7.58</td><td>7.53</td></tr><tr><td>Auto LPG</td><td>0.20</td><td>0.03</td><td>0.07</td><td>0.11</td></tr><tr><td>Natural Gas</td><td>43.13</td><td>44.51</td><td>56.54</td><td>51.68</td></tr><tr><td>Solid Fuel</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.00</td><td>7.32</td><td>17.23</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>298.23</td><td>353.95</td><td>388.38</td><td>385.36</td></tr></table></p><p>Please note that the receipts shown for Carbon Tax for 2014 are provisional and are subject to revision. </p></reply>

Through a continuation of prudent, medium-term focussed budgetary and economic policies, sustainable increases in jobs and in living standards for all will be achieved.  The policies to achieve this objective include:</p><p><b>A growth-friendly tax system:</b>The Government's tax policy is focussed on putting the tax base on a more stable and sustainable footing.  We are rebalancing the tax system in a growth friendly manner by maintaining a broad base, rigorously evaluating new and existing tax expenditures, relying to a greater extent on taxes that are less harmful to growth, and gradually lowering the tax burden on labour. The commencement of a multi-year programme of income tax reform which began in Budget 2015 is part of this process.  </p><p><b>Financing for growth:</b>The Government is working to ensure adequate credit supply for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises through inter alia state-sponsored vehicles such as the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  We are continuing to explore ways of improving credit supply, including through non-bank sources.  The Government is actively engaged in work at European level on the Capital Markets Union and the European Fund for Strategic Investments.</p><p><b>Labour market policies:</b>The Action Plan for Jobs is a whole-of-Government process that has played a key role in creating employment and reducing unemployment.  The Plan's target of 100,000 additional jobs by 2016 will be met this year.  Unemployment has fallen by 5 percentage points since its peak.  The Government is continuing to work to reduce it further through the Action Plan for Jobs and the Pathways to Work strategy. </p><p><b>Recouping the cost of the bank bail-out:</b>The investment in the banks by Irish taxpayers has been unprecedented, totalling &euro;64 billion.  Over the past few years, major steps have been taken to reduce the overall cost of this recapitalisation including the liquidation of the IBRC, the disposal of some of our banking investments and the receipt of interest and fees. In relation to our remaining banking assets, the Government's strategy is to identify suitable opportunities for disposal which will maximise the return for the taxpayer.</p><p><b>Reducing the drag from public debt</b>: Policy efforts by the Government have reduced the deficit and put debt on a sustainable path.  These efforts have reaped considerable benefits through the reductions in the debt burden.  The Government is complying with European fiscal rules which are designed to ensure that sensible levels of debt and deficit are achieved, and that increased public expenditure can be financed.</p><p><b>Targeted sector-specific interventions:</b>Re-building the economy sector-by-sector has been a key feature of the Government's economic policy.  In some areas, such as tourism and agrifood, the approach has been about building on comparative advantage and exploiting new market opportunities. In other sectors, particularly construction, the focus has been on repairing the sector.  The Government has developed a number of sectoral strategies with the aim to continue this successful approach, including in Tourism, Financial Services, Construction and Agrifood.</p><p>These, and other policies, are set out in detail in the Spring Economic Statement.  Sustained implementation of these policies is key to achieving steady, stable growth in employment and output over the medium term, to deliver a more prosperous future for all.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-18a.231.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015061800066#WRG01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 to 93, inclusive, together.</p><p>It is important to point out to the Deputy that debtors are entitled to petition to bankrupt themselves in accordance with the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. The decision to grant bankruptcy is therefore a matter for the relevant jurisdiction.  This is not something that NAMA can control.</p><p>I am advised that as a secured lender, NAMA's experience has been that bankruptcy has not prejudiced recoveries on secured assets. As a secured lender, NAMA is legally entitled to enforce over and to realise the assets securing its loans. This is not affected by debtor bankruptcy. Furthermore, NAMA advises me that in practically all bankruptcy cases involving its debtors, it had enforced over or had realised the secured assets securing its loans prior to the debtor's filing for bankruptcy.</p><p>Bankruptcy proceedings therefore relate, generally, to the unsecured liabilitiesof the bankrupt.  The role of the bankruptcy official (usually a trustee) is to oversee the estate of the bankrupt and to gather in and realise the bankrupt's assets including property and cash, identify creditors, and ultimately make a distribution to creditors, including NAMA, in accordance with priority. The bankruptcy official can also seek orders in respect of post-bankruptcy earnings through, for example, an income payment order or other attachment. The bankruptcy official may also have grounds to seek reversals of asset transfers for the benefit of the bankrupt's estate under the rules of the relevant jurisdiction.</p><p>NAMA does not write off its unsecured debt as a result of a debtor being adjudicated a bankrupt.  As advised, it is a matter for the bankruptcy proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction to deal with the bankrupt's debts and, even after the bankrupt has been discharged, the bankruptcy estate continues to be administered by the bankruptcy official until such time as all assets have been liquidated and the debt, in so far as possible, has been repaid. Reflecting this, I am advised by NAMA that the winding up of bankrupt estates in the vast majority of cases involving its debtors is ongoing.  NAMA's financial statements for 2014, which are available on NAMA's website, , take account of the financial position of its whole loan book including debtors that have been declared bankrupt. As with all debtor connections, NAMA conducts regular impairment reviews of connections whose principals have been declared bankrupt and, for the reasons set out, bankruptcy does not in itself cause the impairment position to deteriorate.  </p><p>NAMA advises that in each instance of bankruptcy involving a NAMA debtor it reviews its legal options and selects the most appropriate method of ensuring the best possible return for Irish taxpayers.  This includes challenging the discharge from bankruptcy in instances where there has been material non-disclosure by the bankrupt. It has also included in a small number of cases challenging bankruptcy applications for various reasons but often on the basis of Centre of Main Interests (COMI).</p><p>I am advised by NAMA that it does not generally incur costs in situations where debtors petition to bankrupt themselves, aside from the small number of cases where NAMA has challenged such bankruptcy petition where the circumstances have so prescribed. In the few cases where NAMA has initiated actions against debtors, and which ultimately result in bankruptcy, legal costs relate to the entirety of NAMA's actions to recover debts owing to it, often across a number of legal jurisdictions, and it is not feasible to segregate the costs which specifically pertain to the application for bankruptcy.  Furthermore, given the small number of cases involved, to isolate legal costs in this way could have the effect of identifying specific cases.  This would not be appropriate, particularly given that some of these legal cases are ongoing and could be subject to further legal action.  For the Deputy's information, a breakdown of legal and other professional fees incurred by NAMA in the conduct of its business for each year of its operation was provided in response to D&aacute;il Question No. 111 on 19<sup>th</sup>May 2015  .  </p><p>I am advised by NAMA that as at end-May 2015 a total of 92 debtors had been declared bankrupt: 20 in Ireland, 70 in the UK, which includes Northern Ireland debtors, and 2 in the US.  Those 92 individuals had a cumulative debt exposure as part of wider debtor connections to approximately &euro;11 billion in par debt. </p><p>A breakdown of debtor bankruptcy by year and jurisdiction is set out below:</p><p>Table 1:NAMA debtor bankruptcy by year and jurisdiction<table><tr><th>Country</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>Ireland</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>UK </td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>13</td><td>29</td><td>15</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>U.S.A.</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td></tr></table></p><p>As also set out below, 54 debtors have to date been discharged from bankruptcy.</p><p>Table 2:NAMA debtor bankruptcy discharges by year<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>12</td><td>25</td><td>13</td><td>3</td><td>54</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The meetings focused on the mortgage market and specifically the comparatively high standard variable rates currently being charged by the banks. </p><p>I outlined my view, that Standard Variable Rates being charged in the Irish market are too high.  There was agreement from all lenders that customers should have access to more competitive mortgage products as per my recommendation.</p><p>The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers. Some of the potential products include lower standard variable rates for existing and new customers, competitive fixed rate products and lower variable rates taking account of loan to value for new and existing customers. </p><p>In addition to the issue of rates I also outlined the need for greater competition in the market and the need for a more active and well-resourced campaign by the individual banks. This should focus on promoting awareness of their best offering and how easy it is for customers to take up new products and switch between different institutions if they wish to avail of better rates.</p><p>In relation to switching, I understand that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is planning to provide more information to consumers to encourage switching. Although I did not meet the financial institution to which the Deputy refers, I would hope that increased competition will impact on all institutions. I expect that if financial institutions are convinced that there is a threat that they will lose these customers, they will reduce the rates that they currently charge existing customers. The CCPC website is a valuable source of information on the rates charged by various financial institutions.</p><p>The financial institution to whom the Deputy refers is regulated by the Central Bank and the borrower may complain to the Financial Services Ombudsman if he is unable to resolve the complaint to his satisfaction with the institution. The Financial Services Ombudsman was set up to adjudicate on unresolved disputes between complainants and financial service providers in an independent and impartial manner. </p></reply>

The OPW is committed to providing Insurance Ireland with data on all completed OPW flood defence schemes showing the design, extent and nature of the protections offered by these works.  Insurance Ireland members will then take into account all information provided by the OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas.</p><p>Since June 2014, the OPW has provided Insurance Ireland with data on the following sixteen completed OPW flood defence schemes.</p><p>River Suir, Clonmel, Co. Tipperary</p><p>River Dodder Tidal, Dublin City</p><p>River Tolka, Dublin City</p><p>River Tolka, Dublin Fingal</p><p>River Tolka, Meath</p><p>River Nanny, Duleek, Co.

Carlow</p><p>The details of the information provided to the Insurance Sector is available on the OPW website, .</p><p>While early indications from the insurance sector are that flood risk insurance is widely available in areas where flood relief schemes have been completed by the OPW, the Department of Finance and the OPW have recently set out the range of detailed information that they require from the insurance industry to measure the benefit to the availability of affordable flood insurance to households and businesses from these completed flood defence schemes.</p><p>Under the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme detailed flood maps for 300 communities at potentially significant risk from flooding are being produced by the OPW.  Their development involves public consultation and when finalised these maps will inform the Flood Risk Management Plans on how best to address the flood risk in each of these areas.  It is envisaged that these plans will be completed in the second half of 2016 and the details of those planned schemes will be provided to the insurance industry in line with the Memorandum of Understanding.</p><p>I recently asked the Oireachtas All Party Finance Committee to give consideration to Flood Insurance and possible policy options that they would like considered.  I await the submission of their report which I will ask the Department of Finance to examine.  Officials from the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works have received the report from the All Party Committee and are considering its recommendations.</p></reply>

On 28 March, 2014, the European Commission published three new Directives as a collective reform of the existing EU regime for public procurement under the existing provisions of Directive 2004/17/EU - coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors and Directive 2004/18/EU - on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts.</p><p>The three new Directives, including the Directive referred to by the Deputy are:</p><p>- 2014/23/EU - on the award of concession contracts</p><p>- 2014/24/EU- on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004/18/EU</p><p>- 2014/25/EU - on procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors and repealing Directive 2004/17/EC</p><p>The three Directives require to be transposed into national law by all EU Member States by April 2016.  In this regard, the Office of Government Procurement, which is under the aegis of my Department, is progressing the process of transposition into Irish law.  The criteria for the award of contract will be based on the provisions in the Statutory Instrument that implements each Directive into national law and they will be applied in accordance with the subject matter or nature of the contract.</p><p>A Report on the performance of the Public Works Contract was published on 11 December last year.  It contains 4 interim recommendations and a framework for a medium term strategy to inform engagement between industry stakeholders.  Engagement with industry stakeholders is underway on the interim recommendations and the three recommendations which amend the conditions of contract will be implemented by the middle of this year.  The recommendation relating to the Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT) award for works contracts will be implemented later this year upon publication of robust criteria and guidance material.  Broader engagement on the procurement of public projects will be ongoing with industry stakeholders throughout 2015.  They will be invited to contribute to a medium-term strategy which will encompass procurement and recent developments in the fields of technology and legislation governing the construction industry.  Key areas such as performance evaluation, risk management and different contracting strategies will also be considered as part of the strategy with recommendations to be put to Government before the end of this year.  A copy of the report is available to download from the construction Procurement Reform website:  .</p></reply>

However, the day-to day operations of individual Departments/Offices are the responsibility of those Departments/Offices.</p>  <p>  The Commissioners of Public Works are charged by Government to administer and manage a significant property portfolio for the State.  This is conducted in an environment of changing market forces, time constraints and the requirements for the delivery of critical State services.  I have full confidence in the Commissioners and their ability to discharge their statutory functions and responsibilities in this regard.  The Deputy is aware that the OPW is subject to the same accountability process involving the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG) and Committee of Public Accounts (PAC) of the D&aacute;il as other Government Departments and Offices.</p>  <p>  Property Asset Management reform is an important element of the Government's overall Public Service Reform Plan and the OPW has been assigned as the lead agency in delivering on this programme.  The key objective of this reform agenda is to improve the management of the State's property portfolio in an even more professional, coordinated and efficient manner that realises value for money and facilitates business needs and service provision across the Public Service.  The Government agreed a range of measures to realise the benefits of better property management and these are set out in "Accommodating Change Measuring Success", the Government's Property Asset Management Delivery Plan, which was published in July 2013.  A copy of the Delivery Plan is available on www.opw.ie.  A progress report on the implementation of this plan will be published before the end of July.</p>  <p>  My Department has fully supported the OPW in the implementation of this strategy through:</p>  <p>  1. its participation on the Steering Group on Property Asset Management;  and</p>  <p>  2. sanctioning the filling of posts considered essential to address issues identified in the Capacity and Capability Review of the OPW's Estate Portfolio Management function conducted in 2013-14 by external experts.</p>  <p>  In addition, this Government has sought to introduce greater openness, transparency and accountability through the Public Service Reform and Civil Service Renewal programmes.  It was in this context that I established the Independent Panel on Strengthening Civil Service Accountability and Performance, to which the two OPW surveyors made their submission.  The submission indicated that, in property transactions, the potential for corruption exists if effective governance arrangements are not present and it sought an increase in the number of professionals in the property management area in the Civil Service.</p>  <p>  I understand that the OPW has engaged with its surveyors in a positive and constructive manner on the issues raised in their submission.  While the surveyors did not identify any instances of "corrupt actions", they did make reference to a number of property transactions going back over many years about which they had concerns.  The surveyors have been asked by the OPW to review these projects in more detail and any issues arising will be referred to the C&amp;AG for review.  The surveyors involved are fully engaged in this process.</p></reply>

It will support projects with partners in both Ireland and Wales focussing on activities across three priority areas: cross-border innovation; adaptation of the Irish Sea and coastal communities to climate change; and cultural and natural resources and heritage.</p>  <p>  The Programme was prepared in line with the reformed Cohesion Policy for 2014-20, which has a new focus on thematic concentration, performance, and results.  The final Programme was the result of a detailed process of programme planning in line with EU regulations, and included public consultation and negotiations with the Commission.</p>  <p>  Given that the Ireland Wales border is a maritime border, the Programme must have a maritime focus.  Nevertheless, the eligible area in Ireland includes inland counties (Kildare, Carlow, Kilkenny, and Tipperary) as well as coastal counties (Meath, Dublin, Wicklow, Waterford, Wexford, Cork, Kerry).</p>  <p>  Project partners in any of the counties in the eligible area may put forward project proposals for any of the priorities.  As a cross-border Programme, projects must have partners in both Ireland and Wales and they must have a cross-border added-value element.  In the case of one of the three priorities (cultural and natural resources and heritage) the project benefits must accrue to coastal communities.  This was a requirement of the European Commission and applies equally to Ireland and Wales.  Inland counties are not precluded from taking part in this priority, but the benefits must accrue to the coastal community as well as to the non-coastal community.</p></reply>

The issue to which the Deputy refers is specific to those civil servants who were serving in August 1984 and who exercised their option not to join the Revised Spouses' and Children's Superannuation Scheme.</p>  <p>  In 2013 officials of my Department were asked to give consideration to the implications of a decision to permit those current and former civil servants who were serving in August 1984 and are now in civil partnerships a further option of opting into the Revised Scheme, if they chose not to in 1984.  I am advised that, given the background of changing legislation over the years, including the introduction of divorce, and to avoid a charge of discrimination, this option could not of course be limited solely to those entering civil partnerships.  It would therefore have to be made available to all relevant serving and former civil servants (and public servants in a similar position). In the circumstances I am advised that allowing for this option could likely accrue a substantial additional cost to the existing accrued liability of public service pensions.</p>  <p>  As a consequence I do not intend to bring forward proposals to facilitate serving and former civil servants (appointed prior to 1 September 1984) and who exercised the option in 1984 not to join the Revised Spouses' and Children's Superannuation Scheme to revisit that option.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has a broad mandate that covers all sectors of the economy.  Furthermore, in addition to its statutory responsibility for the enforcement of competition and consumer protection law, the Commission has a general mandate to promote consumer welfare within the State through, for example, the use of advocacy.  The Commission&rsquo;s functions are set down in Section 10 of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 (&ldquo;the Act&rdquo;) and include, <i>inter alia</i>:</p><p>- promoting and protecting the interests and welfare of consumers; </p><p>- enforcing the relevant statutory provisions of the Act; </p><p>- encouraging compliance with the Act generally; and </p><p>- advising Government and any public body or agency on the likely impact of their actions and/or decisions on consumer protection and welfare.</p><p>The course of action open to the Commission in respect of pricing structures in prison tuck shops, if any, would depend on the nature and details of the particular circumstances.</p><p>More generally, it is worth recalling that retail prices of goods are not regulated by Irish legislation, regardless of the retail outlet.  However, price display and/or the provision of information on prices are subject to the provisions of EU Directive 98/6/EC on consumer protection in the indication of the prices of products offered to consumers and EU Directive 2<font color="#212100">005/29/EC concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market (&ldquo;the Unfair Commercial Practice Directive&rdquo;). Directive 98/6/EC </font>requires that the price of a product, and where relevant, the unit price of a product, be unambiguous, easily identifiable as referring to that product, be clearly visible and legible to prospective customers and be in proximity to the product.</p></reply>

As I understand the background, in September 2012 Clerys was bought from receivership by Gordon Brothers, as US fund which operates as a purchaser of distressed assets.  Gordon Brothers set up a new company structure under OCS Investment Holdings limited, and the Clerys employees were transferred to a 100% subsidiary, OCS Operations Limited, under transfer of undertakings with terms and conditions intact.  I further understand that the new company structure had a second 100% subsidiary of OCS Investment Holdings limited, OCS Properties Limited, which became the owner of the property.</p>  <p>  Last Friday, it was announced that Gordon Brothers had sold their shareholding in OCS Holdings to a new company, Natrium Ltd, a joint venture between a Dublin property company D2 Private, and a London business, Cheyne Capital Management. That afternoon, OCS Operating Ltd. petitioned the High Court to appoint a provisional liquidator, with the Court being told that the company was unlikely to have sufficient monies to make upcoming payments, and was unable to pay its debts. Mr. Kieran Wallace and Mr Eamonn Richardson of KPMG, who I met on Tuesday, were appointed by the Court.  In dealing with the devastating impact of the news on the workers concerned the Liquidator put a team of 10 people in place to immediately engage with the workers in those early hours after their appointment on Friday and, to be fair to them, have been engaging actively since then.</p>  <p>  My first priority on hearing the news was to work with my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, to ensure that the workers receive their statutory entitlements.  Officials from the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) which comes within the remit of my Department, are working closely with the Department of Social Protection to provide advice and assistance to affected workers.  Ireland&rsquo;s employment rights legislation provides protections for employees difficult situations such as those directly employed by OCS Operations Limited.</p>  <p>  The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973 requires employers to give notice of termination or to pay employees in lieu of notice, and outstanding wages, holiday pay, commission and bonuses are protected by the Payment of Wages Act, 1991.  In the event that an employer is insolvent, the employees are entitled to seek payment from the State through the Insolvency Payments Scheme, which is administered by the Department of Social Protection.  The employees may also be entitled to payment from this fund in respect of holiday pay, outstanding pay and minimum notice, amongst others.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection has assembled a team of people to meet with and advise the workers in relation to entitlements to jobseekers payments, secondary payments such as rent supplement and future options in relation to alternative employment, training and education.  Arrangements have been made for Social Protection staff and staff of the National Employment Rights Authority to meet with workers later today.  In addition, the Department of Social Protection is informing its network of local offices in the greater Dublin area of these developments to ensure that claims from affected workers are processed in a speedy and sensitive manner.</p>  <p>  Claims are made through the person legally appointed to wind-up the company.  Monies owed up to the appointment of a liquidator are secured by the Social Insurance Fund, subject to statutory limitations.  Entitlements are limited to a maximum weekly rate of &euro;600 and there is a limit of eight weeks&rsquo; pay for arrears of pay, sick pay or holiday pay.</p>  <p>  A representative of the Liquidator has verbally advised the Department of Social Protection that all staff have been made redundant and that P45s will issue this week.  The Liquidator will seek, on behalf of workers, payment from the Redundancy Payments Scheme in respect of statutory redundancy and from the Insolvency Payments Scheme (IPS) in respect of unpaid wages, accrued but untaken leave, and payment in lieu of statutory notice. It is intended that individual meetings will be held between the Liquidator and workers affected to determine, on an individual basis, the extent of liabilities. The Department of Social Protection will deal promptly with individual applications submitted in respect of the IPS by the Liquidator.</p>  <p>  The situation regarding the staff employed by the concession stores is somewhat different.  I met with representatives from the 50 concessions yesterday.  Many of those concessions have other outlets, and it may be the case, for example, that staff can be redeployed to other locations. The concession holders have very immediate concerns in relation to directly owned stock and money which they say is owed to them from their own direct sales proceeds. The Liquidator has indicated to me that he will be dealing with these issues as a matter of priority and I understand that stock is being returned to concession holders &ndash; and I welcome that.</p>  <p>  I consider it vital that workers are treated with dignity and respect at all time, and that they and their representatives are consulted with on all matters affecting them.  There are clearly entities involved in this transaction that did not respect that concept and left it to Court appointed Liquidators to do their communicating for them. The liquidators have met with unions. I welcome the fact that they will be sitting down with the OCS Operations employees individually, to assist them in filling the necessary forms for their statutory entitlements.</p>  <p>  What has happened in Clerys is very shocking and those who are directly employed by Clery&rsquo;s and those who own and work in concession stores have been treated appallingly.  Clery&rsquo;s is part of the wider Dublin city centre community and the Clery&rsquo;s building represents an iconic landmark which has played an important part in the life of the capital for well over 100 years.  I intend to engage with the new owners behind Natrium Limited whom, I believe, should indicate their plans for the property at an early date and how its employment potential can be maximised.</p></reply>

The Programme forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme (RDP) and allocates funding of some &euro;300 million over the next six years to suckler farmers in Ireland. The BDGP builds on the large strategic investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in recent years, and will ultimately bring about fundamental improvements to the entire sector by substantially improving the genetic quality of the national beef herd.</p><p>While the BDGP is an area based payment, the area upon which payment is made is based on the number of suckler cows calving in the herd in 2014. It is not possible to have a &ldquo;rolling reference year&rdquo; that changes continuously due to the European Commission requirement for a stable payment and, furthermore, a scheme under the RDP could not provide an incentive to increase stock numbers. Selecting 2014 also adds a measure of administrative simplicity for farmers that will facilitate early payments under the scheme.</p><p>Nonetheless, the provisions allow the use of 2015 as an alternative basis for new entrants, young farmers and if <i>force majeure</i>or other circumstances had an adverse impact on stocking levels in 2014. The use of 2015 as a base year will be decided upon request from individual farmers and on a case by case basis. In addition, 2015 can also be used by farmers that reduce their herd in 2015 and would otherwise be ineligible due to the reduction in herd or farm size between 2014 and 2015.</p><p>The BDGP builds on the schemes operated by my Department in recent years and most of the actions will already be familiar to the majority of farmers entering the scheme, including the data recording elements and the genotyping requirements. The replacement strategy is one of the main new elements of the BDGP over and above existing schemes for the suckler beef sector. The need for genetic improvement in the Irish suckler herd is widely acknowledged, and the adoption of genomic technology is a critically important tool in increasing production efficiency and ultimately farmer margins. The requirement for farmers to move towards using 4 and 5 star rated stock bulls and heifers is essential to the programmes objectives.  Furthermore, any adjustment to these provisions would require engagement with the Commission and would jeopardise the operation of the programme.</p><p>In addition, I should note that many farmers are already well on the way to meeting the requirement for 4 and 5 star animals. Analysis undertaken by ICBF of the 2014 Beef Genomics Scheme has indicated that some 30% of herds are already compliant with the requirement for female animals in 2020 i.e. that the number of 4 and 5 star heifers are equal to 50% of the reference animals on each farm. Furthermore, 52% are already compliant with the 2018 requirement. All farmers will receive comprehensive training, and ongoing information and advice to assist them in introducing the required breeding strategy. I am also aware that these requirements will take time to introduce which is why there is a 5 year lead-in time included in the design of the programme.</p><p>In relation to the stock bull replacement requirement, I do not consider there to be any risk of inbreeding as a result of the requirements of this scheme. The majority of stock bulls on existing scheme herds are already 4 or 5 stars. There is also a very wide range of AI bulls available for pedigree beef breeding that are 4 or 5 stars on either the replacement or terminal index. For example, the ICBF recently completed a listing of recommended sires for bull breeders involved in the Gene Ireland maternal beef breeding program. In total there are 164 bulls in that catalogue, 151 (92%) of which are 4 or 5 stars on either the replacement or terminal index within or across breeds.</p><p>For imported bulls, the ICBF assigns a rating based on the data available for each bull at that time. The approach used to assigning this rating is in line with that used for all other bulls under the EuroStar rating system. The fact that 20% of the AI used can come from other types of bulls also gives scope for pedigree breeders that wish to use some outcross sires as part of the Programme or for commercial herds wishing to use AI from bulls which are not 4 or 5 stars.</p><p>As regards genotyping, the number of animals to be genotyped each year will be equal to 60% of the number of calved suckler cows that the applicant had on his/her holding in 2014 &ndash; known as the applicant&rsquo;s &ldquo;reference animals&rdquo;. The number of &ldquo;reference animals&rdquo; will be advised to applicants upon acceptance into the scheme. For example, an applicant with 15 reference animals in 2014 must have sufficient animals to genotype 9 cows/heifers/calves/stock bulls, in each year of the programme, without repetition.</p><p>The 60% of the herd that will be genotyped each year represents an increase compared to the 15% under the 2014 Beef Genomic Scheme, however the percentage of the overall payment related to genotyping is broadly the same under both schemes. The 15% genotyping in 2014 was undertaken to develop the training population for genomic which provides the platform for the more widespread application of genomics and higher level of genotyping now made possible under the BDGP.</p><p>The 60% genotyping requirement reflects the need to genotype a high percentage of female calves at birth within scheme herds and to genotype female animals introduced from non-scheme herds so that sufficient 4 and 5 star animals can be identified. The 60% requirement will also include pedigree males and cows for ongoing research and knowledge development. This increased level of genotyping improves the reliability of the breeding indexes and, importantly, ensures the identification of sufficient numbers of 4 &amp;amp; 5 star females required by BDGP herds. In addition, and given that the payment is based on cost incurred and income foregone, any reduction in the level of genotyping would result in a reduction in the payment to the participant farmer to reflect the lower level of genotyping.</p><p>Finally, I would like to add that participants in the BDGP will receive advice and guidance on an ongoing basis to assist them in meeting the requirements of the programme. The BDGP, like all RDP Schemes, will be subject to mid-term review. If aspects of the scheme can be improved in the future, I will seek to address these issues in consultation with the EU Commission in a manner consistent with the relevant regulation.</p></reply>

The BDGP builds on the large strategic investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in recent years, and will ultimately bring about fundamental improvements to the entire sector by substantially improving the genetic quality of the national beef herd.</p>  <p>  The BDGP was launched on 5 May and my Department received almost 30,000 applications by the extended closing date of 5 June. While analysis of the applications is still ongoing, the initial figures suggest that the programme is fully subscribed and that there will not be a surplus in the Programme&rsquo;s budget. Of course, should any surplus arise, I will examine the potential to re-open the scheme in 2016 for new applicants.</p>  <p>  The number of applications, and subsequently the number of herd owners involved in the programme, is broadly comparable to the numbers with which my Department and the ICBF engaged with as part of both the Beef Genomics Scheme and Beef Data Programme last year. The experience garnered in operating these schemes demonstrates the capability to provide an efficient and effective service.  While there are extra elements to the BDGP which will require additional processing resources, I am satisfied that adequate provision has been made to deliver an efficient service to scheme participants, including as regards genomic evaluations. </p>  <p>Finally, I should also note that the 2014 pilot Beef Genomic Scheme provides the research base for which genomic evaluations can be provided to BDGP participants in the coming years . Evaluations could not be provided to participants until this initial and time consuming research had been completed. As a result of this research, made possible by the investment undertaken in 2014, I am happy to note that evaluations will shortly be issuing to scheme participants from the 2014 scheme and that participants under the BDGP will receive evaluations in a regular and timely fashion in the coming months and years.</p></reply>

The Programme forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme and allocates funding of some &euro;300 million over the next six years to suckler farmers in Ireland. The BDGP builds on the large strategic investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in recent years, and will ultimately bring about fundamental improvements to the entire sector by substantially improving the genetic quality of the national beef herd. </p><p>As the deputy is aware, the BDGP will compensate participants for the cost incurred and income foregone in undertaking a number of actions such as genotyping, data collection and the introduction of animals with a higher genetic merit. It is not correct to say that exported animals are excluded from the BDGP as all of the required actions, including data recording and genotyping, can be carried out in herds which export some of their progeny to markets outside of Ireland. </p><p>As is the case for all herds in the BDGP, these participants will be required to record key data on all male and female calves, regardless of whether they are planned for export or not, on an annual basis for important traits such as calf quality, calf docility and health and disease traits, as well as information on the sires and the dams of these calves. All of this data will be integrated into the National genomic evaluation system resulting in more accurate &euro;uro-Star evaluations to the benefit of the farmer himself, including those that are in the business of exporting calves, and the wider industry. As such, the data collected through the BDGP is central to ensuring that the value of these exported animals is accurately reflected in the indexes and that suckler herds producing animals for export are not excluded from the programme. </p><p>In addition, it should be noted that the ICBF also collects data regarding the weights and prices recorded for a large volume of these animals which are sold through livestock marts prior to export, which again provides additional data to go towards improving the accuracy of the indexes. In addition, ICBF are committed to working with exporters, buyers and processors in the third country markets which take live exports of cattle from Ireland in order to collect additional. This will help assist ICBF in accurately representing the value of these animals through the indexes developed. </p></reply>

Donegal. The Commonage Container details commonages that are declared for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes and also the individual claimants on each of the listed commonages. It was introduced by my Department in order to assist farmers and their planners, who intended or intend to apply for participation in GLAS and to submit a Commonage Management Plan under that Scheme. The details of the person named were not included on the Commonage Container for a technical reason. This matter has now been resolved and the relevant details will appear on the database shortly.   </p>  <p>  I can confirm that my Department has received Circuit Court Record No. E943/09, which states that the person named be allowed graze 80 sheep on commonage in question. My Department intends to fully comply with this Court Order and to process any payments due to the person named. However, in order to do so, the person named has been requested to seek clarification from the Circuit Court regarding what land area within the commonage this 80 sheep equates to and what date this right became effective from. This is essential information required by my Department as the Single Payment Scheme is an area-based scheme under which eligible applicants are paid an amount per eligible hectare declared. To date these clarifications have not been provided and as a result 2014 payment on this commonage cannot be issued to the person named. </p>  <p>  In December 2014, in order to pay some monies to the person named his application was processed on the land declared, excluding the commonage, which was not clear for payment. My Department, as a courtesy, offered to facilitate a meeting where the parties may be able to resolve the outstanding issues regarding their shares of this commonage thereby facilitating the processing of claims made under various schemes for which my Department has responsibility. This offer was refused by one party to the dispute. Therefore, it was suggested by my Department, in the correspondence issued, that it is open to parties directly involved to attempt to resolve the issues between themselves.</p></reply>

The High Support Units have managed vulnerable and mentally ill prisoners in a more effective and humanitarian environment, and this has resulted in greater access to care and regular reviews by the prison In-Reach team.</p>  <p>  A Psychiatric In-reach and Court Liaison Service is delivered by the HSE at Cloverhill Prison.  This diversion system ensures, insofar as possible, that people presenting before the courts, or indeed at an earlier stage of the criminal justice system, where the infraction is a reflection of an underlying mental illness, are referred and treated appropriately.  This approach has reduced the number of mentally ill people committed to prison.</p>  <p>  I have also been advised that the Irish Prison Service provides training to staff on mental health issues, including suicide awareness training by way of programmes such as STOP4, training on Seclusion Policy, and Critical Incident Stress Management.  It is currently implementing a service wide programme of mental health awareness training for prison staff.</p>  <p>  Prisoners have access to the Samaritans and the Listeners scheme.

The 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction provides for the return of children who have been removed from one contracting state to another - usually by a parent against the wishes of the other parent.  The European Council Regulation (2201/2003) reflects the Convention as regards EU countries and enhances the provisions of the 1980 Convention.  As the Deputy knows there are provisions under the Convention which are reflected in the EU Regulation and provides for the non return of a child.  Under Article 13 of the 1980 Hague Convention, the Court is not bound to order the return of a child to the other jurisdiction in some circumstances, e.g. where the Court decides there is a grave risk that the child's return would expose him or her to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place that child in an intolerable situation. </p><p>A decision in relation to whether a child is returned to their habitual residence is thus a matter for the relevant judicial authority in the jurisdiction in which the child is now living and an appeal process is available when the court issues its decision in such cases.  </p></reply>

It is a matter for such judicial authorities to consider whether or not to return a child to Ireland given the specific circumstances.  The Regulation reflects and enhances the provisions of Article 13 of the 1980 Convention which provides that a non return order may arise where a Court decides that there is a grave risk that the child's return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place that child in an intolerable situation.  When a decision is taken not to return a child, such decisions may be appealed and the Regulation sets out a procedure to be followed in that regard.</p>  <p>  The Central Authority for International Child Abduction which is part of my Department is, under the Regulation, the authority which deals with communications with equivalent central authorities in foreign jurisdictions, including communications in relation to non-return matters, and notifies the Irish High Court, in accordance with the Regulation, where a foreign court has declined to return a child to Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Minister has no role in the judicial systems in this or other countries party to the 1980 Convention and Brussels II Regulation.</p></reply>

These include an exemption from the upper age limit where a child would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year. </p>  <p>  On the specific issue raised by the Deputy, the Department of Health has informed my Department that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year, it does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities. In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities in some instances to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and subject to resources.  The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p>  <p>  Improving access to the pre-school year for children with special needs is a priority for my Department.</p>  <p>  The intersectoral work done under the chairmanship of the Office of the Minister for Disability and Mental Health and through the Cross Sectoral Team on children&rsquo;s disability issues agreed that the best approach to meeting the needs of children with a disability of pre-school age was through mainstream pre-school services, but no agreement was reached on what the model of provision would be, or, who would lead out on developing this.</p>  <p>  The Secretary General of my Department has recently agreed with his counterparts in the Departments of Health and Education and Skills that my Department will seek to gain agreement, in a relatively short time-frame, between the three sectors (children, education, health) on the most appropriate, workable model for supports to pre-school children with special needs.  This will be followed by very close co-operation between the sectors in defining/developing the model and in making an agreed cross-departmentally supported proposal for the resources required to implement it.  The team will use information from recent consultations with parents and providers to inform their work and will conduct further consultation as the tight time-frame allows.</p>  <p>  There will be several challenges to agreeing an appropriate and workable model &ndash; including reviewing existing resources in the system to determine how they can best meet children&rsquo;s&rsquo; needs, and accessing the additional investment needed.  My Department has committed to leading this process and it is my intention that a proposal will be available in time for the Estimates process.</p></reply>

The key objective of the Progressing Disabilities Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery across the country.  This involves the creation of a clear pathway to services for children with disabilities, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child's difficulties.</p>  <p>  The Programme is a key priority for the HSE's Social Care Directorate.  An additional &euro;4m was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  Further investment of &euro;4 million will also be made to support the development of therapy services in 2015 (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year).  A number of HSE Community Healthcare Organisations across the country are successfully implementing the Programme.  It requires significant preparatory work in engaging with families, schools, voluntary providers and local communities and the development of new procedures and protocols in respect of multi-disciplinary and multi-agency working.  Once this preparatory work has been completed additional posts are being provided to support the implementation of the new model of service.</p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in respect of the specific operational matters he has raised.

Therefore, I do not intend to introduce measures to require health insurers to recognise health insurance cover held outside of Ireland by providers not registered here.</p>  <p>  Community rating, reflecting the principle of intergenerational solidarity, is a fundamental cornerstone of the Irish health insurance system. This means that people who are old or sick do not have to pay more than the young and healthy, whereas in other health insurance systems the level of risk than an individual presents directly affects the premium paid. Thus, different health insurance systems are not directly comparable or related, so periods of cover or time served are not interchangeable between them.</p>  <p>  When an individual takes out health insurance for the first time in this country, whether already a resident or a person who previously lived abroad, they may have to serve waiting periods before they are fully covered, but accident and injury will be covered immediately.  The application of waiting periods, including those for pre-existing conditions, helps to support community rating and is an important tool for insurers to combat practices where someone could potentially take out a health insurance policy to avail of a particular treatment and then cancel the policy once treatment had been received, without either penalty or sustained contribution to the community-rated system. </p>  <p>  For this reason, I do not intend to introduce an exemption from waiting periods for pre-existing conditions, as to do so would only increase the likelihood of claims being made without any contribution to our community-rated system, which in turn would result in increased costs and ultimately higher premium prices for all.</p></reply>

The HSE inquiry involved two distinct phases. The first phase, which commenced in 2010, examined the standard of care provided to one person (with an intellectual disability) who resided with the Foster family. That report was completed in March 2012.</p>  <p>  A complex legal process followed the completion of the first phase of the investigation. Once this had been resolved, the second phase involved a full tracing and look-back exercise in relation to all clients (living and agreeable to the process) who had contact with the foster family concerned. </p>  <p>  Flowing from that process in 2013 it was decided that all placements with the foster family should be reviewed and that, as an initial step, it was necessary to undertake a review of available statutory records.  In December 2013, Resilience Ireland was appointed to undertake the work involved. </p>  <p>  The HSE have been precluded from publishing the report of the inquiry into these matters and the report of the review undertaken by Resilience Ireland, pending completion of a criminal investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Minister for Health and I remain concerned to ensure that these matters are brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible. However, we are obliged to ensure that the Garda investigation is not in any way prejudiced. </p>  <p>  Arising from questions raised and following careful consideration, it has been decided to appoint a Senior Counsel to outline and examine the procurement process in commissioning the two reviews and the approach taken in conducting the two exercises. Appointment of Counsel to conduct this matter is under consideration and appropriate terms of reference which take account of the ongoing Garda investigation are being developed in accordance with legal advice.</p>  <p>  With regard to the cost of the investigation, as the Deputy's question relates to service matters, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply. If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, she can contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with the HSE.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. It currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools.</p>  <p>  The Staffing arrangements for primary schools includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional classroom posts on developing grounds.</p>  <p>  Reforms introduced in the 2012/13 school year created a single simplified allocation process for both learning and language support. At primary level, learning/language support hours are allocated on the basis of mainstream classroom teaching posts in the school. Schools have autonomy to deploy this resource between learning support and language support depending on the specific needs of the school.</p>  <p>  The staffing arrangements also include an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. The Primary Staffing Appeals Board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final. The staffing arrangements for the 2015/2016 school year are set out in Circular 0005/2015 which is available on the Department website.</p>  <p>  My focus in Budget 2015 was on obtaining the additional funding that was necessary to provide for demographic growth. The last Budget included an increase in spending on education for the first time in recent years, amounting to additional funding of &euro;60m during 2015.</p>  <p>  This funding will be used to provide 1,700 additional teachers and SNAs for our schools, as well as to fund prioritised reforms, such as implementation of the literacy and numeracy strategy, reform of junior cycle, and the introduction of education focused pre-school inspections. The improvements in the Primary Staffing Schedule for small schools which I announced in February last are the only changes that I will be making to the staffing arrangements for schools for the 2015/16 school year.</p>  <p>  The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing economic growth. It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about further improvement in PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers.</p>  <p>  The challenge for all schools is to ensure that they utilise their allocated resources to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.</p></reply>

It is a condition therefore that the maximum length of time that a teacher may be on secondment is five years, following which they return to their teaching roles within their schools. In this way, their expertise and knowledge is not lost to the system. </p><p>These teacher secondment arrangements were disseminated extensively in 2012 and subsequently so the necessary planning could take place at all levels including education centres, support services, school boards of management and individual teacher. </p><p>The implementation of this policy is a matter for the services concerned and the relevant section of my Department.</p><p>Overall, secondment numbers available are limited and HR planning to meet business needs in terms of supporting national priorities is essential. The support services, including the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), have engaged in succession planning as a key strategy in ensuring continued support for teachers and school leaders in implementing national education policy priorities and CPD and which allows for continuity, quality planning and management. </p><p>Reading Recovery is a literacy programme offered to DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 schools only as part of Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, which was launched in May 2005. Schools in these areas were invited to have teachers trained in the programme.  In some areas, where training took place in local cluster groups, additional schools were facilitated in participating in the programme. </p><p>My Department has prioritised support for the programme and has spent over &euro;4m on it over the last 5 years. Current plans provide that support will continue for over 500 schools involved in the programme and I am satisfied that PDST has made appropriate provision in its ongoing programme of work. My Department is anxious that we continue to target schools with the greatest need with most supports particularly in a climate of constrained budgets.</p></reply>

Under stage one of the selection process for the new programme, any entity who wished to be considered as a Local Action Group was invited to submit an expression of interest.  This included LCDC &rsquo;s, community groups and any other interested entity.  For the purposes of the new programme, there are 28 sub-regional areas in Ireland and 45 separate expressions of interest were received.  A single expression of interest has been received in 17 of the 28 areas and at least 2 expressions of interest have been received in the remaining 9 areas.   </p>  <p>I expect that all the expressions of interest will be presented to an Independent Evaluation Committee for assessment and decision shortly. I am in the process of establishing this Committee.  On foot of this, preparatory support will be made available to all eligible Local Action Groups selected by the Committee.  The Groups will then be provided with a minimum of 6 months to develop their strategies but I do expect some strategies to be submitted much earlier than this.   </p>  <p>The Independent Evaluation Committee will also assess and make the final decisions with regard to the quality of the local development strategies.  In areas where a single strategy is submitted, the Committee in question will review and evaluate these strategies with a view to ensuring that the strategies meet the required standard. In areas where entities do not come to an agreement and multiple strategies are submitted, it will be a matter for the Evaluation Committee to a make a decision on which local development strategy best meets the needs of the community.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific query regarding stage two of the process, I envisage that this will commence in early July.  All entities successful in stage one will be provided with a comprehensive template to assist in the process of developing their local development strategy.  My Department are currently working with Pobal to finalise this template, which will include full details of the criteria and scoring framework.  The system will be open and transparent and all information will be available to all entities successful in stage one of the selection process and will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website once complete. </p>  <p>  Technical support for the local development strategy process will be provided by Pobal and it is envisaged that Pobal will conduct the substantive evaluation of submissions and prepare detailed assessment reports for the consideration of the Evaluation Committee. Pobal have a significant track record with regard to the management and implementation of local and community development programmes for a number of Government Departments. </p>  <p>  The Evaluation Committee will have the ultimate decision making role in the context of the awarding of contracts to support the delivery of the LEADER elements of the RDP 2014-2020 in any given sub-regional area.  I am confident that Pobal&rsquo;s support for the strategy selection process for LEADER 2014-2020 will provide the support necessary to the Evaluation Committee to allow them to facilitate the most effective robust strategies for all sub-regional areas.  As Pobal do not have any direct input into the decision making I am confident that their role is transparent and will not in any way undermine the integrity of the local development strategy selection process.</p></reply>

As well as creating a more rational and comprehensive structural arrangement, the new system will over time result in more effective and community-focused decision making and implementation.  Moreover, under the new arrangements, there is full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms. </p>  <p>  A further important rationale for the new system is a more appropriate assignment of local authority functions.  The performance of different functions by members at county and municipal district levels will result in greater effectiveness than the previous parallel town and county system, which involved a significant element of duplication.  The division of functions between county and district has been determined on the basis of what is most relevant to each level.  Local matters are to be dealt with at municipal district level, while those of wider strategic application are being decided at county level, without duplication between county and district jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  It is important to bear in mind in relation to the new sub-county governance arrangements that we are in the very early stages of reform.  Municipal districts only came into operation on 1 June 2014 and 2015 will be the first full year of their operation.  Against this background, I have initiated an evaluation process on the operation of the new structures through a broadly based advisory group which my Department has recently reconvened together with a working group for engagement with the Association of Irish Local Government, both of which played an important role in the early stages of the local government reform process.  The groups will give particular consideration to how the new governance arrangements are impacting on towns and whether any adjustments are needed in light of experience to date, including civic aspects, such as the status of mayors of borough and municipal districts and the economic and community development of towns. </p>  <p>  The thrust of Government policy remains to strengthen local government and foster the potential for improved subsidiarity, coherence and efficiency, resulting in greater value for money for the taxpayer and, ultimately, improved service delivery for citizens.  The review that I have initiated will provide a sound evidence base upon which to consider any further developments to local government and local democracy.</p></reply>

Housing authorities were recently informed of regional funding allocations.  Of this total, over &euro;2.5 million has been transferred to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in respect of domestic violence refuges which previously received funding from housing authorities; State funding for these services will now be entirely routed through Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>From the remaining funding I have made the following regional allocations under Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988. <table><tr><th>Dublin </th><th>&euro;37,160,470 </th></tr><tr><td>Mid-East  </td><td>&euro;934,267 </td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>&euro;794,972</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West</td><td>&euro;3,499,898 *</td></tr><tr><td>North-East</td><td>&euro;977,737 </td></tr><tr><td>North-West</td><td>&euro;387,643</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>&euro;2,394,619 * </td></tr><tr><td>South-West</td><td>&euro;5,000,686</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>&euro;1,698,834</td></tr></table></p><p>*Following the amalgamation of North and South Tipperary County Councils into Tipperary County council in 2014, the realignment of Tipperary County Council into the Mid-West Region is pending.</p><p>The Midlands Region, for which Westmeath County Council is the lead-authority, received an allocation of &euro;649,707 last year.

I asked the Chair if it would be possible to delay the sale, or to consider withdrawing the paintings from auction, to provide some time to explore all other possible options that would involve my Department and the Office of Public Works.

I will continue to see if any other possible options can be explored. This, however, will be very difficult given that the sale is to proceed next month.</p></reply>

This has included intense and on-going engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission. A long term compensation scheme was introduced to compensate cutters for their loss. This cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme is comprised of a payment of &euro;1,500 per annum, index-linked, for 15 years or relocation, where feasible, to a non-designated bog together with a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500.</p><p>The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan was published in January 2014. It sets out how the raised bog candidate special areas of conservation are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. </p><p>Notwithstanding the complexity involved, progress in relocating turf cutters to non-designated bogs is being achieved in a number of cases. Potential relocation sites have been identified for each of the raised bog candidate special areas of conservation where relocation may be required. When relocation sites have been assessed as suitable, my Department has been seeking expressions of interest from turf cutters with a view to them moving to these sites. </p><p>For a number of these candidate special area of conservation sites, the relocation site identified may not be suitable or may not have the capacity to cater for the number of turf cutters who may wish to relocate there. In such cases, and in the context of the finalisation of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, my Department, in consultation with turf cutting interests, is considering the available options in terms of relocation and the provisions of the Habitats Directive. Under article 6.3 of the Directive, consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog candidate special area of conservation where it can be shown that such cutting will not have an adverse effect on the site. Under article 6.4 of the Directive, consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog candidate special area of conservation for imperative reasons of overriding public interest. </p><p>Given the clear scientific evidence of the negative impact of turf extraction on raised bogs, it will only be possible to utilise the provisions of article 6.3 in a small number of cases. Similarly, the flexibility provided for under article 6.4, if required, will only be applicable to a small number of sites.</p><p>Final resolution of all issues in relation to the protection of Ireland's raised bog candidate special areas of conservation will only be brought about by everyone working together, within the law, with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established with the purpose of ensuring the input from all stakeholders.</p><p>The <i>Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network, </i>published in January 2014<i>, </i>provides detail on future arrangements regarding turf cutting on each of the 75 current raised bog natural heritage areas. The <i>Review </i>has concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network. This will entail the phasing out of turf-cutting on certain natural heritage areas by 1 January 2017 and the partial or complete de-designation of certain natural heritage areas.</p></reply>

The Action Plan sets out a number of actions in relation to the arts sectors. The nature of employment within the sector encompasses a wide range of activities and may also embody the industrial creative sectors, including audio-visual production.</p><p>For example, it is estimated that the audio-visual sector provides 6,000 full-time job equivalents. Last year, 53 feature films were made. Many of those employed in the industry are graduates. Some 65% of investment in the sector is inward investment. My Department is working with other Government Departments and agencies to examine ways in which further support can be provided to the industry.</p><p>Many people in the creative sectors will benefit from the additional funding which my Department is providing for the Decade of Commemorations, in particular the investment in the <i>Ireland 2016</i>programme. This comprises &euro;4m current and &euro;22m capital funding in 2015. </p><p>This includes a &euro;2 million allocation directed through the Arts Council for artistic projects and &euro;1m directed towards our key national cultural institutions.  There are also considerable employment benefits arising from the capital projects under way or being planned. For example, some 200 jobs have been created in the construction stage of the new interpretative centre in the GPO.  In addition, some 300 high-level jobs have been created in the construction work on the National Gallery of Ireland as part of a joint project funded by my Department, the OPW and the National Gallery.</p><p>I will continue to invest across the arts sector within the resources available to my Department.</p></reply>

This includes assistance with locations for the making of films. The Film Board has a good track record of using Irish scenery as a major asset in attracting film makers to Ireland. Detailed information on the supports available from the Film Board, including in relation to film locations, can be found on its website.</p>  <p>  The Government considers the audiovisual industry to be very important and, in addition to the excellent work of the Irish Film Board, continues to support the growth of the sector in other ways. In particular, section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 - the Film Tax Relief Scheme - has undergone a number of improvements, which took effect at the start of this year. The changes have been well received and were developed following consultations between my Department, the Irish Film Board, the Department of Finance and the industry.  The intention is to ensure that Ireland remains competitive in attracting film projects. The Film Tax Relief Scheme has been extended to the end of 2020 and I am confident that this will increase the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for film investment and allow the audiovisual production sector to maintain existing jobs and create new ones.</p></reply>

One of the core objectives of the programme is to encourage and facilitate participation by, and the inclusion of, the citizens of Ireland to the greatest extent possible in the programme of events to commemorate this significant centenary.</p><p>At the centre of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme are the <i>State Ceremonial</i>events, which represent the formal and solemn remembrance of the events of 1916 by the citizens of Ireland as the seminal event in our modern history, which led to our independence.  The importance of our national flag and the ideals behind the Proclamation will also play a central role in the programme of events.</p><p>The 2016 Project Office in my Department has been engaged in an extensive consultation process across the Government, State agency and community sectors to progress the development of detailed plans for 2016.  A widespread public consultation process has been underway for a number of months in order to encourage and facilitate the involvement of national and local, ground-up initiatives in the wider commemorative programme.</p><p>The <i>Community Participation</i>strand of the programme is being led by local authorities across the country and I have been working closely with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Alan Kelly, T.D., in this regard.  Each local authority has appointed a steering committee and a dedicated &lsquo;Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme&rsquo; co-ordinator, to support engagement and facilitation within local communities to generate awareness of the national programme; and to develop and deliver a plan for a suitable programme of events and initiatives to take place at a county level in line with the national plans for Ireland 2016.  A series of public meetings in each county is nearing completion, at which members of the public came together to hear about Ireland 2016, meet those involved in their community, and to explore and learn about how they can get involved.  I have allocated funding of &euro;1 million to local authorities in 2015 to support this overall process.  </p><p>My Department's 2016 Project Office is engaging with the National Cultural Institutions, the Arts Council and the Heritage Council to ensure that a comprehensive and diverse cultural programme is developed.  Meetings and a dedicated workshop have also been held with a wide range of Irish language groups in order to develop an Irish language programme.

Additional funding was announced in Budget 2015 for a number of key targeted initiatives in my Department.  These include:</p><p>-  &euro;2m in additional funding for the Arts Council;</p><p>-  &euro;2m in additional funding for the National Cultural Institutions;</p><p>-  &euro;1m in extra funding for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta;</p><p>-  &euro;1m in additional funding for peatlands restoration; and</p><p>-  a new &euro;4m current allocation for the Decade of Centenaries Programme in 2016.</p><p>In order to ensure that the best use is made of limited financial resources and to provide a basis for a sustainable approach to the public finances, the Government has periodically embarked on detailed Comprehensive Reviews of both current and capital expenditure. The objectives of these reviews has been to re-set Ministerial expenditure ceilings in line with emerging Government priorities and to provide the basis for the Government's multi-annual budgetary framework.</p><p>My Department's allocations since it was established reflect the outcome of the Comprehensive Reviews of Current Expenditure (CRE) carried out in 2011 and again in 2014 and the Review of Capital Expenditure carried out in 2011.  A further review of capital expenditure is due to be completed shortly.  While the funding adjustments in the period up to 2014 have posed challenges, my Department has continued to support arts and culture, maintain our built and natural heritage, develop our language and Gaeltacht areas, and support island communities and the North South Implementation Bodies under its aegis to the greatest possible extent.  In doing so, it has sought to support employment, achieve compliance with EU Directives and support the ongoing implementation of the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements.</p></reply>
