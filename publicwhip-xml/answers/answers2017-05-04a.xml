    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-04a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050400058#WRA00600"><p>At the outset I would like to clarify for the Deputy that the general TAMS requirement is that the applicant must be farming at least 5 hectares, that is, they must have  at least 5 hectares on their BPS application.  This can be grass land or tillage, not a minimum of 5 hectares of tillage as suggested by the Deputy.  When the TAMS tillage measure was introduced, it required a minimum of 15 hectares of tillage because the measure is aimed specifically at tillage farmers.</p><p>During 2015, a suite of six measures were announced under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme known as TAMS II.  These measures were launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 and are co-funded under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).</p><p>The measures announced were the:</p><p>1.Young Farmers Capital Investment Scheme</p><p>2.Dairy Equipment Scheme</p><p>3.Organic Capital Investment Scheme</p><p>4.Animal Welfare, Safety and Nutrient Storage Scheme</p><p>5.Low Emission Slurry Spreading, and the</p><p>6.Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme.</p><p>A seventh measure, the Tillage Capital Investment Scheme was launched on 8 March 2017. </p><p>Among the stated objectives of this measure are  - to facilitate the Tillage Sector to develop a targeted and precise approach focusing on environmental dividends, efficiency and growth and to improves competitiveness in the sector.</p><p>The Tillage Capital Investment Scheme requires that applicants must have a minimum area of 15 hectares of eligible crops declared under the Basic Payment Scheme or equivalent in the year of application or previous year.  The eligible crops are defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme. </p><p>In order to ensure the best allocation of resources the new Tillage Scheme is specifically targeted at farmers who have tillage as their main enterprise.  The specific areas of capital investment available for Tillage farmers include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers. </p><p>The  investments available under the remaining TAMS II suite of measures cater for those farmers who do not meet the 15 hectare eligibility criteria but have other enterprises such as dairy, beef or sheep  on their farms as well as tillage.</p><p>The remaining TAMS II Schemes are the Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme, The Pigs and Poultry Investment Scheme,  Organic Capital Investment Scheme, Animal Welfare, Safety and Nutrient Storage Scheme, Dairy Equipment Scheme and Low Emission Slurry Spreading Scheme.</p><p>Under the 2016 basic payments scheme, 12,891 applicants had less than 15 hectares of tillage.  It is important to note that the definition of tillage includes wild bird cover, so many of these herds only have wild bird cover and no other tillage crops.  The financial allocation for TAMS II in respect of the full RDP period will be in the region of &euro;395m.  The 2017 allocation for TAMS II is &euro;50m.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-04a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050400058#WRA00900"><p>Funding of almost &euro;1 million has been allocated to agro-forestry under the six year Forestry Programme 2014 &ndash; 2020.  So far approval has issued for some 26 hectares and 0.6 hectares has been planted.</p>  <p>  The scheme itself promotes mainly silvopastoral agro-forestry.  Acceptable broadleaf species include oak, sycamore and cherry.  Other species, including conifers, are considered on a site-by-site basis.  Fruit and nut producing trees can comprise up to 15% of the total trees planted on a site to site basis.  The cumulative agro-forestry target for 2015, 2016 and 2017 is 55 hectares.  </p>  <p>  The reason behind the very modest planting figures achieved to date is that there is no tradition or culture of agro-forestry across Ireland amongst the farming community.  Nevertheless my Department considers agro-forestry to have significant potential and is a very important part of the planting mix within the afforestation scheme.  Agro-forestry can lessen the impacts of climate change and erosion; this is achieved by slowing down surface run-off and increasing the rate of soakage into the soil.  This also has the additional benefit of allowing waterlogged land to drain more quickly.  Trees planted close to sensitive waterways can help filter surface run-off and reduce the amount of sediment that enters these streams and rivers, protecting vulnerable aquatic species.  There are also bio-diversity benefits through the creation of new habitats and also in animal welfare where the trees provide shelter.    </p>  <p>  Furthermore, by allowing agriculture and forestry to take place on the same land at the same time farmers can become more familiar with forestry as a land use.  This may lead these farmers to consider taking the next step of deciding to plant trees as part of a more conventional forest type.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the afforestation scheme as it is currently written, agro-forestry systems other than silvopastoral may be considered if the development complies with the definition of forest cover.  In an effort to develop this further the midterm review of the Forestry Programme has called for submissions to consider which alternative agro-forestry systems can be included in an updated afforestation scheme.  Support for the establishment of demonstration plots for research purposes may also be considered under the afforestation scheme in the context of my Department&rsquo;s research programme.  The challenge for Ireland is to find other agro-forestry systems that are suited to our climatic, environmental, forestry and agricultural requirements.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-04a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050400058#WRA01100"><p>I hosted a Tillage Stakeholders Forum on the 16 February, following on from the first one in October 2016, which on both occasions consisted of representatives from all sides of this Sector. Addressing the most recent Forum, I took the opportunity to highlight that one of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers. </p><p>Therefore I was pleased to facilitate the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo;, which was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and makes &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%.  Distributed through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, it provides tillage farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.  The loans are for amounts up to &euro;150,000 for up to six years and are flexible with interest only facilities of up to three years.  Although no official returns have been made to my Department as yet, preliminary information from the SBCI shows that some 8% of the loans to date have been drawn down by the tillage sector.  The banks have confirmed that they have applications up to the amounts available under the Scheme. </p><p>There may be some residual availability but this will only emerge as applications are processed and loans drawn down.  I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.  I am currently meeting with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other issues relating to access to finance in the agri-food sector.  I am asking the banks to respond positively to this demand by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.</p><p>Also the Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II opened for online applications on the 8 March 2017.  The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.  This Tillage Scheme is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  The Scheme is co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). </p><p>All applications must be made on-line, either by the farmer or by an adviser authorised to act on his or her behalf.  The closing date for applications under the first tranche of the new scheme will be Friday 30 June 2017.</p><p>As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, up to <b>&euro;1.184 billion</b>has been paid out under the Basis Payment Scheme to 123,961 farmers and payments are ongoing.  Payments of <b>&euro;201.554 million </b>have also been made to 94,184 applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme.  </p><p>I can also confirm to the Deputy that a wide ranging discussion took place among all the stakeholders who attended the recent session of the Tillage Forum, including on the issue of crop losses as a result of the poor harvest conditions of last autumn.  My officials have since then had some additional meetings with stakeholders and I will consider further the outcome of those deliberations.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-04a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050400058#WRA01300"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, dairy markets experienced significant difficulties for a period spanning almost two years, due to a combination of increased global supply, the effects of the Russian ban on the import of EU agri-food products and reduced global demand, notably for dairy products in China.</p>  <p>  The Commission, both prompted and supported by Ireland, among other Member States, responded to these difficulties through the deployment of support measures, including intervention provided for under the CAP. </p>  <p>  Ireland has welcomed some of the measures adopted by the Commission over the last 18 months.  These include the buying of skimmed milk powder (SMP) into intervention, where Ireland's industry  has placed some 36,000 tonnes of product since September 2015.  Since then, the volume thresholds for fixed-price intervention for SMP were raised on a number of occasions.  Currently there are over 350,000 tonnes of SMP in intervention across the EU. </p>  <p>  The increased volume thresholds for SMP of 350,000 tonnes and a commitment to avoid market disruption when releasing product have had a stabilising effect on the market in late 2016 and early 2017. </p>  <p>  More recently the process of tendering for release of product back onto the market has commenced, with a single tendering round in December 2016 and 7 tendering rounds through 2017 thus far.  On each occasion the Commission have adopted a cautious approach, with only 40 tonnes released in December.  The tendering events since December have seen all offers rejected on the basis of what were deemed insufficient offers below the market price for the stock, with this approach supported unanimously by Member States, including Ireland. </p>  <p>  It is critically important that the release of these stocks is managed in a way that does not de-stabilise the market and to date I am satisfied that the Commission has managed these stocks in a prudent and sensible manner.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-04a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050400058#WRA01500"><p>The impact of Brexit on the agri-food sector is potentially very severe in the long-term, but also very significant in the short-term as the sector deals with the real and very immediate difficulties created by the significant fall in the value of Sterling against the Euro. </p><p>I have attempted to address these short-term challenges primarily through the measures announced in Budget 2017, including the &euro;150 million low-interest loan fund, agri-taxation measures, increased funding for Bord Bia, and further funding under the Rural Development Programme and the Seafood Development Programme.</p><p>The more medium- to long-term impacts of Brexit include the potential disruption that will arise from:</p><p>-  potential new trading arrangements and possible tariffs,</p><p>-  potential changes to regulations and standards, </p><p>-  potential border controls and certification, and </p><p>-  the related areas of veterinary and health certification.</p><p>Our goal in this regard must be to maintain a trading relationship that is as close as possible to the current arrangements, with the minimum possible customs and administrative procedures and ongoing equivalence of standards.  This must be accompanied by constraints on the UK&rsquo;s ability to enter into trading arrangements with third countries that would have the effect of undermining the competitiveness of Irish and EU exports to the UK.</p><p>My Department undertook an initial limited study some months ago on the potential effect that a &lsquo;fully tariffed&rsquo; trade between Ireland and the UK would have on certain agri food products.  The initial results show that the estimated tariff rate equivalent (in the absence of an FTA) would be over 60% for beef and over 50% for dairy.</p><p>A more in depth examination of the effect is currently being undertaken within my Department, and it is anticipated that this exercise will still identify beef, dairy products and prepared consumer foods as being the products most likely to incur high tariff rates and duties.</p><p>Other agri products, which rely almost exclusively on the UK market, may also be severely impacted by currency volatility.</p><p>Irrespective of how the ultimate trading relationship between the EU and the UK is finally negotiated, I am of the view that it is prudent that Ireland reduces its dependence on the UK as a market for its agri-food exports, of which almost 40% went to the UK in 2016.</p><p>This requires a focused effort on identifying and developing new, economically viable markets.  While our record to date has been very impressive, we have to raise the bar even further.  For that reason I have recently outlined a seven-point plan aimed at increasing international market access for Irish food and drink exports.  The plan will be implemented by my Department, with significant input from Bord Bia and Irish Embassies around the world, to help increase the footprint of our food and drink exports.  Its components are as follows:</p><p>-  The Establishment of a High-Level Market Access Committee; </p><p>-  The allocation of additional market access resources in the Department; </p><p>-  The commissioning of Bord Bia to undertake market profiling exercise for potential third-country and EU markets for Irish exports;</p><p>-  An intensified programme of  trade missions to promote Irish food and drink on EU and third country markets;</p><p>-  An immediate review of existing export markets where conditions of certification present barriers to trade or additional costs for exporters; </p><p>-  Increased engagement with the European Commission on measures to encourage a common approach to resolving issues relating to market access for EU products internationally; and </p><p>-  The development by the Department of a new dedicated portal website which will bring together in the one location the full range of open markets and products, and the relevant conditions certification in a user-friendly manner for exporters.</p><p>I am certain that these initiatives will be of direct assistance to Irish food and drink exporters this year. They are entirely consistent with the Food Wise 2025 strategy for the development of the Irish agri food sector, and are all the more relevant against the background of the decision of the UK to exit the European Union.  We will, of course, keep these arrangements under review, in consultation with industry, to ensure that resources are deployed to best effect and that our efforts are focused on making real progress for business operators in priority markets. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-04a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050400058#WRA01700"><p>Both GLAS and AEOS provide valuable support to farmers to deliver environmental benefits and public goods which will enhance Ireland's sustainability credentials into the future.  They provide support to Irish farmers aimed at enhancing biodiversity, water quality and the mitigation of the future impacts of climate change while allowing Irish farmers to improve their agricultural practices.</p>  <p>  The GLAS scheme is the latest agri-environment scheme available to farmers.  It forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan 2014-2020.  To date in excess of 50,000 farmers have had applications approved into the Scheme under three different tranches over a fourteen month period.  The approval of these farmers into the Scheme has been achieved a year ahead of the original target set when the Scheme was launched.  I am satisfied that the full allocation to agri-environment schemes provided for in Ireland's RDP 2014-2020 will be used.  The annual expenditure in respect GLAS 1, 2 and 3 applications will only be known when GLAS 3 payments for 2017 have been processed. </p>  <p>  The first full year of payments to participants in the first two tranches of the scheme is 2016.  To date over 91% of these participants have received their 2016 GLAS advance payment which represents 85% of the total 2016 payment due.  There are some 3,000 applicants who have not yet received this payment as their applications have not passed all of the regulatory cross-checks of department databases and validation checks required to support these EU co-funded payments.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, this is a complex scheme with over thirty different actions available which allows farmers a choice of environmental actions to suit their farms.  However, with this flexibility of choice for farmers comes increased complexity in administrating the scheme.  My Department has committed significant resources in developing systems including IT systems to support this level of complexity, with the system required to support multiple changes in land parcel details and multiple combinations of actions across holdings.</p>  <p>  Outstanding 2016 cases under GLAS 1 and 2 are delayed due to a variety of issues including - the declaration of incompatible parcel usage on the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) application for a selected GLAS action; changes in parcel boundaries in respect of parcels selected for GLAS actions; an applicant no longer claiming a parcel on their 2016 BPS; incomplete documentation such as an incorrect or incomplete Low-Emission Slurry Declaration Form or interim commonage management plan.</p>  <p>  All cases which have passed all of the required checks have been paid and cases continue to be paid as they are cleared.  In addition I want reassure the Deputy that my Department is continuing to review outstanding applications on a case by case basis including contacting farmers directly by telephone, email or letter with a few to resolving all issues with outstanding cases as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  In respect of the AEOS scheme there were 8,640 valid AEOS applications due a payment for the 2016 Scheme year.  Of these, 7,436 have been paid, leaving 1,204 outstanding.  Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System must take place.  As 2016 is the final scheme-year of payment for the AEOS 2 Scheme, re-checks on payments made for all scheme years must be completed before final payment can be processed.  This work is on-going and payments for valid checked files are and will continue to be released on a weekly basis.</p>  <p>  I should point out that a number of payments under both schemes continue to be held up due to incomplete documentation and all participants are reminded to respond to any correspondence and submit any outstanding documentation as soon as possible to facilitate payment.</p>  <p>  Payments under both Schemes will continue on an ongoing basis as issues are resolved and cases are cleared for payment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-04a.30.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050400058#WRA02100"><p>There is no doubt that many geopolitical events are having an impact on the outlook for Irish, European and world agriculture, with, of course, knock-on implications for family farm viability.  Examples include Brexit, the Russian ban on food imports from the European Union, and the future of international trade agreements, particularly in light of recent political developments in the United States of America and elsewhere.</p>  <p>  Farming in Ireland is an essential part of the social, cultural and economic fabric.  It is also part of a wider EU dispensation that values a Common Agriculture Policy built on family farming, food security, high standards of food safety and environmental sustainability.  These are values that we hold dear, and so it is critically important, when we consider the impact of Brexit and other geopolitical events, that the positive contribution of farming to the rural and national economy, and to society in Ireland, and indeed elsewhere in the European Union, is to the forefront in our deliberations. </p>  <p>  The ongoing viability of family farms is critical.  Teagasc's National Farm Survey highlights that two-thirds of Irish family farms are economically viable or sustainable, albeit in many cases supported by an off-farm income.  The remaining one third are considered vulnerable.  It is therefore essential that on-farm practices and production methods are made as efficient and sustainable as possible, and that the trading opportunities for the agri-food sector are maximised if we are to maintain and improve farm incomes. </p>  <p>  In terms of the key challenges, close to home, very few policy, business or financial decisions will be made over the coming months and years that will not be affected by Brexit in some way, either directly or indirectly. </p>  <p>  However, this is especially true for those involved in the agri-food sector, in respect of which all of the analysis that has been carried out to date points to a negative outcome.  Indeed, I think it is fair to say that Brexit presents probably the greatest challenge that the agri-food sector has faced since the foundation of the State.  That is why I have put in place a number of measures under Budget 2017 to deal with the short-term impact of the fall in the value of sterling against the euro, including the &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme, agri-taxation measures, additional funding for Bord Bia, and further funding under the Rural Development Programme and the Seafood Development Programme.  I and my Department have also been deepening our analysis of the longer-term implications of Brexit, consulting closely with stakeholders and engaging with our Member State counterparts and the European institutions.  We will continue to work to ensure the best possible outcome for the agri-food sector from the Brexit negotiations.</p>  <p>  More generally, trade for Ireland is very important given that it is a small open economy.  The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is, therefore, an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agri-food sector, as evidenced by its placement right at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development over the coming decade. </p>  <p>  I am of the view that it is prudent, if not imperative in the light of Brexit, that Ireland reduces its dependence on the UK as a market for its agri-food exports, of which almost 40% went to the UK in 2016.  This requires a focused effort on identifying and developing new, economically viable markets.  While our record to date has been very impressive, we have to raise the bar even further.  For that reason I have recently outlined a seven-point plan aimed at increasing international market access for Irish food and drink exports.  The plan will be implemented by my Department, with significant input from Bord Bia and Irish Embassies around the world, to help increase the footprint of our food and drink exports.</p>  <p>  In relation to Free Trade Agreements, Ireland is generally supportive in the implementation of such Free Trade Agreements between the EU and other trading blocs as long as they reflect the interests of Ireland and other Member States.  While negotiations with the US, Canada and Japan contain many potential benefits to the Irish Agri-food sector, other agreements such as Mercosur do not offer the same potential, and indeed represent significant threats to the Irish and European agriculture sectors.  I and my Department will continue to adopt a pragmatic, balanced approach to such agreements, consistent with overall Government policy.</p>  <p>  Against the background of Brexit, we need to double our efforts in securing access for Irish products and increasing penetration in international markets.  We are, however, fortunate in that we have an excellent industry-led strategy for the growth of the sector in Food Wise 2025 which provides a clear road-map for its development.</p></reply>

Through his chairing of Brexit Cabinet Committee meetings, he is acutely aware of the potentially very negative impact that Brexit would have on the agri-food sector in Ireland and the highly integrated nature of the sector both north and south of the border.  He is aware of the fact that a number of analyses were conducted on the potential impact of a UK exit from the EU on Ireland, including by ESRI, IBEC, Teagasc, Alan Matthews and the Department, and that all of these analyses show that the result would be unambiguously bad for the Irish agri-food sector.  This comes as no surprise, given that the sector in 2016 exported some 40% of its total exports, valued at &euro;4.8 billion, to the UK, while it imported 46% of total agri-sector imports, valued at &euro;3.7 bn, from the UK.</p>  <p>  Within these statistics there are significant levels of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  CSO figures for 2016 show that we exported &euro;700 million worth of agri-food products to Northern Ireland, while we imported &euro;500 million worth of products during the same period.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is also aware of our key &lsquo;asks&rsquo; from the EU/UK negotiations, in the agri-food sector, namely:</p>  <p>  -  Continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures.</p>  <p>  -  Minimisation of the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries.</p>  <p>  -  Maintenance of current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal and protect Ireland&rsquo;s quota share for joint fish stocks. </p>  <p>  In his address after the meeting with Prime Minister May, the Taoiseach said that although the Irish and UK paths may be diverging within the context of the EU, their common interests remain and he was committed to working together on them.</p>  <p>  He also said that they discussed the necessity of ensuring the continued free flow of trade on the island of Ireland and the need to avoid a hard border, and that any manifestation of a hard border would have very negative consequences. </p>  <p>  He said that both governments were agreed that a close, and friction-free, economic and trading relationship between the UK and the EU, including Ireland, was in our best interests.</p>  <p>  He went on to say that as the UK prepares for its formal notification under Article 50, Ireland wants to see those hard-won, deep trading ties between our two countries recognised and facilitated. </p>  <p>  That will continue to be an absolute priority for this Government, not just in our discussions with the British Government but also with our EU partners as we prepare for the negotiation process on the EU side of the table.</p>  <p>  It is for that reason that I have met with ten different EU Agriculture Ministers in recent weeks to raise awareness at European level of the particular implications of Brexit for the agri-food and fisheries sectors, and to ensure that they fully understand the impact Brexit is having on the sector and the importance, not just for Ireland but for all Member States, of ensuring that it is treated as a priority in the negotiations.  </p>  <p>  Personally I am fully committed to ensuring the best possible outcome for the sector.  I have been heavily involved in consultations through my Department&rsquo;s Stakeholder Consultative Committee and the All-Island Civic Dialogue process, as well as the extensive series of bilaterals with EU counterparts.</p>  <p>  We are still at an early stage in the Brexit process.  What is most important is that we are clear in our goals, and that we work coherently and effectively to that end.  This has informed our approach to the challenges facing the agri-food sector, and will continue to do so as the negotiation process unfolds.</p></reply>

These are the afforestation scheme and the neighbourwood scheme. Under the afforestation scheme Local Authorities can apply for establishment grants which cover 100% of the cost of planting bare land. Under State aid rules however, Local Authorities are not eligible for annual premiums. </p>  <p>  On the other hand the neighbourwood scheme has been designed specifically with Local Authorities and communities in mind. Applications can be submitted by Local Authorities on behalf of community groups or by community groups themselves working in conjunction with Local Authorities. The scheme supports the development of attractive close-to-home woodland amenities (or &lsquo;neighbourwoods&rsquo;) for public use and enjoyment and includes a planting component where new forests can be established on green field sites.</p>  <p>  Neighbourwoods can be used by people of all ages and abilities on a regular &ndash; often daily &ndash; basis, for strolling, family visits and picnics, walking-the-dog, &lsquo;power-walking&rsquo;, jogging, and a host of other outdoor activities. Also, local schools often use them as an &lsquo;outdoor classroom&rsquo; for young people to learn about nature and the environment. Typical facilities include entrances, car parking, a variety of looped footpaths, information signage and waymarkers, nature trails, and seats and picnic tables. A neighbourwood can be a stand-alone amenity, or can be linked into other amenities and attractions in the area, such as parkland, historical buildings, visitor attractions and wider walking or cycle routes.</p>  <p>  So far under the Forestry Programme 14 applications have been received for funding under this scheme, three have been from County Councils and one from a city council. My Department would like to encourage more Local Authorities to take part in this scheme and in line with my Department&rsquo;s &ldquo;Promotion Plan for Forestry&rdquo; all local authorities will be contacted in order to raise awareness of the Neighbourwood scheme.  Furthermore, the Midterm review of the forestry programme 2014-2020 will look at all aspects of the 11 measures included in that programme, including neighbourwoods. I will ensure that the discussions that are due to take place in relation to this work will include the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal for a community led afforestation project, coordinated by local authorities.</p></reply>

Addressing the most recent Forum, I took the opportunity to highlight that one of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers. </p>  <p>  Therefore I was pleased to facilitate the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo;, which was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and makes &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%. Distributed through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, it provides tillage farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises. The loans are for amounts up to &euro;150,000 for up to six years and are flexible with interest only facilities of up to three years.  Although no official returns have been made to my Department as yet, preliminary information from the SBCI shows that some 8% of the loans to date have been drawn down by the tillage sector. The banks have confirmed that they have applications up to the amounts available under the Scheme. </p>  <p>  There may be some residual availability but this will only emerge as applications are processed and loans drawn down. I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance. I am currently meeting with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other issues relating to access to finance in the agri-food sector. I am asking the banks to respond positively to this demand by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.</p>  <p>  Also the Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II opened for online applications on the 8 March 2017. The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers. This Tillage Scheme is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020. The Scheme is co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). </p>  <p>  All applications must be made on-line, either by the farmer or by an adviser authorised to act on his or her behalf.  The closing date for applications under the first tranche of the new scheme will be Friday 30 June 2017.  </p>  <p>As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, up to &euro;1.184billion has been paid out under the Basis Payment Scheme to 123,961 farmers and payments are ongoing. Payments of &euro;201.554million   have also been made to 94,184 applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I can also confirm to the Deputy that a wide ranging discussion took place among all the stakeholders who attended the recent session of the Tillage Forum, including on the issue of crop losses as a result of the poor harvest conditions of last autumn. My officials have since then had some additional meetings with stakeholders and I will consider further the outcome of those deliberations.</p></reply>

To date over 5,500 of meetings have been held on important topics such as grassland management, farm progression, veterinary health and, farm health and safety.</p>  <p>  The Farm Improvement Plan includes animal health measures addressing key issues such as calf health and mortality, biosecurity and fertility which farmers must complete with an approved vet. My Department has developed a dedicated online system for this purpose using herd data from other Department systems supplemented by data from ICBF. This provides the vet with information which, in addition to on-farm appraisal and discussion with the farmer, builds a profile of animal health on the farming enterprise. In turn, this forms the basis for individual advice to the farmer on veterinary health matters. </p>  <p>   Development of the dedicated Animal Health Measures system, on which the vet records data and recommendations, is in the final stages with a view to going live shortly. In the interim approved vets have been registering the link with their client farmers on the online system in preparation for recording actions under the Animal Health Measures. My Department has also notified approved vets of the requirements in terms of both data and recommendations, which has enabled them to gather information in preparation for recording such information.</p>  <p>  All other components of the Farm Improvement Plan such as breeding plans, eProfit monitor and farm health and safety are completed with the farmer by the approved Knowledge Transfer Facilitator on a one to one basis. My Department has developed a customised online system for recording key data related to these actions as well as recommendations which can enhance profitability and sustainability on the farming enterprise. This system is currently in the concluding stage of development with a view to opening it to facilitators shortly. In preparation, facilitators are currently completing actions, including the one to one discussion with the farmer, for the Farm Improvement Plan.  In view of this, my Department currently has no plans to extend the 31 May deadline.</p></reply>

These are the afforestation scheme and the neighbourwood scheme. Within the first of these, Local Authorities can apply for establishment grants which cover 100% of the cost of planting bare land. However under State aid rules, Local Authorities are not eligible for annual premiums. </p>  <p>  The neighbourwood scheme on the other hand was designed for Local Authorities working in partnership with local communities. Applications can be submitted by Local Authorities on behalf of community groups or by community groups themselves working in conjunction with Local Authorities. The scheme includes a planting component where funding is provided for establishing woodlands on &ldquo;Greenfield sites&rdquo;. The scheme aims to provide a &ldquo;close to home&rdquo; woodland amenity for the local community to enjoy. The scheme itself is a central pillar of the Department&rsquo;s strategy to deliver recreation and social benefits of forestry to local communities. Forests have a positive impact on human well-being particularly in relation to our mental health.  Neighbourwoods are a great way to provide an amenity which is accessible for locals and also for schools where children can be close to and learn about their natural environment. </p>  <p>  While the scheme is proving attractive to both Local Authorities and community groups my Department would like to see more applications being received. To this end the midterm review will focus on the following issues in relation to improving the neighbourwood scheme;</p>  <p>  -  How can the Neighbourwood scheme be improved upon to make it easier for interested parties to submit applications? </p>  <p>  -  Can the scheme be improved to increase the level of native woodland afforestation?</p>  <p>  -  How can local communities be mobilised to develop forests in their area?</p>  <p>  Furthermore I will ensure that the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal for a community led afforestation project coordinated by Local Authorities forms part of the discussions that will take place as part of this work.</p></reply>

I am advised that, once the planning application is lodged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, formal statutory consultation will commence.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the actual forest and woodland involved, Coillte advise that the valuable biodiversity and mixed woodland habitat that comprises Massey&rsquo;s wood is being retained in its entirety.  Coillte add that the project will see the removal of laurel and invasive species from along the stream and river edges, opening up the vistas along the watercourses enjoyed many years ago.  I am advised, in relation to the Hellfire property, it is proposed to change more than twenty hectares of conifer forest to native mixed broadleaves over a ten to twenty year period and therefore to grow the biodiversity of this area also.  I understand that there will also be an interesting interpretation of the rich natural and built heritage to be seen and explored in the area.  I am advised that there will be a trail around the top of Montpelier Hill which will give a 360-degree panorama over Dublin City and Bay and south to the Wicklow Mountains, all brought to life with information panels as the breath-taking views change along the route.   </p>  <p>  I understand that, as mentioned, the project team have carried out extensive informal consultation and that, having listened carefully to local concerns raised, have scaled back the proposal considerably with the building itself now less than 50% of the scale originally proposed and comprising only those facilities needed to give information and provide refreshments and toilet facilities for groups and individuals visiting the Mountains.   </p>  <p>  Coillte advise that there is currently no orientation facility for visitors to the Dublin Mountains and that this development will make the trails, heritage and landscapes of the Mountains far more accessible to those who are visiting for the first time, both from Ireland and overseas.  I understand that many people enjoy forest recreation and that it enhances both physical and mental wellbeing.  Coillte further advise that this development will bring the Dublin mountains to life for many of the city&rsquo;s residents and visitors from overseas.   </p>  <p>  As I note that the planning application is to be lodged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I await the outcome of that process.</p></reply>

A national awareness campaign on domestic and sexual violence is a key action under the prevention pillar of the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021.  The Strategy is being monitored by a range of key state and non-governmental organisations working in the domestic and sexual violence sectors. In addition, an advisory group on the national awareness campaign includes state and non-governmental organisations working in the domestic and sexual violence sectors and campaign experts.</p><p>It is intended that the <i>&quot;What would you do?&quot;</i>campaign, which was launched in November 2016, will run for a period of 6 years up to 2021.  The campaign recognises that women and men are victims of domestic and sexual violence.  The first 3 years will focus on domestic violence to be followed by 3 years dealing with sexual violence but elements of each will be interwoven into each phase of the campaign.</p><p>The overall aim of the campaign is to increase the awareness of society of domestic and sexual violence, to bring about<b></b>a change in long established societal behaviours and attitudes and to activate bystanders with the aim of decreasing and preventing this violence.  As a society we must speak out about domestic violence and leave perpetrators in no doubt that this violence will not be tolerated in our country.  I believe that these are achievable goals.</p><p>&quot;<i>What would you do?</i>&quot; is designed to be a high impact media campaign to reach a national audience that features TV, cinema, radio, outdoor, social and digital advertising.  The campaign aims to reduce the very real suffering of those affected through the actions and assistance of bystanders who have been moved to take action by this powerful campaign and the call to action directs people to search the comprehensive campaign website whatwouldyoudo.ie for information and advice on domestic violence for bystanders, victims and perpetrators.  </p><p>In order to run the campaign, I secured funding of &euro;950,000 for 2016 and also for 2017.

Currently programmes run in 14 locations with more programmes due to come on stream later this year.</p><p>The key aims of the programmes include the following:</p><p>- to reduce violent and controlling behaviour by perpetrators who undertake the programme resulting in improved safety and quality of life for their partners and their children.</p><p>- the development of a partnership approach between women's support service providers and those delivering perpetrator programmes.</p><p>- the operation, as appropriate, of a rehabilitation focused community alternative to prison.</p><p>Building on the work carried out in this area under the first National Strategy, the current National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021 includes actions to:</p><p>- put in place a uniform risk assessment system across programmes</p><p>- develop a national intervention programme.</p><p>- develop a group-work programme for partners and ex-partners of perpetrators on the programme.</p><p>Work is in train or has been completed in relation to many of these actions.  For example, the risk assessment tool is now in place with programme staff trained in it.  In conjunction with work on risk assessment, the implementation of an intervention model known as the Choices Programme, is being advanced with training in this model currently underway with the providers of the perpetrator programmes.  The intention is that this intervention model will be rolled out as the uniform national programme to be delivered by all domestic violence perpetrator programmes during 2017/2018.  Work on the delivery of a group programme for partners and ex-partners to augment all of this work will also be further progressed over the next 18 months.</p><p>Looking further ahead, it is anticipated that demand for placement on programmes will increase due to the proposed changes in the Domestic Violence Bill 2017 which provide that a court when making a safety order, a barring order or an emergency barring order may recommend that a respondent engage with a programme for perpetrators of domestic violence.  In that context it is intended to establish further programmes over the lifetime of the National Strategy.</p></reply>

The key goals of the strategy are to prevent such violence, support victims and holding perpetrators to account.  The strategy also contains those actions necessary for the ratification of the Istanbul Convention.  Work on implementing the strategy's actions is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Agreement on Co-operation on Criminal Justice Matters, both my Department and the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland and the related criminal justice agencies in both jurisdictions discuss matters of mutual interest including strategies for more effective co-operation on criminal justice matters across the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Under this framework, information sharing in the policy area of addressing domestic and sexual violence in both jurisdictions is facilitated, in particular, by the work of the Support for the Victims of Crime Advisory Group.  This group comprises high-level representation from the relevant criminal justice agencies North and South who promote and co-ordinate practical, operational co-operation, the exchange of best practice and sharing of policy initiatives, which informs policy and operational developments in both jurisdictions.  This close co-operation reflects the Government&rsquo;s strong continuing commitment to cross-Border working for the mutual benefit for all the people of this island.</p></reply>

In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that 981 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 49 of which were assigned to the Louth Division.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation, including the Louth Division.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will benefit all areas of Garda activity.</p></reply>

In view of these concerns, I met with the Director of the Central Statistics Office to help chart a course of action to address the Inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendations in relation to the recording and classification of crime data.</p>  <p>  Since then the CSO has provided strong support for measures to improve the quality of our crime figures, including two detailed reviews of the quality of crime data, as recorded on the Garda PULSE system (June 2015 and September 2016).  I understand that further reviews are planned by the CSO and this will provide us with an important level of reassurance in relation to official crime statistics.</p>  <p>  The CSO has also chaired an Expert Group on Crime Statistics which has considered a number of the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendations on crime statistics, including in relation to the crime counting rules.  I am advised that the Expert Group   has prepared a report, and I expect this will be published in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Work to address the full range of the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendations in relation to data quality is ongoing and is supported by very large Government investments totalling &euro;330 million from 2016-2021 in Garda technology and systems, including &euro;250 million under the Capital Plan.</p>  <p>  It is essential that we do all we can to ensure and enhance the integrity of crime statistics.  The Government remains committed to ensuring that the issues highlighted by the Garda Inspectorate concerning the official crime statistics are addressed progressively through a series of measures by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the CSO as the national statistics agency.</p></reply>

Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public. </p>  <p>  The Garda authorities will continue to take all necessary security measures proportionate to the level of terrorist threat and all the relevant agencies here co-operate closely in respect of any threats identified.  The Deputy will understand, of course, that the detail of such security measures, including the number and nature of Garda&iacute; assigned to particular areas, cannot be disclosed publicly for obvious reasons.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has developed considerable operational capacities in countering terrorism and in responding to critical incidents.  There is, in particular, a highly-trained and well-equipped special intervention capability in the Emergency Response Unit that is supported by the regional Armed Support Units and the range of other resources across the Garda organisation.  In addition, the considerable skills and resources of the Defence Forces are also available in support where needed.</p>  <p>  While there are a number of persons here whose activities in support of extremism give rise to concern they will continue to be monitored closely by the Garda authorities and all appropriate measures will be taken in this regard. </p>  <p>  The Garda Authorities will continue to work closely with their EU and other international security and intelligence counterparts in responding to the shared threat of international terrorism.  The gathering and sharing of relevant information is an important aspect of this international co-operation.  The Government is committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to enhance their connectivity to a range of EU and other international resources and significant work is ongoing in this regard.  This includes connecting to the Schengen Information System and, indeed, to other EU and Interpol information-sharing resources relevant to countering the terrorist threat.  A series of measures is being rolled out to build on the current EU framework for information-sharing, combatting terrorism and controlling illegal firearms, and Ireland is fully engaged in pursuing these developments.</p></reply>

Garda management constantly monitor the distribution of resources in the light of crime trends and overall policing needs including with respect to concerns about public order and anti-social behaviour.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his or her Division.</p>  <p>  The areas mentioned by the Deputy are patrolled by members assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) South Division. I have been informed that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to this Division on the 31 March 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 536.  Of these, 238 members were assigned to the Tallaght District which is also supported by 7 Garda Reserves and 12 civilians.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p>  <p>  This plan is progressing well. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that 981 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 82 of whom have been assigned to the DMR South Division.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the DMR South Division in the coming years.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility.  I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in decisions in this regard.  Under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between valuation of rateable property and setting and collection of commercial rates.  The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. </p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors.  This has been the policy of successive governments and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office.  The Valuation Acts provide for revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment.  The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted across the country, as soon as possible, and on a phased basis.  This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made to date. </p>  <p>  Revaluation is an important instrument in addressing historical anomalies in relation to commercial rates for both urban and rural properties and between particular classes of property within a local authority area.  The general outcome of revaluations conducted to date by the Valuation Office has been that about 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced following revaluation and about 40% had an increase, a pattern which is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the programme advances.  The current phase of the national revaluation programme, "REVAL 2017", covers revaluation of all rateable properties in counties Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Kildare, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny where a revaluation is being undertaken for the first time since the nineteenth century.  It also includes the second revaluation of South Dublin County Council area. Revaluation in these counties will be completed in September 2017 and become effective for rating purposes from 2018 onwards.</p>  <p>  Where the Valuation Office proposes to enter a new valuation or amend an existing valuation on a Valuation List, there is an extensive process available to cater for ratepayers who may be dissatisfied with the proposed valuation. A dissatisfied person can make representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days of the date of issue of the proposed valuation certificate. The Valuation Office will consider any such representations and may or may not change the proposed valuation depending on the circumstances of each individual property. If any ratepayer is still dissatisfied with the final valuation to be placed on their property following consideration of the representations, they have a right to lodge a formal appeal with the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent statutory body established for the purpose of hearing appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation.</p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to property used in the equine industry, I am advised by the Valuation Office that there has been some apparent confusion as to the rateability of certain elements of the industry.  The Valuation Act 2001 (Schedule 3, Sections 1(a) and (b)) provides that all buildings and lands used or developed for any purpose, are rateable.  The basic premise under the Act is that all interests (including buildings) and all developed land are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4. </p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's specific question, I am advised by the Commissioner of Valuation that no re-classification of properties from rateable status to exempt status has occurred within the general equine industry since the Valuation Act 2001 came into force on 2 May 2002.  The only element of the equine industry which satisfies the exemption provisions in Schedule 4 is the breeding of horses. Buildings used for breeding of horses are classified as being of agricultural use and are "farm buildings" as defined in the Act.  Therefore these buildings are exempted from the payment of rates under paragraph 5 of Schedule 4.  On the other hand, buildings used for the training of racehorses, recreational equestrian purposes or livery premises are rateable under the Act because they are considered to be part of a commercial enterprise. Such buildings would typically include stables for horses, covered riding arenas, tack rooms and ancillary buildings used to support the enterprise.  While acknowledging the important contribution which all elements of the equine industry make to the economy, there are no plans to reclassify these as exempt from rates. To do so would be at variance with the provisions in the Valuation Acts which maintains the long-standing position that all property occupied and used for commercial enterprises are liable for rates. Exceptions to this key principle would quickly be followed by demands for similar treatment from the providers of other equally important services and products, which would be difficult in equity to resist.  This could thus substantially reduce local authority revenues, which would have to be made good by imposing corresponding increases on the remaining ratepayers.</p></reply>

The Central Bank's supervisory remit is to monitor credit and financial institutions for compliance with AML/CFT control measures.  It has not a statutory remit to investigate or prosecute substantive money laundering or terrorist financing offences.</p>  <p>  Any fine that is imposed for AML/CFT breaches by the Central Bank under ASP relates to control breaches and not to actual money laundering or terrorist financing offences.</p>  <p>  One of the relevant AML/CFT breaches for an ASP case can be a breach of section 42 of the CJA 2010, which requires designated persons to submit a suspicious transaction report ("STR") to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to the Revenue Commissioners "as soon as practicable".  Designated persons are obliged to submit STRs where a suspicion or knowledge of money laundering or terrorist financing arises during the course of business.</p>  <p>  The duration of ASP investigations conducted by the Central Bank is determined by a number of factors, including inter alia the complexity of the matters under investigation; the fact that the ASP is a legal process requiring fair procedures to be followed (including procedures relating to the acquisition of relevant evidence) and the requirement for remediation measures (which can be significant) to be addressed before the case can be finalized.</p></reply>

The first quarterly progress update in respect of the implementation of the recommendations is now available on the Department of Finance website, under the Insurance Policy section.</p>  <p>  This update shows the progress to date on the overall implementation of the Report, with a particular focus on action points which were due for completion in the first quarter of 2017. </p>  <p>  The 5 parliamentary questions which have been composited all relate to Objective 1 of the Report &ndash; "Protecting the Consumer".</p>  <p>  In respect of Recommendation 5 (Support efforts and raise awareness of the need to improve cross-border insurance provision at EU level) and Action Points 8 &amp;amp; 9 (Monitor EU developments and make representations as necessary with EU Commission and EU Parliamentarians), it should be noted that the Department of Finance is monitoring developments at EU level on an ongoing basis and has instructed the Permanent Representation in Brussels to hold consultations with relevant institutions on issues raised in the report.  In this regard, I understand that engagements have taken place with the European Commission.  Furthermore, representations have been made in the Financial Services Committee to reflect the concerns outlined in the report.  There will be further engagements with other institutions going forward.  </p>  <p>  On the basis of these engagements, I understand that the European Commission is due to publish a review of its Green Paper on Retail Financial Services which will contain an action on the need to complete an evaluation of the Motor Insurance Directive later this year, in response to numerous complaints, particularly regarding no-claim bonuses on a cross-border level.  Separately, the Commission has stated that it is reviewing supervision and enforcement in relation to insurance companies operating on a cross-border basis in Member States, on foot of a number of concerns following recent bankruptcies of such companies.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has an ongoing engagement with the relevant European authorities in order to ensure common standards are applied consistently.  In addition, the Central Bank fully participates in EIOPA (the EU overarching insurance regulatory body) to establish high quality common regulatory and supervisory standards and procedures.  EIOPA is also due to report in 2019 on the barriers to providing cross-border insurance in general.  The Department of Finance and the Central Bank will feed into the development of this report to ensure views expressed during the Working Group consultations are considered.</p>  <p>  In respect of Recommendation 7 (The Declined Cases Agreement to be subject to ongoing review to ensure transparency) and Action Point 14 (Insurance Ireland to provide information on their website), Insurance Ireland has made the necessary alterations to its website in order to provide more prominent information in respect of the Declined Cases Agreement on its home page.  I am satisfied that the link from the home page provides sufficient details on the Agreement and the procedure for making an application for consumers, including relevant contact details.</p>  <p>  In respect of Recommendation 9 (Insurance Ireland to establish a Forum for Consumer and Business Issues) and Action Points 18 &amp;amp; 19 (Forum to be established by Insurance Ireland for consumer and business issues, and the Forum to meet twice yearly), I have been advised that Insurance Ireland set up the consumer and business forum in March and invited the relevant stakeholders, including representatives from the Department of Finance, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Financial Services Ombudsman, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, and the Consumers&rsquo; Association of Ireland, to the first of its biannual meetings due to take place on May 16th.  The first meeting of the forum will concentrate on motor insurance with a view to broadening its scope at the second meeting.</p>  <p>  In respect of Recommendation 10 (The Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles should enter regular discussions with Insurance Ireland to explore solutions for drivers in the sector) and Action Point 20 (Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles to meet with Insurance Ireland), I have been advised that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport met the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles, commonly known as the Taxi Advisory Committee (TAC), in March and this recommendation was discussed.  The TAC is scheduled to meet with Insurance Ireland to explore solutions for drivers in the sector on May 22nd and will then report to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport before the end of Q2 2017.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance concluded that a national claims information database is needed for the motor insurance sector so that amongst other things we can see what claims are being made against property or for personal injuries, the legal and other costs that are being incurred, and the channel of resolution and what impact this has on the final settlement.  In order to better understand how claims costs impact premiums, the Cost of Insurance Working Group decided that an incremental data gathering approach should be adopted to increase transparency and improve data availability across the insurance sector along the following lines:</p>  <p>  1. the short-term publication on a quarterly basis, of a number of key aggregated claims-related metrics.</p>  <p>  2. to be followed by the establishment of a National Claims Information Database which would facilitate a more in-depth annual claims&rsquo; trends analysis.</p>  <p>  To that end, a data sub-group was established to commence examination of these issues.  The sub-group is chaired by the Department of Finance, and includes membership from the Central Bank of Ireland, the Society of Actuaries, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, the State Claims Agency and the Central Statistics Office, and it met seven times between January and March.  </p>  <p>  Because there is considerable overlap between recommendations 11 and 12, the data sub-group has structured its work in order to enable it to meet the deadlines identified in the report.  In this context, its primary focus from the outset has been to identify the key aggregated metrics that can be obtained from the industry in the short term to allow for immediate publication on a quarterly basis from Q2 2017.  In this regard, it was therefore decided to seek an update on the information provided by industry for the purpose of Section 7(4)  of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.</p>  <p>  To facilitate the industry&rsquo;s completion of this request, the data sub-group developed a template which issued to industry at the end of March, thus achieving action point 25 of the Report.    </p>  <p>  With regard to commencing the development of a national claims information database, the work and discussion around the identification of key aggregated metrics for immediate publication has assisted the data sub-group  in considering the specification of the key aggregated metrics for the national claims information database.  This work is progressing well.  It should also be noted that concurrently the data sub-group is examining the legislative requirements to underpin the National Claims Information Database.</p></reply>

As this work is ongoing, it is not possible to comment on the outcome of the consultation, or the details of a possible review and update of the Book of Quantum. </p>  <p>  The position in relation to Recommendation 20 (Introduce more granularity into the Book of Quantum) and Action Points 41 (Consult with the Personal Injuries Commission and implement any recommendations arising from their Report) and 42 (Enhance the Book of Quantum upon each publication) is that the tasks are being considered in the context of the next review of the Book of Quantum, taking account of any recommendations which may emerge from the work of the Personal Injuries Commission.  This work is ongoing and in this regard you will note that the Working Group recommended that the Book of Quantum should be updated every 3 years, therefore I expect that it will be completed within this period.</p>  <p>  In relation to Recommendation 21 (Implement the Review of the Framework for Motor Insurance Compensation in Ireland) and Action Point 43 (Continue to implement the Review), work is well underway on the implementation of this recommendations and action point. In particular, stakeholders are being consulted and the drafting of the Heads of Bill is being progressed with a view to them being published by the end of Q2 2017.</p>  <p>  In relation to Recommendation 22 (Examine the impact of legal and other fees on personal injury awards) and Action Point 45 (Establishment of reliable set of data and commence review), the review has been commenced.  However, it has proven to be more difficult than anticipated to establish a reliable set of data and therefore the relevant action point has not been completed as scheduled in Q1.  A data set based on the aggregation of cases submitted for adjudication will become available when the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators (OLCA) is established in late 2017/early 2018.  A steering group to migrate from the current Office of the Taxing Master to the OLCA was formed earlier this year and the underlying data requirements are being designed as part of the set-up process.  There have been discussions in respect of alternative data set(s) in the interim period.  The only usable data set in relation to legal costs available to the Working Group was provided by the insurance industry in response to a specific request and it is proposed that a quarterly reporting system on costs trends be put in place with the insurance industry until the OLCA is operational.  Other discussions have taken place with the Central Statistics Office on improving the basis of collection of its legal costs data, and with the Office of the Taxing Master with a view to the possibility on an interim basis of aggregate data on costs profiles related to PI cases being extracted manually from its cases.  The review has commenced and, following discussions with the Department of Justice and Equality, experts from the Courts Service are now examining existing database systems for the District, Circuit and High Courts to establish means of extrapolating the required data for a quarterly reporting set.  Preliminary discussions have also been held with the PIAB with a view to it supplying data on trends from its own settlements spanning the period since the jurisdictional changes.</p>  <p>  In respect of Recommendation 23 (Review the impact of the changes to the Court Jurisdictional Limits as they evolve) and Action Point 47 (Review to be commenced), the review has commenced and, following discussions with the Department of Justice and Equality, experts from the Courts Service are now examining existing database systems for the District, Circuit and High Courts to establish means of extrapolating the required data for a quarterly reporting set.  Preliminary discussions have also been held with the PIAB with a view to it supplying data on trends from its own settlements spanning the period since the jurisdictional changes.  It is expected that the report will be finalised in accordance with the Q2 2018 deadline set out in the action plan. </p>  <p>  In relation to Recommendation 24 (Examine the setting of the Discount Rate (in Personal Injury lump sum awards), without prejudice to the outcome of relevant proceedings, and to be reviewed at regular intervals) and Action Points 49 (Review to be commenced) and 50 (Report to be submitted to the Cost of Insurance Working Group), the Department of Justice and Equality has commenced examination of this issue in consultation with the Department of Finance and the State Claims Agency, taking into account the judgments in the case of Gill Russell v HSE, and the recent discount rate changes in England and Wales.  The State Claims Agency is also proposing to carry out some analysis on this subject.  In the case of Gill Russell v HSE, the Court of Appeal upheld the determination of the High Court that the discount rate of 3% then being applied by the courts to personal injury lump sum awards was too high for cases involving significant long-term care needs.  A key outcome of this process will be whether regulations should be brought forward to set the discount rate and if so at what rate should they be set.</p></reply>

These views were taken on board in coming to a final decision on the methodology adopted.</p>  <p>  As I have detailed previously to the Deputy the approach taken for the assessment of schools under the new DEIS identification process utilises CSO Small Area data as represented in the Haase Pratschke Index of Deprivation (HP Index) combined with DES Primary and Post Primary data supplied by schools.  The key data sources are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the new DEIS Identification Model used to assess the level of disadvantage among the pupil cohort of a school has been applied fairly using centrally held data adopting an objective and scientific approach which has been uniformly applied for all schools.</p>  <p>  I also wish to inform the Deputy that a communication to all schools will issue shortly to provide information on the identification model including details of how the datasets are used to determine a schools level of disadvantage; the importance of data quality to the process and the need for detailed and up to date information from schools.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that DEIS supports are just one of a suite of supports provided by the Department of Education and Skills and by other Government Departments and agencies to assist schools in meeting the identified educational needs of their pupil cohorts.  These include supports for children with special educational needs, English as an additional language (EAL) supports, Educational Welfare Services and School Meals schemes.  DEIS Plans includes specific actions in relation to each of these areas.</p>  <p>  It is also important to consider that in addition to supports under DEIS additional resources, to support SEN, EAL and Travellers, are allocated across the school system both in DEIS and non-DEIS schools. </p>  <p>  Furthermore it is important to note that as part of my announcement in February in launching DEIS Plan 2017, I made it clear that we would continue to conduct further analysis to examine other strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.  In view of this, as set out in both the Report on the Review of DEIS and DEIS Plan 2017, the Technical Group will continue its work, supplemented as necessary by additional research and data expertise.</p>  <p>  A key objective of DEIS Plan 2017 is to achieve a more dynamic and tailored process for the assessment of schools which will more closely match resources to identified need. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-04a.272.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050400066#WRJ01300"><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that DES Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools and 0014/2017 for post primary schools were published on 7th March 2017.</p>  <p>  These Circulars set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.</p>  <p>  The revised allocation process replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.</p>  <p>  The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p>  <p>  Allocations based on the school profiles were issued to all schools on 7th March.  Details of the special education teaching allocations have also been published on the NCSE website.</p>  <p>  The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with Low Incidence disabilities, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. </p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government.  The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support. </p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school&rsquo;s profile. </p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school. </p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.   </p>  <p>  The new allocations to schools will include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. </p>  <p>  All allocations to schools include a supplementary provision, which has been referred to as the &lsquo;baseline allocation&rsquo; which is allocated over and above the profiled allocation. </p>  <p>  For students who start school from September 2017, with a specific diagnosis, either in junior infants or transferring from another school, the resources they need will already be in the school under the new model.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  It is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile.  Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations. </p>  <p>  For the introduction of the new allocation model, from September 2017, the NCSE &lsquo;Low Incidence&rsquo; allocations which had been made for each school during the preceding 2016/17 school year, have been used to establish the complex needs component of the new model for each school.</p>  <p>   A model for the identification of pupils with complex needs in future is being finalized by the NCSE, in consultation with the Health Service Executive and National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS) which will take account of the decision making process and qualification criteria for the selection of children for access to HSE Children Disability Network Teams. </p>  <p>  Pupils who qualify under this criteria will be included at the re-profiling stage and will be counted when the next allocations are made to schools.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  Schools were asked to submit appeals by March 31st 2017.  The appeal process will consider whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017/18 allocation.</p>  <p>  DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.  </p>  <p>  The model includes provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. </p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs are published and available on the Departments website.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants. </p></reply>

The Congregation had previously contributed as part of the legally binding collective 2002 Indemnity Agreement. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Congregation advised the then Minister for Education and Skills in 2012 that it had decided to waive its claim for legal costs from the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (CICA) and to offset this claim against the remaining cash contribution of &euro;3m outstanding from the &euro;5m it offered.  It advised that the Bill of Costs it had submitted to the CICA was in the amount of &euro;4.89m.  The then Government agreed to reckon this set-off as a contribution towards the redress response, the amount of which will be calculated by applying the average discount achieved by CICA on its respondent legal costs.  This exercise will be done once CICA has completed its work.  The Congregation was advised that in the event that the amount of the set-off calculated on that basis is less than the &euro;3m now outstanding the Government would expect it to make up the shortfall by way of a cash payment.  </p>  <p>  No other religious congregation has advised that it is offsetting legal costs against outstanding voluntary cash contributions.  However, the Oblates of Mary Immaculate advised that it would not be claiming legal costs off CICA.  An exercise to calculate the value of this contribution will be carried out once CICA has completed its work.  The Presentation Brothers refunded legal costs amounting to &euro;0.6m and this refund has been treated as an additional contribution by that Congregation. </p></reply>

In urging and encouraging the Trustees and Boards of Management to respond sensitively to this need, my Department fully appreciates that the decision ultimately lies with the relevant Board or Trustees and that the first priority at all times should be the interest of the school, its teachers and pupils.</p><p>Many schools already make their premises available to the local community outside of school hours and schools profit from an improved relationship with the wider community as a result. Good relations between the school and the community can be beneficial when it comes to seeking placements for work experience, outlets for community service, or when schools seek to access local services and expertise, including the arts. Being linked in effectively with the local community can help the school to provide a wider curriculum and range of co-curricular activities. It is for this reason that my Department has published in 2016 &ldquo;Looking at our Schools 2016&rdquo; &ndash; A Quality Framework for Primary Schools and &ldquo;School Self-evaluation Guidelines for Post-Primary Schools&rdquo;. These guidelines suggest that the relationships between the school and the wider community should form one of the self-evaluation criteria for schools. Schools shall now in their school policies and plans, where possible, include arts-in-education opportunities as an important aspect of enriching the curriculum and the wider life of the school. These policies should realise the complementarities between arts education and arts-in-education, and will be referenced in the upcoming guidelines regarding out of hours use of school buildings.</p><p><b>School Policies </b></p><p>The Arts in Education Charter envisaged that schools, in their school policies and plans, shall incorporate arts in education opportunities as an important aspect of enriching the curriculum and the wider life of the school.  The Charter Implementation Group has the agreement of my Department's Inspectorate to assist schools in this aspect of their school planning and self-evaluation.  </p><p><b>Capital Provision</b></p><p>My Department has agreed that provision for arts-in-education practice and for the wider education agenda will be reflected in the design and equipping of school buildings, and the parallel need for the design of new schools and other education buildings to take account of the particular needs &ndash; both directly educational and more widely community-based &ndash; of the arts, in the context of available resources. </p></reply>

The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State. The Programme was rolled out in April 2015, and will run until 31 December 2017. Its aim is to tackle poverty, social exclusion and long-term unemployment through local engagement and partnership between disadvantaged individuals, community organisations, public sector agencies and other stakeholders. SICAP is a key intervention for the harder to reach, with delivery in each area (or Lot) overseen and managed by the relevant LCDC in each local authority area. </p>  <p>  The SICAP funding allocation for 2017 for front-line delivery nationally is &euro;37.5m, which includes an allocation of &euro;3m under the European Social Fund (ESF) Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department recently launched the national &euro;2 million Communities Facilities Scheme which is under the remit of my colleague, Catherine Byrne T.D., Minister of State for Communities and the National Drugs Strategy.  The Communities Facilities Scheme is targeted at both urban and rural areas and will fund projects that seek to enhance communities, address disadvantage and improve social cohesion at a local level. The Scheme is being managed at a local level by the LCDCs in conjunction with the Municipal Districts, under the remit of the local authorities.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government included a commitment to launch a recast RAPID programme and my Department is currently finalising the necessary arrangements, with the intention of launching the recast programme shortly. </p></reply>

The apportionment of that payment between the three constituent companies, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is a matter for determination by CI&Eacute;.  A discount of 40% is applied to that payment to reflect fares foregone.  In the early years of the free travel scheme surveys of passenger numbers were carried out and the rate of payment was increased to take account of the survey results, fare increases and increases in numbers qualified.  My Department moved away from this approach with the CI&Eacute; Group as it was no longer practicable to conduct such surveys.  Instead, as the scheme evolved, negotiations took place when there were major changes or improvements to the transport infrastructure and/or the services which free travel customers could access.  Payments to CI&Eacute; would have been adjusted to reflect some of these.</p>  <p>  The amount my Department pays to private operators participating in the free travel scheme is determined by way of survey of their passenger numbers at a given point in time either when they apply to participate in the scheme or when they are subsequently reviewed.  An average fee, which takes account of the particular operator&rsquo;s fare structure and includes a 30% discount, is agreed with the operator and paid on a monthly basis.</p>  <p>  These discounting arrangements are historical and my Department, the Department of Transport and the National Transport Authority are now engaged in a process of reviewing the payment mechanisms underpinning the free travel scheme to ensure equity, consistency and transparency in payments to all commercial bus operators participating in the scheme.  The outcome of these deliberations will help to inform future funding requirements.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

With this in mind, my Department undertook an analysis of CE, which also looked at the other employment programmes.  In this context, the Government recently approved the implementation of a number of changes to the terms and conditions of participation on CE.  The main purpose of these changes is to broaden the availability of CE to a greater number of people on the live register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on the programme.</p>  <p>  The changes I am planning to introduce will see the general qualifying age for CE for those on the live register reduced from 25 to 21 years.  It will also be easier for previous participants, who have exhausted their CE entitlement, to requalify as participation prior to the year 2007 will be disregarded.  While participants between 21 and 55 years of age on CE will be entitled to one year on the programme, this can be extended by up to 2 more years if they are engaged in a recognised training or education award that is helping them progress towards employment.  All CE participants aged 55 and over will be able to avail of 3 consecutive years on a CE scheme up to the overall limit of 6 years from 2007 (7 years if on a disability payment).  I have also agreed to review the current participation limits for older people on CE within the next three months.  As the Deputy will be aware, participation limits are necessary to allow for the utilisation of places amongst qualifying persons to ensure the benefits of CE are available to the widest possible number of jobseekers.</p>  <p>  The length of time a person must be in receipt of a social welfare payment to qualify for CE remains at 12 months and I have no plans to change that.  This ensures that a person who becomes unemployed is, in the first instance, provided with the one-to-one intensive activation support of a DSP case officer to try to find employment before being considered for a placement on an employment programme.</p>  <p>  The Department keeps all aspects of its activation programmes under review to ensure the best outcomes for participants.  As part of the implementation of the new measures, my Department is currently consulting with key stakeholders across the country.</p>  <p>  If a CE sponsor is experiencing particular recruitment difficulties, they should contact their local DSP Intreo office with any concerns they may have in that regard.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year. Although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, pensioners may claim the State Pension Non-Contributory (currently at 95% of the SPC) if it is more advantageous to them, and they qualify through the means test. </p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes. The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC. It does not involve the award of credits.</p>  <p>  My Department is working on the details relating to the introduction of a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; as outlined in the National Pensions Framework (2010). This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation. An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform</p>  <p>  Eligibility rules and rates of the State Pension Contributory are varied from time to time by legislation, and changes, including increases or decreases in rates, are generally not applied retrospectively. </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Government has decided to implement some of these, while others will require further reflection or a consultation process with disability groups.</p>  <p>  In launching the report, the Government announced that people with a long-term disability payment who move off the payment to get a job will retain their free travel pass for a period of five years. This measure goes beyond the recommendation of three years contained within the report and comes into effect from the launch date of 6th April 2017.  The Government has also decided to accept the report&rsquo;s recommendation to dispense with the requirement that work be of a &lsquo;rehabilitative nature&rsquo; for the disability allowance earnings disregard.  This means that a report from a doctor is no longer required before commencing work and that the focus is on capacity rather than incapacity.</p>  <p>  Other recommendations related to extending the principle of &ldquo;early intervention&rdquo; to disability allowance and other disability payments as well as reconfiguring the system of payment for young persons. The Government has promised a period of consultation with persons with disabilities on these recommendations in particular.  The Department of Social Protection has started this process of consultation with the disability sector.</p>  <p>  The means disregard for disability allowance (DA) is important in the context of ensuring that people with disabilities can participate in work while retaining a proportion of their social welfare payment. The current disregard provides that people with disabilities can earn up to &euro;120 per week (after deduction of PRSI, any pension contributions and union dues) from employment or self-employment of a rehabilitative nature, without their payment being affected.  The Make Work Pay report recommends that the earnings disregard should be reviewed at regular intervals taking into account developments in the wider economy.  It is envisaged that this review could take place in the context of budgetary developments generally and the consultation process referred to above.</p></reply>

These channels include online, postal and in-person options. In order for the Passport Service to provide the most effective assistance possible, applicants are advised to select at the outset the channel that best suits their particular needs. The online passport application service, which I launched on 30 March, offers a convenient, fast and secure way for adult citizens resident anywhere in the world to renew their passports through their computer, tablet or smartphone. The turnaround time for this service, provided applications are in order, is just ten working days plus postage time.  Passport Express offers a further convenient means for applicants throughout the island of Ireland to submit applications through local post offices and have their passports delivered by express post. The turnaround time for this service is currently 16/17 working days for standard passport renewal. As advised on my Department&rsquo;s website and on Passport Express receipts, first-time applications and applications for renewal of lost/stolen passports take longer due to the more extensive checks on entitlement and identity involved. </p><p>Current average turnaround times for online and Passport Express applications are updated weekly on the website of the Passport Service, , and applicants are advised on notes accompanying the application form to consult these before submitting an application.</p><p>Individuals whose travel plans do not allow sufficient time for a passport to issue via these channels are catered for by the passport appointments service available at the Passport Offices in Cork and Dublin. The Passport Service also assists those with extremely urgent travel plans through the Rapid Renewal Service, which allows for passports to be issued (subject to certain terms and conditions) within just one working day regardless of the reason for travel.</p><p>It should be noted that in a documented case of immediate family bereavement or medical emergency abroad, the Passport Service will (subject to the provisions of the Passports Act, 2008) accommodate an individual who needs a passport by taking an application without appointment at the public office in either Cork or Dublin or by expediting an application that is already in the system.</p><p>There are currently in excess of 80,000 applications in the system, and the Passport Service endeavours to issue passports as swiftly as possible in a way that is fair and equitable to all citizens. In the interests of both fairness and operational efficiency, applications are processed in order of receipt according to the channel through which they were submitted. Genuine emergency cases are, as outlined, given priority. I am satisfied that this approach, which allows flexibility in the most urgent cases, is the most effective and equitable way for the Passport Service to assist all citizens. </p><p>I am grateful for Deputies&rsquo; assistance in encouraging applicants to familiarise themselves with current average turnaround times at , to allow plenty of time for processing, and to avail of the appropriate application channel at the outset. </p></reply>

At peak and prior to the OPW&rsquo;s intervention in the early 1990&rsquo;s when it moved to regulate the activity, there were up to 25 boats operating.  This was considered to be unsustainable on conservation grounds and a system of restrictions on permits was introduced in 1995.  With the agreement of the Boatmen at that time, the number of permits was fixed at the number then plying (19) on the understanding that this would be allowed to reduce over time through natural wastage to 15, which, it was judged, is a sustainable level.  This limit has been determined by a professional <i>Carrying Capacity Study</i>carried out in 2012 / 13 which validated the approach and confirmed that its appropriateness, subject to close management of the regime of visitor flows on the island.  This level of boat permits (which equates to a maximum of 180 visitors per day) is not considered an unsustainable load on the island, particularly when it is considered that typically, 30 / 40% of sail days are lost through bad weather off the south-west coast.  </p><p>In the years after 1994, the number of permits issued each year reduced to a point where, at the end of the 2015 season, there were 13 boats regularly operating.  Following open competitions held in 2016 and again this year, a total of 15 permits will be in place for the coming 2017 season, restoring the number of permitted boats to the optimum level. </p></reply>

The purpose of the scheme is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas. The scheme generally applies where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame. </p><p>The following Table 1 sets out the number of projects approved each year since 2009 for each Local Authority, including Leitrim County Council, for whom part of their administrative area lies within the Shannon Catchment area.</p><p>The OPW publishes on its website, , the annual lists of all projects approved under the Scheme since 2009, showing the location and details of each project approved. The commencement and progression of any works, for which funding is approved, is a matter for each Local Authority concerned.</p><p>While the OPW does not have the detailed flood information sought in relation to Carrick on Shannon municipal district, the Deputy may be able to access this data from Leitrim County Council in terms of their emergency response role.</p><p>The core strategy for addressing the significant flood risks along the River Shannon is the OPW&rsquo;s Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme. Of the 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) nationwide, there are 66 in the Shannon River Basin District that have been assessed within the Shannon CFRAM study.  These include Carrick on Shannon and are listed in Table 2.</p><p>Feasible flood relief structural measures have been identified to provide protection to almost all properties at significant risk from flooding within at risk communities. </p><p>Following a public consultation process, the Flood Risk Management Plans are now being finalised taking on board the comments received and will include a prioritised list of feasible structural measures, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner. </p><p>In January 2016, the Government took decisive action to support the existing plans in place to address flooding on the Shannon and established the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group to enhance ongoing co-operation of all State agencies involved with the River Shannon and to add value to the CFRAM Programme.</p><p>The Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group has taken the decision to develop a plan for strategic maintenance works on the River Shannon that will complement the Group&rsquo;s Work Programme and the specific measures that are identified for the areas at risk in the CFRAM Draft Shannon Flood Risk Management Plan. The Group has established a sub-committee to address all of the necessary legal, environmental, technical and other considerations that arise in bringing forward both short term and long term proposals. The Group has now agreed to the delivery of targeted maintenance activities to be carried out in a range of locations this year in accordance with the permitted seasonal windows for such activities.</p><p>Since last October, the Group has also been piloting the lowering of the lake levels in Lough Allen to help mitigate potential flood risk during Winter months and has also endorsed the commencement of a specific project, led by the Office of Public Works, to identify viable flood risk reduction measures in the Shannon Callows.</p><p><b>Table 1</b></p><p><b>Approved Projects under Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp;

While the Commission has achieved a lot since its establishment, there have also been a number of new important policy and operational developments in relation to regional development in recent years, including the introduction of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs process and the provision of a statutory role for the Local Authorities and the Regional Assemblies in economic development.  </p>  <p>  A Programme for a Partnership Government includes a specific commitment to reinforce the role of the WDC so that it can continue to play an important part, in light of these developments, in the Government&rsquo;s efforts to achieve more effective regional development across the country.   </p>  <p>  In this context, the WDC has been involved in an increasing number of initiatives, some of which go beyond the role the body has played to date, and which can develop its potential further.  </p>  <p>  For example:</p>  <p>  - The WDC is represented on the Implementing Committees which oversee the delivery of the Action Plans for Jobs for the West and North-West regions. </p>  <p>  - The body is also represented on the Monitoring Committee for the Action Plan for Rural Development which is chaired by Minister Humphreys.  The WDC is assisting my Department, as part of a sub-group of the Monitoring Committee, in developing indicators to measure the impact of the Action Plan on rural communities.</p>  <p>  - The Commission is also represented on a new Taskforce which I established in March to progress the concept of an Atlantic Economic Corridor along the western seaboard.  The WDC is involved in a sub-group of the Taskforce which is mapping out the options for EU funding which could support the development of the Western region. </p>  <p>  - The WDC has also assisted my Department by participating in, and reporting on, a public Dialogue on the implications of Brexit for areas such as rural communities, regional SMEs, culture, the Irish language, and heritage and outdoor recreation. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to work with the WDC and draw on its expertise and potential to support regional economic and social development, particularly in the Western region.  </p></reply>

Building on the Arts in Education Charter this will involve the development of an integrated plan &ndash; <i>Creative Children -</i>to enable every child in Ireland to access tuition in music, drama, art and coding by 2022.  My Department officials continue to work with relevant Departments and other stakeholders to develop this plan with a launch timeframe of early Autumn 2017.  The <i>Creative Children</i>plan will build on work to date in implementing the <i>Arts in Education Charter </i>where my Department continues to work closely with the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Youth and Children Affairs and the Arts Council to deliver the key objectives of the Charter within the wider context now of the <i>Creative Ireland Programme.</i></p><p>The objectives of the Charter have been achieved largely through existing structures such as education centres.  Good progress has been made to date in terms of launching Ireland&rsquo;s first <i>Arts in Education Portal</i>, holding National Arts and Education Days and developing Teacher Artist Partnerships through the Education and Training Centres.  Indeed, I look forward to attending the next National Arts Day, this Saturday 6<sup>th</sup>May, in St Patrick's College DCU, Drumcondra. </p><p>It should be noted that under the Arts Act 2003, primary responsibility for the promotion and support of the arts throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council.  In Budget 2017, I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council.  This will see an increase in the Arts Council allocation in 2017 of &euro;5m, or 8%, and will assist the Council in implementing its 10-year strategy Making Great Art Work (2016-2025).  This strategy places specific emphasis on the need to plan and provide for children and young people. </p><p>These initiatives demonstrate the overall commitment of Government to deliver for children as we work in finalising the Creative Children plan</p></reply>

Building on the Arts in Education Charter this will involve the development of an integrated plan &ndash; Creative Children -to enable every child in Ireland to access tuition in music, drama, art and coding by 2022.  My Department officials continue to work with relevant Departments and other stakeholders to develop this plan with a launch timeframe of early Autumn 2017.</p><p>The Creative Childen plan will build on work to date in implementing the Arts in Education Charter where my Department continues to work closely with the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Youth and Children Affairs and the Arts Council to deliver the key objectives of the Charter within the wider context now of the Creative Ireland Programme to include non-mainstream education.</p><p>The objectives of the Charter have been achieved largely through existing structures such as education centres.  Good progress has been made to date in terms of launching Ireland&rsquo;s first Arts in Education Portal, holding National Arts and Education Days and developing Teacher Artist Partnerships through the Education and Training Centres.  Indeed, I look forward to attending the next National Arts Day, this Saturday 6 May, in St Patrick's College DCU, Drumcondra. </p><p>Arising from the significant increase of support of &euro;5m which I secured for the Arts Council as part of Budget 2017, I am pleased that the Arts Council decided to increase funding in this area for 2017 from &euro;3.1m in 2016 to &euro;3.7m this year. </p><p>These initiatives demonstrate the overall commitment of Government to deliver for children as we work in finalising the Creative Children plan.</p></reply>

Residents make a contribution  towards the cost of their care based on their means and the State pays the balance.  In order to avail of support under the scheme a person must be assessed as needing long term residential care.  However, Government policy is to support older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. </p>  <p>  Government considers that a standalone funding scheme, designed for home care and recognising its particular characteristics, together with regulation of these services is needed. However a significant amount of detailed preparation needs to be done before final decisions are taken on the form of a home care scheme and the regulation of these services.  This is required if reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to determine what type of home care scheme is best for Ireland.  As an initial step in this process, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake an evidence review of the home care systems that are in place in four other European countries.  This review was published on 11 April.  The Review will help us to learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and will inform the debate and future consideration of approaches to formal home care financing and regulation here in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Another important step in this process is a public consultation process which I will be launching at the end of May.  The purpose of this consultation is to allow all those who have views on this topic to have their say, including older people themselves, their families, and healthcare workers.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.</p><p>It should be noted that every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying  for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p><p>The HSE has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to an emergency situation for persons with a serious medical condition in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and persons in palliative care, who are terminally ill.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are issued on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the medical card eligibility.  These cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant.  For terminally ill persons, no means test applies and the cards are not renewed.</p><p>It is important that people with medical needs are able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner. It is clear greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 119,620 as of 1 April this year.  This followed the measures announced by my predecessor Minister Varadkar, when the &quot;Keane&quot; <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>was published.  The &quot;Keane&quot; Report found that it is not feasible, desirable or ethically justifiable to list medical conditions for medical card eligibility.  On foot of the publication of the report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  Its establishment followed the completion of the work of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility and demonstrates the HSE's commitment to the development of a medical system which is responsive and considerate  of an applicant's particular circumstances.</p></reply>

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  Lyme Disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe.</p><p>In general, it is accepted clinical practice in Ireland, the UK, Europe and North America that laboratory confirmation is unnecessary for a confidently-made, clinical diagnosis of erythema migrans (the initial primary skin lesion of Lyme borrelliosis).  For later presentation Lyme borrelliosis, the two-tier system is necessary to ensure that false-positive rates are kept to a minimum.  Serological testing for antibodies to <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>is the mainstay of diagnostic testing.  There have been significant improvements in antibody testing in recent years, making diagnosis more certain than in the past.  Testing for Lyme borrelliosis is currently undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage process and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA &ndash; a test to detect proteins found in the Borrelia bacterium) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions (i.e. leading to over diagnosis) in the presence of other infections such as syphilis, and certain viral infections including glandular fever.  In addition, false-positive results can also occur in patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions including, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, diabetes or ulcerative colitis.  Samples giving reactive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage, confirmatory immunoblot (such as Western blot) tests.  Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity (i.e. it reduces the likelihood of these false positive results).  Using this two stage approach gives a considerably great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme.  All clinical (and other) laboratories in Ireland, must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the laboratory tests they provide is maintained at conform to the highest internationally-accepted standards. </p><p>The HSE-Health Protection Surveillance Centre has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee with the primary aim to examine best practice in prevention and surveillance of Lyme Disease and to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  This will involve raising awareness among clinicians and the general public.  The initial work packages of the Lyme Borreliosis Sub-committee involves a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners and the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland for general practitioners. It is intended that the Sub-Committee will publish a final report on its findings.</p><p>Lyme borelliosis was made been statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment Regulations) Regulations 2011 (S.I. no 452 of 2011).  The notifiable entity is Lyme neuroborreliosis, the more severe neurological form of Lyme borelliosis. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE collects and collates surveillance data on notifiable infectious diseases.  The number of annual neuroborreliosis notifications over the last few years is as follows:</p><p>- 2012 &ndash; 8 cases;</p><p>- 2013 &ndash; 13 cases;</p><p>- 2014 &ndash; 18 cases;</p><p>- 2015 &ndash; 12 cases;</p><p>- 2016 - 21 cases  (provisional).</p><p>There is extensive information available on the HPSC website <i></i>including extensive general information on Lyme disease, Information for Healthcare Professionals, illustrations showing the characteristic rash of erythema migrans and relative tick sizes, and a new set of FAQs to answer the commonest questions about Lyme testing.

Immunisation against measles was introduced in Ireland in 1985, and from 1988 the MMR vaccine  replaced the single measles vaccine.  It is included in the Primary Childhood Immunisation Programme with the first dose given at 12 months and the second dose at 4-5 years of age.  It can also be given at any age to those who need it for travel, work, or to protect vulnerable children or adults. Immunisation rates in Ireland remain high. Vaccination rates for MMR at 24 months were 92% in 2016 and have been above 90% since 2008.  Uptake rates fell when links between MMR and autism were first reported in the 1990s.  At that time people falsely linked the development of autism with MMR, but these claims have been fully discredited. </p><p>The HSE continues to work to, increase MMR immunisation rates, particularly in those areas of the country where they are below average.  These activities include: </p><p>- ongoing training for health care professionals; </p><p>- meetings with key stakeholders including the Department of Education and school management bodies; </p><p>- articles in parents magazines and for health professionals;  </p><p>- letters to be sent to all language and summer schools highlighting measles outbreaks in Europe and the importance of MMR vaccination; </p><p>- publication of hot topic article highlighting measles outbreaks in Europe and importance of MMR vaccination on National Immunisation Office website (which is accredited by the World Health Organisation);</p><p>- circulation of the latest edition (April 2017) of the National Immunisation Newsletter which contains an article about measles at .  Hard copies of the newsletter are sent to all sites that receive vaccines (2000+) from the National Cold Chain Service and it is also sent electronically to HSE staff and others who request it. </p><p>There were a number of imported cases of measles in Ireland last year. In 2015 measles incidence in Ireland was 0.2 per million of the population.  In 2016 the incidences was 8.7 per million of the population.  This increase was as a result of forty three confirmed measles cases were notified, all of which were linked to an imported cases.  Despite this outbreak Ireland is still on track to meet the WHO Euro target for the elimination of measles by 2020.</p></reply>

Many of our largest and most developed health service providers are voluntary organisations, some with religious involvement.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is not unique in the participation of voluntary organisations, including those with religious involvement, in the delivery of publicly funded healthcare.  However, it is proper that the frameworks within which service providers operate in delivering publicly funded heath services are subject to ongoing consideration.</p>  <p>  In recent years, the nature of the relationship between voluntary organisations and the State has been clarified in a number of ways.  The HSE operates a robust Governance Framework which governs grant-funding provided to all Non-Statutory Service Providers and provides for detailed service level agreements.  In the voluntary sector, it is required practice for public capital investment to be accompanied by a lien which protects the State's interest.  All public hospitals are regulated by HIQA and are subject to national clinical standards and guidelines.  Moreover, as part of the establishment of hospital groups, voluntary hospitals will be required to plan and deliver services in a manner which integrates service provision with HSE-owned hospitals in the region.  These arrangements and controls are what are paramount in ensuring high quality care and patient safety, robust operational and clinical governance, and value for State investments.</p>  <p>  I recognise that there are different and evolving views on the ownership and governance of publicly funded hospitals.  Therefore, before determining future policy I believe it is appropriate to put in place an inclusive process of consideration and I am open to listening to the views of colleagues in this House before embarking on such a significant undertaking.</p>  <p>  This process can be expected to raise a broad range of complex policy issues that will need to be addressed on a general basis within the health service into the future and therefore can, rightfully, be expected to take some time.</p></reply>

The HSE has advised that income from car parking charges in most statutory hospitals and some voluntary hospitals forms an integral part of the hospitals budgetary policy and is invested back into services provided at the hospitals.  Income is also used to fund the upgrade and upkeep of the car parks, including security and management systems. </p>  <p>  The HSE has also advised that it does not provide guidelines on hospital parking and each hospital/hospital group implements its own guidelines.  Some hospitals provide reduced parking rates for long-term patients and visitors for whom the payment of the full rate would cause hardship.

In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE, through the National Contact Point (NCP) office, provides information for patients on the Cross-Border Directive on its website and also by phone.  The principal function of the NCP (which is the mechanism specified under the Directive for the dissemination of information on the Directive by Member States) is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements. </p>  <p>  Under the Directive, insured patients are entitled to have costs of cross-border healthcare service reimbursed if the healthcare service in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation. The HSE is pro-active in advising potential users of the Scheme that reimbursement will be at the cost of the treatment availed of abroad or the cost of providing the healthcare in Ireland whichever is the lesser.  The patient is notified of this by the HSE in numerous ways: via the HSE website or in response to phone queries; on the Pro-forma invoice to be used for cases where an overnight in-patient stay is not required; and the letters issued in response to prior authorisation applications for cases involving an overnight in-patient stay will advise the actual amount to be reimbursed, based on the treatment code/s provided by the treating/referring consultant in the application form.</p>  <p>  The HSE also advises where a patient is in any doubt as to the need to seek prior authorization before availing of a consultation or treatment abroad to contact the NCP.  The NCP is happy at that stage to advise patients of the reimbursement rate that will apply to the assessment/treatment being accessed.</p></reply>

The Strategy is intended to promote older people&rsquo;s health and well being so that older people can continue to contribute to social, economic, cultural and family life in their own communities for as long as possible, thereby representing a vision for an age-friendly society.  The Strategy highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic and environmental factors that affect the health and well-being of our ageing citizens.</p><p>In advance of the development of the NPAS, given that the Strategy has a wider focus than any previous policy document for older people, it was considered important that the views and opinions of people in all sectors of Irish society could inform its development &ndash; public, private, community and voluntary, institutions, agencies and representative groups as well as those of individual older people.</p><p>In this regard, a public consultation process, which represented the most comprehensive and wide-ranging consultation exercise ever between Government and older people in Ireland, was carried out.</p><p>This consultation process comprised:</p><p>- a public call for written submissions (190 written submissions were received from statutory agencies, organisations in the community and voluntary sectors, academic and cultural institutions, as well as from older people themselves);</p><p>- a series of public regional consultation meetings which were attended by over 1,100 people;</p><p>- meetings between the Minister for Older People and groups representing vulnerable and marginalised older people to discuss in greater detail issues raised in their submissions; and</p><p>- a round table meeting in Co Louth to hear at first hand the learnings and experience so far of the Louth Age Friendly County Initiative.</p><p>A report of the consultation process, <i>In Our Own Words,</i>was published in 2010 on the Department of Health's website <i>ww.doh.ie.</i></p><p>At the launch of the Strategy, a commitment was made to publish an Implementation Plan to facilitate the translation of the Goals and Objectives of the Strategy into action on the ground. The approach to implementation originally included in the Strategy would have worked where a finite number of discrete and concrete steps could be taken after which the implementation could be deemed complete.  However, many of the objectives included in this Strategy are quite broad, and can be viewed as a set of principles to which Government has committed, and which will inform policies that affect older people on an indefinite basis into the future, rather than concrete objectives that can be delivered in the short term.</p><p>The Department therefore formulated new arrangements to implement and monitor the implementation of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  The revised arrangements were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform on 27 October, 2016.</p><p>The new arrangements establish mechanisms that will give stakeholder groups effective and on-going access to Government Departments and  State Agencies relevant to older people.  This includes  an annual Forum for stakeholders to identify what they consider to be their key priorities for Government for the coming year and the next three years; and establishing clear channels of communications between stakeholders and relevant Government Departments. In this regard, relevant Departments will be requested to assign a named senior official(s) to engage with stakeholder representatives on issues relevant to their remit, in order that the priorities identified  by the stakeholders at the Forum can be pursued.</p><p>As noted by the Deputy, the inaugural stakeholder Forum took place on 30 March 2017.  Civic society organisations who are representative of the needs and views of older people in Ireland were invited via direct written communication to attend the Forum.  Other groups and individuals who are not members of NGO organisations, but who would have an interest and expertise in the area of older people and ageing, and who expressed an interest in attending, were also invited. The wide range of attendees present at the Forum resulted in interesting and diverse discussions. Although the various organisations may have differing focuses and concerns, the Forum was an opportunity for stakeholders to reach a consensus on the matters of most importance and relevance to older people.  At the Forum a stakeholder representative group was formed by the stakeholders to progress matters arising from the Forum, directly with the relevant Departments.</p><p>The Department of Health, as secretariat, will shortly communicate with each of the Government Departments identified as having responsibility for the priorities agreed by stakeholders, in order to inform them of the context of the NPAS and the Forum and to make them aware of the issues raised at the Forum relevant to them. This will assist in setting a foundation for the stakeholder group to engage with the relevant Department thereafter. The Department of Health will meet with the stakeholder representative group in late 2017 to establish progress made and assist with any issues arising.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-04a.529.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050400074#WRR02200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 199, 202, 203 and 209 to 211, inclusive, together.</p><p>Following extensive mediation discussions, agreement was reached late last year between the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group and the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) on the relocation of the NMH to the Elm Park campus.  The terms of the agreement, which has now been published, provides for the establishment of a new company - <i>&quot;The National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC (limited by shares)&rdquo;.</i></p><p>The new company will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.  This independence will be assured by the reserved powers which are set out in the agreement and will be copper fastened by the golden share which will be held by the Minister for Health of the day.  These reserved powers can only be amended with the unanimous written approval of the Directors and with the approval of the Minister for Health.  The Board of the new NMH will comprise nine directors; four nominated by St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, four by NMH, including the Master, and one will be an international expert in obstetrics and gynaecology.  Two of the NMH Directors will also sit on the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Board.</p><p>The agreement ensures that a full range of health services will be available at the NMH at Elm Park without religious, ethnic or other distinction.  In that regard, I welcome the confirmation by the Board of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group that any medical procedure, which is in accordance with the laws of this State, will be carried out at the new hospital.  I should also acknowledge that the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group is making valuable land available, at no cost to the State, to facilitate the new NMH.  In doing so, they have foregone the opportunity to put this land to alternative use. The site was, at the time when the relocation was recommended in the 2008 KPMG report, 'Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin Area', and still is, in private ownership and was not on the market.  The question of the purchase of the site did not therefore arise.</p><p>As set out in the agreement, the establishment of the new company will necessitate an amendment of the NMH Charter.  However as we are still in the very early stages, my Department has not yet been in communication with the NMH in relation to this issue.</p><p>Now that the planning application for the development has been submitted we must now turn our focus to the legal mechanisms necessary to complete the project. The hospital will be publicly funded, built on lands in the ownership of the St. Vincent&rsquo;s and operated by the new company.  Over the next few weeks I will meet with both hospitals and will consider further the legal mechanisms necessary to absolutely protect the State's considerable investment in the hospital, including the issue of ownership of the new facility. I have indicated that, prior to the HSE entering into any construction contract, I will formally sanction the necessary arrangements to ensure that the facilities are legally secured on an on-going basis for the delivery of publicly funded maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services commitments. I should add that over the years we have made very significant capital investment in voluntary hospitals, and such facilities have always continued to be used for the delivery of publicly funded healthcare as intended.</p><p>I intend to report to Government on this project at the end of May. At that stage I expect to have further details on the legal and other arrangements envisaged and will make this information available publicly. This will allow for the necessary clarity well in advance of contractual or other commitments being entered into in respect of this project.</p><p>With regard to the designs for the new hospital, there is no differentiation between public and private in-patient rooms and indeed all in-patient rooms are of a similar design. In order to support the current commitment in the Consultants' contracts, some private outpatient consulting space will be provided. The charge to consultants for the use of those rooms is an operational matter and will be determined in due course. While there is no provision for the facility referred to by the Deputy in the design of the new maternity hospital, there is provision in the design for an assisted conception area within the development.</p><p>Finally, I would like reaffirm my commitment to this hugely important project.  The facilities at Holles St are no longer fit for purpose.  It is also acknowledged that for optimal clinical outcomes, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services.  I look forward to working with all stakeholders to deliver the new National Maternity Hospital which is so badly needed to provide women and infants with modern healthcare facilities.</p></reply>

Initial processing of this inspection identified a requirement to verify the eligibility of land declared by means of a field inspection.  Pending the outcome of this field visit payment under the 2014 Single Payment Scheme was processed based on the area declared by the person named and issued on 9   December 2014.</p>  <p>  The subsequent field visit, to verify the position on the ground, identified discrepancies between the area declared and the area determined resulting in an over-declaration in area of greater than 20%.  Based on the terms and conditions of the scheme this resulted in no payment being due under the 2014 Single Payment Scheme.  The person named was notified of the outcome of this field visit by letter issued on 7 April 2015.  The person named was also notified of their right to seek a review of this decision. To date no such request has been received.</p>  <p>  As payment had already issued under the 2014 Single Payment Scheme, my Department is required to recover any overpayment from future payments issuing to an applicant.

The laboratories also provide valued services and advisory support to the farming community,  the food industry and wider society.  </p>  <p>  The ambitious targets of the Agri-food industry for growth and development over the next decade, as set out in Food Wise 2025, must be underpinned by robust systems which protect and enhance our reputation as a producer of safe and wholesome food and one of the ways in which we must respond to this challenge is by developing a long-term strategy for the laboratories - building on existing capability and  expertise in animal health, food safety and plant sciences, and ensuring we achieve both operational and scientific excellence.  </p>  <p>  This was the primary reason for tasking a Working Group led by Prof. Alan Reilly to undertake a comprehensive review of the Department&rsquo;s Laboratories.  This review has considered both the central laboratory complex at Backweston and the eight regional laboratories located at Athlone, Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick and Sligo.  The Group has presented a report to the Department, which makes recommendations on: </p>  <p>  - Oversight and co-ordination of the laboratories activities  </p>  <p>  - Re-organisation of Divisions and support functions within the Central Laboratory complex </p>  <p>  - Options for the future development of the Regional Laboratories &ndash; with a view  to improving disease investigative and surveillance capability but with  the over-riding imperative of maintaining and enhancing services to  farmers and </p>  <p>  - Human resources management within the laboratories - with a focus on grading structures, career development opportunities  and workforce planning.</p>  <p>  To date no decision has been taken in respect of the options proposed for the Regional Veterinary Laboratories (RVLs).  My Department is currently completing a consultative process with all relevant stakeholders on the Working Group report (including on the options for RVLs).

It was also considered that were there to be a land drainage scheme, it would be likely that specific sensitive areas such as Natura Designated Lands (whether Special Areas of Conservation or Special Protection Areas) and potentially contiguous areas that may impact on these designations, would have to be excluded.  Other administrative and control challenges within my own Department were also raised as significant issues.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that discussions on CAP post 2020 are at an early stage and no decisions have yet been taken; however the challenges presented by a land drainage scheme as outlined in the previous paragraphs in the context of the   current programming period, would have to be considered and addressed were such a scheme to be included within a future CAP.</p></reply>

The ANC scheme replaces the previous Disadvantaged Areas Scheme/Less Favoured Areas Scheme.  The designation of eligible areas under these schemes to date has been based on a range of socio-economic factors.  From 2018 eligible areas must instead be designated using a set list of bio-physical criteria.  In cases where a Member State does not introduce this new system for payment, the old scheme remains in place but payments must phase out on a digressive basis.  </p><p>The bio-physical criteria set out in the legislation to underpin the new system of designation are: </p><p>- Low temperature </p><p>- Dryness </p><p>- Excess soil moisture </p><p>- Limited soil drainage </p><p>- Unfavourable texture and stoniness </p><p>- Shallow rooting depth </p><p>- Poor chemical properties </p><p>- Steep slope.</p><p>My Department has commenced work on this project, and relevant technical experts are currently working on sourcing and analysing the data in relation to the new criteria.

Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular.  </p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.  This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.  </p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025, I and Minister Doyle led trade missions to China, Singapore, Vietnam and South Korea in September 2016.  In November I also led a trade mission to Morocco which was extended at senior official level to include Algeria.  Earlier in 2016, senior officials accompanied a Bord Bia trade mission to Iran, and travelled on to Turkey and met with officials to discuss trade of live animals.  </p>  <p>  In February 2017 I also led a very successful Trade Mission to the Gulf Region.  This covered the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  </p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland in making arrangements for other destinations for the remainder of 2017, although no final decision has yet been made in terms of content or timing.  Again, markets in Asia, Africa and America are likely to feature prominently in these considerations, and I am of course ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.  These missions will again include participants from across the agri-food sector and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as political discussions with my counterparts in the host countries.  </p>  <p>  I have also hosted a number of high level visits from countries outside of the EU including, most recently, the Chinese Minister for Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, and the Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister, and their delegations.  </p>  <p>  These missions and visits will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in these destinations.  It will also promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products.</p></reply>

Figures from the European Commission's most recent Short Term Outlook for meat markets show a projected growth of per capita beef consumption of 1.2% for 2017.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the market situation for sheepmeat the European Commission&rsquo;s Short Term Outlook noted that consumption of sheepmeat declined by 1% in 2016 due to a reduced availability of sheepmeat on the EU market but that consumption will increase in 2017 as production increases.  The strong performance of Irish sheepmeat across the EU, not just in our traditional markets in France and the UK in recent years augurs well.  </p>  <p>  The immediate impact of Brexit was seen in weaker sterling values against the Euro.  Despite this cattle prices are remaining reasonably firm so far this year.  Nonetheless the uncertainty surrounding the final outcome of negotiations presents significant challenges.  Our strategy is to defend our market position in the UK while developing new opportunities elsewhere.  </p>  <p>  I led a major trade mission to four Asian Countries in September of last year and one to Algeria and Morocco at the beginning of November.  I also led a trade mission to the Middle East at the end of February.  By increasing our footprint internationally that we can help to mitigate the effects of Brexit and develop our agri-food sector to realise its full potential.  My Department and its state agencies will continue to ensure that as many markets as possible are opened  for Irish beef and sheepmeat.  </p>  <p>  I am also very conscious of the vital role that live exports play in providing an alternative market outlet for Irish farmers.  These have increased significantly in 2017, both to traditional EU and third country markets, and this is helping to provide market balance for cattle prices in Ireland.</p></reply>

The sector accounts for 5% of the total agri-food sector and is the third largest individual component. In 2016 Irish pigmeat exports were 4% higher at &euro;615m.  Exports of Irish pigmeat to International markets however grew by 20% driven by higher demand from Asia.  Irish prices are currently strong and remain broadly in line with EU prices, reflecting renewed market confidence in Europe and increased demand in China, the second most important market for Irish pigmeat.  </p>  <p>  Poultry meat has long been seen as a value for money food and this has underscored an increase in demand, particularly in recent years. Irish production hit record levels in 2016.  Retail sales of fresh and chilled poultry increased by approximately 8% on the Irish market in 2016 compared to the previous year, with most of this increase was attributable to broilers, while prices remained steady.  </p>  <p>  Support is provided by my Department for the development of the pigmeat and poultry sectors in a number of ways.  Firstly I have included provision throughout the whole RDP for a specific Pigs and Poultry Investment Scheme with a budget of &euro;17 million.  Among the areas identified for funding are investments for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers.  Other elements of the RDP, such as targeted Animal Welfare, Safety and Nutrient Storage Scheme and the Low Emission Slurry Spreading Scheme will also be of benefit to the sectors.  </p>  <p>  Other supports for development of the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility, courses in pig production, and the provision of technical advice plays an important role in improving production at farm level.  Support for the poultry sector is available through the RDP funded Knowledge Transfer programme which was launched last year.  </p>  <p>  I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pigmeat in domestic and overseas markets.  Bord Bia provides assistance to the pigmeat and poultry sectors through its marketing and promotional activities and the quality assurance schemes which help consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat and poultry produce on the domestic market.  Support from Bord Bia also helps expand the presence of Irish exports on EU and third country markets, which is evident from the continued rise in exports, particularly to Asia.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I am committed to ensuring that as many alternative markets as possible are open to the Irish pigmeat and poultry sectors to ensure the continuation of positive prospects for future growth.  In that regard I recently launched a seven point plan to increase international market access for Irish food and drink exports.  This will be implemented by my Department with significant input from Bord Bia and Irish Embassies around the world, to help increase the footprint of our food and drink exports.  Securing access for Irish products and increasing penetration in international markets is a priority against the background of Brexit.  There have been a number of significant successes in recent times and agri food exports to China, for example, have almost tripled in value to more than &euro;700 million since 2010.</p></reply>

I have recently undertaken a number of trade missions in order to gain access to new 3rd country markets and develop existing ones for dairy and other agrifood sectors.  </p>  <p>  In addition, against the background of Brexit, I have recently asked Bord Bia to conduct market profiling exercise to identify opportunities in new and more mature markets, and the output of this exercise will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers.  </p>  <p>  Competitiveness is key if Irish operators are to be successful on international markets.  My Department works closely with industry stakeholders, providing financial and practical support to bring initiatives which encourage sustainable development of the sector through on farm skills development and collaboration leading to increased efficiencies.  It also provides funding for Teagasc to provide research , education and advice to improve farm and industry competitiveness, and funding is also available through Enterprise Ireland for lean manufacturing, energy efficiency and other competitiveness measures.  </p>  <p>  There have been a number of geopolitical factors which have exacerbated market volatility in recent years, including the ban on exports to Russia.  As Minister, I have been an advocate of deploying the market measures utilised by the Commission, such as Aids to Private Storage and Intervention.  These have been deployed and this has helped put a floor under prices over the past two years.  There has been significant price recovery this year.  Additionally, the Common Market Organisation Regulations agreed by the Irish EU Presidency in 2013 provides for more flexible "exceptional measures, such as those deployed during the most recent dairy market crisis.  These included the provision of direct aid to farmers, the voluntary production reduction scheme and the &euro;11 million in funding that facilitated the creation of a &euro;150 million low interest loan fund for farmers.  </p>  <p>   It should be noted that there have been a number of significant successes in recent times and agri food exports to China, for example, have almost tripled in value to more than &euro;700m since 2010, much of this in the dairy sector.

This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.  The CFP specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY.  This is being phased in gradually and is due to be complete by 2020 at the latest for all stocks.  This will result in more fish being left in the sea to mature and reproduce leading to increased abundance of fish, and over time to higher quotas for Irish fishermen.  </p>  <p>  The EU Commission has noted that the state of fish stocks in European Atlantic and nearby waters continues to improve which I believe indicates that we are continuing to see the benefits of prudent and responsible fisheries management practices.  </p>  <p>  The ongoing implementation the landing obligation, which began in 2015 will also contribute to an improvement in the state of the stocks of importance to Ireland and will result in increased fishing opportunities for the Irish fishing industry.  </p>  <p>  The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Operational Programme is funding a suite of schemes implemented by Bord Iascaigh Mhara to support our seafood processing sector develop new value-added seafood products, put in place the capital investment to produce new and more seafood products, develop business and marketing strategies to take advantage of the export opportunities, and to work cooperatively with other seafood enterprises to develop marketing resources in potential export markets.</p>  <p>  My overarching goal for fisheries is to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to safeguard fish stocks for future generations.  This will ensure that families dependent on fishing can look forward to being part of a vibrant, productive and resilient Irish fishing industry and can expect to continue to achieve a reasonable return for their efforts and investment.  </p>  <p>  The most immediate potential threat to the well being of our fishing industry is of course Brexit. At this stage it is impossible to say with certainty what effect Brexit will have on the Irish fishing industry as we don't know yet what changes the UK may seek to the current arrangements.  </p>  <p>  Any attempt by the UK to alter the status quo at the expense of Ireland and others must, and will be, resisted strenuously.  </p>  <p>  I am and will remain in close contact with fisheries stakeholders as the issues develop and work with them to ensure that we are all fully prepared for what are likely to be extremely complex negotiations.  </p>  <p>  I am also continuing to work closely with my European colleagues to ensure that fisheries remain a top priority in the negotiations to come. Protecting existing shares and access are top priorities for the fishing Member States.</p></reply>

However the FSAI is the body responsible for enforcement of regulations governing traceability, labelling and provision of food information to customers.</p>  <p>  Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators. The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement. This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain. Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system. There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.   </p>  <p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants. Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks.</p>  <p>  Extra veterinary checks are carried out on selected consignments of foods imported into DAFM-approved establishments from other EU Member States or from Third Countries outside the EU.  These checks include, physical checks of product condition, checks of accompanying documentation and checks of labelling and health markings.</p>  <p>  The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards. The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department. Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance. Inspection finding reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the controls and checks in place and enforced by my Department ensure that Irish consumers are protected and correctly informed when they purchase and consume food products.</p></reply>

On the 30th of March, the UK published a White Paper entitled "Legislating for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union" which made clear that as part of the UK's Brexit plan it is intended that the Repeal Bill will reflect the decision to convert the "acquis" - the body of European legislation - into UK law at the moment that the European Communities Act is repealed.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have engaged with the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the UK Office for Nuclear Regulation, through the UK-Ireland Contact Group on Radiological Matters.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>On the 4 April, I signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  Eir has committed to doing this work over a 90 week period, an average of 500 premises passed per day.  My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eir meets its obligations under the Agreement.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website www.dccae.gov.ie.</p><p>The decision by eir to invest in infrastructure to deploy high speed broadband services to an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland was taken purely on commercial grounds having regard to the cost of service provision and the anticipated revenue returns from any such invest. I do not have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard. </p><p>On the same day I published  an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. which finalises the State Intervention area.  The updated Map shows the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:  </p><p>-  The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,</p><p>-  The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p><p>The map shows that the eircode referred to by the Deputy is  within the townland of Grange More Co Westmeath and falls within<font color="#444444"> the AMBER area and will require State Intervention. </font>Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at www.broadband.gov.ie.</p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.</p><p>The  three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second. </p><p>The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers. </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP once contracts are in place. </p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand and a prioritisation programme.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.</p><p>In this regard, in July 2016, together with Minister Humphreys I established the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available at the following link:.  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p><p>The work of the Task Force is being led by an Implementation Group.  This group brings together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery of actions.  This group will formally report every 90 days on progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys.  I am expecting the first such quarterly report in May.</p><p>In addition, I have signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with a 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band. This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.</p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.</p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

On the 15th February 2017, the European Parliament voted in support of the provisional application of CETA.</p>  <p>  The process of ratification can now commence in some 43 national parliaments and regional assemblies across the EU according to their constitutional requirements.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the D&aacute;il will be part of the final decision to ratify the Agreement.</p>  <p>  I fully support provisional application of the Agreement.  I am of the view that there should be no impediment to Irish companies immediately taking advantage of the provisions of CETA including eliminating tariffs on almost all of key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, easing regulatory barriers and ensuring more transparent rules for market access. </p>  <p>  Canada is currently finalising its internal implementation procedures to allow for its ratification of the Agreement, therefore CETA is yet to be provisionally applied.  I believe that it is important to wait to see the benefits of CETA come into being, before CETA is put before the D&aacute;il for ratification.  Then we can have a fully informed, evidence based debate on the value of the Agreement to Ireland. </p>  <p>  My Department is already working with our agencies and Business Groups to ensure that Irish firms take early advantage of the terms of the Agreement.  I will be leading a trade mission to Canada in late May to promote the opportunities provided by the Agreement. </p>  <p>  An Taoiseach is meeting with Prime Minister Trudeau today to discuss the ties between Canada and Ireland and in particular how to take advantage of the opportunities created by CETA.</p></reply>

That is why I secured significant additional funding for IDA Ireland to help the Agency better respond to the challenges and opportunities Brexit may present.  I regularly engage with the IDA about its Brexit-related requirements and other issues in connection with securing new investment for Ireland.</p>  <p>  Competition for all mobile FDI, including opportunities arising as a result of Brexit, is intense.  It is important that Ireland continues to remain competitive in order to attract this investment and labour costs play a part in this.  The National Competitiveness Council has noted that, although demands for wage increases are understandable after a period of economic stagnation and wage cuts, Ireland's relative competitive position would be negatively affected if wage growth outpaced productivity growth and wage growth in competitor countries.  Therefore, to ensure that wages are sustainable, wage growth should not outpace productivity growth.  Having said that, I know there must also be a focus on protecting real living standards by avoiding, to the greatest extent possible, significant increases in the costs of living.</p></reply>

HPSU companies are defined as start-up ventures that are:</p><p>-  Introducing a new or innovative product or service to international markets.</p><p>-  Involved in manufacturing or internationally traded services.</p><p>-  Capable of creating 10 jobs in Ireland and realising &euro;1 million in sales within three to four years of starting up.</p><p>-  Led by an experienced management team.</p><p>-  Headquartered and controlled in Ireland.</p><p>-  Less than six years old.</p><p>Table 1 provides an overview of each of the HPSU Class 2010 &ndash; 2016 by NUT3 Region and county.</p><p>Start-up companies that have a well-developed business plan and need to raise investment for their business can apply to EI for equity support under the Competitive Start Fund.  This is a &euro;50k equity investment designed to accelerate the development of high potential start-up companies by supporting them to achieve commercial and technical milestones such as evaluating international market opportunities or building a prototype.</p><p>Table 2 provides an overview of Competitive Start Funds approved by NUT3 Region and County.</p><p>EI&rsquo;s company R&amp;amp;D supports are designed to provide support for research, development and technological innovation relevant at all stages of company development, and which will enable companies to progress from undertaking an initial research project to higher level innovation and R&amp;amp;D activities.</p><p>Table 3 provides an overview of companies that engage in substantial research and development projects of above &euro;1 million spend per annum by NUTS Region and county.</p><p>Table 4 provides an overview of companies that engage in substantial research (spend of more than &euro;100,000 for more per annum) and development projects.</p><p>EI assists client companies to build the leadership and management capabilities that are required to scale and succeed in international markets.  This support is delivered in the form of short management programmes (e.g. Excel at Growth) and long-term management programmes (e.g. Leadership for Growth).</p><p>Table 5 provides an overview of companies participating on short and long term management development programmes by NUT3 Regions and by county.</p><p>In relation to Seed and Venture Capital Schemes, the Government, through Enterprise Ireland, has made &euro;175m available as part of the Seed &amp;amp; Venture Capital Scheme (2013 &ndash; 2018).  The following investments have been made by Enterprise Ireland under these Schemes across the period 2012&ndash;2016:</p><p>-  2012:  &euro;25.7m </p><p>-  2013:  &euro;21.1m</p><p>-  2014:  &euro;18.8m</p><p>-  2015:  &euro;21.1m</p><p>-  2016:  &euro;25.1m</p><p>Enterprise Ireland invests in VC funds through the Seed and Venture Capital Schemes.  These funds then invest a minimum of double Enterprise Ireland commitments in Irish companies most which are EI clients.  The fund managers make investment decisions independent of Enterprise Ireland.  The regional breakdown of these investments is made available on an annual basis on the publication of the Seed and Venture Capital Report.  The report for the period 2016 will be available in July 2017.</p><p>It is important to highlight that Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy 2017 &ndash; 2020 is focused on addressing the need for Irish enterprise to build scale and expand reach by driving Innovation, Competitiveness, Diversification and Ambition.  EI has a range of financial and non-financial supports, which are not detailed above, that are available to clients to assist in the implementation of this strategy.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland is working with companies throughout the country to assist in addressing the challenges in a post Brexit marketplace.</p><p><b>Table 1: Overview of each of the HPSU

Collaboration between the private and the public sector has been a core element in each plan&rsquo;s development, and will be central to each plan&rsquo;s delivery.</p>  <p>  The First Progress Reports in respect of all 8 Regions were published in December 2016.  While at an early stage, the progress reports reflect the good work made to date in the implementation of all 8 Regional APJs and creating a supportive environment for jobs growth in the regions.  Based on current data, all regions are on target to meet or exceed the job targets to be delivered by 2020.</p>  <p>  Employment has been growing continuously for the past 17 quarters and over the past year employment has grown in all regions.</p>  <p>  The most recent figures from the CSO also show that 70% of all jobs created in the past year were created outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  The enterprise agencies are making a significant contribution to employment in the regions. In 2016, 61% of new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, and over half of those created by IDA supported companies, were outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2017-2020 aims to create a further 60,000 jobs, while sustaining existing ones, which will make an important contribution to jobs and economic growth across all regions of Ireland.  IDA will continue to target a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside Dublin to 2019.</p>  <p>  I recently published the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) annual jobs survey results which highlights three consecutive years of local jobs growth throughout the country.  In 2016 there was a net increase of 3,679 jobs and total direct employment among LEO client companies stood at 34,634.</p>  <p>  In June 2016, I announced an initial allocation of &euro;5m in competitive funding for 48 local and regional initiatives.  My Department and Enterprise Ireland are finalising plans for a further regional funding initiative of up to &euro;60m to support collaborative approaches to grow and sustain jobs across the regions.</p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;150m is being made available to the IDA to support its Regional Property Programme and drive job creation in the multi-national sector.</p></reply>

These efforts will continue in the coming months through a communications initiative with parents and providers.  In addition, the availability for the first time of a universal band within CCS from September is expected to incentivise more private providers to sign contracts to participate in the scheme.</p><p>With regard to the level of parental demand for childcare, there is considerably uncertainty about the level of take-up of subsidised places, given the high level of change to subsidy rates from this September.  Increases in subsidies are expected to lead an increase in demand, but this increase may take time to fully materialise as the speed of change in demand depends, for example, on the speed with which parents for whom childcare is now affordable &ndash;  as a result of higher levels of subsidy &ndash; are able to obtain work.</p><p>Differences between the expected take-up of CCS and TEC subsidies this September and the expected initial take-up in the first year of the Affordable Childcare Scheme partly reflect differences between the schemes in eligibility rules.

This subvention is aligned with the rates proposed under the ACS.  The CCS/P caters for children in the age range of 0-15 years.  From September 2017, the maximum childcare subsidy available to parents who qualify for CCS/P will be &euro;145 per week, which will be paid pro-rata based on child&rsquo;s level of attendance (full-time, part-time, sessional, or half-sessional).</p>  <p>  Unlike the ACS, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes, which are the childcare schemes that will be in operation in September 2017, calculate subsidies on a weekly rather than an hourly basis.  Also, unlike the ACS, the existing schemes do not vary subsidy rates by the age of the child; the same subsidy applies whether a child is 18 months or 8 years old.</p>  <p>  The maximum subsidy in September will be &euro;145 per week under both the CCS and TEC programmes, eligibility for which is based not on family income but on other specified criteria (e.g. receipt of relevant social welfare payments and possession of a Medical Card).  This highest level of weekly subsidy will be available for full-time childcare, which under the current schemes is defined as childcare for more than 5 hours per day.</p>  <p>  When the ACS is introduced, the maximum subsidy that an 18 month old will be able to receive will be &euro;4.37 per hour, for up to a maximum of 40 hours per week.</p>  <p>  For a family that benefits from this maximum hourly subsidy rate and uses the full 40 hours of childcare per week, the ACS will provide a subsidy of &euro;175 per week.</p>  <p>  For a family that benefits from this maximum hourly subsidy and uses 6 hours of childcare per day (which counts as full-time under the existing schemes), i.e. 30 hours per week, the ACS will provide a subsidy of &euro;131 per week.</p>  <p>  So, while some 18-month olds in full-time childcare will be slightly better off when the ACS is introduced, some will be slightly worse off.  The maximum subsidy rate set for this September (&euro;145), which is 53% higher than the current maximum subsidy rate under CCS (&euro;95), necessarily is a compromise subsidy rate, reflecting the fact that the existing childcare schemes offer less scope for variation in subsidy rates than will be possible when the ACS is introduced.</p>  <p>  Similarly, as the existing childcare schemes do not vary subsidy rates by the age of the child, the increased subsidy rates being introduced this September necessarily reflect a compromise between the subsidy rates for older children and for younger children that the ACS will provide.  For example, for a child using 7 hours childcare per day, or 35 hours per week, the maximum subsidy this September will be &euro;145 per week, regardless of the age of the child. When the ACS is introduced, the maximum subsidy for 35 hours per week will range from &euro;132 per week for a school-aged child (for out-of-term-time care) to &euro;179 per week for a child between the ages of 6 and 12 months old.</p></reply>

Since the policy paper for the introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme was approved by Government in October 2016, officials in DCYA and Pobal have been working intensively to plan for the implementation of this Scheme. <font color="#FF0000"> </font>The Scheme must be fully functional and rigorously tested before it is introduced.</p><p>I committed to ensuring that parents would benefit from September 2017, and I will be delivering on this pledge.</p><p>I recently announced that a number of changes will be made to existing childcare schemes that will bring substantial benefits to up to 70,000 children and their families from this September.  These changes will include: a new universal childcare subsidy for children aged from 6 months up to 36 months old (or qualification for the free pre-school programme); and increases of up to 50% in childcare subvention rates provided under existing targeted childcare schemes.</p><p>I was informed during the first week of February that it would not be possible to have a fully automated IT system for the Affordable Childcare Scheme operational in September.  I announced this at a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Children and Youth Affairs on February 8th, whereupon I also stated my hope that the Affordable Childcare Scheme could be introduced this September on the basis of semi-automated income assessments.  Officials in my Department closely examined this possibility, however, given the additional time needed for such income assessments, this scenario would have required opening the Scheme to applications in June.  Given the extensive requirements of even a semi-automated process &ndash; including legislation, IT development of a parent application portal, and extensive new business processes &ndash; it was determined that this scenario was not achievable within the timeframe.</p><p>Officials in my Department and in Pobal are now working intensively to deliver the full Affordable Childcare Scheme &ndash; including automated income assessments, at the earliest possible date.  Rigorous governance and project-monitoring procedures are in place for the Scheme, including a Project Board that meets on a 3-weekly basis which includes representatives of my Department, the Department of Social Protection, the Revenue Commissioners, Pobal, and an independent member.  In addition, the IT development is currently undergoing an independent peer review carried out by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.</p><p>There has been no change to the maximum and minimum subsidies approved by Government in January, which will apply when the Affordable Childcare Scheme is introduced.  The maximum subsidies under the Affordable Childcare Scheme will range from &euro;3.76 per hour for school-aged children to &euro;5.11 per hour for children between 6 and 12 months old, for up to a maximum of 40 hours per week.  The minimum subsidy for children aged between 6 and 36 months (or qualification for the Free Pre-School programme if later) will be &euro;0.50 per hour. There will be no minimum subsidy for older children.</p></reply>

In this context, there are no plans to review Defence Force Regulations with regards to the governance and management of married quarters.</p>  <p>  Personnel who leave the Defence Forces or who vacate a married quarter property are required to return vacant possession of that property.</p>  <p>  Those who fail to return vacant possession of such properties are termed &ldquo;overholders&rdquo; and the Department seeks to recover possession of the property.  Where married quarter properties are located outside the barracks they may be offered for sale to the occupant and many have been disposed of in this manner.  The majority of properties being overheld at this point are located within barracks and it is not possible to offer these for sale.</p>  <p>  The Department does not have a role in the provision of housing accommodation for the general public and the ongoing illegal occupation of these properties cannot be supported.  It is always preferable not to have to use legal means to obtain vacant possession and each case of overholding is dealt with on an individual basis.  My officials have met with a number of overholders to discuss and examine what assistance can be provided to bring about a resolution.</p>  <p>  However, securing alternative housing is a matter for the individuals concerned. In certain cases individuals may qualify for social housing or some level of housing assistance.  When requested to do so the Department provides whatever documentation it can to support such applications.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s engagement with overholders is ongoing.  It is hoped that the discussions will provide an opportunity for both sides to work together in order to bring about a resolution to the problem.</p>  <p>  Currently there are twenty six (26) overholders in or near the Curragh Camp.  Of this group, the Department has issued &ldquo;Notices to Quit&rdquo; in twelve cases and court proceedings seeking vacant possession were commenced in two of these cases.  I am aware of a small number of overholders who are particularly vulnerable and the deputy can be assured that they will be treated in an appropriately sensitive manner.</p>  <p>  There are also thirteen (13) serving personnel currently residing in married quarters in the Curragh Camp.</p></reply>
