Publication is expected this week with enactment to follow as expeditiously as possible thereafter.  </p>  <p>  The main purpose of the Bill is twofold: Firstly to provide (1) for the reintroduction of a mechanism for the registration of employment agreements between an employer or employers and trade unions governing remuneration and conditions of employment in individual enterprises, and (2) to provide for a new statutory framework for establishing minimum rates of remuneration terms and conditions of employment for a specified type, class or group of workers, particularly in the context of transnational provision of services and promoting harmonious relations between workers &ndash; in effect a framework to replace the former sectoral Registered Employment Agreements. The relevant provisions are contained in Part 2 of the Bill.</p>  <p>  Secondly, to put in place the legislative amendments to the Industrial Relations Acts 2001 and 2004 required to give effect to the Programme for Government commitment to reform the current law on employees' right to engage in collective bargaining (the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001), so as to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Furthermore, the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 prioritised the enactment of the Collective Bargaining legislation as approved by Government. The relevant provisions are contained in Part 3 of the Bill.</p>  <p>  The proposals in the Collective Bargaining element of the legislation respect Ireland&rsquo;s voluntary Industrial Relations system but ensure that where an employer chooses not to engage in collective bargaining either with a trade union or an internal &lsquo;excepted body&rsquo; the 2001 Act will be remediated to ensure there is an effective means for a trade  union, on behalf of members in that employment, to have disputed remuneration and conditions of employment assessed against relevant comparators and determined by the Labour Court if necessary. </p>  <p>  They will also ensure that if an employer chooses to collectively bargain with an internal &lsquo;excepted body&rsquo;, instead of a trade union, that body must pass tests as regards its independence. </p>  <p>  Provisions are included to ensure the Act is used appropriately. There are provisions to ensure cases dealt with are ones where the numbers of workers are not insignificant; provisions to ensure elements of remuneration and conditions of employment are not challenged without regard for the totality of remuneration and conditions of employment; provisions to manage the frequency of reassessment of the same issues. </p>  <p>  Crucially, additional protection by way of interim relief is proposed where a trade union member, identified in the course of use of the process under the Act, believes her or his dismissal is a direct consequence of this.  </p>  <p>  In addition, any determination by the Labour Court may also be enforced by the Circuit Court, should any employer choose not to engage with a trade union or implement a previous recommendation of the Labour Court.   </p>  <p>  The new legislation will balance the interests of workers and employers by providing certainty and clarity for businesses while enhancing collective bargaining in workplaces, providing for registered employment agreements to be re-established and sectoral wage rates and conditions.</p>  <p>  Integral to the process of drafting the Bill, submissions and presentations were received from a range of interested parties ranging from trade union representatives, employer representatives, State bodies and others. In addition, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers&rsquo; Confederation, and the American Chambers of Commerce were consulted extensively and the Bill, balancing the concerns of both sides of industry in this area, very much reflects the consensus achieved through the submission and consultation process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-13a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051300041#WRA00800"><p>I welcome the publication of the EU&rsquo;s draft Regulatory Cooperation Chapter which is intended to provide the framework for ongoing regulatory cooperation under TTIP. This is an area where significant mutual gains can be made which will promote trade and job creation. It will be a particular area of interest for Ireland with our large pharmaceutical and medical device sectors, It offers all parties an opportunity to make input into this significant area on the TTIP. The revised regulatory cooperation text was tabled by the EU and is available on the EU Commission website along with a detailed explanation of the EU proposal.   The chapters on Regulation first set out the potential benefits of regulatory cooperation in terms of:</p>  <p>  -  Jobs and growth</p>  <p>  -  More choice for consumers</p>  <p>  -  Stronger regulation, better enforced</p>  <p>  -  Greater influence on the international stage </p>  <p>  They then demonstrate that such cooperation will not lower existing protection in the EU or in the US. It makes clear that nothing in a TTIP agreement will affect the right of either side to make new regulations, or undermine the procedures through which those regulations are made. </p>  <p>  The detailed articles set out the general objectives and principles of cooperation. The key objectives are to facilitate trade and investment by removing unnecessary burden, promoting a transparent and predictable regulatory environment and promoting international cooperation. Some principles of good regulation are enshrined in the cooperation agreement such as early indication of plans, opportunity for consultation, sound impact assessment, development of an annual cooperation programme covering information exchange, identifying the scope for mutual recognition of equivalence, simplification or harmonisation. It also provides for the establishment of a Joint Regulatory Cooperation Body to facilitate their implementation of the cooperation agreement. </p>  <p>  In addition, nine specific sectors have been identified as areas on which regulatory cooperation work can be carried out and mutual gains achieved. These are cars, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, cosmetics, engineering, textiles, chemicals, pesticides, ICT. </p>  <p>  The EU and US work closely already in a number of areas. Air transport is one example of where common standards for safety and technical requirements are already in place, we have also agreed to recognise each other's organic food standards.  The ultimate objective of these initiatives is to avoid duplication and to find ways to make our systems work more smoothly. </p>  <p>  Regulatory compatibility and cooperation recognises the realities of globalisation and will make the trading landscape easier and more predictable. This will be particularly important in unlocking the potential of SMEs helping them to internationalise and grow exports as is reflected in my Department&rsquo;s recent report on the impacts of TTIP on Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-13a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051300041#WRA01000"><p>Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) 2015 was published in January this year and is the fourth in the multi-annual series of a whole of government approach to economic recovery, export growth and job creation. The Action Plan for Jobs set a target to increase employment by 100,000 by 2016 and we are well on track to achieve that figure this year, ahead of the target. Much work remains to be done however to replace all the jobs lost in the downturn, the target which we have set is to achieve sustainable full employment by 2018.  This will require enhanced focus on developing skills and capability on the competitiveness of our sectors; on new business start-up, on developing new opportunities and on anticipating threats to existing jobs. </p>  <p>  With this year&rsquo;s plan (APJ2015) we have embedded a new assessment framework, which will improve monitoring associated with our employment policies. This is in response to a suggestion by the OECD that one area of improvement for APJ was to more clearly link actions to outcomes. For the first time we will be able to assess how actions increase sales, stimulate the domestic economy (retail, construction, tourism, agri-food), improve skills, activation and startups, enhance productivity and R&amp;D, make doing business easier and cheaper, and enhance funding availability for SMEs. A full set of assessment metrics is set out in Annex 2 of APJ2015. As well as helping assess the effectiveness of the APJ, these metrics will also enhance monitoring of the jobs environment with a view to ensuring early detection of areas of risk or indeed opportunity.   </p>  <p>  My Department, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices work closely with individual enterprises to identify early warnings of difficulty, to seek to minimise job losses where possible and to develop responses to assist the enterprises get on a firmer footing for the future. </p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a dashboard of indicators which provide early indicators of changes occurring in areas critical to the developing environment which influences enterprise and jobs. This includes tracking of Labour Market data from the CSO and our various agencies but also trends in company formation, in purchasing managers indices, in company formation, in relation to indices of competitiveness etc. This early intelligence better inform our policy responses and longer-term strategies.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-13a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051300041#WRA01200"><p>I am advised by the Employment Appeals Tribunal that, currently, the average waiting time for a hearing before the Tribunal is 63 weeks. This has reduced from an average of 79.5 weeks in 2012 and every effort is being made to finalise cases on hand as efficiently as possible. The Tribunal indicate that there are currently approximately 3,500 cases on hand. There is likely to be a small number of cases, which may prove difficult to finalise in the short to medium term, including some cases adjourned, due to parallel High Court proceedings.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the current reform of Workplace Relations Services, the functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be transferred to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and the Labour Court insofar as first instance complaints and appeals respectively are concerned. The Employment Appeals Tribunal will continue to function for a limited period, after the establishment of the WRC, to finalise complaints and appeals which were lodged before commencement of the enabling legislation and will be dissolved on finalisation of those legacy cases.  The decision to extend the period of operation of the Tribunal beyond the establishment of the new framework is predicated on the assumption that complainants and respondents in matters referred to the EAT prior to the establishment of the WRC would have a legitimate expectation of having the case disposed of before a tripartite tribunal, sitting in public and operating with the degree of procedural formality currently applied by the EAT.</p>  <p>  With effect from the commencement of the enabling legislation, therefore, no new complaints or appeals will be presented to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, which will then be in a position to focus its resources on finalising legacy cases. My objective is to ensure that the Tribunal has the necessary resources to progress these cases to finality in an efficient and effective manner and within a reasonable timeframe.</p>  <p>  More efficient and effective receipt, registration and referral of workplace relations complaints has already led to the removal of the hearings backlog in certain cases, particularly in the case of the Rights Commissioner Service. My objective as part of the Reform Programme is to greatly reduce the waiting time for hearings by putting in place a target period of three months from the time of complaint to hearing. </p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that the Workplace Relations Commission will have the appropriate level of resources to ensure that waiting times are reduced and decisions issued on a timely basis. I am pleased to say that some 19 new Adjudication Officers, selected for appointment following an open competition conducted by the Public Appointments Service, will shortly complete an accredited training programme. These Adjudicators, together with the current cohort of Equality Officers and Rights Commissioners who will be appointed as WRC adjudicators, will be available for deployment on the establishment of the Workplace Relations Commission. The adjudication resources at the disposal of the Commission will, therefore, comprise a diverse group of experienced industrial relations and HR practitioners, employment lawyers and civil servants with appropriate skills and experience. </p>  <p>  Work is proceeding at an accelerated pace on progressing a comprehensive programme of work to ensure that our workplace relations services are business ready. This critical work includes the rationalisation of accommodation and hearings venues in conjunction with OPW on a phased basis, finalising arrangements for the introduction of compliance notices and fixed charge notices in support of inspection activities, the transitioning of e-business, the phasing out of ICT systems in line with the rationalisation of services and implementing the proposed Customer Relationship Management Solution to support complaints and adjudication management.</p></reply>

According to assessments made by the EU Commission and other European bodies, a comprehensive TTIP could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum bringing significant economic gains as a whole for the EU. This injection of economic activity will bring new job opportunities.  Based on EU Commission estimates, about 30 million jobs in the EU depend on sales to the rest of the world, and on average, each additional &euro;1 billion of exports supports 15,000 additional jobs across the EU.  That suggests that across the EU, an ambitious TTIP could generate 400,000 jobs.</p><p>The results of the study commissioned by my Department suggest that TTIP will be good for Ireland.  It estimates that the benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole. It suggests growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1% and increase in real wages of 1.5%. It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs. It also suggests that Irish small and medium enterprises (SMEs) will be particular beneficiaries.  </p><p>In relation to ISDS, the EU Commission has been working over the last few months on a number of areas by way of follow-up to its public consultation on ISDS.  These are: the protection of the right to regulate; the establishment and functioning of arbitral tribunals; the relationship between domestic judicial systems and Investor to State Dispute Settlement (ISDS); and the review of ISDS decisions for legal correctness through an appellate mechanism.  </p><p>Last week, the EU Commissioner for Trade, Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m, presented a concept paper to the EU Council of Ministers and to the EU Parliament&rsquo;s International Trade Committee.  The paper sets out ideas for reforming the current ISDS system, with the overall aim of creating a new modern system of investment arbitration.  The ideas include strengthening governments' right to regulate, making arbitral tribunals operate more like traditional court systems with a clear code of conduct for arbitrators, and guaranteeing access to an appeals system.  The paper can be found at: </p><p>I welcome the comprehensive work by the EU Commission in following up on the views expressed by stakeholders, and the ideas it has set out in the concept paper, which I will be carefully considering.</p></reply>

The recovery in jobs and exports to date is in large part due to the considerable improvement in competitiveness that has taken place in recent years. Prices and labour costs have grown less in Ireland than in our trading partners. Combined with the recent depreciation of the euro, this has seen Irish seen Irish competitiveness &ndash; as measured by the real effective exchange rate - recover most of the deterioration recorded during the boom years.</p>  <p>  Our improved competitiveness is reflected in our international rankings also. Since 2011, Ireland&rsquo;s rankings in both the IMD and WEF competitiveness reports has improved &ndash; from 24th to 15th in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook, and from 29th to 25th in the WEF Global Competitiveness Report. In the World Bank&rsquo;s Doing Business 2015 report, Ireland is ranked 13th out of 189.</p>  <p>  As noted in the Government&rsquo;s Spring Economic Statement, this recovery in competitiveness has facilitated a reallocation of resources towards the tradable sectors of the economy. Exports are now at an all-time high and total employment in IDA supported client companies grew to 174,000 in 2014 from a low of 145,000 in 2009.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland reported that client companies created 19,705 new jobs in 2014 &ndash; a net increase of 8,476. This is the highest net gain in the history of the agency and demonstrates clearly the direct impact that increasing exports has on jobs in Ireland. Enterprise Ireland supported companies now, account for total direct employment of 180,000 people- the highest recorded in the history of the agency. Significantly, EI clients recorded the lowest level of job losses since 2000.</p>  <p>  These successes are spread across manufacturing, services and R&amp;D activities.</p></reply>

The relevant provisions are contained in Part 2 of the Bill.</p>  <p>  Secondly, to put in place the legislative amendments to the Industrial Relations Acts 2001 and 2004 required to give effect to the Programme for Government commitment to reform the current law on employees' right to engage in collective bargaining (the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001), so as to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).

In this context, the new framework proposes a mechanism whereby, in future, at the request, separately or jointly from organisations substantially representative of employers and/or of workers, the Labour Court can initiate a review of the pay and pension and sick pay entitlements of workers in a particular sector and, if it deems it appropriate, make a recommendation to the Minister on the matter.

In 2014, NERA carried out over 5,500 such inspections including construction sites. The policy of NERA is to seek voluntary compliance where breaches of employment law are detected.  NERA work with employers and allow them every reasonable opportunity to rectify breaches.  Allegations of non-compliance with employment rights legislation should be referred to NERA who investigate matters brought to their attention.  </p>  <p>  It is not within the remit of NERA to make determinations regarding the employment status of individuals vis-&agrave;-vis employment or self-employment.

The appointment of UL follows a competitive tendering process.</p>  <p>  The key objectives of the study are:</p>  <p>  -  To fill the gap in knowledge that currently exists in terms of the hard data and information that is available concerning the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts in the Irish economy and the manner of their use.</p>  <p>  -  To assess the impact of zero hour and low hour contracts on employees.</p>  <p>  -  To enable the Minister to make any evidence-based policy recommendations to Government considered necessary on foot of the study.</p>  <p>  The study will have a broad scope, covering both the public and private sectors, with a particular focus on the retail, hospitality, education and health sectors. The study will examine how zero and low hour contracts operate in practice and how they impact on employees. It will assess the advantages and disadvantages from the perspective of employer and employee and assess the current employment rights legislation as it applies to employees on such contracts. The study will also consider recent developments in other jurisdictions, including the UK in particular. The study may also identify how the information gap might be addressed in the future. </p>  <p>  A wide range of stakeholders is being canvassed to contribute to the study and I expect the study to be completed in Q3. The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot anticipate the outcome of the study or the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the study&rsquo;s findings. However, the Deputy can rest assured that where the evidence points to some adjustment being required to the protections already in place under Irish employment law, these will be brought forward for consideration by Government.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Dunnes dispute, I continue to urge both parties to avail of the services of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery who remain available to assist the parties, if requested. It is my opinion that engagement with the State's industrial relations machinery offers the best way whereby the parties involved in this dispute can hope to resolve their differences. Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties to the dispute.  However, an early and fair settlement to this dispute is in the interest of all concerned. Last week the Government agreed the text of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015 which in addition to providing a replacement for the Registered Employment Agreement system, will provide an improved framework for workers who seek to better their terms and conditions where collective bargaining is not recognised by their employer.</p></reply>

Receivership is a remedy that derives from the courts of equity.  The law in relation to receivership is largely made up of rules which the courts have developed by applying general private contract law and equitable principles.</p>  <p>  The Companies Act, 2014, which will commence on 1 June 2015, substantially re-enacts the existing law on receivership. The most important change to the existing law is the codification of the powers of receivers in section 437 of the Act, which until now has been contained in case law. This change is in line with the position of other common law countries. </p>  <p>  Under the Companies Act, 2014 additional transparency and protection exists as the receiver has specific statutory duties under section 439 which provide that:</p>  <p>  -  receivers must achieve the best price reasonably obtainable at the time of sale; and</p>  <p>  -  the receiver must not sell by private contract a non-cash asset of a company to a person who is or who, within three years prior to the date of appointment of the receiver, has been, an officer of the company unless the Receiver has given 14 days notice of his intention to do so to all creditors of the company who are known to him or who have been intimated to him. </p>  <p>  Receivers also have a duty to provide certain information to the Registrar of Companies and the ODCE.  </p>  <p>  The Act also prevents certain persons from being appointed as Receivers (section 433), such as persons who are undischarged bankrupts and connected persons (parent spouse etc of an officer of the company), among others.  Breach of a receiver&rsquo;s statutory duties may result in the receiver being held personally liable for any loss incurred.  </p>  <p>  As part of its Work Programme 2014 - 2016 the Company Law Review Group will be examining the area of receivership law and I look forward to receiving its Report in due course.</p></reply>

IDA Ireland&rsquo;s core mandate is to see this huge economic contribution expand further for the benefit of all the citizens of Ireland. </p>  <p>  In that context, IDA Ireland has a central role in the business and economic life of Ireland and in furthering the goals of creating long-term, sustainable employment for the citizens of Ireland.</p>  <p>  As a result IDA Ireland is asked regularly, often in public, to give its views on topical business issues linked to FDI, particularly those bearing directly on employment, the sourcing of talent and more broadly, Ireland&rsquo;s international brand image.</p>  <p>  In that context, IDA has commented over many years on a wide range of issues, including Irish and international economic performance, taxation, property, competitiveness, International and European relations, educational issues, talent attraction and issues relating to infrastructure and utilities.</p>  <p>  The IDA Ireland Chief Executive Officer Martin Shanahan conducted a recent business interview with the Irish Times and during that interview, covering a range of topics, was asked about the marriage equality referendum and views expressed on this subject in public by IDA&rsquo;s client companies. </p>  <p>  As made clear by the CEO in this lengthy interview, IDA Ireland has not campaigned on the marriage equality referendum and is an &lsquo;apolitical&rsquo; organisation. However in the context outlined above, the CEO of IDA felt it appropriate to respond to the questions asked on the likely repercussions internationally and in a business sense of a No vote and equally on the likely repercussions of a Yes vote.</p>  <p>  IDA has not devoted any public financial resources to the referendum campaign and no discussions were held between IDA Ireland and my Department on this issue. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, promoting a Yes vote in the marriage equality referendum on 22nd May is Government policy.  We firmly believe that this is a matter of equality, and that we should all have the right to marry the person we love, and we are attempting to convince the people of that case in advance of the vote.  </p>  <p>  Clearly there is a prohibition on the use of public funds to promote a particular outcome in a referendum and there are systems in place to ensure that this is adhered to. </p>  <p>  I strongly believe that a Yes vote on 22nd May would be good for Ireland.  I will be strongly making that case on the doorsteps and in the media between now and 22nd May.</p></reply>

This includes &euro;150 million for an IDA property investment programme to attract foreign direct investment into the regions, and &euro;100 million to Enterprise Ireland to support indigenous enterprises to start up, grow and export.  As part of IDA&rsquo;s capital investment programme, a total of nine locations were identified in the recent announcement as headline investments to occur in the period 2015-2017 - including facilities at Galway and Castlebar within the West Region.  The Enterprise Ireland funds will be distributed through three new competitive calls which will be announced by Enterprise Ireland over the coming months.  Funding will be allocated to the best ideas across the regions. Tangible jobs impact, enterprise start-up and scaling are amongst the criteria against which applications will be measured.

Investing in economic infrastructure to underpin employment growth has been one of the key priorities of the Action Plan for Jobs since its inception in 2012. Despite the economic downturn this Government has continued to prioritise investment in key infrastructures and as set out in the 2015 Spring Economic Statement is committed to infrastructure investment to underpin future growth and the Public Capital Programme will be published over the coming months.</p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are continually engaged with relevant stakeholders on the particular infrastructure needs required to support enterprise development and job creation.  The stakeholders include other Government Departments, regulatory bodies and public and private infrastructure providers.  In addition, I am a member of the Economic Infrastructure and Climate Change Cabinet Committee.  Officials from my Department are members of the relevant Inter-departmental Committees. </p>  <p>  As the country returns to growth, further targeted investment and reform is required to address existing and likely infrastructural bottlenecks which could constrain growth in the economy by dampening productivity growth, increasing costs and limiting sectoral opportunities for foreign direct investment (FDI) and indigenous enterprise development.  However, given the constraints on Government finances, capital investment in the short term must remain highly targeted and support our broad economic development objectives. In this context, I announced earlier this year as part of the Action Plan for Jobs an investment programme of &euro;150m over five years by my Department through IDA Ireland in utility intensive sites to help attract more multinational jobs to the regions. </p>  <p>  My Department (and previously through Forf&aacute;s) assesses Ireland&rsquo;s performance in meeting the infrastructure needs (energy, telecoms, transport, waste and water) of enterprise on a frequent basis.  For example, in June 2014, Forf&aacute;s made a submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s review of capital investment outlining the main capital priorities for the period to 2020 to support enterprise development and job creation.  The review, which will focus on infrastructural investment consistent with the Government&rsquo;s economic and social priorities including the investments that would best support economic recovery and social progress, is to be published next month.</p>  <p>  There is also significant scope for Government to improve infrastructure capacity and deliver more cost effective, higher quality services to business users without the need for Exchequer investment by addressing policy and regulatory barriers.  It is critically important to put in place the right policy and regulatory framework to give investors the confidence to commit to long-term projects, and ensure the supply chain has the certainty and tools it needs to deliver effectively.  For example, as part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, I requested Forf&aacute;s to undertake a study to identify changes in the operation of sectoral regulators that would enhance cost competitiveness, which informed the Government Policy Statement on Economic Regulation, published in July 2013.</p></reply>

While the NCC report, prepared under the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, finds that Ireland is an expensive location in which to do business, it also finds that costs have fallen across a range of business inputs since 2009, making Ireland more competitive internationally. This is reflected in our ongoing ability to successfully compete internationally for trade and investment and in our improving performance across a range of international competitiveness benchmarking reports &ndash; we have moved from 24th to 15th  in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook, for example. </p>  <p>  In the longer term productivity performance must be the vehicle through which we must improve our competitiveness and grow the economy. Relentlessly pursuing cost competitiveness remains vital to us as a small, export oriented economy is important but we must also sustain our focus on productivity growth across all sectors of the economy. </p>  <p>  Structural reform, as championed through the Action Plan for Jobs, is essential to deliver the necessary productivity gains and improvements in competitiveness.  Such reforms are essential to improving the competitiveness of our exporting sectors, which will be at the heart of delivering on our ambition of having full employment by 2018.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, it is critical that all Government policy reflects the Council&rsquo;s underlying message that policies which enhance Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness position, reward productivity and develop productive infrastructure capacity are of foremost importance.</p></reply>

The appointment of UL follows a competitive tendering process.   The key objectives of the study are:</p>  <p>  -  To fill the gap in knowledge that currently exists in terms of the hard data and information that is available concerning the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts in the Irish economy and the manner of their use.</p>  <p>  -  To assess the impact of zero hour and low hour contracts on employees.</p>  <p>  -  To enable the Minister to make any evidence-based policy recommendations to Government considered necessary on foot of the study.</p>  <p>  The study will have a broad scope, covering both the public and private sectors, with a particular focus on the retail, hospitality, education and health sectors. The study will examine how zero and low hour contracts operate in practice and how they impact on employees. It will assess the advantages and disadvantages from the perspective of employer and employee and assess the current employment rights legislation as it applies to employees on such contracts. The study will also consider recent developments in other jurisdictions, including the UK in particular. The study may also identify how the information gap might be addressed in the future. </p>  <p>  A wide range of stakeholders is being canvassed to contribute to the study and I expect the study to be completed in Q3. The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot anticipate the outcome of the study or the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the study&rsquo;s findings. However, the Deputy can rest assured that where the evidence points to some adjustment being required to the protections already in place under Irish employment law, these will be brought forward for consideration by Government.</p>  <p>  In relation to part-time workers and short-term contracts, Irish employment rights legislation contains strong safeguards for part-time workers. The Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 implemented EU Council Directive 97/81/EC into Irish law.  The purpose of the Directive was to implement the Framework Agreement on part-time work concluded by the European cross-industry organisations UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC. The Act provides a wide degree of protection for part-time employees, including the general protection that a part-time employee shall not be treated in a less favourable manner in respect of his/her conditions of employment than a full time employee.  </p>  <p>  Section 13(5) of the 2001 Act contained provisions in relation to the preparation and publishing of a Code of Practice by the Labour Relations Commission in relation to the steps that could be taken by employers for the purposes of Clause 5.3 of the Framework Agreement. Clause 5.3 of the Framework Agreement provided that, as far as possible, an employer should give consideration to a request by workers to transfer from full-time work to part-time and vice-versa.  The Labour Relations Commission prepared this Code of Practice, based on the provisions in Section 13 of the 2001 Act, following consultation with the social partners.  It was deemed to be a Code of Practice and implemented, in 2006, by the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Access to Part-Time Working) (Declaration) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 8 of 2006).  Under Section 42(4) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990, the Code is admissible in evidence in any proceedings before a Court, the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Equality Tribunal. </p>  <p>  The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 provides that fixed-term employees may not be treated less favourably than comparable permanent employees, unless the employer can objectively justify the different treatment. Any justification offered cannot be connected with the fact that the employee is on a fixed-term contract.  </p>  <p>  The 2003 Act also establishes a framework to prevent abuses arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts.  The Act provides that where an employee has been on two or more continuous fixed-term contracts, the total duration of those contracts may not exceed four years. After this, if the employer wishes to renew the employee&rsquo;s contract, it must be an open-ended contract unless there are objective grounds justifying the renewal of the contract for a fixed term only. </p>  <p>  The Unfair Dismissal Act 1977 as amended contains a provision aimed at ensuring that successive temporary contracts are not used in order to avoid that legislation. It provides that where a fixed-term or specified-purpose contract expires and the individual is re-employed within 3 months, the individual is deemed to have continuous service for the purposes of that Act.</p></reply>

Increasing entrepreneurial activity is a Disruptive Reform in the Action Plan for Jobs for 2015. Our key priority is driving implementation of the actions in the National Entrepreneurship Statement, which was published in October last year and to achieve the ambitions targets set out for a 25% increase in the number of start-ups and in the scaling and sustainability of new enterprises.    The launch of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) was a major reform delivered in 2014 and the clients of the LEOs increased employment by 4,012 last year to 31,326 jobs throughout the country. In 2015 the LEOs will have ambitious and robust county strategies and targets for start-ups, enterprise engagements and supports to be effective first-stop-shops for enterprise information and supports and launch an Entrepreneur Partnering Programme. </p>  <p>  My Department through its agencies will build on the 2014 success of the awards programmes such as Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur with a renewed programme for 2015.</p>  <p>  When it comes to promoting prosperity through job creation, the role of new entrepreneurs can hardly be overstated, with two-thirds of new jobs created by firms in their first five years. Enterprise Ireland works to increase the number of companies starting-up, succeeding, expanding, exporting and ultimately creating jobs in Ireland. EI&rsquo;s support system for young companies includes help with business planning, mentoring and development advice, feasibility funding and finance, often in the form of equity investment, as appropriate to the founder&rsquo;s ambitions and the company&rsquo;s potential and stage of growth. Enterprise Ireland has set itself an ambitious target of 550 new and early start-ups supported by 2016.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s ten regional offices work closely with entrepreneurs, local development agencies and local representative bodies offering a wide range of supports for entrepreneurship. Building on the success achieved to date on the Competitive Feasibility Funds, EI will launch four targeted funds during the year in the West, Midlands, MidEast, and one sectoral fund. </p>  <p>  Early stage companies continue to face difficulties in accessing the necessary funding required to develop and to enable entrepreneur&rsquo;s to achieve their vision for their company. Enterprise Ireland also continues to support the development of the Seed and Venture Capital and Business Angel sectors to increase the provision of early stage funding to support entrepreneurs and early stage companies. A further call for expressions of interest under the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2013-2018 will be issued by the end of Q2. </p>  <p>  In many cases the lack of a first reference sale is a key barrier to accessing funding at an early stage.  Early intervention through entrepreneur development programmes such as New Frontiers and others workshops and accelerator programmes helps companies accelerate their business development and to build up the skills and contacts needed to successfully start and grow. EI will support 130 new Entrepreneurs via the New Frontiers programme in 2015. </p>  <p>  The launch of the simplified Startup Refunds for Entrepreneurs Scheme (SURE) in 2015 will provide additional finance for entrepreneurs. A range of agricultural related measures are being implemented including steps to maximise available agricultural land with measures to encourage long term leasing. We are also continuing to supporting the tourism sector with retention of 9% VAT rate. More broadly improvements in personal taxation will benefit the self-employed and entrepreneurs and support growth in demand across the economy.</p></reply>

Another round is expected in mid-July 2015. In addition, inter-sessional discussions will also be organised between formal rounds. The objective during these rounds is to make as much progress as possible in all areas of the negotiations.</p>  <p>  During the last Round, work advanced in all three pillars of the negotiations: market access, regulatory cooperation and rules. On market access, the discussions were technical, aimed at better understanding the respective tariff offers and issues around government procurement.  Regulatory issues took up a lot of the time, with a focus on both horizontal co-operation as well as the 9 specific sectors [cars, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, cosmetics, engineering, textiles, chemicals, pesticides, ICT]. The regulatory discussions are aimed at enhancing transatlantic trade by reinforcing regulatory co-operation in areas of shared interest and cutting out overlapping, unnecessary red-tape.  The discussions in the area of rules included sustainable development, and energy and raw materials.  SMEs were also discussed in the last Round, specifically, how SMEs might benefit from TTIP.  A Report released by the EU Commission at the start of the week of the last Round, which identifies perceived obstacles to trade for SMEs, will inform the EU approach in this area.</p>  <p>  The definitive time-frame is difficult to predict but it is expected that there will be substantial progress in these negotiations in 2015.</p>  <p>  According to assessments made by the EU Commission, a comprehensive TTIP could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum bringing significant economic gains as a whole for the EU.  This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU.  Right across the range of issues covered by TTIP, I will ensure we are best positioned to make the most from these and other trade and investment opportunities in order to maximise any potential benefits for Irish companies and citizens.</p>  <p>  The study commissioned by my Department estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole. It suggests growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1% and increase in real wages of 1.5%. It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs. It also suggests that Irish small and medium enterprises (SMEs) will be particular beneficiaries.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the TTIP negotiations will be assisted by the indications from this study, which also includes areas of potential sensitivity.  Our priorities include advancing regulatory cooperation and common rules which aim to make trade and investment easier especially for SMEs, and protecting our interests in any sensitive areas, including beef.  </p>  <p>  Ireland supports the Commission in these negotiations which aim to achieve an ambitious and comprehensive agreement contributing to growth and jobs both here and the EU.  I will continue to promote our objective for a comprehensive, balanced agreement for the benefit of the long term development of our country.</p></reply>

I will continue to pursue relevant and appropriate initiatives through the North South Ministerial Council.</p><p>I strongly believe that it is important to continue building on what has already been achieved in the region by the relevant State bodies and by local authorities on both sides of the border.  The work of the Cross Border Body, <i>InterTrade Ireland,</i>has been foremost in this regard, with a significant range of enterprise development initiatives and programmes in place. My Department jointly funds and provides oversight to this Body, together with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Belfast and it represents a very effective mechanism for tackling business development on an all-island basis. In addition, there is on-going co-operation between <i>Enterprise Ireland</i>and its Northern Ireland counterpart agency, <i>Invest Northern Ireland</i>on areas of mutual interest.</p><p>A further useful mechanism has been the work of organisations such as <i>the Irish Central Border Area Network,</i>the <i>North West Region Cross Border Group</i><font color="#2F2F2F"> </font>and <i>East Border Region Ltd.</i>These organisations involve local authorities on both sides of the border working together to pursue the specific needs of communities in their regions.  They have the experience and local knowledge to assist with driving future development strategies of mutual interest.  Indeed, the projects led by such groups, and others, under the Enterprise Development theme of the INTERREG IVA Programme (2009-2015), have made a significant impact on developing small businesses in the region.My Department co-funds the Enterprise Development strand of this INTERREG Programme, under which a total of 28 individual projects have been initiated. In addition, my Department has been involved in the planning process for the next strand of the INTERREG Programme for the period up to 2020, which has recently been formally approved by the EU, and we will continue to financially support this programme.</p><p>The concept of a specific Border Development Zone as a means of fostering economic recovery in the cross-border region of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland was the main theme of a conference organised by the <i>Centre for Cross Border Studies </i>(CCBS) and the <i>International Centre for Local and Regional Development </i>(ICLRD) in 2014. This follows the development of this concept in the CCBS-sponsored Bradley/Best economic study of 2012 and I am aware that the CCBS has undertaken further research on the topic in the intervening period also.</p><p>The concept of initiating a Border Development Zone in the border region is an interesting proposal.  However it could raise significant issues involving EU State Aid Rules and other EU provisions and it would also, of course, require detailed negotiations between both Administrations on this island.  There would also, almost certainly, be significant resource issues, which would be challenging in the current financial environment.  For these reasons, and while I will of course keep abreast of the ongoing research by the CCBS, I do not envisage the establishment of such a zone as being practical or realistic at this time, especially given the existing,  well-developed arrangements which are in place, as set out above.</p></reply>

It is important also to acknowledge the natural time lag between a decision being made to invest and that investment coming on stream.   The time lag can be between 3 and 5 years in some cases.  That time is required for such activities as locating and acquiring a suitable site for the company&rsquo;s operations, constructing a facility, installing machinery and the recruitment and training of suitable staff.</p>  <p>  The level of investment coming on stream is best captured in the number of jobs created in any given year as recorded in the Annual Employment Survey which shows that employment in IDA Ireland client companies in Donegal rose from 2,387 in 2013 to 2,612 in 2014 an increase of over 9%.</p></reply>

A consultation paper was then prepared as a scene setter which provided details of the current position in relation to the range of relevant issues including, inter alia, investment in Science, Technology and Innovation for economic and societal benefit, the development of human capital, the transfer of knowledge into jobs, delivering research excellence, and the value of international collaboration to Ireland.</p>  <p>  The detailed consultation paper was circulated by the IDC on 13th February 2015 with the views of stakeholders sought by the closing date of 23rd  March 2015. The consultation paper was also posted on the websites of IDC members. In advance of the consultation paper being issued, I met with each of the heads of the Universities and with the IoTI RD&amp;I Group and DIT&rsquo;s Head of Research, and to get their views and to invite their formal written submissions following issue of the paper.</p>  <p>  While the deadline has not been extended, my Department has been very flexible in the approach taken with regard to the closing date for receipt of submissions. More than half of the total of 80 submissions received were accepted after the original deadline had passed, the latest having been received on 7th  May &ndash; giving a total of 12 weeks since the publication of the consultation paper which in my view is more than adequate.  Each of these submissions is being considered in detail by my Department and, in due course, by the Interdepartmental Committee.  Following this analysis, stakeholders will also be invited to attend a consultative workshop designed to address key issues arising from the written consultation phase and the ongoing work of the Committee. This comprehensive approach to consultation will ensure that the full range of stakeholders&rsquo; views will be proactively considered in the formulation of the new Strategy. </p></reply>

This Group has met regularly and provided a coordinated approach to the needs of the affected staff and is ensuring that all necessary steps are put in train to pursue an alternative employer.  </p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing work Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland continue to fully engage with their existing client companies and, in the case of the IDA, with prospective new international investors, to market the facility and especially to make them aware of the skilled pool of former staff.</p>  <p>  There have been a small number of preliminary enquiries about the facility, both from foreign owned and Irish owned businesses but it is too early in the process to be specific about their potential.</p>  <p>  It is noteworthy that Government has had considerable success in driving job creation in the Border Region, which includes County Leitrim. Since Q3 2012 the unemployment rate has fallen from 17.7% to 10% as of Q 4 2014, and the rate in the West Region, which includes Roscommon, has shown an almost similar fall,  to now stand at 10.2%.  While still unacceptably high, this reduction represents very substantial progress and I am driving this improvement with the advent of the new Regional Enterprise Strategies. These will be developed following consultation with key stakeholders at regional level and on the analysis of the strengths of each region.  All will include specific actions for all the enterprise development organisations and other public bodies active in each region, to promote enterprise growth and job creation. Of course specific issues and factors relevant to particular regions, such as the MBNA closure, will be fully embraced in the new Strategies.</p></reply>

I know that in similar situations in the past, the parties have facilitated access to commercially sensitive information such as company accounts. It is a matter for the parties in each dispute to decide however.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, whether in redundancy or other collective disputes, rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement to support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences.</p>  <p>  Even what often appears to be the most intractable of disputes is capable of resolution where both sides engage constructively and in good faith in this voluntary process. The principle of good faith implies that both sides in a dispute make every effort to reach an agreement and endeavour, through genuine and constructive negotiations, to resolve their differences.</p></reply>

In Budget 2015, my colleague the Minister for Finance, Mr Michael Noonan, TD, signalled the start of a multi-year programme of income tax reform to address these issues.</p><p>In relation to access to social welfare supports for the self-employed, I have been informed by my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, under whose remit this issue arises, that self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory) as well as guardians payment (contributory), maternity benefit and adoptive benefit.  Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI class A.  </p><p>Self-employed workers may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  </p><p>In the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed, published in September 2013, it was noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance between 2009 and 2011 received payment. It recommends that social insurance for the self-employed should be extended on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  This recommendation will be further considered by the Minister for Social Protection taking into account the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund and the views of industry who have concerns about rising costs.</p><p>In relation to my area of responsibility the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first port of call in terms of advice, information, mentoring, training and, subject to eligibility criteria, grant support for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business.  Where appropriate the LEOs will refer clients to other State Agencies or Government Departments for advice on supports such as the Start-up Refunds for Entrepreneurs (SURE), Microfinance Ireland, the Credit Guarantee Scheme and<font color="#2F2F2F"> </font>the Credit Review Office.</p><p>Businesses can also access the online search tool for SME business supports that was launched last year.

The pension is paid to the husband or wife of a deceased person and is available to those who satisfy the necessary PRSI contribution conditions, either on their own record or on that of the deceased spouse, provided the applicant is not cohabiting.  A claimant may also qualify for an increase for a qualified child as part of the conditions of this PRSI contribution based scheme.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify, either the person claiming or their spouse or civil partner must have:</p>  <p>  -	At least 260 paid contributions paid before the relevant date (which is either the date of the bereavement or the 66th birthday of one of the spouses, depending on the basis of qualification), and</p>  <p>  -	An average of 39 paid or credited contributions in either the 3 or 5 years before the death of the spouse or civil partner or before he or she reached pension age (66), or</p>  <p>  -	A yearly average of at least 24 paid or credited contributions from the year of first entry into insurance until the year of death or reaching pension age. If this average is used then an average of 24 will entitle a person to a minimum payment, they will need an average of 48 per year to get the full pension. </p>  <p>  For those who do not meet the qualifying condition of such a contributory payment, they may apply for a means-tested Widow&rsquo;s or Widower&rsquo;s (non-contributory) pension, which may be payable to those who are under 66 and who do not satisfy the social insurance conditions. This is a payment for widows, widowers or surviving civil partners who do not have dependent children, and who have not reached State pension age.  If the person has qualified children, they may instead qualify for the means-tested one-parent family payment (OFP). </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note the  phased one-parent family payment (OFP) scheme age change reforms were introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, to reduce long-term social welfare dependency by ending the expectation that lone parents will remain outside of the workforce indefinitely.  The final phase of the one-parent family payment scheme age change reforms will be taking place on 2 July, 2015, when the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which a one-parent family payment ceases will be reduced to 7 years for all recipients.  Prior to these reforms lone parents could have been on the scheme until their youngest child turned 18 years of age (or 22 years of age if they were in full time education). </p>  <p>  However, there is an exemption to these reforms for recipients who are recently bereaved.  In these circumstances the One-Parent Family Payment will be payable for two years from the date of death of the spouse/civil partner/co-habitant or until the youngest child reaches age 18, whichever occurs first.  If after the two years has elapsed and the person continues to have an income support need, they will either remain on the one-parent family payment, move to the jobseeker's transitional payment or to the jobseeker's allowance (JA) depending on the age of their youngest child, in the same way as any other lone parent.</p></reply>

Monaghan were redeployed from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the Department of Social Protection in July 2012. The staff are engaged in the processing of the Public Services Card.  The current facilities are not considered appropriate for the existing business processes or to accommodate the recently expanded operation.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that the Office of Public Works have investigated all of the options in Ballybay and have inspected a number of properties, with a view to adapting a number of buildings to meet the Department of Social Protection's requirements. The position is that a significant investment would be required to bring the proposed properties up to modern standards. In addition, other technical surveys and reports, planning permission, fire certification and physical works would take approximately one year to complete. Unfortunately, this timeframe is not commensurate with the Department's business requirements and the need to establish a Public Service Card Centre in the County, which is badly needed and is now an urgent requirement.  Consequently, neither my officials, nor the OPW, consider that the properties on offer in Ballybay could meet the requirements in terms of both cost and time and a decision has been made to move the current facilities to Monaghan Town and combine it with a public, customer facing facility to serve the people of Monaghan.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. </p>  <p>  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  The rate at which a State pension (contributory) is paid at is determined by the average number of contributions paid or credited per year, with tiered rates applying in respect of bands of contributions. For example, to qualify for the maximum personal rate, a person requires a yearly average of 48 or more contributions per year. </p>  <p>  While new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced from September 2012, it was already the case that bands existed for different levels of contribution, and that some people qualified for a higher rate of pension on the State pension (non-contributory).  Therefore, this is not a new development.  A person who qualifies for a reduced rate of SPC below the maximum SPNC rate does so because, in addition to their SPC, they have additional means over and above that contributory pension.  If they did not, they would instead be paid the higher SPNC rate.  Accordingly, they are not worse off as a result of paying their contributions and the PRSI system continues to provide good value for such workers.</p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the State pension (contributory), men have been more likely to have a complete social insurance record than women, and yet, all of the main poverty indicators show that women over 65 experience poverty at the same or lower levels than men of the same age, despite many women having lower lifetime earnings than men.  This is a result of the social protection system which awards entitlements based on contributions to the Social Insurance Fund by the claimant or his or her spouse, and provides assistance where people have no such PRSI record.  Those with lower earnings and those with lesser contribution histories continue to obtain the best value for money from the Social Insurance Fun, e.g., a person with an average of only 20 contributions per year (i.e. 38% of the maximum) can receive a State pension of &euro;196, i.e., a higher rate than the full rate in 2007. </p>  <p>  It is not possible to state to what extent, if any, women were disadvantaged by the changes made in 2012 to new entrants to the State pension (contributory), as most of those whose State pension (contributory) entitlement would have been reduced, and these include both men and women, would have had access to other benefits.  Such benefits would be either derived from their spouse&rsquo;s contribution record, such as the widow&rsquo;s pension (contributory) or qualified adult increase on his pension, or in their own right, such as the State pension (non-contributory). </p>  <p>  Over time, there has been a very significant increase in female participation in the workforce, and this will impact on the gender profile of the various benefits claimed under the Irish pensions system.</p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;219, or just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory). Alternatively, if a person&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just less than 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory).</p></reply>

Most importantly the SBCI commenced lending to businesses in the real economy through AIB and Bank of Ireland at the start of March 2015. SMEs have already begun to access SBCI funds to grow and develop their businesses. More lending partners will join with the SBCI throughout the course of 2015 increasing choice for SMEs and driving competition in the markets for SME credit.</p><p>Eurostat determined that the SBCI should be classified in the general government sector from its inception in 2014. Further information regarding this decision can be located on Eurostat's website</p><p>As with any body classified in the general government sector, any borrowing undertaken by the SBCI from external third parties is included in general government debt. As the borrowing will be subsequently lent on to other parties, this is considered a loan asset and will be included in the calculation of net debt. The surplus or deficit of the SBCI will count towards the general government balance. The impact of the SBCI in the context of the overall general government balance is negligible.  </p><p>The SBCI has been included in the March 2015 EDP return prepared by the Central Statistics Office. The SBCI has also been included in the general government forecasts published by my Department in the Spring Economic Statement and Stability Programme Update of April 2015.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-13a.172.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051300043#WRC03100"><p>My understanding of shadow economy (or black market) activity is that it is wide-ranging and it includes, not only illicit activity such as tobacco smuggling, oil laundering and counterfeiting, but also practices (much of which are facilitated within the cash economy) carried out by businesses such as suppressing sales and purchases, keeping cash payments 'off the books' and paying employees under an 'off the books' arrangement.  Also within the shadow economy are those who are working while at the same time claiming social welfare benefits. </p>  <p>  Individuals and businesses that operate within the shadow economy gain an unfair competitive advantage compared to legitimate, tax compliant businesses and they deprive the Exchequer of much needed revenues.  The Deputy will be aware that I have introduced a number of specific measures in recent years aimed at countering the effects of shadow economy activity.  These include:</p>  <p>  -	the licensing regime for auto fuel traders which was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market;</p>  <p>  -	a new licensing regime for marked fuel traders which was introduced in October 2012 and which is designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering;</p>  <p>  -	requirements in relation to fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries to ensure data is available to Revenue assist in supply chain analysis;</p>  <p>  -	a 'reckless trading' provision in Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that makes a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty evaded;</p>  <p>  -	strengthened provisions in the Finance Act 2014 to permit Revenue to refuse or revoke a mineral oil trader's licence where the trader does not comply with excise law, does not maintain adequate stock management systems and records, or provides false or misleading information. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied as regards Revenue's commitment to tackling shadow economy activity.  That commitment is evidenced by the following key statistics for 2014 that were recently published in the Commissioners' Annual Report for that year:</p>  <p>  -	over 437,000 compliance interventions yielding over &euro;610 million;</p>  <p>  -	6,158 drug seizures and seizure of 201,140 litres of illicit fuel;</p>  <p>  -	Seizure if 53.4 million cigarettes and 9,824 kg of tobacco, valued at &euro;25.47 million and &euro;4.22 million respectively.</p>  <p>  The Commissioners' Annual Report also highlights the significant programme of work that is ongoing and aimed at specific aspects of the shadow economy including detection of fiscal fraud, smuggling and illegal drugs as well as targeting sectors of the economy that traditionally have been susceptible to shadow activity, specifically cash businesses such as the hospitality sector and white collar cash.I am satisfied that there is a high level of co-operation and joint working between the various State agencies who are charged with tackling the shadow economy and that the arrangements in place at an operational level are working effectively.</p>  <p>  There is extensive co-operation between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trades of tobacco and oil smuggling and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border groups to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for large proportions of these illicit markets.  There is also strong collaboration between Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the National Employment Rights Authority as evidenced by joint operations in relevant sectors focusing on compliance in relation to employment taxes.  I am also informed that the Revenue website has recently been extended to include a shadow economy webpage where information to report such activity is provided.  Any information as regards shadow economy activity can be reported to Revenue, either via the Revenue website or directly (including anonymously) to any Revenue office.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly recently published a report on Cross-border Police Cooperation and illicit trade.  The report found that:</p>  <p>  -	the current level of cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI was excellent with evidence that both police forces worked closely together, formally and informally, on many issues.</p>  <p>  -	the joint Cross-border Policing Strategy, first launched in 2010, has contributed to the detection of criminal activity and better public safety across the island of Ireland by enhancing the policing capabilities of both police services.</p>  <p>  -	the Committee welcomed the development of the multi-agency Cross-border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group and the Cross-border Tobacco Fraud Enforcement Group since its last inquiry.</p>  <p>  Having regard to the legislative measures in place, the on-going work and focus of the Revenue Commissioners in tackling shadow economy activity in all its manifestations and the significant on-going cross-border cooperation between agencies, I do not propose to establish a special task force to tackle the shadow economy on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that consumers retain the protections they had prior to the sale of their loan.  This Bill will require entities dealing with the consumer to be authorised by the Central Bank and subject to its Codes of Conduct. Dealing with the consumer is credit servicing and the definition of credit servicing is broad. Owners of loan books who deal directly with consumers, that is, who are servicing their own loan books, will be regulated. Otherwise they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm. </p>  <p>  The Bill was published in January and second stage of the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il on 4 February. Since then, my officials have been in contact with the Central Bank and with the Office of the Attorney General to further progress the legislation. The Bill will continue its progress through the legislative process and I look forward to further discussion of the Bill at Committee Stage which has been set for 27 May.</p></reply>

Furthermore, at the start of 2013 the Central Bank had three applications for authorisation in progress. During 2013, the Central Bank received a further two applications and during 2014 the Central Bank received a further three applications. Of these eight applications, three applications were returned to applicants due to dormancy (i.e. absence of response from the applicant for 6 months or more), one was withdrawn by the applicant, two were authorised and the reminaing two continue to be processed.</p><p>As part of my role as Minister I meet with a wide range of members of the public and representatives of industry, some of which may outline regulatory issues which they have encountered. In the context of my responsibility to ensure an effective legislative framework for financial regulation I may from time to time raise certain issues in discussion with the Central Bank of Ireland or elsewhere. Furthermore, under Section 32L of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended, the Central Bank is required to prepare an Annual Performance Statement relating to its performance in regulating financial services. In that context, my Department is currently working with the Central Bank in seeking to improve the parameters for reporting on performance contained in that Performance Statement.</p><p>I note that, as set out in 'IFS 2020: A strategy for Ireland's International Financial Services Sector', in an Irish context 'the Payments Industry is a highly successful sub-sector of the International Financial Services Industry which has seen considerable growth in recent years'. Officials within my Department strive to ensure that the regulations which are in place operate as envisaged and in this regard they continue to monitor the appropriate legislation. </p><p>Finally, I welcome the recent political agreement which was reached on the proposal for a revised Payment Services Directive with the conclusion of trilogue negotiations.</p><p><b>Appendix 1</b></p><p><b>List of Payment Institutions authorised in Ireland 1.</b><table><tr><th>Payment Institution</th><th>Trading as</th><th>Date of Authorisation </th></tr><tr><td>CBN Ireland Remittance Centre Limited</td><td>CBN Remittance Centre</td><td>29 Apr 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Chase Paymentech Europe Limited</td><td>Chase Paymentech Europe Limited</td><td>01 Nov 2009</td></tr><tr><td>CurrencyFair Limited</td><td>CurrencyFair Limited</td><td>08 Apr 2010</td></tr><tr><td>CUSOP (Payments) Limited</td><td>CUSOP</td><td>01 Nov 2013</td></tr><tr><td>EU Money Transfer Limited</td><td>EU Money Transfer Limited</td><td>01 Feb 2010</td></tr><tr><td>FEXCO Corporate Payments</td><td>FEXCO Corporate Payments</td><td>01 Nov 2009</td></tr><tr><td>Fire Financial Services Limited</td><td>Fire Financial Services</td><td>04 Jun 2010</td></tr><tr><td>First Merchant Processing (Ireland) Ltd</td><td>AIB Merchant Services</td><td>01 Nov 2009</td></tr><tr><td>InterPay Limited</td><td>Transfermate</td><td>29 Apr 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Primafinance Limited</td><td>PrimaFinance Debt Solutions</td><td>11 Dec 2013</td></tr><tr><td>Western Union Payment Services Ireland Limited</td><td>Western Union Payment Services<br /><br />Ireland Limited</td><td>01 Nov 2009</td></tr></table></p><p>1.

Up until the introduction of this Scheme individuals exporting vehicles had no way of recouping the residual VRT contained in the vehicle. An administration charge of &euro;500 was initially necessary in order to recoup the significant investment necessary in setting up the technological platforms for operating the refund scheme and the interface with the third party to which the export examinations have been outsourced.</p>  <p>  However, now that the necessary systems are in place and the scheme is operating effectively, I believe that there is an opportunity to reconsider the level of the charge with a view to a reduction in the context of this year's Finance Bill process. I will instruct my officials to examine the level at which the administration charge is set. Any new rate at which the administration charge may be set must continue to reflect the significant ongoing administrative and enforcement costs of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  The administrative charge raised &euro;728,000 in 2014. </p></reply>

Interest can only be deducted during the period in which the property is let and the deductibility of interest in computing taxable rental income from residential property (insofar as it would otherwise be allowable) is limited to 75% of such interest.Information on interest relief for rental property is based on all claims for such relief in tax returns: Form 11 or Form 12 for individual taxpayers. Interest relief associated with corporate landlords is not captured on the relevant corporation tax CT1 return and is therefore not available.Based on personal income tax returns filed for 2010 to 2012, the latest year available, the estimated amount of tax foregone by allowing a deduction for interest on borrowings to be offset against rental income is as shown in the following table. This includes the cost for both residential and commercial properties. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Cost &euro; million</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>672</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>691</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>577</td></tr></table></p><p>These estimates are based on assuming that tax relief was allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% (the applicable rate in the years in question) and the figures provided could, therefore, be regarded as the maximum Exchequer cost in respect of those taxpayers. </p><p>In respect of Question 18858/15, it is assumed the Deputy is proposing to increase the 75% limit to 100%. In that regard, the Deputy should be aware that the estimated full year saving arising from the restriction of the interest deduction to 75% when introduced in the April 2009 supplementary budget, was put at &euro;95 million. It is likely, therefore, that the cost of restoration of the deduction to 100%, would be of the same broad order of magnitude. </p><p>In relation to Question 18859/15, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the amount of gross domestic rental income declared on income tax returns was &euro;4.3bn for 2010, &euro;4.1bn for 2011 and &euro;4.0bn for 2012 (returns for tax years 2013 or 2014 are not yet available). The rental income declared in respect of corporation tax was &euro;548m for 2010, &euro;520m for 2011 and &euro;526m for 2012. However, as rental income is aggregated with all other incomes for the purposes of tax assessment calculation, it is not possible to specify the total tax intake on rental income alone.</p></reply>

Given our high debt to GDP ratio, we do not have the luxury of holding all of these investments indefinitely and I envisage receipts from the gradual sale of these investments helping to play their part in reducing the State's overall debt burden in the coming years.</p>  <p>  The Irish banking system is now in a much stronger position than it has been in recent years. Profits are recovering, balance sheets have been restructured and we have started the process of returning cash to the taxpayer following the huge investments that were made over the 2009-11 period. </p>  <p>  Much of the banking-related work in the Department of Finance this year will focus on AIB. Given the scale of the State s investment   some &euro;20.8 billion   and the range of options available to recoup value from the bank, officials within my department are working with AIB on reconfiguring its capital structure. Goldman Sachs International has been appointed to provide financial advice to the Department  in this regard. </p>  <p>  The focus will be on ensuring that the best decisions are made regarding potential capital restructuring options and sequencing in order to maximise the return of cash to the State from our AIB investments over time. While this is just the start of the process, it is an essential first step on the road to recovering value for the taxpayer. All options remain on the table and it is too early to specify what steps will be taken next or to put a timeline on decisions.</p></reply>

The drafting of that Bill is advancing in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and it is my intention to bring it to the House at the earliest opportunity as the deadline for transposition is 20 July 2015. </p>  <p>  The focus of the Directive is on small companies, so most of the changes in the Bill will affect small companies.  Small companies qualify for audit exemption. As the thresholds for small and medium companies are considerably increased, the number of companies that will exceed those thresholds will be reduced.  Therefore, the number of companies that qualify as large companies will be fewer. For the remaining large companies, the requirements for production and publication of accounts will remain largely unchanged and the Bill will reflect that. </p>  <p>  However, the transposition of the Directive may have implications in this regard for unlimited companies.  My Department and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel are examining how best to give effect to those features of the Directive in the forthcoming Bill. </p></reply>

The purpose of the Directive was to implement the Framework Agreement on part-time work concluded by the European cross-industry organisations UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC. The Act provides a wide degree of protection for part-time employees, including the general protection that a part-time employee shall not be treated in a less favourable manner in respect of his/her conditions of employment than a full time employee.</p>  <p>  Section 13(5) of the 2001 Act contained provisions in relation to the preparation and publishing of a Code of Practice by the Labour Relations Commission in relation to the steps that could be taken by employers for the purposes of Clause 5.3 of the Framework Agreement. Clause 5.3 of the Framework Agreement provided that, as far as possible, an employer should give consideration to a request by workers to transfer from full-time work to part-time and vice-versa.  The Labour Relations Commission prepared this Code of Practice, based on the provisions in Section 13 of the 2001 Act, following consultation with the social partners.  It was deemed to be a Code of Practice and implemented, in 2006, by the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Access to Part-Time Working) (Declaration) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 8 of 2006).  Under Section 42(4) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990, the Code is admissible in evidence in any proceedings before a Court, the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Equality Tribunal. </p>  <p>  The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 provides that fixed-term employees may not be treated less favourably than comparable permanent employees, unless the employer can objectively justify the different treatment. Any justification offered cannot be connected with the fact that the employee is on a fixed-term contract.  </p>  <p>  The 2003 Act also establishes a framework to prevent abuses arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts.  The Act provides that where an employee has been on two or more continuous fixed-term contracts, the total duration of those contracts may not exceed four years.  After this, if the employer wishes to renew the employee&rsquo;s contract, it must be an open-ended contract unless there are objective grounds justifying the renewal of the contract for a fixed term only. </p>  <p>  The Unfair Dismissal Act 1977 as amended contains a provision aimed at ensuring that successive temporary contracts are not used in order to avoid that legislation.  It provides that where a fixed-term or specified-purpose contract expires and the individual is re-employed within 3 months, the individual is deemed to have continuous service for the purposes of that Act. </p>  <p>  I have no plans at this time to amend these provisions.</p></reply>

The services sector is making the largest contribution to the achievement of the Government&rsquo;s target of 100,000 more at work by 2016. Following a number of years of decline in employment from 2007, I am pleased to report that the manufacturing sector has also recorded increases in job numbers since 2011. </p>  <p>  According to the CSO Quarterly National Household Survey, as of the fourth quarter of 2014, seasonally adjusted, the number of people at work in industry and services increased by 73,400, and there are 13,400 more people at work in construction, since the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs in 2012.   </p>  <p>  In relation to agency assisted firms, the net increase in full-time employment since the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs to 2014 is 25,665, of which there a was a net increase of 8,051 in manufacturing employment and a net increase of 17,614 in internationally traded services employment.  This equates to just under one-third, or 31 per cent, of the net increase in full-time employment in agency assisted firms was in manufacturing and two-thirds of the net increase was in internationally traded services enterprises, since the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs. </p>  <p>  Arising from the strategy for the manufacturing sector &lsquo;Making it in Ireland: Manufacturing 2020&rsquo;, prepared by Forf&aacute;s and the report of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs Skills Report on the skills needs for the sector, both of which I launched in 2013, there are now a range of initiatives in hand by my Department and relevant Agencies to drive the Government&rsquo;s jobs targets. </p>  <p>  Manufacturing was a Disruptive Reform in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, with a range of measures designed to support industry growth including encouraging entrepreneurship, further improving our skills base, improving access to finance by SMEs and supporting indigenous companies and foreign-owned manufacturing companies to transform their businesses as part of a National Step Change Initiative.  The Manufacturing Development Forum is helping to address the key issues arising from the Strategy recommendations.  These initiatives are important to growing and sustaining the competitiveness of existing enterprises, to sustaining employment and to attracting new investment.</p>  <p>  More broadly in terms of our competitiveness for manufacturing and services investment, as reminded recently by the National Competitiveness Council when they published the 2015 Cost of Doing Business Report, while we have made progress in improving our comparative position, there is still further progress required.  Costs in Ireland have fallen across a range of business inputs since 2009, making Ireland more competitive internationally.  This is reflected in our ongoing ability to successfully compete internationally for trade and investment and in our improving performance across a range of international competitiveness benchmarking reports &ndash; for example, we have moved from 24th to 15th  in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook. </p>  <p>  In the longer term, improving our productivity performance must be the vehicle through which we must improve our competitiveness and grow the economy. Relentlessly pursuing productivity growth, driven by investment in talent and innovation, and improving our cost competitiveness remain vital to us as a small, export oriented economy so as to grow jobs and incomes in a sustainable way over the medium and longer term.</p></reply>

While every region and firm has yet to recover all the jobs lost in the downturn, the Action Plan for Jobs is having a positive impact with employment up in all eight regions of the country since the first Plan was launched in early 2012  (NUTS 3). </p>  <p>  So as to ensure we recover all the jobs lost and establish sustainable platforms for growth for the future in the regions, as part of the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs I am leading the development of Regional Action Plans for Jobs.  The development of Regional Action Plans, through a bottom-up process of stakeholder consultation, will identify those actions at regional level that can help achieve specific impacts in terms of jobs, sales and exports, entrepreneurship and startups, innovation and market penetration and access to talent.  I have participated in stakeholder fora in every region over recent weeks and there is a consensus that to achieve these impacts there is a need to strengthen and deepen regional collaboration &ndash; that is through local authorities, regional bodies, and higher education institutions, the private sector and communities coming forward with innovative ideas to boost job creation in their area and working together to deliver on those actions.  My Department is committed to working with stakeholders in the regions in identifying regional strengths, assets and areas of competitive advantage in order to support businesses to start-up, succeed, expand, and export so as to grow sustainable employment for the future.   </p>  <p>  The number of people at work in the mid-west is up by 2,400; in the west by 4,000; in the midlands by 8,900; in the south-west by 9,000; in the mid-east region by 9,100; in the border region by 11,300; in the south-east by 23,300 and in Dublin by 46,000.  Over the same period there are 73,400 more people at work in industry and services, and 13,400 more people at work in construction</p>  <p>  With regard to employment in Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Udaras na Gaeltacht client companies between 2012 and 2014, the manufacturing sector recorded increases  of 10% in the Midlands, 9% in the Mid-East, 8% in the West, 6% in the | South West, 6% in the Mid-West and 4% in the Border region since 2012.  Overall, employment in the manufacturing sector increased by 5% between 2012 and 2014 to reach 185,545 full time employees in agency-assisted firms. </p>  <p>  In the internationally traded services sector between 2012 and 2014, all regions experienced employment growth.

The Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) 2015 is a whole of government approach to economic recovery, export growth and job creation.  The Action Plan for Jobs set a target to increase employment by 100,000 by 2016 and we are well on track to achieve that figure this year, ahead of the target.  Much work remains to be done however to replace all the jobs lost in the downturn, and we are determined as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs and the Spring Economic Statement to have 2.1 million at work by 2018 and to get the unemployment rate below 8 per cent.  It is important to record that almost 90,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>in 2012.  There was an annual increase in employment of 1.5% or 29,100 in the year to the fourth quarter of 2014, bringing total employment to 1,938,900.  The increase in total employment of 29,100 in the year to Q4 2014 was represented by an increase in full-time employment of 39,600 (+2.7%) and a decrease in part-time employment of 10,500 (-2.3%).Unemployment decreased by 39,600 (-15.6%) in the year to Q4 2014 bringing the total number of persons unemployed to 213,600.  This is the tenth quarter in succession where unemployment has declined on an annual basis.  The long-term unemployment rate decreased from 7.2% to 5.7% over the year to Q4 2014. </p><p>Over the last four years, the number of males at work has grown by 59,000, while the number of females at work has increased by 22,700.  Over the same period, unemployment amongst men has fallen by 75,600, and by 21,700 amongst women.  Male unemployment decreased by 23,400 to 135,500 in 2014, while female unemployment decreased by 16,300 to 78,100 over the same period.</p><p>My Department, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices work closely with the Department of Social Protection and its offices at local level to promote available employment opportunities to those seeking employment opportunities, male and female, and to ensure employers have the best available data on skills available to fill job openings.</p></reply>

Europe is IDA Ireland&rsquo;s second largest market and accounts for 20% of investments won in the same period.  While the market is challenging given uneven recovery from the downturn, significant opportunities remain.   India, China, Singapore, the ASEAN countries,- including Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam as well as  South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Brazil, Israel and South Africa, referred to as Growth Markets, have become central sources of and destinations for global FDI flows, with Asia in particular becoming a key player.  IDA Ireland has put additional resources into this market place over the past five years and has seen good results with &lsquo;New Name&rsquo; investments rising from 4% in 2010 to 20% in 2014 and accounting for an average of 10% of total investments. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year IDA Ireland launched its new 5 year strategy entitled &ldquo;Winning&rdquo; which covers the period 2015 to 2019.  The strategy sets out ambitious targets to boost FDI in Ireland by over 40%, creating 80,000 new jobs in the economy over the next five years.  This will bring total direct employment by overseas companies in Ireland to 209,000 by 2019.  This will be the highest level of employment from overseas firms in the history of the State and will deliver wide-ranging economic benefits for the people of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s future FDI success will require continued support of existing sectors and exploiting new opportunities in new sectors.  In relation to IDA&rsquo;s global strategy, North America will remain the key source market for FDI.  The Agency will also target market share growth in Europe and increasing returns from regions such as Asia-Pacific.  IDA Ireland will continue to target high growth companies in all three markets to bring first time investors to Ireland.</p></reply>

During a period of economic decline, the eligible occupation categories are narrowed and other restrictions are applied in line with a decline in employment opportunities and an oversupply of labour.  However, even during such periods, the need to meet certain skills requirements remains, and during such periods, employment permits will still issue to non-EEA nationals where it can be demonstrated that their expertise is required or would be beneficial.</p><p>In 2012 it was recognised that the growth of Ireland&rsquo;s economy was dependent on our ability to meet the skills needs of both our indigenous and multi-national enterprises and a key component of that rested on our ability to attract and retain these key skills through the employment permits regime pending the achievement of a sufficient supply of appropriately trained Irish and other EEA nationals via education and reskilling.  Thus improvements to the employment permit regime were designed to help us meet our objective of providing a system that could quickly respond to skills gaps, could quickly process applications and could be used by employers with confidence to acquire those skills they are unable to source in Ireland.  The changes made included broadening and updating the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List (HSEOL) and the ineligible occupations list.</p><p>The Employment Permits (Amendment) Act 2014, which commenced in October 2014, provides the flexibility to deal with changing labour market, work patterns and economic development needs which often require rapid response.  The Regulations, as provided for in the Act, are being reviewed and adapted on a biannual basis to reflect the exigencies of a changing enterprise environment.  They, inter alia, stipulate two types of occupation for the purposes of the employment permits system:</p><p>-The HSEOL sets out the lists of eligible occupations deemed to be critically important to growing Ireland&rsquo;s economy, are highly demanded and highly skilled, and are in significant shortage of supply in our labour market.  This list is an integral part of the <i>Critical Skills Employment Permit</i>which is designed to attract highly skilled people into the labour market with the aim of encouraging them to take up permanent residence in the State;</p><p>-The Ineligible Categories of Employment List includes those occupations for which there is a clear surplus of adequately skilled Irish and EEA nationals in the wider labour force.  It is primarily focused on elementary occupations.</p><p>During 2013, my Department devised a process of reviewing and updating the HSEOL and Ineligible Categories of Employment List for employment permits bi-annually.  This review is predicated on a formalised and evidence-based process.  Such a process involves obtaining and considering advice from the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SMLRU - SOLAS).  It also involves input from relevant Government Departments, Agencies, and industry as necessary.  </p><p>The success of the employment permit system in helping to fill key ICT shortages in the Irish labour market is evident:</p><p>-Total number of permits issued to end Q1 2015 is up 19% on the same period in 2014;</p><p>-In all, 61% of the total permits issued in Q1 2015 were in respect of ICT professionals in critical short supply not only in Ireland but also in the EU and globally.</p><p>Detailed statistics are published on my Department's website which give a breakdown of employment permits issued by sector, county, company and nationality.  These may be accessed at .</p></reply>

Increasing entrepreneurial activity is a Disruptive Reform in the Action Plan for Jobs for 2015.  Our key priority is driving implementation of the actions in the National Entrepreneurship Statement, which was published in October last year and to achieve the ambitious targets set out for a 25% increase in the number of start-ups and in the scaling and sustainability of new enterprises.</p><p>The launch of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) was a major reform delivered in 2014 and the clients of the LEOs increased employment by 4,012 last year to 31,326 jobs throughout the country.  In 2015 the LEOs will have ambitious and robust county strategies and targets for start-ups, enterprise engagements and supports to be effective first-stop-shops for enterprise information and supports and launch an Entrepreneur Partnering Programme.  My Department through its agencies will build on the 2014 success of the awards programmes such as Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur with a renewed programme for 2015.</p><p>Businesses can also access the online search tool for SME business supports that was launched last year.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is a cross-governmental initiative to help Irish start-ups and small businesses navigate the range of Government business supports for which they could be eligible.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at: <i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i></p><p>When it comes to promoting prosperity through job creation, the role of new entrepreneurs can hardly be overstated, with two-thirds of new jobs created by firms in their first five years.  Enterprise Ireland works to increase the number of companies starting-up, succeeding, expanding, exporting and ultimately creating jobs in Ireland.  EI&rsquo;s support system for young companies includes help with business planning, mentoring and development advice, feasibility funding and finance, often in the form of equity investment, as appropriate to the founder&rsquo;s ambitions and the company&rsquo;s potential and stage of growth.  The number of full-time and part-time jobs created by EI client companies can be seen in the table below.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland has set itself an ambitious target of 550 new and early start-ups supported by 2016.  In addition, building on the success achieved to date on the Competitive Feasibility Funds, EI will launch four targeted funds during the year in the West, Midlands, MidEast, and one sectoral fund.</p><p>The launch of the simplified Startup Refunds for Entrepreneurs Scheme (SURE) in 2015 will provide additional finance for entrepreneurs.  Other schemes like the Micro Finance Fund Ireland and the Credit Loan Guarantee Scheme were also established to make available further supports to a wider cohort of Irish companies.</p><p>In addition, a range of agricultural related measures are being implemented including steps to maximise available agricultural land with measures to encourage long term leasing.  We are also continuing to supporting the tourism sector with retention of 9% VAT rate.  More broadly, improvements in personal taxation will benefit the self-employed and entrepreneurs and support growth in demand across the economy.</p><p><b>Enterprise Ireland job creation figures including SME jobs:</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>Permanent Full Time Jobs</td><td>141,228</td><td>145,460</td><td>149,718</td><td>156,202</td></tr><tr><td>Permanent Full Time Gains</td><td>9,076</td><td>12,861</td><td>12,532</td><td>14,873</td></tr><tr><td>Permanent Full Time Losses</td><td>-9,070</td><td>-9,523</td><td>8,912</td><td>-7,659</td></tr><tr><td>Permanent Full Time Net Change</td><td>6</td><td>3,338</td><td>3,620</td><td>7,214</td></tr><tr><td>Part Time Jobs</td><td>21,464</td><td>23,991</td><td>26,032</td><td>23,870</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The person named received a payment on 16   October 2013 under the 2013 Single Farm Payment Scheme and also 20 September 2013 under the 2013 Disadvantaged Area Scheme, which are deemed overpaid and will be netted-off future payments made by my Department.</p>  <p>  The person named was notified of the outcome of this review in writing on 21 May 2014 and informed of his right to submit an appeal to the LPIS Appeals Committee.  By letter dated 23 June 2014, the person named opted to avail of his right to appeal to the independently-chaired LPIS Appeal Committee.  Following due consideration, the LPIS Appeal Committee rejected his appeal, and notified him of the decision on 30 October 2014, in which they outlined his right to appeal to the Office of the Ombudsman.   Following consultation with the Office of the Ombudsman, my Department arranged for a further verification visit to be carried out, which did not result in a positive outcome for the person named, as the overall area remained unchanged.  The person named was notified in writing of the outcome of this review on 30 April 2015.</p></reply>

In that letter, he was advised that the debt mentioned, along with any interest charged, if not recouped from him directly, would be debited from any future payments that would fall due to him from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.  A further statement issued to him on 1<sup>st</sup>May 2015 advising him that the outstanding balance on his payment at that stage was &euro;4,337.61.  The full entitlement of the person named for 2014 REPS 4 payment is &euro;8,883.30. REPS 4 payments are made in two instalments, 75% and 25%. His 75% instalment of &euro;6,662.48 had penalties of &euro;1,385.52 deducted in respect of non-compliance with the REPS Scheme.  The person named was notified by way of Farmers Statement of this debt on 27<sup>th</sup>April 2015.

A significant miles t one was reached in June 2014 when the US side sent a team of inspectors to Ireland in order to carry out an equivalence re-instatement audit including visits to 2 Irish beef processing establishments which had applied for approval to export to the US.  The final report of this audit was received at the end of December 2014 . Since then, three plants have been approved  by my Department to produce beef for export to the U.S.  I am delighted to say that trade has commenced and Irish beef is available in restaurants and supermarkets there.  Obviously it takes time to scale up in such a large market but we have significant first-mover advantage by virtue of being the first and only EU member state to have achieved access.</p>  <p>  As part of the approval, a veterinary health certificate has been agreed with the U.S. authorities in respect of &ldquo;beef meat, beef meat products and beef meat by-products&rdquo;.  At present Irish processors have access to the U.S market for &ldquo;intact beef&rdquo;, i.e. beef which is not subject to grinding or certain other types of processing which involve breaking the surface are a of the meat after importation, before being marketed in the U.S. such access allows Irish beef processors to target the high value retail and food service end of the US steak market.</p>  <p>  Any beef which is subject to grinding or certain other types of processing in the U.S. before being marketed must be treated under the USDA rules applying to &ldquo;non-intact beef&rdquo; in the country of origin.  My Department is currently engaged in a detailed technical discussion with the U.S authorities in order to extend access to the US to include &ldquo;non-intact beef&rdquo; also.  It is also working closely with the Irish beef plants as part of this process.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that we are making significant progress and am hopeful that access can be extended to these additional lower value beef products in the near future.</p></reply>

The Farmers&rsquo; Charter is comprised of agreed standards and delivery targets for the schemes and services, including on-farm inspections, provided by my Department to all its clients including farmers.  The relevant EU Regulations are the legal instruments governing farm inspections.  The Charter is effectively an agreement drawn up between my Department and the main farming organizations, which must fully respect and operate within these legal requirements.</p><p><i>EU legislation governing the Direct Payment Schemes and Rural Development measures requires my Department to carry out on-the-spot checks covering such issues as eligibility under the Scheme, including the eligibility of the land being declared, and compliance with Cross Compliance requirements, as set down in EU legislation, and the standards for Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC). The legislation sets down the minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually.  The legislation also prescribes, for example, the process for selecting cases for inspection, rules on the advance notification of inspections and the reductions/penalties to be applied in the event of non-compliances with scheme requirements being determined at inspections. In undertaking these inspections my Department must ensure that the legislative requirements are being met in full, to ensure that applicants under the schemes are being treated in a fair and equitable manner and that the EU funding being provided for the schemes is protected.</i></p><p>The current Farmers&rsquo; Charter was introduced in 2009. Negotiations on a new Farmers&rsquo; Charter are ongoing at present. My Department is endeavouring to achieve consensus with representatives of the main farmer representative organisations on some outstanding issues and will immediately move to publish the new Farmers&rsquo; Charter upon the achievement of consensus.</p></reply>

I can say, however, that it has been operated in a significant number of cases and that over the course of its operation over many years it has proven its worth in helping to secure the conviction of very serious organised crime leaders.</p><p>The Witness Security Programme is operated by the Garda authorities, overseen by the Crime and Security Section at Garda Headquarters supported by the Special Detective Unit and other local Garda resources as necessary.  The operation of the programme and the resources required for it are kept under continuous review by the Garda authorities.</p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to provide statutory guidelines for the Witness Security Programme, which currently operates on an administrative basis.  Consideration of legislative framework to give effect to this commitment is under active consideration in my Department.</p></reply>

I have received an action plan that addresses both the short and medium term requirements to manage the referrals that were not processed as they should have been as well as the longer term local and national management actions needed to ensure this is not repeated.  </p>  <p>  I can take some assurance that this is not a more systemic issue as the child welfare and protection services are subject to the independent inspection regime of the Health Information and Quality Authority.  Since 2013,  HIQA has carried out inspections of the child protection and welfare services in 11 out of 17 of Tusla's administrative areas, of which 7 were carried out in 2014.  The Midlands area has not yet been inspected.  These inspections are on the basis of standards designed to follow a child&rsquo;s journey within the child protection system to ensure that his or her safety and welfare is being protected.  </p>  <p>  Inspections consider the full range of Tusla's child protection services, including the service planning, review and monitoring processes with the aim of ensuring that systematic approaches are in place involving good leadership, inter-agency cooperation, skilled and experienced staff, and the effective management and deployment of resources with children at the centre.</p>  <p>  Inspection report findings to date show overall a good quality of social work service when cases are allocated.  The issues of concern was the length of time some children were waiting to be allocated a social worker due to staffing issues, and in a small number of areas, concerns were outlined regarding the monitoring of risk of children waiting for an allocated social worker. As HIQA goes about its valuable work, I anticipate they may find other aspects of child protection services which require improvement.  It is for that reason we have an independent inspectorate to identify issues and to apply an improving action plan on the area in question. </p>  <p>  Tusla has also recently developed the first ever quality assurance programme for child protection services. This programme is identifying areas in need of improvement and is used to address resources and practice issues. </p>  <p>  My Department has agreed a  set of performance indicators with Tusla which are reported on monthly and quarterly and allow for a contemporary picture of how areas are managing the demands on their service. This information which is published on the Tusla website, informs both the HIQA inspection process and Tusla's quality assurance programme. </p>  <p>  In respect of Laois/Offaly services, I welcome the speedy and appropriate response by Tusla to put in place resources to implement the action plan.  I also appreciate the openness shown by the CEO of Tusla in his appearance at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.  The first step has been to collate all the affected referrals and determine how best to move them forward.  I have been informed that all of the referrals were known to the social work teams but only about half had recorded clearly follow up reviews or actions.  I have also been informed that the number of referrals involved is much less than the 1,200 previously mentioned.</p>  <p>  At this stage, I have not been informed of any children that were at immediate risk who did not receive an urgent response.  I will refrain from giving figures until I have been informed that they have been validated.  I will also give due regard to fair procedures for the individuals involved.   Allowing for these restrictions, I will keep the House informed as to the progress of the action plan in the Tusla Laois/Offaly child welfare and protection services.</p></reply>

Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has advised that a review of the service, following the absence without authority of two children from the unit, was completed in 2012.  However, this report was not subject of final checks, including checks on confidentiality and fair procedures, that would allow its wider circulation.  Consequently, Tusla has indicated that this report could not be published and it has no plans to do so.  I can confirm that the conclusions were not favourable in respect of the culture, leadership and management of the service provided by the unit.  While the option of closure was considered following the report in 2012, it was decided to implement an action plan to address the operational and management deficiencies and to ensure that the lessons from the incident were learned. </p>  <p>  My predecessor, Minister Flanagan, received a copy of a report titled "Gleann Alainn Special Care Unit:  Report of Deep Learning Process (Serious Incident Oct 2011)".  The CEO of Tusla commented in a covering letter that those involved with the service accepted that practice at the time of the event fell short of the standards expected of staff and the unit and noted that the subsequent implementation of the action plan had, in the end, proved a valuable learning experience.  </p>  <p>  Since the implementation of the action plan, the number of significant events recorded at Gleann Alainn has reduced markedly.  Monitoring of the unit's progress noted that the staff and management of the unit had enthusiastically addressed ongoing IR issues and attended to a significant number of recommendations for the service provided by the unit.  Also, Gleann Alainn was inspected independently by the Health Information and Quality Authority a number of times, most recently in December 2014.  The report of this inspection, which is available on the HIQA website, noted that the centre was well managed with national oversight.  Staff practice in relation to child protection was good.  The inspectors noted that there had been no children absent without authority or missing from care in the previous 12 months.  This was attributed to the improved ethos and culture in the unit.   The HIQA inspections have provided good evidence, following the implementation of the action plan, that the children are receiving a safe and effective service in the Gleann Alainn special care unit.</p></reply>

Parents qualify as disadvantaged or low income on the basis of means-tested entitlements. In the case of full day care, parents qualifying for the higher rate of subvention under the CCS programme can have up to &euro;95 (Band A) per week, per child, provided towards the cost of the childcare place. The parent pays the balance of the weekly cost of the childcare place. </p><p>Parents whose children are enrolled in a participating childcare service before or during a &lsquo;snap-shot&rsquo; week in October each year can apply for subvention support under the programme.  Eligibility is verified by submitting application details for checking against the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and Health Service Executive (HSE) records.</p><p>Eligibility for subvention support can only be confirmed on the verification of the relevant parental application for eligibility. However, participating CCS services have been advised that, if they wish to grant a subvention rate to parents before the verification process has been completed, they should request the parent to provide up-to-date proof of eligibility from the time the child commences in the service.  The eligibility criteria is set out on the DCYA website but T&uacute;sla/PHN referrals are not included as this referral system is a specific arrangement based on significant circumstances for a child. </p><p>The purpose of T&uacute;sla/PHN referrals (previously known as HSE referrals) is to secure a childcare place for a child deemed by a T&uacute;sla/PHN Professional to be in significant need of a childcare place. To avoid any obstacles to accessing a childcare place (i.e. costs) the T&uacute;sla/PHN professional makes a referral to a childcare service under the agreement that as the &lsquo;referring agent&rsquo; the balance of parental fees will be paid by the &lsquo;referrer&rsquo; and the parent is not charged any childcare fees. </p><p>The 'referring agent' is therefore applying for the Band A subvention on the basis that the balance of the childcare costs will be funded by them and will not be charged to the parent. As part of the CCS verification/appeals process the &lsquo;referral letter&rsquo; is reviewed to ensure that it is clear that the parent is not being charged any child care fees. </p><p>T&uacute;sla/PHN referrals must clearly name the child being &lsquo;referred&rsquo; to the service and that the remainder of the childcare fee, following Band A subvention, will be covered by the referring agent.  For the 2014/15 year, a letter from the service provider stating that the parent is not being charged any childcare fee, is being accepted if the Tusla/PHN referral does not clarify this.  </p><p>In relation to Bunratty Community Childcare Centre, referred to by the Deputy,  the initial CCS application indicated that this service had 5 children, referred by T&uacute;sla/PHN, seeking specific support under the programme.</p><p>In the case of the information attached to the 5 T&uacute;sla/PHN referrals, none had a confirmation either by the PHN or the service provider, that the parent would not be charged the balance of the parental fee should a Band A place be approved.  In addition, one of the letters from a PHN only provides information as to the status of the child&rsquo;s welfare and does not clarify the need for support, under this provision of the programme, for this child.  The applications were declined for Band A funding approval based on these assessments. </p><p>All of the 5 applications have been appealed by the service and further information submitted.  The service will be notified of any further information required to support a T&uacute;sla/PHN referral.  It must be noted that it appears from the initial assessment of the additional information that the parents are paying childcare fees which would, therefore, result in a decline of these appeals.  </p><p>The other service referred to in the correspondence attached to the Deputy's question -  Jigsaw, Darndale / Belcamp Integrated Childcare Service - indicated that 23 child registrations in the service are T&uacute;sla (HSE) referrals.  These applications also had insufficient information attached to satisfy the T&uacute;sla/HSE referral requirement before the verification process was completed.  The service, through the local City Childcare Committee, requested clarification of the information needed to progress their appeals and have since submitted documentation under the appeal process which will be examine in due course. </p><p>All of the appeals will be fully evaluated and the outcome will be communicated to the childcare providers in each case.</p></reply>

Employees are also prohibited from having a financial or other beneficial interest in any company or organisation operating in a sector that the HPRA regulates.</p>  <p>  Any employee who previously worked in a regulated company is restricted from all activities relating to that company for a period of time of up to five years depending on their role in that company, seniority of their position, relationships with persons in the company or level of contact with persons in the company, and any other relevant factor. They are also prohibited from ever taking part in any activity relating to a medicinal product, medical device or cosmetic that they helped develop in any previous employment or relating to any competitor products for the same active substance or class of substances.</p>  <p>  HPRA policies and procedures govern the declaration of interests, when staff join, on an annual basis and at any time that interests may change (e.g. with respect to a household member). There is a structured evaluation of any declared interest and appropriate outcomes depending on the evaluation. Checking for any restrictions is an integral part of all procedures for assigning work.</p>  <p>  All pharmaceutical companies pay fees for their licence applications. The fees are set out in Regulations approved by the Minister for Health. No company may provide financial support to any employee. This is clearly stated in the Conflict of Interest Policy on the HPRA website.</p>  <p>  Roaccutane has been closely monitored at both national and European level since it was first authorised, with issues related to its safety highlighted and communicated to healthcare professionals as appropriate. </p>  <p>  The HPRA, together with its EU counterparts has worked with the pharmaceutical company to facilitate availability of appropriate product information for Roaccutane, which includes detailed and comprehensive advice regarding the risks associated with its use and recommendations to minimise the occurrence of these risks. The product information has been reviewed and updated since Roaccutane was first authorised for use in Ireland in 1983, as required. The HPRA has also communicated the outcome of regulatory reviews and updated recommendations regarding Roaccutane to healthcare professionals through its Drug Safety Newsletter on a number of occasions, all of which are accessible from the HPRA website  </p>  <p>  The product information for Roaccutane highlights the requirement that it should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of physicians with expertise in the use of systemic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and with a full understanding of the risks of therapy and the monitoring requirements associated with its use.</p>  <p>  The product information also specifies the circumstances where Roaccutane is contraindicated (i.e. when it should not be used).</p>  <p>  The requirements for specific monitoring of the patient to reduce the risk of adverse reactions and to facilitate their early detection and management are described in detail in the product information in relation to psychiatric disorders, severe skin reactions, allergic reactions, effects on liver enzymes, serum lipids and the pregnancy prevention programme. Monitoring in these circumstances is through on-going review of the patient by the prescribing doctor, as part of their clinical practice. </p>  <p>  The HPRA and the company have legal obligations to share reports of serious, suspected adverse reactions associated with use of Roaccutane within 15 days of first notification. These reports are in turn submitted to the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organisation to facilitate review in the context of global safety experience and to support early detection of new and emerging reporting trends. </p>  <p>  The relevant renewal requirements have changed over time. When Roaccutane was first licensed, companies were required to apply for renewal of their marketing authorisations every five years. Marketing authorisations became subject to one further renewal, following which authorisations remain valid for an unlimited period, unless one additional five-year renewal was considered necessary on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance (drug safety). Roaccutane was last renewed on 10 July 2009 with an unlimited marketing authorisation.</p>  <p>  Requirements for renewal application have changed over time. The current requirements are included in the European Commission&rsquo;s &lsquo;Guideline on the processing of renewals in the Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedure&rsquo; and the accompanying &lsquo;EU Application form for renewal of a marketing authorisation.&rsquo;</p>  <p>  The HPRA prohibits the acceptance of money as cash, cash vouchers or cash equivalents from any industry or sector regulated by the HPRA. Gifts may not be solicited, directly or indirectly. Only gifts of very modest value are acceptable in limited circumstances or where it is the custom in the country concerned to give such gifts and where to decline may cause offence. The Conflict of Interest Policy on the HPRA website provides detailed guidance and requirements.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that the Steering Group will submit a draft Cancer Strategy for consideration by me before the end of 2015 with a view to the new strategy being ready for implementation from 2016.</p>  <p>  My Department has also established a Cancer Patient Forum to facilitate a patient input to the development of the National Cancer Strategy and to inform the work of the Steering Group. A representative of the Forum will sit as a member on the Steering Group.</p>  <p>  As per my letter sent to you on the 8 May, the Cancer Patient Forum will comprise of the following representatives:</p>  <p>  The Irish Cancer Society, Purple House Cancer Support, Cancer Care West, EuropaDonna Ireland, Marie Keating Foundation, ARC Cancer Support, a screening participant, Donegal Action for Cancer Care, Cooperating for Cancer Care North West, Men's Cancer Alliance, CanTeen Ireland, Barretstown and Patient Focus.</p>  <p>  The intention is that one member of the Patient Forum will sit on the Steering Group, to facilitate direct patient input to the development of recommendations. The Patient Forum had a very well received first meeting on 29 April, at which they were asked to consider a nominee to sit on the Steering Group and revert to the Department.</p>  <p>  All interested parties including members of the public will be invited to make submissions.  I hope and expect that there will be dozens if not hundreds.  Unfortunately, it will not be possible for me to meet any individuals or groups about their submissions as it would compromise the outcome of the process if I were to meet some but not others and it would be impossible for me to meet all.</p></reply>

The main focus of the resolution was the setting up of an ad hoc committee to elaborate a binding debt resolution mechanism. Following detailed consideration of the proposal and discussions with our EU partners and other UN members, Ireland, and our EU partners, were unable to support the Resolution.     Ireland fully subscribed to the EU&rsquo;s statement clarifying the important considerations which informed the negotiating approach on the Resolution, as follows:  </p>  <p>  &ldquo;The ad-hoc committee must be limited to the elaboration of a non-binding 'set of principles' which builds upon a market-based voluntary contractual approach to sovereign debt restructuring and aims at furthering its implementation and use. Neither the EU nor Member States will participate in discussions aiming at the establishment of a binding multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes.</p>  <p>  The ad-hoc committee should reflect the recent and ongoing work on sovereign debt restructuring undertaken in the IMF, subject to the previous considerations, and should take place in close coordination with and with technical support from the Fund.   Discussions should also make reference to the work in other fora on these issues, such as the Paris Club, which has a history of discussing sovereign debt restructuring issues.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  In the event, the Resolution continued to propose the elaboration of a new legal framework and, in these circumstances, Ireland, in common with EU partners, will not be participating in the work of the committee.</p>  <p>  Ireland is actively engaged in ongoing global processes to address the issue of sovereign debt restructuring. Work being undertaken at other levels, including in the IMF and at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in Addis Ababa in July, offer appropriate, established and constructive means for meaningful dialogue on the matter. We are playing our full role, in partnership with our EU colleagues, in working for the success of the Financing for Development Conference in Addis, which is central to the ongoing negotiations on a new framework for global development to follow on from the Millennium Development Goals.  These major international negotiations at the UN are being co-chaired by Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the UN, with Kenya. </p></reply>

That focus will now only intensify following the recent general election in Britain and Prime Minister Cameron&rsquo;s commitment to holding a referendum on the country&rsquo;s EU membership by 2017. My Government colleagues and I have been clear in voicing our view that joint British-Irish membership has been hugely beneficial to our country and our relationship with the UK. The important role the EU has played in the context of Northern Ireland should also not be forgotten, as the Taoiseach emphasised recently in a speech in Belfast.</p><p>Our unique relationship with the UK &ndash; in economic, social, cultural and historical terms &ndash; means we have a deep interest in the outcome of this debate about that country&rsquo;s future in Europe. We also value the contribution the UK has made to the EU during the four decades we have been members together and we share a similar approach on many key policy areas. Given the importance we attach to their ongoing membership, a key priority will be ensuring that our UK partners remain fully aware of the potential consequences for Ireland of any fundamental change in the nature of their membership of the EU.</p><p>I have addressed many of these points directly with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. I have also written to him following his recent re-appointment and will remain in close contact with him in the time ahead.</p><p>Our Embassy in London is, of course, very active with regard to EU-UK relationship. Its input and reporting on this, together with the reports and analysis we receive from our other diplomatic missions across the EU, will continue to be of key importance.</p><p>We will work closely in the coming period with both our British and EU partners the objective of ensuring continued UK membership of the European Union.</p></reply>

A Task Force to assist students was established in 2014, and the report of the Taskforce was published on 2nd September 2014.  On the basis of Marketing English in Ireland's (MEI) involvement with the Task Force, MEI schools have been assisting genuine displaced students in completing their studies by offering alternative courses at a significantly discounted rate.</p>  <p>  MEI schools provide an additional support to displaced students in that they have arrangements in place for the protection of learners.  Most of the private colleges which have closed did not have such learner protection arrangements in place.  Other individual colleges and representative groups, such as the recently formed Private College Network, have also made offers to accommodate impacted students.</p>  <p>  A dedicated website has also been established, and this provides useful information to affected students and outlines the range of options available to them.  The website continues to be updated regularly.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of teacher salaries, this is a matter between the teachers and their employer, and my Department has no role in this.</p>  <p>  Regarding the regulation process going forward, my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality have produced a package of reforms to the student immigration system for international education which will be brought to Government for its approval shortly. These reforms will drive a restructuring in the sector designed to improve the overall quality of offering to international students, improve protection for learners, enhance Ireland's reputation and diminish negative impacts on the Irish labour market and social protection costs, strongly in line with the goals of Ireland's international education strategy.</p></reply>

This initiative is a targeted pilot tax incentive scheme which aims to:</p><p>-encourage people back to the centre of Irish cities to live in older buildings (residential element),</p><p>-  encourage the regeneration of central business districts (commercial element).</p><p>The commercial tax relief is given in the form of an accelerated capital allowance for &ldquo;qualifying expenditure&rdquo; on the refurbishment or conversion of premises within the special regeneration areas of six cities (namely Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Kilkenny and Waterford). Unlike the residential element of the scheme, the commercial/retail element is not restricted to pre-1915 buildings. The capital allowance is given at the rate of 15% of qualifying expenditure for each of the first 6 years and 10% in year 7. </p><p>There are a number of conditions governing eligibility for the scheme:</p><p>-  The premises must be located within the designated special regeneration area.</p><p>-  The premises must be used, after refurbishment/conversion, for retail purposes or for the provision of services within the State.</p><p>-  The expenditure incurred must relate to refurbishment or conversion only.</p><p>-  The expenditure must be incurred within the qualifying period. This means a 5 year period commencing with the day the scheme is commenced by Order of the Minister for Finance.</p><p>-  There are overall limits on the amount of capital expenditure on any project which is to be treated as qualifying expenditure, with the maximum relief available for any individual project being capped at &euro;200,000.</p><p>This is the only tax relief scheme currently applicable for the renovation of commercial premises. Further details in relation to the scheme, and qualifying expenditure under the scheme, may be obtained from the Department of Finance.</p></reply>

Details of that announcement are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>The announcement followed the submission by all local authorities of proposals for their planned delivery of new social housing out to 2017.

However, the assessment of project proposals is continuing and proposals which were not among those announced including those submitted by Wicklow County Council, details of which are included in the table below, are still under active consideration in my Department. In line with the targets in the Social Housing Strategy, I will be making further announcements in due course of project approvals and funding allocations as the assessment process continues. In addition, local authorities may submit further proposals over the course of the Social Housing Strategy as they identify and prioritise the delivery of social housing units to meet the need in their areas. </p><p>The social housing targets out to 2017 that I announced on 1 April last provide for a target of 438 units in respect of Wicklow. I also announced a provisional funding allocation of &euro;31 million which provides for units to be delivered by Wicklow County Council through a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes.

Full details of this announcement are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>I announced a major social housing construction programme on 5 May 2015, with &euro;312 million to be invested nationally, covering all 31 local authorities and with over 1,700 social housing units to be built across some 100 separate projects. That announcement included projects for Mayo covering the construction of 22 new social housing units at an estimated cost of &euro;5 million. Details of that announcement are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>.</p><p>This announcement followed from the assessment of local authority proposals for their planned delivery of new social housing units. Local authorities had been requested to focus on projects that would - </p><p>-  be suitable for early commencement and completion;</p><p>-  meet social housing need in the area; and</p><p>-  represent good value for money.</p><p>The projects announced on 5 May are those assessed at this stage as being suitable to proceed. However, the assessment of project proposals is continuing and proposals that were not among those announced, including those submitted by Mayo County Council, details of which are included in the table below, are still under active consideration in my Department. In line with the targets announced in the Social Housing Strategy, I will be making further announcements in due course of project approvals and funding allocations as the assessment process continues. In addition, local authorities may submit further proposals over the course of the Social Housing Strategy as they identify and priorities the delivery of social housing units to meet the need in their areas.</p><p>The proposed social housing projects submitted by Mayo County Council are as follows:<table><tr><th>Proposed Project Name/Address <br /><br /></th><th>Number of units </th><th>Estimated costing as per local authority </th></tr><tr><td>Return of vacant properties to use </td><td>100 </td><td>&euro;1,500,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Transfer of &lsquo;unsold affordable&rsquo; housing stock to permanent social housing stock </td><td>23 </td><td>&euro;6,504,480 </td></tr><tr><td>Construction project at Tubberhill, Westport </td><td>21 </td><td>&euro;3,800,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Construction project at Marian Crescent, Ballina </td><td>2 </td><td>&euro;250,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Construction project at Knockmore, Ballina </td><td>8 </td><td>&euro;1,300,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Various New Builds for identification </td><td>20 </td><td>&euro;3,200,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Infills in various towns for identification </td><td>40 </td><td>&euro;6,400,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Single Rural Houses built to demand </td><td>16 </td><td>&euro;2,400,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Acquisitions in various towns for identification </td><td>64 </td><td>&euro;8,960,000 </td></tr></table></p><p>Applications from local authorities for funding support to return vacant social housing units to productive use are invited by my Department on an annual basis. Mayo County Council sought support in respect of 100 such properties for 2015. The exact locations of units to be remediated is a matter in the first instance for the Council. Nationally, the funding available under Budget 2015 will see a target of 1,000 vacant housing units returned to productive use and the requests from Mayo County Council and all other local authorities are now being assessed with funding to each Council to be allocated shortly.</p><p>The most recent Summary of Social Housing Assessments, carried out as at 7 May 2013, found that there were 1,479 households on the waiting lists in Mayo. The 2013 figures are the most up-to-date figures available on waiting list numbers, which are subject to on-going fluctuation due to households being allocated housing and new households applying for housing support.  In order to get the most accurate data relating to the numbers applying for social housing support, the Social Housing Strategy includes a commitment to increase the regularity of the summary of social housing assessments by undertaking it on annual basis from 2016 onwards. The full results of the 2013 Summary are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) commenced in 2005 and at the end of March 2015, local authorities had transferred a total of 52,529 households from Rent Supplement. Of these, 30,911 were housed directly under RAS and a further 21,618 were accommodated under other social housing options.  In Mayo, up to the end of March 2015 some 1,420 households have been transferred from Rent Supplement directly to RAS and 501 to other social housing options.</p></reply>

This website provides a cost-effective online recruitment facility and widespread exposure for jobs in the public sector in this jurisdiction.</p><p>I understand from the agency that, while the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) has a recruitment website, the normal practice of the NICS is to advertise only those posts for which it has direct recruitment responsibility.
