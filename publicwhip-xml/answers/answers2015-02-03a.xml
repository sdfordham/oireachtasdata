I understand the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Minister Alan Kelly, proposes to allow a significant period of time for the public and stakeholders to feed into the continued development of the Plan. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy refers, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill also creates a statutory obligation for my Department to develop a Climate Change Adaptation Plan for the Transport Sector.  Good progress has been made to date and, subject to the level of obligation required in relation to Strategic Environmental and Appropriate Assessments, I would hope to be in a position to publish the Plan by the end of this year.</p></reply>

There is no one size fits all approach to this.</p>  <p>  As stated above, negotiated permissive access from the perspectives of cost and public ownership has value but, for projects of national scale, consideration must  be given to land purchase by agreement or if necessary by CPO.   In the context of developing major cycling infrastructure projects that traverse long sections of privately owned land and involve major state investment, it would be precarious to rely on permissive access where the associated agreements may be withdrawn at any time without recourse to the State.  </p></reply>

As a result there were a record number of applications in 2012 with a total of 2170 applications. I also made changes to the Programme in 2012 to make it accessible to more clubs and organisations than ever before.  I believe that these changes also led to the record number of applications in 2012.  </p>  <p>  I was very pleased to announce a total of &euro;40.5 million last year under the 2014 round of the Sports Capital Programme.  A total of 2,036 applications were received under the 2014 Programme, the second highest number ever received. A total of 821 of the successful allocations were towards local sports clubs and organisations, with the remaining 59 allocated to regional or national projects.</p>  <p>  I am delighted that I was successful in receiving enough money for 2015 to launch another round of the SCP this year. This will be the third round of the Programme since this Government came into office, a very significant achievement by any standards, particularly against the backdrop of the continuing economic challenges facing the country and it shows this Government&rsquo;s commitment to the excellent work being done by sporting organisations throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  Detailed preparations are being made at present in my Department for the 2015 SCP. I expect to make an announcement in the near future.</p></reply>

In relation to the Blanchardstown to UCD proposal work is ongoing on the identified route corridor with a view to producing a Final Route Option Report later this year. Work on the  Clongriffin to Tallaght  BRT is at an earlier stage but it is hoped to have the Route Option Report finalised next year. </p>  <p>  No decision will be taken on the Swords/Airport BRT proposal  pending the completion of the Fingal/North Dublin Study which will advise on the best rail project to address the long term needs of the Swords/Airport corridor. I expect to receive this report at the end of March.</p>  <p>  It is accepted that BRT will not, on its own, replace rail-based solutions where a higher capacity solution is required in the long-term, such as on the  Swords/Airport corridor. </p>  <p>  I will carefully consider  the results of the various reports having regard  to the costs and benefits of each project, affordability and  availability of funding including from non exchequer sources. My aim is to recommend the project that gives best value for money over an appropriate time period. </p>  <p>  With regard to the operation of any BRT service, the NTA has entered into a new contract with Dublin Bus for the period up to December 2019.  They have advised that Dublin Bus will undertake the operation of any of the three proposed BRT services that become operational during the period of this public service contract. </p></reply>

The NRA in conjunction with the relevant local authorities published its M50 Demand Management Report in April 2014.  </p>  <p>  Looking to the future and increased travel demand  as the economy recovers further we will need to address congestion across the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) and not just on the M50.  In this context I have asked the National Transport Authority, as the agency responsible for strategic traffic management in the GDA, to work with the NRA and the GDA local authorities to prepare a report on congestion and to outline actions and investment that might be required in the short, medium and long term.  I expect the report to be completed within a few months.</p></reply>

My Department's role in the processing of exemptions is to examine and administer applications for exemptions and to issue exemptions to airlines where appropriate, taking account of aviation and other public policy considerations.    </p>  <p>  As part of this procedure the views of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are sought in relation to foreign policy issues.

In January 2015, the Garda Professional Standards Unit concluded a report following its examination of the Procedures, Policy and Decision Making Processes in relation to cancellations in the Fixed Charge Processing System. The examination was carried out following concerns expressed regarding certain cancellation decisions within the System. While the findings and conclusions of the Report are matters appropriately to be addressed by An Garda&iacute;  Sioch&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality, some of the recommendations contained impact on the functions of my Department. The recommendations are being studied within my Department at present, in consultation with the Criminal Justice Working Group, and they will be advanced as appropriate.</p></reply>

The Council meets in this format in order to make decisions on common policies and approaches in the area of transport including areas where there may be scope to better integrate transport provision throughout the island.    The most recent NSMC meeting in Transport Sectoral format took place on 4 November 2014 in Armagh where I met Mark H Durkan MLA, Minister for the Environment in Northern Ireland and Danny Kennedy MLA Minister for Regional Development in Northern Ireland. Amongst the agenda items for this meeting were Strategic Transport Priorities;  Cycling/Cross Border Greenways;  an update on the A5 and A8 major road projects; a progress report on the work which is underway to allow for the mutual recognition of penalty points; a review of the ongoing cooperation in the areas of road user and vehicle safety as well as a discussion on EU matters which impact on the transport sector in the two jurisdictions. Other items which have previously featured on the agenda at NSMC Transport meetings have included the All Island Freight Forum, developments on the Dublin/Belfast Rail line and cross-border community based rural transport.</p>  <p>  The next NSMC meeting in Transport Sectoral format is scheduled for 22  April and the agenda is likely to  again feature a number of the issues listed above as well as providing an opportunity for a general discussion on improvements in cross-border transport links. Overall there is excellent  cooperation between my Department and the relevant Departments in Northern Ireland in the transport area. I look forward to this cooperation continuing and to availing of any other mutually beneficial opportunities in relation to cross-border transport links in the future.</p></reply>

The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads, such as the Naas Bypass widening, is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. As part of its remit the NRA monitors collisions across the national road network. The assessment and prioritisation of individual national road projects is a matter for the NRA within its capital budget and in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Osberstown interchange and the Sallins bypass the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources, supplemented by State road grants. The selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is, therefore, a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  Owing to the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in roads expenditure in recent years. The reality is that the available funds do not match the amount of work that needs to be done to maintain existing road infrastructure or address demands for new road improvement projects. Funding in 2008 was &euro;2.3 billion while funding this year is around &euro;730 million for the national, regional and local road network.  Unfortunately, the current financial realities are such that the budgets proposed for my Department for 2016 and 2017 indicate that capital funding will continue to be very tight, and my ability to progress new projects and PPPs is limited.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge it is important to restore over time capital funding for the transport sector to ensure that infrastructure is maintained but, as of now, I am not in a position to give a commitment in regard to funding of the projects in question, although I acknowledge their national and local importance.</p></reply>

My Department lobbied extensively against the application of the UK HGV road user levy in Northern Ireland, but the UK Minister for Transport refused to grant any significant exemption beyond the small sections of NI roads that criss-cross the border.</p>  <p>  In relation to the introduction of a pay-as-you-go road user charge regime in Ireland, this is being examined by my Department through the cross-Departmental Group on HGV Road Charging.  The Group issued a consultation paper on potential reform of the commercial vehicle motor tax system to stakeholders on 27 November.  On completion of the consultation process, the Group will submit a report with its recommendations to myself and the Ministers for Environment and Finance for consideration.</p>  <p>  This Government recognises the importance of the haulage sector to the Irish economy and we have introduced a number of initiatives to support Irish hauliers.  We have introduced legislation to clamp down on unlicensed hauliers, a new on-line system for haulage licensing has been introduced and we have cut costs for hauliers through the fuel duty rebate, which is worth up to &euro;33 million per annum to the industry. </p>  <p>  In November I met with the Minister for Finance and representatives of the Irish hauliers to discuss options for reducing the motor tax burden on the haulage sector.  The Minister for Finance at this meeting committed to reducing road tax on HGVs of over 12 tonnes, with a tapering of the reduction for vehicles below that weight, starting in this year's Budget. </p></reply>

As recognised in the report, financial constraints have meant that investment in road infrastructure has had to be cut back significantly.  The priority at present for the DTTS regional and local road grants is the maintenance/renewal of roads and regional road bridges.</p>  <p>  On the national side, a limited number of PPP road projects are being progressed, including the important Gort to Tuam scheme on the Atlantic Corridor which is at construction stage with a view to completion in 2018 and the New Ross Bypass and Enniscorthy to Gorey scheme in the south east on which the procurement process is being progressed.</p>  <p>  Scope for funding specific improvement projects will depend on the availability of funding under future capital investment plans. </p>  <p>  Recommendation 18 relates to improving and integrating the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) into the overall public transport system. In April 2012 responsibility for managing the RTP was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA) as part of new arrangements for integrated local and rural transport approved by Government in January 2012 to deliver on its commitment in the Programme for Government to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services as much as practicable. This role for the NTA, coupled with its national remit for securing the provision of public passenger transport services, enables the development of better links between local and rural transport services and scheduled bus and rail services.</p>  <p>  A restructuring of the RTP, announced in July 2013, involves the establishment of 17 Transport Co-ordination Units (TCUs) in place of the 35 RTP Groups which have delivered rural transport services until now.  To date 11 TCUs have been established and the remainder will be very shortly. The NTA has replaced the RTP groups as the contracting party for service provision and the new TCUs will manage the contracted services on behalf of the NTA. </p>  <p>  Recommendations 26, 27 and 28 are tourism related. A new Tourism Policy Statement entitled &ldquo;People, Place and Policy &ndash; Growing Tourism to 2025&rdquo; was presented to Cabinet by me on 14th   January last and was approved by the Government.  The Policy Statement, which will be published shortly, notes the recommendations on tourism that are contained in the CEDRA report.  Following publication of the Tourism Policy Statement, I will establish a Tourism Leadership Group (TLG), consisting of representatives of key public sector bodies and representatives of the tourism sector, to begin work on an Action Plan to deliver the objectives in the Tourism Policy Statement.  The development and growth of tourism outside the main urban centres will be a central consideration in the deliberations of the Tourism Leadership Group.</p>  <p>  The National Cycle Network (NCN) Programme is allocating approximately &euro;23.5 million over the period 2012 to 2016 (including &euro;10 million allocated under the recent stimulus package) to advance routes that will provide valuable transport and recreational infrastructure, with the added potential to enhance tourist activity for the areas concerned.  Fifteen cycling projects were completed by local authorities across the country with &euro;7 million in funding provided under the first tranche of NCN funding for the years 2012/2013.  A further 3 projects shared in funding of &euro;6.3 million under the second tranche of NCN funding for the years 2014-2016.  </p>  <p>  Under the &euro;10 million investment package for greenway development announced as part of the &euro;200 million national infrastructure package, 11 cycling projects were selected to share in this funding.</p></reply>

This is a legal obligation in Ireland and throughout the EU. Roadworthiness testing standards are aimed at detecting any wear and tear, deterioration or alterations that could affect the roadworthiness or safety of the vehicle.<br/><br/>Since October 2013, the certificate of roadworthiness (CRW) issuing system is aligned to the longstanding obligation to have commercial vehicles tested annually.The period of validity of the CRW is calculated by reference to the last test due date.  A delay in completing the test has the effect of reducing the validity period of the CRW.This change was introduced for the purpose of ensuring that an operator who did not test the vehicle by the due date does not gain any economic advantage over an operator who tested their vehicle in accordance with the legal requirements.  <br/><br/>The Road Safety Authority is in the process of reviewing the system as it applies to vehicles which are off the road for more than a year and I expect to receive the outcome of this review later this year.  Any adjustments to the system in respect of vehicles overdue the test by more than one year which have been off the road would need to be assessed against a background of  strong overall compliance as well as road safety considerations. </p></reply>

The policy identified the delivery of a National Cycle Network as the key to achieving this objective. </p>  <p>   Following the policy launch the National Roads Authority were requested to carry out an initial scoping study into the potential scale and extent of a National Cycle Network for Ireland.  An advisory group, including all the necessary stakeholders, was set up under the auspices of the National Trails Advisory Committee to assist in this work.  The initial scoping study, published in 2010, identified routes to connect settlements around Ireland with populations of 10,000 or more and which would tie into tourist attractions around the country.  The resulting potential network consisted of 13 corridors totalling around 2,000 kilometres in length.  </p>  <p>  It is accepted that in order to grow cycling  in Ireland as a valuable tourism resource it is necessary to have a network of routes of substantial length and quality in place which will be challenging and attractive to cyclist (and walkers) of all levels. </p>  <p>  The 277 kilometre Dublin-Galway corridor was identified as the ideal corridor to progress first for a number of reasons, the main being that the extensive route when completed would make sense in its own right, it also uses, for much of the route, land in State ownership. The route also forms part of Eurovelo 2 which provides a ready-made branding for the project that will assist in attracting overseas visitors.</p></reply>

The funding proposal from the scheme's trustees was approved last year by the statutory regulator for pensions, the Pensions Authority, and has been implemented since 31 December 2014.

This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments. Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.</p>  <p>  Unemployed persons not in receipt of payments may however be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB training for unemployed people (at present there are 1,009 upcoming day courses and 552 upcoming evening courses). Although not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course, they may receive some support for expenses on travel, meals and accommodation. </p>  <p>  An unemployed person who does not qualify for a social welfare payment due to the assessment of their means may be eligible to sign for social insurance contribution credits.</p>  <p>  Persons who sign for credits for three months (78 days) of the last six months are eligible to participate in the JobBridge programme. </p>  <p>  Persons signing on for credits for 12 months or longer over the previous 18 months are entitled to participate on Momentum courses through Solas, provided that they have been actively seeking work, however they will not receive any payment. </p>  <p>  Persons signing for credits for six months or more are entitled to participate on ETB-run VTOS courses subject to availability. In the case of VTOS courses, participants do not receive a training allowance but may receive travel and lunch allowances.</p>  <p>  Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also open to people regardless of their social welfare status. </p>  <p>  Many other services are also available to people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment. For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices regardless of their social welfare status.</p>  <p>  In short, the Government is committed to supporting as many people as possible to participate more fully in employment and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers they may encounter in finding and sustaining employment.</p></reply>

The eligibility criteria for both initiatives are in line with the Government&rsquo;s policies on focusing resources of maintaining the work readiness and employability of jobseekers who suffered jobs losses in recent years.  In order to maintain this focus, persons not in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment from the Department are not eligible for selection for these initiatives. <br/><br/>The Deputy should note, however, that persons in receipt of disability allowance (DA), and certain other payments for the Department, are eligible for a range of other activation initiatives.  These include JobBridge, the rural social scheme, and community employment, back to work and back to education allowances, as well as other education and training supports.  Additionally, a range of supports designed specifically to support people with disabilities and employers (to offer and maintain job opportunities for people with disabilities) are funded and delivered by the Department.  These include a wage subsidy scheme and resources to offset the costs of providing reasonable accommodation for the employment of a person with disability or restricted mobility.<br/><br/>A person in receipt of DA is permitted and encouraged to work if their medical advisor recommends that such work is of a rehabilitative or therapeutic nature.  They can earn &euro;120 per week without it affecting their DA claim.  Persons in receipt of DA also have the option of giving up their allowance in favour of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if they wish to be considered for schemes such as Gateway and T&uacute;s, once they meet the eligibility criteria.<br/><br/>Advice on opportunities across a range of work placement, internships, self-employment, training and educational supports and options can be accessed via the Department&rsquo;s offices and Intreo centres and further information is available on the Department&rsquo;s website - .</p></reply>

It is considered secondary, rather than primary, in nature.  </p>  <p>  As the increase is not a payment in its own right but an increase to an Irish social welfare payment, it cannot be paid to people who are not in receipt of such a payment in the first place. </p>  <p>  There are no plans to change the rules or nature of this allowance.  In relation to those receiving payments exclusively from other countries, the needs of older people are often provided for in different ways by these countries.  While the Irish system provides a basic pension, supplemented by allowances and other benefits, the approach adopted by other countries can be very different, with each country providing for the needs of older people in the way it sees fit.  The fact that a living alone allowance is not paid by another administration merely reflects a different approach to providing for the needs of older people.</p>  <p>  It is, of course, open to recipients of pensions from other countries to apply for pensions under the Irish system and they can do this in a number of ways.  Those with a mixture of social insurance contributions from this country, other EU countries or from countries with which Ireland has reciprocal agreements, may qualify for a pro-rata contributory pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a non-contributory pension if they can satisfy a means test.  Improvements made to the income disregard in recent years have made it easier for people to qualify for a pension and receive the additional support provided under our pension system for those who live alone. </p></reply>

This entitlement is not conditional on the employee having worked during those 13 weeks.  After the 13-week period referred to in Section 13(3) of the Carer&rsquo;s Leave Act, the general rules regarding public holidays, set out in Sections 21 and 22 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, apply to employees on Carer&rsquo;s Leave.  Section 21(4) of the 1997 Act provides that a part-time employee must have worked at least 40 hours for their employer during the 5-week period ending on the day before the public holiday to qualify for the public holiday entitlement.  Public holiday entitlement can take the form of whichever of the following the employer determines: (a) A paid day off on the public holiday (if the public holiday falls on a day that the employee normally works)(b) A paid day off within a month of that day(c) An additional day of annual leave(d) An additional day&rsquo;s pay Calculation of pay for public holiday entitlement is determined by S.I.

The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.</p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p>  <p>  On the basis of the findings of the report of the Advisory Group I am satisfied that the self-employed have adequate access to income support in the event of business failure.

Rent supplement recipients and expenditure each year since 2008 is provided in the attached tabular statement. A county breakdown by recipients is also provided for 2014. The Department does not maintain statistics on rent supplement on a housing authority basis. Statistical reporting on a housing authority basis is a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<br/><br/>Under the legislation governing entitlement to rent supplement, the Department must establish that the applicant is a bona fide tenant. There is no specific restriction on landlords renting to family members provided all of the qualifying criteria for the scheme have been met. In determining whether the applicant is a bona fide tenant the Department will generally require documentary evidence including:<br/><br/>- Details of the lease agreement,<br/><br/>- Proof of ownership of the property,<br/><br/>- Documentation that the tenancy has been registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board,<br/><br/>- Documentation detailing payments made to the landlord.<br/><br/>In view of the current supply difficulties in the private rented sector, the Department has put a number of measures in place to support rent supplement recipients at risk of homelessness through increased flexibility within the administration of the rent supplement scheme. The Interim Tenancy Sustainment Protocol introduced in the Dublin region during 2014, has provided support for some 340 families to date through increased rental payments.<br/><br/>Engagement with the various Dublin housing authorities by individuals at risk of homelessness is also a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<br/><br/><b>Table 1: Rent Supplement End of Year Recipient Numbers &amp;amp; Expenditure: 2008 to 2014</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Recipients</th><th>Cost &euro;000</th></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>74,038</td><td>440,548</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>93,030</td><td>510,751</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>97,260</td><td>516,538</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>96,803</td><td>502,747</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>87,684</td><td>422,536</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>79,788</td><td>372,909</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>71,533</td><td>338,135</td></tr></table>2014 Revised Estimate<br/><br/><b>Table 2: Rent Supplement by County, December 2014</b><table><tr><th>COUNTY</th><th><div>RECIPIENTS</div></th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td><div>1,086</div></td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td><div>414</div></td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td><div>1,336</div></td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td><div>8,273</div></td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td><div>1,812</div></td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td><div>26,453</div></td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td><div>3,591</div></td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td><div>1,736</div></td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td><div>3,698</div></td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td><div>1,011</div></td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td><div>1,008</div></td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td><div>324</div></td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td><div>2,461</div></td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td><div>476</div></td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td><div>2,211</div></td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td><div>1,619</div></td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td><div>1,726</div></td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td><div>352</div></td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td><div>1,041</div></td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td><div>687</div></td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td><div>451</div></td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td><div>1,961</div></td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td><div>1,443</div></td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td><div>1,533</div></td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td><div>2,700</div></td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td><div>2,130</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>71,533</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

In addition, their employers pay 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 8.5%)</p>  <p>  Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory) as well as  guardians payment (contributory), maternity benefit and adoptive benefit. </p>  <p>  Self-employed workers may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person&rsquo;s income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  It is recognised that the downturn in the economy had an impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels.  This may be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance purposes.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment. </p>  <p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral. </p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. </p>  <p>  On the basis of the findings of the report of the Advisory Group I am satisfied that the self-employed have access to income support in the event of business failure and I do not propose to make any changes to the PRSI system at this time.  I will keep the situation under review.</p></reply>

The price of Brent crude oil has fallen by about 45 per cent in euro terms (nearly 50 per cent in US dollar terms) since the end of September, when the macroeconomic projections that underpin Budget 2015 were finalised. For the most part this is a positive development, and will likely have a favourable impact on real economic activity in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a net energy importer and, as such, falls in oil prices have a positive impact in the short term. Lower energy prices reduce firms' input costs, thereby improving profitability and competitiveness. At the household level, lower energy prices are likely to lead to an increase in real disposable incomes through lower inflation and this can help people to reduce indebtedness or increase consumption on other goods and services.</p>  <p>  In terms of quantifying the impact, a reasonable rule of thumb is that, everything else being equal, each sustained &euro;10 per barrel reduction in the price of oil boosts the level of real GDP by somewhere in the region of 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points.</p></reply>

This is known as the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) and was introduced on 7 December 2005 and reduced on a number of occasions since, most recently in Finance (No 2) Act 2013 which, among other things, reduced the SFT from &euro;2.3 million to &euro;2 million from 1 January 2014.</p>  <p>  A higher limit, known as a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT), may be claimed where the capital value of an individual's pension benefits exceeded the SFT on the date of its introduction or on the various dates on which it was reduced. Accordingly, the legislation provided that such individuals could protect his or her higher pension values, subject to certain ceilings and conditions, by applying to the Revenue Commissioners for a PFT certificate.</p>  <p>  In order to be in a position to make a correct application for a PFT the individual concerned had to request a statement from the administrator of his or her defined benefit and/or defined contribution arrangement certifying the capital value of that individual's pension rights at that date, as calculated in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 2C of Part 30 of, and Schedule 23B to, the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p>  <p>  Up to June 2014, when the PFT process was paper based, each application was examined and documentary evidence was requested to verify the accuracy of the submission and that the correct amount of a PFT was being claimed.</p>  <p>  Since the advent of the new electronic system in July 2014 an individual is required, when making an application for a PFT, to provide basic identifying information about him or herself and the various pension arrangements of which he or she is a member. In addition, the individual has to obtain from the administrator of each pension arrangement of which he or she is a member, a statement certifying the amount of the individual's pension rights as at 1 January 2014 relating to that arrangement, calculated in accordance with the provisions of the relevant legislation.</p>  <p>  The legislation places an obligation on both the individual making the PFT application and the administrator(s) of the pension arrangement(s) to retain the certifying statements for a period of 6 years after the last benefit is paid out and to make them available to an officer of the Revenue Commissioners on being required by a notice in writing to do so. </p>  <p>  Section 787P (2) (b) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 requires the PFT applications to be made electronically within 12 months of the electronic system becoming available (1 July 2015). After this closing date for applications, Revenue will launch a compliance program to ensure the electronic applications are correct and comply fully with the terms of the legislation.   </p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014 when the SFT was reduced to &euro;2 million, Revenue has issued 159 PFT certificates.</p></reply>

However, the European Commission's original proposal on Money Market Funds (MMF) and in particular the proposed capital buffer to be applied to constant net asset value MMFs, would in my view do considerable damage to the constant net asset value MMF industry, and we have argued to this effect at the Council's working group.<br/><br/>Constant net asset value funds are an important source of funding for banks and corporates and the buffer proposal which would constitute an effective ban could lead to a sudden and large scale outflow of funds to third countries and a loss of liquidity in the real economy. <br/><br/>Reform of MMFs should be considered and proportionate. It should also be consistent with developments elsewhere globally so as to ensure no harmful impact on the EU market or disparity between the EU and the United States.  The US rules did not include a capital buffer and will, in effect, preserve most of constant net asset value funds in the U.S.<br/><br/>Ireland will work with other member states and with the Commission to develop a better approach to regulation of MMFs in Europe. It is my view that both constant and variable net asset value MMFs could be more effectively regulated through a package of enhanced regulation which includes fees and gates and this remains my preferred solution.</p></reply>

The levy is a charge on the trustees of funded pension schemes and on the insurers and administrators who manage the assets of such schemes and personal pension plans and it is they who are liable to pay the levy. It is up to those trustees and administrators to decide in each case whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension funds or pension plans for which they are responsible. I have no detailed or specific information on the decisions taken by trustees and administrators in this regard. <br/><br/>With regard to the numbers of persons to whom the public service pension reduction (PSPR) applies, I am informed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that the number of public service pensions in payment at the end of each of the years 2012, 2013 and 2014 is estimated to have been 140,000, 144,500 and 149,000 respectively.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-03a.294.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015020300059#WRG02600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 and 239 together.</p>  <p>  Price stability in the euro area has been defined as annual inflation of close to but not exceeding 2 per cent (inflation being measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices).  Inflation in the euro area has been below levels consistent with price stability for some time and, in fact, has been in negative territory for two months in a row now.</p>  <p>  With policy rates effectively at zero per cent, the ECB announced an expanded asset purchase programme on January 22nd to include bonds issued by euro area central governments, agencies and European institutions. This programme will be carried out from March until at least the end-September 2016, or until the path for inflation is consistent with price stability.</p>  <p>  The Irish economy should benefit through a number of channels. For example, the economy should benefit directly through improved financing conditions for households and firms. In addition, the euro area is Ireland's single largest export destination; therefore, by supporting real economic activity and raising inflation in the euro area this will underpin export growth in Ireland. Monetary policy also works through the exchange rate channel the depreciation of the euro will provide a boost to Irish exports. Raising the rate of inflation in the euro area will also help Ireland achieve our twin goals of improving competitiveness and increasing tax revenue. So, over time, the success of quantitative easing will be seen in terms of stronger growth rates in Ireland and across the euro area, and inflation rates consistent with price stability.</p>  <p>  Of course, the accommodative stance of monetary policy in the euro area raises the possibility of asset price bubbles. This must, however, be seen in the context of weak credit growth both in Ireland and in the euro area as a whole. Moreover, the macroprudential tools that the Central Bank is to impose are designed to reduce the probability of property market bubbles.</p>  <p>  At a European level, there has been a strengthening of institutional arrangements governing the risk architecture since the global financial crisis with, for example, the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board.  </p>  <p>  Many details in terms of the implementation of the ECB's expanded asset purchase programme are not, as yet, publicly available and these are, of course, an internal matter for the ECB and National Central Banks. The ECB has, however, indicated that its asset purchase programme in relation to sovereign bonds will be restricted to bonds with a remaining maturity of greater than 2 years but less than 30 years.  It has also indicated limits on the Eurosystem's holdings of any one issuer's bonds, taking into account existing holdings.  These limits refer to the same 2-year to 30-year maturity window.  To be precise, holdings within the 2-year to 30-year remaining maturity window will not exceed 33 per cent of an issuer's tradeable bonds within the same window.  In summary therefore, the limits imposed on the holding of bonds are limits on the Eurosystem as a whole, rather than on the Central Bank of Ireland, and relate to bonds within the purchasable window, that is, those with between 2 and 30 years remaining maturity.</p>  <p>  The majority of the bonds acquired by the CBI in exchange for the Promissory Notes have more than 30 years remaining.  Currently, this is the case for &euro;19 billion out of the original &euro;25 billion nominal issuance.  Therefore, the holding of these bonds by the Central Bank of Ireland will, in practice, have no impact on the amounts that can be purchased by the CBI.  While other bonds within the 2-year to 30-year maturity window that are already held by the CBI and other National Central Banks will be taken into account for the purposes of calculating the amounts that can be purchased, I understand that this still leaves ample room for participation by the CBI in the asset purchase programme. In addition, I understand that the Bank s disposal strategy for its Special Portfolio - those bonds acquired following the liquidation of IBRC and the exchange of the Promissory Notes remains as previously announced, that is, it will continue to dispose of the bonds as soon as possible, provided conditions of financial stability permit. Disposals may or may not impact on the purchasable amounts under the asset purchase programme depending on whether the bonds sold are within the 2-year to 30-year maturity window.  </p>  <p>  I also wish that note be taken of the fact that, as the Central Bank of Ireland and other Eurosystem National Central Banks do not generally make regular detailed statements of their investment holdings available, I do not have information on these holdings to hand.  The Central Bank will report on the holdings in its Special Portfolio - those bonds acquired following the liquidation of IBRC and the exchange of the Promissory Notes in its regular Annual Report which is scheduled to appear in April.  In addition, the Eurosystem makes available information on bonds purchased in its previous Securities Market Programme on its website but this information does not cover the investment holdings to which I have already referred.</p></reply>

Where there are non-euro borrowings such as those from the UK Treasury and International Monetary Fund (IMF) which form part of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support as well as some short-term paper liabilities, the NTMA as part of its debt and risk management strategy has in place a hedging programme whereby non-euro borrowings are swapped back into euro using derivative instruments such as currency swaps and foreign exchange contracts. The aim of the hedging programme is to manage exchange rate risks and protect the Exchequer from potential currency volatility. As the vast majority of the gross National Debt is either denominated in, or swapped into, euro there is practically no impact on the value of the debt as a result of recent currency fluctuations.  </p>  <p>  The main non-euro borrowings are from the UK Treasury and International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support. At end-2014 the outstanding balances on these loans were Sterling 3.2 billion and SDR 11.8 billion respectively. IMF loans are denominated in SDRs (Special Drawing Rights), an international reserve asset created by the IMF. Its value is based on a basket of four key international currencies euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling and U.S. dollar. There are also some short-term paper non-euro borrowings with outstanding balances of &pound;0.15 billion and US $2.3 billion respectively at end-2014. </p>  <p>  At end-2014 the Exchequer had cash and other financial asset balances of &euro;14.8 billion. In calculating National Debt these cash and other financial asset balances are netted off Gross National Debt. With the exception of one very small US Dollar deposit, all of the cash and other financial assets are denominated in euro. </p>  <p>  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund follows a policy of reducing its foreign currency risk by in excess of 50%. Following this currency hedge, the Fund has approximately &euro;1 billion worth of exposure to foreign currencies from non-Euro denominated investments. The Fund has therefore, purely from a currency perspective, benefited from the recent strengthening of foreign currencies. </p></reply>

It is projected that Ireland will reach its MTO in 2018. As part of the annual European Semester process, the European Commission assesses the budgetary strategy of each Member State by reference to its SPU.</p>  <p>This year, Ireland's SPU will be accompanied by a Spring Economic Statement (SES). The SES will set out in broad terms the Government's economic priorities and fiscal strategy over the medium term.

The scheme was extended in the recent Budget to include repairs, renovations and improvements carried out on rental properties whose owners are liable to income tax.  Only works carried out by a tax compliant contractor qualify under the Incentive.  It is clear from the figures provided that the Incentive has been very successful in boosting activity in the legitimate construction sector and ancillary services.<br/><br/>The electronic facility to allow homeowners claim their tax credit has been available since 13 January 2015. To date, 1,970 claims have been processed, representing total tax credits of &euro;4.3m. The approach of linking activity to tax compliance is proving to be a successful means of levelling the playing pitch when legitimate traders are competing with those operating in the shadow economy. This approach will be continued and I would encourage those in the shadow economy to regularise their tax affairs and avail of the opportunities that will continue to come on stream in the construction sector.<br/><br/>The information requested is as follows:<br/><br/><b>Table 1 General Statistics on Home Renovation activity at 29 January 2015</b><table><tr><th>Number of Works</th><th>20,334</th></tr><tr><td>Number of Properties</td><td>15,487</td></tr><tr><td>Number of Contractors</td><td>4,133</td></tr><tr><td>Value of Works</td><td>&euro;318m</td></tr></table><b>Table 2 Top 5 Activities by Value</b><table><tr><th>Home Extensions</th><th>36%</th></tr><tr><td>General Repairs &amp;amp; Renovations</td><td>21%</td></tr><tr><td>Window Replacement</td><td>13%</td></tr><tr><td>Kitchen Renovations</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Bathroom/Shower/En Suite Improvements</td><td>3%</td></tr></table><b>Table 3 - Top 5 Activities by Number of Works</b><table><tr><th>Window Replacement</th><th>24%</th></tr><tr><td>Kitchen Renovations</td><td>19%</td></tr><tr><td>General Repairs &amp;amp; Renovations</td><td>12%</td></tr><tr><td>Home Extensions</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Bathroom/Shower/En Suite Improvements</td><td>6%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The strategy pursued has been to seek proposals from experienced operators with:<blockquote>- a deep understanding of the business processes and specialised data processing involved, in particular, to match data to create a Single Borrower View and to develop reliable matching and credit scoring algorithms;<br /><br />-a proven capacity to provide and maintain modern IT facilities and information security capabilities; - a reputation for reliability and accuracy. </blockquote>The Central Bank considered alternative approaches to delivering the CCR, such as developing or buying a software solution and building the necessary operational capability within the Bank. Options were compared across a number of criteria, including risk, timeline to implement and cost. Awarding a contract to an experienced operator is favoured as the safest approach to delivering the CCR in a cost effective and timely manner.</p></reply>

The ESRI published a paper in August 2014  <i>Updated Estimates on the Extent of Negative Equity in the Irish Housing Market</i>. This paper can be accessed at the following link : <br/><br/>The paper estimates the extent of negative equity based on certain assumptions regarding the volume of mortgages, house prices, mortgage term, interest rate, buyer type, Loan-to-Value ratio and level of arrears.  The paper estimates that the total number of mortgage loans in negative equity reached a peak of over 314,000 by the end of 2012.  However, the subsequent recovery of house prices reduced that number - the ESRI estimates that the numbers in negative equity fell by 15% in 2013 and would further improved in 2014 as prices increased.</p></reply>

In the context of negative equity, the Central Bank considers that it is necessary to provide for an exemption for households in such a situation to avoid unduly limiting mobility for such borrowers.  The Central Bank has indicated that there is currently little new lending to such borrowers (less than 300 mortgages were issued by the main banks to borrowers in negative equity in 2014). </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Central Bank do not consider it necessary at this time, for macro-prudential purposes, to introduce a special Loan to Value regime for such borrowers. However, if unintended consequences or adverse behaviour is observed as a consequence of this exemption, or for any other reason it appears appropriate, the Central Bank has indicated that it reserves the right to amend the exemption accordingly. As with all these macro prudential limits, this does not preclude a lender from applying stricter lending standards than contained in the Regulations.</p></reply>

They are specified in the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank.  The Statute is a protocol attached to the TFEU.<br/><br/>The Deputy refers to Article 127(2) of the TFEU which defines the basic tasks to be carried out through the Eurosystem to be:<br/><br/>- to define and implement the monetary policy of the Union<br/><br/>- to conduct foreign-exchange operations consistent with the provisions of Article 219 of the TFEU<br/><br/>- to hold and manage the official foreign reserves of the Member States<br/><br/>- to promote the smooth operation of payment systems.<br/><br/>The ECB is independent in carrying out its mandate and tasks. However, accountability is an important counterpart of its independence. As a European institution, the ECB is accountable in the first instance to the European Parliament.<br/><br/>The President of the ECB regularly reports on the ECB's monetary policy and its other tasks at his hearings before the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Other members of the ECB's Executive Board also appear before the European Parliament to address specific issues. Beyond that, the ECB replies to written questions by MEPs, which are published together with the ECB's answers in the Official Journal of the EU and on the ECB's website.<br/><br/>As part of the ECB's reporting obligations, the President also appears before the plenary session of the Parliament to present the ECB's Annual Report, on which Parliament, as a rule, adopts a resolution. <br/><br/>The Central Bank of Ireland is a member of the Eurosystem, which consists of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the National Central Banks (NCBs) of the nineteen Member States that have adopted the euro. This group of institutions is responsible for conducting and implementing the single monetary policy for the currency union with the primary objective of maintaining price stability. Further details of the Central Bank's involvement in monetary policy formulation at Eurosystem level are set out in its Annual Report.  <br/><br/>In addition to its monetary policy role, on the basis of Article 127(6) of the TFEU and of the Council Regulation (EC) No 1024/2013 (the &quot;SSM Regulation&quot;), the ECB is responsible for specific tasks concerning the prudential supervision of credit institutions established in participating Member States. It carries out these tasks within a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) composed of the ECB and the national competent authorities. The SSM is responsible for the prudential supervision of all credit institutions in participating Member States. It confers key supervisory tasks on the ECB and establishes the framework in which the ECB and the national competent authorities, including the Central Bank of Ireland, are to co-operate on the prudential supervision of credit institutions. <br/><br/>The SSM took effect from 4 November 2014, and it is early days yet to be making judgement on its performance. In line with the SSM Regulation the ECB is required to report to Council and to Parliament on an annual basis in relation to the execution of the tasks conferred on it. In addition there is democratic accountability at both the European and national levels. National parliaments of the participating Member States, through their own procedures, may request the ECB to reply in writing to any observations or questions submitted by them to the ECB in respect of the tasks of the ECB under the SSM Regulation. The national parliament of a participating Member State may also invite the Chair or a member of the Supervisory Board to participate in an exchange of views in relation to the super­vision of credit institutions in that Member State together with a representative of the national competent authority. <br/><br/></p></reply>

These transactions yielded total sales proceeds of &euro;5.5 billion.  <br/><br/>Under Section 202 of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA is prohibited from disclosing confidential information. Confidential information is defined to include information relating to debtors, including the property assets securing their loans. The Act also provides that, on acquisition of a loan, NAMA takes over the obligations of the participating institution, one of which is the contractual duty of confidentiality to debtors. NAMA cannot, therefore, disclose details about debtors as to do so would leave it open to litigation. Information about individual debtors or guarantors is also protected against disclosure by the Data Protection Acts with which NAMA must comply as a data controller.  <br/><br/>Confidential information is also defined to include information which, if disclosed, would tend to place NAMA at a commercial disadvantage. The disclosure by NAMA of the identity of the purchasers of its loans and property assets and the commercial terms of individual sales transactions would place it at a significant commercial disadvantage relative to its competitors. Other financial institutions engaged in deleveraging their loan portfolios in Ireland are not required to disclose such information. It is important that NAMA, which is seeking to maximise the return to Irish taxpayers from its loan portfolio, should not be placed at a commercial disadvantage by disclosing information which would benefit its competitors and potential future counter-parties. It is also likely that some potential purchasers would decline to bid on NAMA assets and loan sale transactions if they were aware that transaction details were to be published subsequently.  <br/><br/>I am satisfied therefore that disclosure by NAMA of the details of purchasers and of the commercial terms of sales transactions, other than what purchasers themselves choose to put into the public domain, would ultimately have the effect of reducing NAMA's financial return. This would be completely contrary to its statutory obligation, under Section 10 of the NAMA Act, to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State. <br/><br/>The Deputy may be aware, and it is a matter of public record, that the IRES REIT has purchased two residential portfolios (the Orange and Rockbrook portfolios) that were offered for sale by NAMA and that the proceeds from these sales have been used to reduce debtor indebtedness. It is also a matter of public record that Green REIT has been a purchaser of assets sold by NAMA debtors and receivers, including part of the Central Park portfolio in Dublin. I am also advised that the Hibernia REIT purchased the Observatory Building which is located in the South Docks area of Dublin and which was offered for sale as part of NAMA's Redwood portfolio.<br/><br/>NAMA acquired and manages loans, not property, and its financial statements are prepared on this basis in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. In its financial statements, NAMA discloses aggregate information about its sales activity and the overall profit or loss generated by it. NAMA's Section 55 Report and Accounts for the third quarter of 2014 was published recently and is available on . It includes information on the overall profit generated on property and loan sale transactions by NAMA since its inception. It shows that, from inception to 30 September 2014, the overall profit recorded in respect of property and loan sale transactions was &euro;432m. </p></reply>

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits and tax bands cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couples in civil partnerships.</p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980), which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  </p>  <p>  From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners.  Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status.  It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting.  It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  </p>  <p>  There would also be legal issues with regard to 'connected persons'. To counter tax avoidance, 'connected persons' are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits.  However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and for persons connected with them.</p>  <p>  With regard to the cost to the Exchequer, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that unmarried cohabiting couples are not separately identified in tax statistics.  It is not possible, therefore, to provide the information requested by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  However, it is estimated that the cost of extending married treatment under the income tax code to such couples could be of the order of &euro;1 million per annum for every 1,000 cohabiting couples registered.</p>  <p>  Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.</p></reply>

It is an offence, under section 102 (1) (b) (ii) of the Finance Act 1999, to use marked diesel in a motor vehicle and a person convicted of that offence is liable to a fine of &euro;5,000.<br/><br/>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they undertake action on an ongoing basis to detect the illegal use of marked diesel in motor vehicles, including, in particular, the stopping of vehicles and checking of their fuel. As a result of this action, 1,318 detections of the illegal use of marked fuel were made in 2013 and 1,111 in 2014.<br/><br/>The numbers of convictions that were obtained in 2013 and 2014 arising from detections of the illegal use of marked fuel were 228 and 286, resulting in the imposition in those years of total fines of &euro;620,100 and &euro;772,250 respectively. In addition, 177 vehicles were seized in 2013 and 155 in 2014.<br/><br/>I am advised also that, in certain defined categories of cases where marked fuel is detected in a vehicle, Revenue is prepared to refrain from the institution of legal proceedings where the person concerned agrees to pay a compromise sum in lieu of prosecution. These would include cases where a person is detected for the first time in charge of a motor vehicle, other than a commercial vehicle, where marked fuel is illegally present. The numbers of cases dealt with in this way in 2013 and 2014 were 627 and 614, resulting in payments to Revenue by the persons in question of &euro;822,145 and &euro;819,630 respectively.<br/><br/>Action against the illegal use of marked fuel is an integral part of Revenue's wide-ranging programme of action against all forms of fuel fraud. An extensive range of new measures have been introduced over recent years to tackle such fraud, including enhanced supply chain controls and the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker. Key measures include the following.<br/><br/>- The licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of fuel criminals to get laundered fuel on to the market.<br/><br/>- A new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders from October 2012, which was designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering.<br/><br/>- New requirements in relation to fuel traders' of stock movements and fuel deliveries were introduced to ensure that data are available to assist in supply chain analysis.<br/><br/>- New supply chain controls were introduced from January 2013 following significant investment in new IT systems. These returns require all licensed fuel traders to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions, to allow the detection of suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution.<br/><br/>- An intensified targeting, in cooperation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations.<br/><br/>In addition, Revenue has, in partnership with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK, identified a more effective fuel marker. The new marker will come into operation in both jurisdictions from midnight on the 31 March 2015.<br/><br/>To support further the integrity of the fuel distribution system and to minimise the risk of fraud, I introduced a provision in the Finance (No. 2 ) Act 2013 which will make a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a  use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty at the standard rate of tax. This strengthens Revenue's hand in dealing with such traders.<br/><br/>I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that they will continue to act robustly against all forms of fuel fraud, including the illegal use of marked fuel in motor vehicles.</p></reply>

The Deputy may be interested to note that the ISME Q4 2014 survey reports a refusal rate of 38%.  <br/><br/>The SME Credit demand survey April-September 2014 conducted by Red C on behalf of my Department is the most comprehensive survey of SME credit demand in Ireland, covering 1,500 respondents and involving over 5,000 direct calls to SMEs.  This survey reports the refusal rate for this period at 14%.<br/><br/>As the Deputy may be aware, the Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by either Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Reviewer John Trethowan and his team have overturned 55% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office to date.  Further details are available at <br/><br/>The Government recognises that small businesses play a central role in the sustainable recovery of the Irish economy. To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has been focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources. <br/><br/>Since the beginning of 2014 the focus has shifted towards the collation and examination, on a monthly basis, of more granular data on the funding of the activities of SMEs from both AIB and Bank of Ireland, the wider banking sector and increasingly the non-bank funding sector. Having completed a process of deleveraging, both AIB and Bank of Ireland are now concentrating on growing their balance sheets.In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending in the period up to 2016, particularly lending to the domestic market, and have put on record their commitment to the SME sector. Both banks have recently reported increased year on year sanctioning activity for lending to the SME sector. <br/><br/>My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small and medium sized businesses, and the SME State Bodies Group provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance.  <br/><br/>Some of the main policies introduced by this Government to encourage access to credit for small and medium businesses include:<br/><br/>- The Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014. On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at <br/><br/>- The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established as a means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient finance for growth and also ensuring that credit provided to SMEs meets their needs rather than the needs of those who offer the credit.  The SBCI, from available funding of some &euro;800 million initially, will provide a more extensive range of financing than is currently offered in Ireland such as loans of longer duration that encourage and enable growth of our SMEs. The SBCI will have a lower cost of funding and this benefit must be passed onto SMEs. The SBCI is working with its first lending partners to provide initial funding to the SME sector by the end of 2014. The initial products will be launched in Q1 2015 with traditional bank lenders and importantly, new credit providers from beyond the traditional bank sector being involved which means SMEs will benefit from greater choice as well as more funding.  More information on the SBCI can be found on .<br/><br/>- The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, will shortly bring legislation to the Oireachtas which enable the development of a more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme.<br/><br/>- The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides loans of up to &euro;25,000 to small businesses who have been refused credit by commercial banks. Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund. This scheme is currently being reviewed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with a view to making proposed changes to enhance its effectiveness. <br/><br/>The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently the Department of Finance, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit with a view to taking appropriate actions as warranted to ensure that SMEs in Ireland have the opportunity to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.  In this context, the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 includes a dedicated chapter and associated integrated set of actions to support the financing for growth in the SME sector.  </p></reply>

Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  <br/><br/>The Local Property Tax (LPT) legislation does not contains a relief from Local Property Tax for Stamp Duty payments. The inter-Departmental group, chaired by Dr Don Thornhill, which was established to consider the structures and modalities of a property tax (the &quot;Thornhill Group&quot;) gave detailed consideration to this issue. The Thornhill Group recommended against giving a relief for Stamp Duty, not least because such a relief would not be targeted at cases of need.<br/><br/>While some individuals had a significant Stamp Duty liability, they may have been able to claim mortgage interest relief on interest up to &euro;20,000 per annum; and individuals who bought properties since 2004 can continue to claim mortgage interest relief until 2017.<br/><br/>There are no plans to provide relief from LPT for those who paid stamp duty.</p></reply>

A relief did exist in the form of a benefit-in-kind exemption where child care facilities were provided by an employer. However, this was abolished in Finance Act 2011, following a recommendation made by the Commission on Taxation, which cited equity issues in relation to those parents whose employers did not provide such facilities. No official figures are available for this exemption as it was not required to be reported to Revenue. However, it was estimated that the yield to the Exchequer from the abolition of the exemption would be &euro;6 million in a full year.<br/><br/>An exemption from tax is available on income of up to &euro;15,000 per annum for individuals who mind up to three children in their own home and the Deputy's question may be in relation to this scheme. The following table shows the cost of this relief for the 5 years up to and including 2012, the most recent year for which figures are available:<br/><br/><b>Cost of relief</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Cost &euro;M </th><th>Numbers Availing</th></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>0.8 </td><td>440 </td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>0.8</td><td>470 </td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>0.8</td><td>450 </td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>0.9</td><td>510 </td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>1</td><td>560 </td></tr></table>I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children. In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents. These include the Community Child care Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community child care services to enable them to charge reduced child care fees to qualifying parents, the Child care Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free child care places to qualifying Solas and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school. Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided. </p></reply>

The National Payments Plan outlines that if Ireland were to match best practice in Europe, savings of up to &euro;1 billion per annum could be made to the economy. </p>  <p>Good progress has been made in a number of areas.  Data published by IPSO (now BPFI) shows a 41% reduction in the volume of cheques and other debit paper instruments used in Ireland from 2008 to 2013, a 29% reduction in the aggregate value of cash withdrawn from ATMs, while debit card usage has increased 88% over the same period.  This migration has been supported by the implementation of a number of recommendations in the NPP, such as the implementation of 'e-Day' by Government on 19th   September last year, the date from which Government Departments, Local Authorities and State Agencies will no longer use cheques in their dealings with businesses.</p>  <p>  On the specific queries that the Deputy has raised regarding basic bank accounts, the Strategy for Financial Inclusion called for the nationwide launch of a Standard Bank Account as a first step in promoting Financial Inclusion.  A pilot project for a Basic Bank Account was run, which finished on 31 March 2013 after a 9-month pilot period. A total of 205 accounts were opened during the Pilot, which the Financial Inclusion Working Group (FIWG) felt was disappointing. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Working Group on the Pilot project noted a number of reasons for this, including the view of stakeholders that one of the key elements required as part of the preparations for a successful national roll-out of a Standard Bank Account is greater involvement by An Post and the credit unions.  My Department is currently exploring with the relevant stakeholders how to make progress on this issue.</p></reply>

It was not possible for Revenue to breakdown the data on a county basis in the timeframe available for responding to the Question. <br/><br/>In regard to the second part of the Deputy's Question on the use of Attachment Orders, I am advised that the data requested is set out in Tables 2 and 3 below for the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. The data in relation to January 2015 is not yet available.<br/><br/>By way of general information in regard to the deployment of its various debt collection and enforcement options, including Attachment, Revenue has assured me that before any such action is considered, the defaulting taxpayer is given every opportunity to engage and agree mutually acceptable arrangements in respect of the outstanding debt. The enforcement process only starts where there is no meaningful engagement by the taxpayer in seeking realistic solutions. Revenue has also assured me that Attachment Orders are normally only deployed where other enforcement options have failed to secure the outstanding tax debt. <br/><br/>The deployment of Attachment Orders is provided for by Section 1002 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which allows Revenue to instruct  financial institutions to transfer funds from any account in the name of a defaulting taxpayer, or, to instruct any third party 'relevant person' that owes a debt to the defaulting taxpayer to pay those funds directly to Revenue. <br/><br/>When Revenue serves an Attachment Order (or a Revocation Order) on a 'relevant person' in respect of a taxpayer, it also forwards a copy of the Notice to the taxpayer for information. Within ten days of receiving the Attachment Order, the 'relevant person' must deliver a written 'return' to Revenue, confirming whether or not any debt is due to the specified taxpayer. Where there is a debt due to the taxpayer, this amount must also be paid directly to Revenue within the ten day period. <br/><br/><b>Table 1</b><table><tr><th>Tax Year </th><th>Number of Self-Assessed Income Tax Taxpayers</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>554,715</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>557,174</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>570,364</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>590,459</td></tr></table>[Data in relation to the tax year 2014 is not yet available]<br/><br/><b>Table 2 Attachment Orders 2011-2014</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th><div>2011</div></th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th><div>2012</div></th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th><div>2013</div></th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th><div>2014</div></th><th>-</th></tr><tr><td>County</td><td>No.</td><td>Value&euro;000</td><td>Payments&euro;000</td><td>Avg.

The aggregate capital value of the contracts is c. &euro;70m.<br/><br/>I understand that overall compliance in relation to the pilot clause has been good. The Department of Social Protection and its local Intreo offices are working closely with the appointed contractors to support the pilot initiative and there has been strong positive engagement from the contractors involved in each of the projects. <br/><br/>The most recent monthly progress reports (Dec 14) provided by each of the main contractors involved indicate that they are on target to achieve the cumulative percentages set out in the pilot clause. At present, across the three contracts the contractors' reports indicate that there are 50 employees who had been unemployed for more than 12 months and 17 further employees who are either apprentices or trainees.<br/><br/>The Department of Social Protection, through its local Intreo offices is continuing to liaise with the contractors on all three contracts to identify and fill further positions from the live register.<br/><br/>Once initial evaluations on the performance of the clause have been undertaken any necessary amendments will be tabled at GCCC before they are incorporated into the &euro;1.5bn, PPP element of the &euro;2.25bn Stimulus Programme that I announced in July 2012.  </p></reply>

In line with the Public Sector Reform Plan 2014   2016 my Department is progressing solutions to design and deliver complete data on the funding received by the not-for-profit sector. The establishment of such an evidence base will assist Government in evaluating and delivering a higher quality impact assessment of public spending. </p>  <p>  The Irish Nonprofits Project Limited (formerly INKEx) previously worked on the development of a single repository of financial, governance and other relevant data on the not-for-profit sector. This project was designed to significantly enhance the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of Government support and interaction with the non-profit sector. It was part-funded through significant State investment. However funding was withdrawn due to economic constraints and the project was put into abeyance. </p>  <p>  The Irish Nonprofits Project Limited (formerly INKEx) have secured philanthropic funding toward the re-establishment of this project and I have committed to providing match funding. My Department are engaged in discussions with the Irish Nonprofits and philanthropic organisations on the practicalities and structures involved in re-establishing this project. Any investment will build on the earlier investment and seek to realise the value of the State's previous funding of this project. This is in keeping with the Government's aim to develop alternative models of delivery and to provide for greater public accountability and transparency in Government grant-making and its support of the non-profit sector.</p></reply>

By logging on to this website, individuals can also register to be notified by e-mail or text message of vacancies as they arise. <br/><br/>In Budget 2015, it was announced that there would be a targeted programme of recruitment into the Civil Service to address service needs and a shortfall in key skills which commenced in late 2014 and is ongoing in 2015. <br/><br/>General Service recruitment competitions currently underway include the following:<br/><br/>Clerical Officer<br/><br/>A recruitment competition to fill clerical vacancies was advertised in mid-2014. Over 28,000 applications were received and, to date, just over 300 individuals have been assigned to vacancies. Approximately 130 have been assigned in 2015 and clerical vacancies notified to PAS over the next year to 18 months will be filled from this competition.<br/><br/>Administrative Officer (Graduate Recruitment) Competitions <br/><br/>The graduate Administrative Officer competition was advertised in October 2014 and it is likely that at least 20 will be assigned from that competition. The Administrative Officer competition to fill Graduate Economist posts in the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) is ongoing and interviews will take place shortly. <br/><br/>Executive Officer<br/><br/>A competition for Executive Officer was recently advertised attracting approximately 13,500 applicants. The selection process is currently underway.<br/><br/>Executive Officer (ICT)<br/><br/>The selection process is also currently in train to fill vacancies for the position of Executive Officer (ICT) <br/><br/>Principal Officer and Assistant Principal Officer Competitions <br/><br/>An open competition for Principal Officer will take place in the first quarter of 2015. It is also expected that competitions for Assistant Principal - both open and interdepartmental - will take place in 2015.  <br/><br/>Following a selection process PAS creates panels of qualified individuals from which vacancies are filled. It is not possible to determine in advance the total number of vacancies to be filled from such panels as this is determined from time to time having regard to demand from Departments and Offices. <br/><br/>The above recruitment programme supports Action 8 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan, to &quot;open up recruitment and promotion processes at all levels&quot;. Under the Renewal Plan the established policy of open competition for all senior management positions (Assistant Principal and higher) will be extended.

The purpose of the negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is to reduce barriers to trade and investment in order to generate jobs and growth in the EU and the US.According to assessments made by the European Commission and other European bodies, a comprehensive TTIP could over time boost the EU's GDP by 0.5% per annum, resulting in 400,000 additional jobs across the EU. <br/><br/>Ireland has particularly strong economic links with the US, with over 118,000 people employed in 585 US companies here.  The total level of trade (imports and exports) between Ireland and the US in 2012 was &euro;55 billion.  The US is Ireland biggest merchandise export market.  The most recent data from the CSO shows that Ireland&rsquo;s services exports to the US increased by 40% in 2012.  Notwithstanding the present high level of trade, significant benefits could be derived from a comprehensive and ambitious TTIP.  <br/><br/>My Department commissioned a study on the potential impact of the TTIP for Ireland. This study is intended to assist in guiding the Irish position in the negotiations.  The study is expected to be finalised shortly and published in early 2015.<br/><br/>The initial findings of the study show that the benefit to Ireland would be more than double the EU average, with 1.1% added to GDP.  Other preliminary findings include increased exports (2.7%), increases in real wages (1.4%) and investment (1.6%).  Opportunities are expected mainly in manufacturing &ndash; pharmaceutical and chemical industry, electrical machinery and other advanced machinery; in certain services and in processed foods.  <br/><br/>The scope of the EU Commission&rsquo;s mandate to negotiate with the US on TTIP is comprehensive.  It is therefore very much in the interests of Ireland that the  partnership will be structured according to the mandate, which is publicly available and can be found on the EU Council&rsquo;s website at <br/><br/>.<br/><br/>The important question of investment protection in the TTIP was the subject of a public consultation by the EU Commission, the results of which were published on 13 January, 2015.  [.]The EU Commission has stated that it will be discussing the report with Member States and the European Parliament, and with different stakeholders, and that following these consultations, it will develop specific proposals for the TTIP negotiations.  I very much welcome this approach, and I believe that it is important to take time to have open and constructive discussion following the Commission&rsquo;s report that will inform the next steps.</p></reply>

In County Meath alone, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland client companies employ 7,900 people in full and part time employment.</p>  <p>  Additionally, two US companies opened their offices in Kells in November 2014, as a result of the Succeed in Ireland Initiative, which is implemented by Connect Ireland on behalf of IDA Ireland.  The inclusion of Kells in the national Regional Aid Map will further enhance the prospects of attracting new investment and the expansion of existing enterprises, both foreign and indigenous, in County Meath  .</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 was launched on Thursday last, 29th   January.

Today it stands at 10.6% and we are on track to exceed our target of 100,000 additional jobs by 2016. We are now setting a goal to bring employment to 2.1 million by 2018 &ndash; 2 years ahead of our original target.</p>  <p>  We are determined that every region will benefit from the recovery and we will be announcing over the coming weeks and month a series of actions to help drive the achievement of this goal.</p></reply>

Cubis Industries, another Enterprise Ireland client company is a subsidiary of CRH, and manufactures preformed access chamber systems for utility markets e.g. power and water companies, rail and road developers and telecommunications. Tubbercurry Engineering<b></b>provides mechanical engineering services to industrial projects including the Commercial, Retail, Industrial and Pharmaceutical sectors and companies.<br/><br/>In the past three years, 2012 to 2014 inclusive, there have been a total of 4 IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential investors to County Roscommon, all of which took place in 2013. IDA sponsored itinerary visits by potential investors include visits to multiple locations where there are greenfield or current turn-key property solutions for them to consider. The majority of these solutions, with the exception of Dublin and to a lesser extent Cork, are usually situated on the outskirts of towns and cities. <br/><br/>For reasons of client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity, such as the potential impact on any future property transactions that may arise from a possible investment, it is prudent to provide details of such visits on a county by county basis only. IDA Ireland has assured me that the Business and Technology Park in Roscommon has been marketed by IDA Ireland over the past number of years for appropriate mobile investment and I am assured that will continue in the future, as appropriate.<br/><br/>While for similar reasons, IDA Ireland does not comment on upcoming site visits or on current or upcoming pipeline, the Agency has informed me that it is confident that it will be in a position to make an announcement relating to an investment in Roscommon before mid-year.I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage. <br/><br/>As the Deputy is aware, the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 was launched on Thursday last, 29<sup>th</sup>January.

The location of these sites are set out in the attached tabular statement.  In addition, there are a number of units in IDA owned Business Parks in the Cork Region which are also available for use.  These units which are a mix of IDA owned and private finance are located as follows.<br/><br/>In Kilbarry, there is approximately 4,200 square metre Industrial Unit (Private Finance) and 4 Cluster units approx. 298 square metres each (Private Finance).  In Cork Business and Technology Park there is approximately 1,164 square metre IDA owned (3 storey).  While in Youghal there are two units (privately owned), one 2,298 square metres and one 10,313 square metres. <br/><br/>The availability of an adequate supply of marketable, serviced land and office and industrial/technology buildings in advance of demand is a key element in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s ability to compete for mobile FDI. <br/><br/>The availability of property solutions eliminates the lead times normally associated with acquiring property, enables clients to plan their property needs with a greater degree of certainty and allows for the commencement of projects at an earlier date by eliminating much of the difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction.<br/><br/>At the end of 2014, there were 146 IDA Ireland client companies in Cork, City and County employing 28,545 people in full and part time employment.  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with all these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.  <br/><br/>IDA Ireland positions Cork as being a strong cluster in Pharmaceuticals and Medical Technologies (Pfizer, Novatis, GSK, Janssen, Abbvie, Eli Lilly, Gilead, Pepsico, GE, Stryker, Gilead, Astellas among others).  The success of Cork for attracting life sciences has seen the growth in associated support services such as experienced building firms and project managers, clean room providers, specialist recruitment agencies, tailored educational courses etc. <br/><br/>The region also has a significant cluster of ICT companies such as Apple, Dell, McAfee, Trend Micro, EMC, VMware, among others.  The cluster of companies has led to the growth in suitably qualified individuals, experienced in working with multi-national corporations.  <br/><br/>IDA Ireland has also informed me that a new cluster is emerging in the region based around the marine and renewable technologies.  The development of the Irish Maritime and Energy Resource Cluster (IMERC) will be a strong magnet of attraction for the South West.  IMERC will harness and integrate diverse research and industry expertise through the development of the innovative cluster which incorporates the Beaufort Research Laboratory, The Irish National Maritime College and The Naval Service of Ireland.<br/><br/><b>Table shows sites owned by IDA Ireland in Cork, City and County, which have potential for use for inward investment purposes.</b><table><tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Town</th><th>County</th><th>Property Type</th><th>Net Hectares </th></tr><tr><td>Mallow B &amp;amp; T</td><td>Mallow</td><td>Cork</td><td>Land</td><td>1.30</td></tr><tr><td>Charleville </td><td>Charleville</td><td>Cork</td><td>Land</td><td>1.65</td></tr><tr><td>Kanturk</td><td>Kanturk</td><td>Cork</td><td>Land</td><td>2.47</td></tr><tr><td>Kilbarry B&amp;amp;T Park</td><td>Cork City</td><td>Cork</td><td>Land</td><td>57.53</td></tr><tr><td>Carrigtohill B&amp;amp;T Park</td><td>Carrigtohill</td><td>Cork</td><td>Land</td><td>24.30</td></tr><tr><td>Ringaskiddy </td><td>Cork City</td><td>Cork</td><td>Land</td><td>155.56</td></tr><tr><td>Fermoy B &amp;amp; T</td><td>Fermoy</td><td>Cork</td><td>Land</td><td>6.05</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Carrigtohill East </td><td>Carrigtohill East</td><td>Cork</td><td>Land</td><td>53.16</td></tr><tr><td>Youghal Springfield Estate</td><td>Youghal</td><td>Cork</td><td>Land</td><td>1.87</td></tr><tr><td>Youghal Foxhole</td><td>Youghal</td><td>Cork</td><td>Land</td><td>1.23</td></tr><tr><td>Fermoy Rathealy </td><td>Fermoy</td><td>Cork</td><td>Land</td><td>1.00</td></tr><tr><td>Skibbereen</td><td>Skibereen</td><td>Cork</td><td>Land</td><td>3.86</td></tr><tr><td>Bandon Laragh Estate</td><td>Bandon</td><td>Cork</td><td>Land</td><td>1.83</td></tr><tr><td>Cork B&amp;amp;T Park</td><td>Cork City</td><td>Cork</td><td>Land</td><td>0.83</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>Total circa. </td><td>312.63</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The 2015 Action Plan for Jobs was launched on January 29th in ICON Plc.     The Action Plan process is working. Almost 80,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012. Indigenous exports and foreign direct investment are at all-time record levels.  Our competitiveness ranking internationally has climbed to 15th. The rate of unemployment has declined from a peak of 15.1 per cent at the start of 2012 to below 10.6 per cent at end 2014. The achievement of 100,000 additional jobs by 2016 will be an important milestone. Beyond this, we want to replace all of the jobs lost during the economic crisis and bring employment to 2.1 million in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2015 will be a further step along the way in meeting this medium-term goal for Ireland. The themes in this year&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs build on the reforms of previous years in the areas of competitiveness, innovation and entrepreneurship and in fostering new sources of growth for the economy,</p>  <p>  The 2015 Action Plan contains a suite of 380 actions to ensure we deliver not just the promised 100,000 additional jobs by 2016, but an additional 40,000 jobs this year alone. Specifically, in 2015, Enterprise Ireland will target the creation of 13,000 gross new full-time jobs in indigenous firms. IDA Ireland will target the creation of 14,000 gross new jobs in multinationals. It is estimated that every direct job created in agency assisted firms indirectly supports another job in the wider economy thereby making a strong contribution to the overall target of getting to full employment in 2018.  </p>  <p>  Key among the initiatives in the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs are six new Disruptive Reforms: significant projects that require cross Government collaboration that can make a real difference to enterprise and jobs in a short space of time. </p>  <p>  Entrepreneurship is one of our Disruptive Reforms for 2015, supporting new job opportunities at local level. Through driving implementation of the actions in the new National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement we will double the jobs impact of start-ups in Ireland over the next five years, from 93,000 currently. We will increase the number of start-ups, the survival rate, and the capacity of startups to grow to scale, all by 25 per cent. </p>  <p>  A major reform of support for creating job opportunities in 2014 was the launch of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), to make the operating environment for businesses and the system for delivery of support to micro and small enterprises more coherent, responsive and conducive to entrepreneurship at local level. The LEOs are now the first-stop-shop for those beginning a new business as well as those wishing to expand their existing one. The LEOs provide financial and non-financial supports to help micro and small businesses to expand their growth potential and the LEO staff can advise clients directly or direct them to the most appropriate source of support for their project.   </p>  <p>  Each LEO is developing a Local Enterprise Development Plan for 2015 which will aim at further boosting enterprise growth within the area within their remit by building on the achievements to date and setting targets for job creation and enterprise growth in their area. Key targets in the Plans will include new business start-ups, business expansions and jobs created or sustained as well as wider economic impacts such as exports, mentoring, training and enterprise promotion. It is expected that this reform will continue the momentum for sustained growth in job creation in each County across the country.   </p>  <p>  In addition, we will launch an Entrepreneur Partnering Programme, linking start-ups with established businesses. The new Startup Refunds for Entrepreneurs Scheme (SURE) will provide additional finance for entrepreneurs.  We will support 130 new entrepreneurs via the New Frontiers Programme, support 185 Competitive and High Potential Startups. </p>  <p>  The other Disruptive Reforms include the National Talent Drive in 2015, which will ensure we have the skills supply to underpin the new economy, including through the provision of 1,250 extra ICT places for students in 2015 and developing new apprenticeships in key sectors of the economy. We will also establish the Low Pay Commission, to undertake analysis and make a recommendation on the appropriate level of the national minimum wage. We will shortly launch competitive funding initiatives of up to &euro;25 million to support entrepreneurship and innovation in the regions. </p>  <p>  These Disruptive Reforms sit alongside the long menu of actions to support sales and exports, get credit flowing, drive innovation, cut red tape, and stimulate the domestic sectors (agri-food/marine, retail, tourism, construction). </p>  <p>  The APJ2015 reforms and initiatives are focused on making it easier to do business and to create jobs in every part of the country and we are determined through these actions to create the conditions to achieve the target of 100,000 extra people at work by 2016 and contribute to our longer-term goal of restoring the country to have 2.1 million at work in 2018.</p></reply>

There are currently 117 such centres across the country.     There are currently no specific proposals to extend the Community Enterprise Centre Scheme to fund Business Development Management in 2015.  The last scheme rolled out was in 2012 and 2013 when Enterprise Ireland provided funding of &euro;2 million to support the recruitment of a total of 46 Business Development Managers.  </p>  <p>  On the wider issue of the Centres, the success levels, occupancy levels and sustainability of jobs at the Centres varies and therefore I asked Enterprise Ireland to review the operations of the Community Enterprise Centres in the context of regional enterprise development and how the Community Enterprise Centres and the Local Enterprise Offices might work more closely in support of business start-ups before giving further consideration to the matter.  </p>  <p>  Under the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs, my Department developed a framework for the preparation of Regional Enterprise Strategies. This framework provides a model for co-ordinated action across public bodies and other stakeholders to maximise the potential of each region to support enterprise development and jobs growth, based on the strengths and assets of the region. </p>  <p>  The application of the template was tested in the Midlands region towards the end of 2014 and will lead to the publication and implementation of a Regional Enterprise Strategy for the Midlands in early 2015. Similar strategies for the other regions will be commenced over the course of the year, on a phased basis, and will include specific actions on the part of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the LEOs, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and other public bodies active in each region to promote enterprise growth and job creation. In this context, my Department and Enterprise Ireland will also work to explore how the Community Enterprise Centre network can best be enhanced to support regional job creation.</p>  <p>As part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, a number of Government agencies will be shortly outlining their regional enterprise plans to map out what they will do to help create new jobs across Ireland.   </p>  <p>  These Regional Enterprise Strategies seek to maximise the job potential of each region. It will provide new funding for enterprise support in the regions and seek to leverage and orient existing funds to target initiatives that enable regions to achieve their full employment potential. A significant regional fund of up to &euro;25 million in competitive funding will be announced to support regional initiatives.</p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s business spans a wide range of activities involving direct interaction with many customers. Every effort is made to ensure that we provide the highest level of service to all our customers.  As regards people with disabilities my Department has two Access officers appointed in accordance with Section 26(2) of the Disability Act. These officers are available to persons with disabilities to provide assistance as required. When a customer with dyslexia makes contact with one of these   officers, arrangements are made whereby the relevant Division makes contact with the individual directly either by phone or in person to go through the paperwork involved and assist/advise as appropriate.  My Department has in the past, made available an audio version of certain schemes on CD for this purpose.  Material is also provided in a large print format when required.  Contact details for the Access Officers are on my Department&rsquo;s Website.   </p></reply>

Stock advice is available online in the Shellfish Stocks and Fisheries Review, prepared by the Marine Institute (MI) and an Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM). According to the 2012 Review, some 1,700 boats, approximately three quarters of the Irish fleet, participated in the fishery between April and October 2012 on all Irish coasts.  Any changes to the management of this fishery are therefore given careful consideration prior to enactment.  The Lobster (Conservation of Stocks) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 591 of 2014), which I signed into law in December 2014, concluded the roll-out of changes to lobster conservation measures which I had announced in May 2014.  The regulations replace and revoke previous regulations with the objective of supporting the reproductive potential of the stock.  In that regard, I am conscious of my responsibilities under the Common Fisheries Policy to strive for sustainable inshore fisheries in the long term.</p>  <p>  The package of enhanced conservation measures I announced in May 2014 were approved following the consideration of over 250 submissions received during an extensive public consultation on the lobster fisheries.  These submissions were reviewed in light of scientific advice and information on the status of the fisheries.  The changes to the lobster management measures are aimed at ensuring the long-term viability of this stock by protecting its reproductive potential.  The most recent stock advice from the Shellfish Stocks and Fisheries Review 2012 noted that the egg production level for the stock is estimated to be below generally accepted limit reference points.  The measures which now apply to the lobster fishery include:</p>  <p>- Continued legal protection in the aforementioned regulations for lobsters v-notched under an incentivised National Lobster V-Notching Programme which provides financial support for fishermen engaged in conservation practice of v-notching live lobsters and returning them to sea to contribute to the reproductive capacity of the stock;</p>  <p>- The introduction of a new maximum landing size for lobster of 127mm, which took effect from 1 January 2015 through the aforementioned regulations;</p>  <p>- An increase in grant aid to fishermen for the voluntary v-notching of lobsters from the existing rate of 55% to a new maximum of 75% of the market price;</p>  <p>- Transitional arrangements that provide fishermen with grant aid of up to 75% of the market price for v-notching oversize lobsters and returning them alive to sea during the first two years of the maximum landing size measure;</p>  <p>- EU regulations prohibiting the landing of lobsters of less than 87mm in carapace length.</p>  <p>  The new maximum landing size measure is expected to be less economically penalising than other possible alternative measures and particularly when provided with financial support under the v-notching programme during the transitional arrangements.  Data from the catch and effort indicators from data collection initiatives conducted by MI and BIM indicates that in the period 2009-2012, the proportion of commercial sized non-v-notched lobsters over 127 mm varied from 0.9 to 2.3%.  I am advised by the Marine Institute that a number of factors point to the conservation value of protecting large lobsters including the far higher number of eggs produced; spawning frequency may be higher in large lobsters as growth and moulting slows down and low natural mortality with lobsters living for more than 30 years and producing more eggs as they get larger.</p>  <p>  I established the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) specifically to give inshore fishermen a voice in policy making and decisions on inshore fisheries management and to work with the Department and the marine agencies in developing robust, scientifically sound measures to support sustainable fisheries into the future.  The first meeting of the NIFF took place on 15 January and the delegates shared fisheries experiences in their different regions and identified a number of common challenges which hampered the development of long-term sustainable lobster fisheries.</p>  <p>  At the meeting I was pleased to have the opportunity to brief the delegates on the upsurge in v-notching of lobsters since my announcement to increase financial support up to a maximum of 75% in May 2014 and I committed to monitoring the impact of the new maximum landing size through the v-notching programme.  The national figures for 2014 record an increase of 19,000 lobsters presented for v-notching, over twice the number conserved in 2013, and over &euro;230,000 was provided to fishermen in financial support.  I advised delegates of scientific advice from the Marine Institute on the reproductive value of large lobsters to contribute to sustainable stocks.  I believe that the figures for 2015 programme will provide a useful dataset from which the impact of the new measures can begin to be assessed.  I have invited the delegates to bring forward proposals from their respective Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums on how some of the specific challenges faced by this fishery could be addressed, including projects which could be funded under the forthcoming EMFF operational programme, for discussion at the next NIFF meeting.</p></reply>

I hope to be in a position to open GLAS as soon as agreement is reached with the EU Commission in the near future.  The GLAS will be the main source of support under my Department for farmers with Hen Harrier habitat on their holding.  The proposed payment under GLAS for farmers who undertake the Hen Harrier action is &euro;370 per hectare subject to a maximum payment of &euro;7,000, if they qualify for GLAS Plus.  This rate is based on the additional costs involved in protecting and enhancing the habitat, and the income foregone as a direct result of that.  The actual designation of the land, however, is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p></reply>

If he meets the eligibility criteria, he will then enter the selection process and compete with all other eligible applicants for recruitment into the Defence Forces.  The selection process consists of psychometric tests, fitness test, interview, medical and security clearance.  From the information provided, it appears that the individual&rsquo;s age, he is currently 26 years old, would be a limiting factor.  He is not eligible to join the Army as a General Service Recruit as he will not be under the age of 25 years of age on the closing date for applications in any future competition.  However, he may be eligible on age grounds for other Defence Forces recruitment streams. </p>  <p>Plans for recruitment competitions in 2015 have not yet been finalised.

However, as he will turn 27 years of age in October 2015, if the closing date for Naval Service Recruits is after this date, he would be ineligible to apply.</p></reply>

I indicated to the Committee that, while I am prepared to examine matters they wish to bring to my attention, I am anxious that no unrealistic expectations about what can be achieved are raised. </p>  <p>  Following that meeting in July the Stardust Relatives' and Victims Committee submitted two reports (compiled by a researcher associated with the Committee) to my Department.  The researcher subsequently sought the return of these reports prior to them being examined and my Department complied with this request.  My Department has, through the Stardust Relatives' and Victims Committee, requested that the decision to withdraw these reports be reconsidered.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Mr. Paul Coffey SC was appointed in 2008 by the then Government, with the agreement of the Victims Committee, to review the case made by the Committee for a new inquiry into the fire.  His report was published in January 2009.  He concluded that the original Tribunal finding of arson was a hypothetical one only and that no-one present on the night can be held responsible.  He further concluded that in the absence of any identified evidence as to the cause of the fire, the most another inquiry could achieve would be another set of hypothetical findings, which would not be in the public interest.  The then Government accepted Mr. Coffey&rsquo;s findings and motions were passed in both Houses of the Oireachtas endorsing his conclusions and expressing sympathy with the families.</p>  <p>  I wish also to inform the Deputy that allegations raised by the Stardust Relatives' and Victims Committee and their representatives in relation to certain matters are the subject of an ongoing investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

As the Deputy is aware, Ireland has a dualist legal system and therefore does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by them, including the amendment of domestic law as necessary. </p>  <p>  A team has been charged with examining all outstanding obstacles to ratification, and has nearly completed the first phase of its work, which includes identifying all areas which will need attention to make ratification possible.  An Interdepartmental Committee is in place, and met recently to review issues and the action and timeframe required to tackle them.  Many of these issues involve amending unsuitable and outmoded language and in some cases, archaic legal provisions, in existing legislation.  Another key task which is underway involves examining how the important issue of Reasonable Accommodation can be achieved in a meaningful way within our Constitutional framework as interpreted by the Supreme Court.</p>  <p>  Progress towards ratification therefore continues to be made. One of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed is the enactment of capacity legislation.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill will comprehensively reform existing legislation governing capacity and will provide a series of options to support people with decision-making capacity difficulties to make decisions and exercise their basic rights in line with the principles of the Convention.  The Bill is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</p></reply>

An application for appointment may be submitted by a person who is interested in obtaining an appointment, or a third party may submit a nomination in respect of a person considered suitable for appointment.  Nominations are generally received from public representatives.  A local Garda Superintendent can also request an appointment in a particular area in the public interest.  <br/><br/>There is no qualifying examination involved but appointees are required to be of good character and they are usually well established in the local community.  Persons who are members of professions or employed in occupations which engage in legal work or related activities and members of the clergy are, as a matter of practice, not appointed because of their occupation.  Civil servants are usually only appointed where the performance of their official duties requires an appointment (i.e. <i>ex-officio).</i>Persons convicted of serious offences are considered unsuitable for appointment.  <br/><br/>Should he wish to do so, the person referred to can submit an application for appointment which will then be considered having regard to the particular needs of the Dublin 3 area.</p></reply>

The term &lsquo;on-the-run&rsquo; was used to refer to these cases although it was not entirely accurate in the sense that, in practice, it also covered people living openly in the community - the key issue was whether they would face prosecution.  Over subsequent years it was recognised publicly by the Irish and British Governments that dealing with these cases was a logical follow on from the Good Friday Agreement&rsquo;s provisions relating to the release of prisoners.</p>  <p>  The scheme to which the Deputy refers was an administrative scheme operated by the Northern Ireland Office in respect of the UK.  The Government was not party to the issuing of letters by the British Government or to any specific arrangements under that scheme.</p>  <p>  As part of a protracted process both Governments had announced in late 2005 proposals for addressing the on-the-runs issue.  The UK Government had formulated legislative proposals.  The Government here had undertaken to operate in tandem with the UK in dealing with this issue and had announced a scheme whereby the President&rsquo;s power under the Constitution relating to pardons would be operated in relevant cases.  As the UK Government&rsquo;s legislation was not proceeded with the Government here did not proceed with a scheme in this jurisdiction.  Subsequently, the NIO proceeded with the administrative scheme referred to above.</p></reply>

However, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the detail of the particular case.  However, on receipt of the Garda report I will contact the Deputy directly with any further information which it may be possible to give. </p>  <p>  More generally, there are a range of legislative provisions, including provisions for a range of court orders, which may be applicable in the sorts of cases referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  These include provisions under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 which provides for offences of assault, harassment, coercion or threatening behaviour.  Section 10(1) of the Act provides for the offence of harassment, including by means of the telephone, by persistently following, watching, pestering, besetting or communicating with another person.  Where a person is convicted of such an offence the court may issue a restraining order requiring that the person shall not communicate by any means with the victim or shall not approach within a specific distance of the victim&rsquo;s home or place of work.  It is also an offence to breach such a restraining order.</p>  <p>  Even where a person is acquitted of harassment a court can issue a restraining order if, having regard to the evidence, the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is a related provision in section 101 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which allows a Court to make a restriction or movement order in respect of a person convicted of certain scheduled offences, including harassment. </p>  <p>  There are also the incremental procedures provided under the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  These provide for Garda warnings, good behaviour contracts and behaviour orders in relation to children.  With regard to adults they provide for warnings and the making of a civil order by the court. </p>  <p>  The Domestic Violence Acts 1996 and 2002 (as amended) provide protections for a spouse, a civil partner (within the meaning of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010) and a person living with another person in an intimate and committed relationship, as well as protections for a parent in relation to a non-dependent adult child who is living with them and a parent with a child in common with the other parent, regardless of whether the parents live with each other.  In addition there is provision for protections in relation to an adult person living with another person.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I can advise the Deputy that work is currently being undertaken to draft proposals to reform and consolidate the Domestic Violence Acts with a view to enactment later this year.</p></reply>

The conditions are that the applicant must: be of full age; be of good character; have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; have, before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows&mdash; (i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and (ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</p>  <p>  A foreign national who is married to, or is the civil partner of, an Irish citizen for at least three years may apply for naturalisation under section 15A of the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, where the applicant has: been continuously resident in the island of Ireland for the year immediately prior to the date of his or her application; and has in addition been resident in the island of Ireland for two out of the four years prior to that year.</p>  <p>  The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law.  Section 15A provides that the Minister may waive certain conditions for naturalisation if satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.</p>  <p>  An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) on 19 November, 2014.

The on-line Naturalisation Residency Calculator available on the INIS web-site at www.inis.gov.ie can be used as a guide to whether an individual satisfies the naturalisation residency conditions and, if not, give an indication of how long they should wait before making an application.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established specifically for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

However, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the detail of the particular case. However, on receipt of the Garda report I will contact the Deputy directly with any further information which it may be possible to give.</p>  <p>  More generally, there are a range of legislative provisions, including provisions for a range of court orders, which may be applicable in the sorts of cases referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  These include provisions under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 which provides for offences of assault, harassment, coercion or threatening behaviour. Section 10(1) of the Act provides for the offence of harassment, including by means of the telephone, by persistently following, watching, pestering, besetting or communicating with another person. Where a person is convicted of such an offence the court may issue a restraining order requiring that the person shall not communicate by any means with the victim or shall not approach within a specific distance of the victim&rsquo;s home or place of work. It is also an offence to breach such a restraining order.</p>  <p>  Even where a person is acquitted of harassment a court can issue a restraining order if, having regard to the evidence, the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is a related provision in section 101 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which allows a Court to make a restriction or movement order in respect of a person convicted of certain scheduled offences, including harassment.</p>  <p>  There are also the incremental procedures provided under the Criminal Justice Act 2006. These provide for Garda warnings, good behaviour contracts and behaviour order in relations to children. With regard to adults they provide for warnings and the making of a civil order by the court.</p>  <p>  The Domestic Violence Acts 1996 and 2002 (as amended) provide protections for a spouse, a civil partner (within the meaning of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010) and a person living with another person in an intimate and committed relationship, as well as protections for a parent in relation to a non-dependent adult child who is living with them and a parent with a child in common with the other parent, regardless of whether the parents live with each other.  In addition there is provision for protections in relation to an adult person living with another person.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I can advise the Deputy that work is currently being undertaken to draft proposals to reform and consolidate the Domestic Violence Acts with a view to enactment later this year.</p></reply>

The legislative vehicle to achieve this is the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Bill 2014 which has passed Second Stage in the Dail.  The Bill provides for a broad range of medical services without charge to women who were resident in these institutions.  These health services are as follows:<br/><br/>(a) General Practitioner and surgical services<br/><br/>(b) Drugs, medicines and surgical appliances<br/><br/>(c) Nursing services<br/><br/>(d) Home help services<br/><br/>(e) Dental, ophthalmic and aural services<br/><br/>(f) Counselling services<br/><br/>(g) Chiropody services<br/><br/>(h) Physiotherapy services<br/><br/>There is no means assessment in regard to any of the above services which will be provided to these women and, in addition, they will be exempt from charges for acute in-patient services.<br/><br/>With regard to the provision for care representatives, I can advise the Deputy that women who were in the Magdalen laundries are already covered under section 21 of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009 which makes provision for persons to act as care representatives in respect of any person applying for support under that Act.<br/><br/>In addition, the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Bill 2014 is awaiting committee stage in the D&aacute;il.  This provides for a range of options including decision making assistants, co-decision makers, decision making representatives and the public guardian, which are well suited to look after the best interests of the women who were in Magdalen laundries and have capacity issues.<br/><br/>As the Deputy will be aware this Bill is just one part of a wider package of supports for these women.  Under the Scheme the women are eligible for a payment of between &euro;11,500 and &euro;100,000 depending on the length of stay in a relevant institution.  To date, my Department has made decisions on 87% of the cases and a total of over &euro;18m has been paid out so far.  The women are also entitled to top up pension type payments of up to &euro;100 under the age of 66 and up to &euro;230.30 aged 66 and over.  These payments are being paid by the Department of Social Protection.<br/><br/>The Government is committed to full implementation of the Quirke report.</p></reply>

The Campaign runs from 25th November, UN International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to 10th December, Human Rights Day.  On the first day of the campaign last year the Taoiseach and I issued a joint statement to underline the seriousness with which this issue is taken by Government.  After condemning all forms of domestic and sexual violence, the Taoiseach said it was necessary to change societal attitudes. In particular the Taoiseach called on men to support women victims of such violence, if they reported such violence to them.</p>  <p>  I said that all forms of such violence persist as a stain on our humanity.  I welcomed the &lsquo;16 Days of Action&rsquo; as a timely opportunity to raise awareness of the evils of gender-based violence. I advocated the need for everyone to work to ensure that no barrier, no hesitation, no doubt ever comes in the way of reporting suspicions or concerns regarding the occurrence or risk of sexual, domestic or gender based abuse.</p>  <p>  I was also pleased to participate in the debate condemning domestic violence which took place in the Dail on 18 December.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that my Department, through Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, funded voluntary sector organisations to co-ordinate and run local awareness raising activities across the country over the 16 days. Cosc also funded a national MANUP campaign leading up to the 16 days. This campaign aimed to engage men to stand up against domestic and sexual violence.  Funding was also provided to the White Ribbon campaign for activities during the 16 days. That campaign was also focussed on engaging men as advocates against such violence.</p></reply>

In this regard, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to implement a range of strategies based on existing legislation and enhancing partnerships with local communities in County Louth and elsewhere.</p>  <p>  A range of strong legislative provisions are available to an An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and Part 13 of the Act which provide for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.</p>  <p>  The National Model of Community Policing is directed and supported each year by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Annual Policing Plan which underlines the importance of community based policing.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to tackle public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities and business groups, including the hospitality industry, to reduce this type of behaviour and enhance community safety. This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  In addition, new Garda Community Crime Prevention Guidelines, which build on the work of existing partnership programmes such as Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert, were published in January 2013. The guidelines give information and advice to help establish new community "watch" groups and also to revitalise existing groups where necessary. My Department continues to provide funding for the Community Alert programme, administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re in partnership with the Garda&iacute;, which supports the operation of over 1,300 local groups. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also supports the operation of approximately 2,500 Neighbourhood Watch groups countrywide.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Garda Text Alert Scheme, which was developed with the support of Muintir na T&iacute;re, Neighbourhood Watch and the Irish Farmers Association, was introduced in September 2013 and has developed very successfully with in excess of 500 local groups involving over 100,000 subscribers. The scheme provides an additional and effective means for Garda&iacute; to distribute crime prevention information and advice and there are in the region of 200,000 text messages sent under the scheme each month.</p>  <p>  In August last year, I published new guidelines for the operation of Joint Policing Committees (JPCs) which have an important role in supporting local community policing partnerships. The new JPC guidelines emphasise the need to enhance communication between JPCs, which have a strategic co-ordinating role, and the full range of local and community based fora which can contribute to improving community safety and supporting effective policing responses.</p></reply>

The legislative vehicle to achieve this is the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Bill 2014 which has passed Second Stage in the Dail.  The Bill provides for a broad range of medical services without charge to women who were resident in these institutions.  These health services are as follows:<br/><br/>(a) General Practitioner and surgical services<br/><br/>(b) Drugs, medicines and surgical appliances<br/><br/>(c) Nursing services<br/><br/>(d) Home help services<br/><br/>(e) Dental, ophthalmic and aural services<br/><br/>(f) Counselling services<br/><br/>(g) Chiropody services<br/><br/>(h) Physiotherapy services<br/><br/>There is no means assessment in regard to any of the above services which will be provided to these women and, in addition, they will be exempt from charges for acute in-patient services.<br/><br/>With regard to the provision for care representatives, I can advise the Deputy that women who were in the Magdalen laundries are already covered under section 21 of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009 which makes provision for persons to act as care representatives in respect of any person applying for support under that Act.<br/><br/>In addition, the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Bill 2014 is awaiting committee stage in the D&aacute;il. This provides for a range of options including decision making assistants, co-decision makers, decision making representatives and the public guardian, which are well suited to look after the best interests of the women who were in Magdalen laundries and have capacity issues.<br/><br/>As the Deputy will be aware this Bill is just one part of a wider package of supports for these women.  Under the Scheme the women are eligible for a payment of between &euro;11,500 and &euro;100,000 depending on the length of stay in a relevant institution.  To date, my Department has made decisions on 87% of the cases and a total of over &euro;18m has been paid out so far.  The women are also entitled to top up pension type payments of up to &euro;100 under the age of 66 and up to &euro;230.30 aged 66 and over.  These payments are being paid by the Department of Social Protection.<br/><br/>With regard to the pension type payments, Judge Quirke recommended that eligible women should, in addition, and without regard to the &quot;lump&quot; sum payments, receive weekly payments of &euro;100 if under 66 and the equivalent of the State Contributory pension - &euro;230.30 - if over 66 for the remainder of their lives.  These payments are to be calculated net of other State benefits.  This recommendation is being fully implemented by the Department of Social Protection.  The Government decided that the commencement date for the Scheme was the 1<sup>st</sup>August 2013 so therefore, regardless of when an applicant makes an application, if eligible for the scheme, will have appropriate payments backdated to the 1<sup>st</sup>August 2013.<br/><br/>The only issue of back dating mentioned by Judge Quirke is in his 7<sup>th</sup>Recommendation in which he states, &ldquo;Where a written &ldquo;expression of interest&rdquo; (or other written application for inclusion within the proposed Scheme) has been provided to the State by or on behalf of a Magdalen woman who was alive on or after the 19th of February 2013 then that woman will be eligible for consideration to be included within the Scheme. Additional income ex gratia payments (payable to women entitled to payments in excess of &euro;50,000) will not accrue to the benefit of the estate of any Magdalen woman.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The Government is committed to full implementation of the Quirke report.</p></reply>

While the circumstances of particular cases will vary there are a range of legislative provisions, including provisions for a range of court orders, which may be applicable in the sorts of cases referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  These include provisions under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 which provides for offences of assault, harassment, coercion or threatening behaviour. Section 10(1) of the Act provides for the offence of harassment, including by means of the telephone, by persistently following, watching, pestering, besetting or communicating with another person. Where a person is convicted of such an offence the court may issue a restraining order requiring that the person shall not communicate by any means with the victim or shall not approach within a specific distance of the victim&rsquo;s home or place of work. It is also an offence to breach such a restraining order.</p>  <p>  Even where a person is acquitted of harassment a court can issue a restraining order if, having regard to the evidence, the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is a related provision in section 101 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which allows a Court to make a restriction or movement order in respect of a person convicted of certain scheduled offences, including harassment.</p>  <p>  There are also the incremental procedures provided under the Criminal Justice Act 2006. These provide for Garda warnings, good behaviour contracts and behaviour order in relations to children. With regard to adults they provide for warnings and the making of a civil order by the court.</p>  <p>  The Domestic Violence Acts 1996 and 2002 (as amended) provide protections for a spouse, a civil partner (within the meaning of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010) and a person living with another person in an intimate and committed relationship, as well as protections for a parent in relation to a non-dependent adult child who is living with them and a parent with a child in common with the other parent, regardless of whether the parents live with each other.  In addition there is provision for protections in relation to an adult person living with another person.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I can advise the Deputy that work is currently being undertaken to draft proposals to reform and consolidate the Domestic Violence Acts with a view to enactment later this year.</p></reply>

This information is based on incidents reported by staff and management under the Oberstown &quot;Notifiable Incidents Policy&quot;, which is available on the website of the Irish Youth Justice Service.  I have arranged for a copy of this policy to be sent to the Deputy.<br/><br/><b>Notifiable Incidents - Oberstown Campus - 2011 to 2013</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th></tr><tr><td>No. of Assaults on Staff</td><td>26</td><td>20</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>No. of Self Harm Attempts</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>No. of Suicide Attempts</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr></table>The comparable figures reported under the policy for 2014 will be available in the near future and will be forwarded to the Deputy.  I am advised that unfortunately, there was a period in late 2014 when there was a small number of attempts at self harm or suicide involving a number of young people on the campus.  In the case of 1 young person, there was a total of 5 attempts at self harm or suicide and in 3 other cases, 1 attempt each at self harm or suicide.  All such incidents are thoroughly reviewed by management and staff and the Campus Manager has put procedures in place since these incidents to enhance monitoring and security of all children on the campus.<br/><br/>I understand that a number of reviews have taken place over the years in relation to residential units for both children's detention and special care.  These considered issues such as unit size, layout, facilities, the mix of young people and staff numbers.  The new units to be commissioned shortly on the Oberstown campus comprise of 10 bedrooms each, all of which have in-room sanitation and shower facilities.  The units also include multipurpose rooms, recreational areas, kitchen, dining area and laundry facilities.  The units offer greater space, flexibility of use and security than the present units on the campus. The design of the units allows for more than one type of activity to take place at any given time and in separate parts of the unit.  It is envisaged that the new units will be initially used a rate of 8 children per unit and the maximum number per unit will be kept under ongoing review based on the criteria outlined above.<br/><br/>The report referred to by the Deputy is the subject of an ongoing human resources process on the Oberstown campus.  This process is ongoing and I am advised that no steps can be taken at this time which could be interpreted as prejudicial to this process.</p></reply>

In responding to these calls it is important to be clear on what we want this investigation to examine and that we are clear and realistic as to our approach and expectations here. My sole objective is to establish a focused Commission, which can effectively utilise all the necessary powers, to establish relevant facts in a reasonable time frame. On the basis of the available information it would not be appropriate to consider places which were children&rsquo;s homes, infants&rsquo; homes or functioned as orphanages, as being Mother and Baby Homes. These institutions did not provide the specific range of services, in particular supervised ante and post-natal facilities to single mothers and their children which are the central focus of this investigation, in the manner of the homes listed in the terms of reference.</p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, it would not be accurate to suggest children&rsquo;s homes and orphanages are excluded from this Investigation as the relationships of Mother and Baby Homes with such institutions will be explored by the Commission as required by Article 1(VII) of the investigation and in the academic social history module. The Commission will investigate evidence of patterns of referral, relationships and co-operation with other entities and intermediary organisations. This will allow for examination of the practices and procedures pertaining in such institutions including intermediary bodies involved in the placement of children.</p>  <p>  While I do appreciate that there are many additional matters which some might like to be included, and I have responded to the specific issue raised on a number of occasions, it is important to be clear that this is not an investigation into all and every type of institution. It is also the case that other inquiries examined issues relating to a wide range of care settings including children&rsquo;s homes. As we know a major investigation into historical child abuse has already been conducted by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. Its remit was to inquire into the abuse of children in institutions in the period 1940 to 1999 and the broad definition of institutions covered included settings such as the Westbank Orphanage.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the independent Commission has sufficient scope to examine a broad range of concerns, and to make a determination on their relevance to the central issues in question, and where appropriate to make any recommendations to me which the Commission deems necessary. In this regard, I hope that this will reassure those who feel that the process to date may not have fully uncovered information relevant to their specific circumstances.</p></reply>

It is considered that the 38 week model of delivery in one school year is the optimal model in terms of ensuring a high-quality early years experience for pre-school children.  The S&iacute;olta and Aistear frameworks which are central to quality pre-school provision, were developed to support this objective. The current model of delivery also helps to ensure that children and parents become accustomed to the weekly discipline of school attendance with the number of days and hours on which the programme is delivered being approximate to the primary school requirement of 5 days over 38.6 weeks.</p>  <p>  Parents of special needs children, who consider that their child may not be able to meet the demands of 5 days attendance each week, can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, attending for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  Parents of special needs children can also apply for an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  These exemptions apply to special needs children only and there are no plans to make these exemptions available to children generally.</p></reply>

These programmes are, of course, in addition to the support provided to all parents in the form of the Children's Allowance, which is a key Government support to help  families with ongoing costs.</p>  <p>  These programmes include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme which provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.  In the case of full day care, parents qualifying for the higher rate of subvention under the CCS programme can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge for childcare in the participating childcare facility. Pro-rata reductions are made in respect of the other services provided.</p>  <p>  The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme is a universal programme that provides for one free pre-school year for all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  The programme represents an annual investment of approximately &euro;175 million and parents availing of the provision have their annual childcare costs reduced by &euro;2,375 for each eligible child.</p>  <p>  A number of initiatives have been introduced under the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes to support parents who are endeavouring to enter or return to the workforce and who are participating in training or educational courses for this purpose. These include the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides childcare places to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Boards trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  This programme provides &euro;145 per week towards the cost of a full day childcare with pro rata rates for parents who receive a reduced level of service.</p>  <p>  The After-School Child Care (ASCC) programme was introduced under the TEC initiative and provides after-school care for primary school children for certain categories of working parents for a once-off period of 52 weeks. This programme provides &euro;40 per week for after-school care, (or &euro;80 per week where a pick up service is provided) and &euro;105 per week for full day childcare during the holiday period. Pro-rata rate applies for parents who require support over a shorter weekly period. The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme was also introduced and provides up to &euro;80 a week to support qualifying parents who are participating in Community Employment schemes.</p>  <p>  The above programmes represents an annual investment of approximately &euro;260 million and despite the difficult budgetary situation in recent years this funding has been maintained.  This Department will continue to fund these programme, with an emphasis on improving the quality of the service, and as funding becomes available I would hope that the capitation rates for all programmes could be increased to provide further support.</p>  <p>  It is clear that accessibility, affordability and high quality childcare can play a critical role in achieving a number of Government priorities, including improving educational outcomes for children, reducing poverty and increasing parents' participation in the labour market.  To ensure that all the benefits of childcare investments are fully realised, future public investment in childcare must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. I am establishing a cross-Departmental group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children. It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare services.</p>  <p>  This new group will include representatives of the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach and will be led and supported by my Department.  I will be asking that the work of this group be carried out within a relatively short time frame and I expect that the group will be in a position to report to me in the Summer.</p></reply>

The reasons for the exceptional nature of these adoptions are that birth mothers giving their children for adoption typically choose a couple and also that sole applicants are not automatically eligible to adopt but must satisfy the Authority that in the particular circumstances the adoption is desirable and in the best interests of the child.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of non-family adoption orders made</th></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>30</td></tr></table></p></reply>

From persisting problems to new and emerging public health threats, WHO has stated that it needs the capability and flexibility to respond to an evolving environment.<br/><br/>The reform process has three objectives:  programmatic reform to improve people&rsquo;s health; governance reform to increase coherence in global health and managerial reform in pursuit of organisational excellence.<br/><br/>The first cases of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in West Africa were diagnosed in March 2014. However, the virus had been spreading in the region since December 2013. On 8 August 2014, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the Ebola outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).  The current epidemic has killed more than all other known Ebola outbreaks combined. As of 28 January 2015, the cumulative number of cases attributed to Ebola was 22,092, including 8,810 deaths.  There is recognition that the international community must take stock of the lessons learned from the Ebola response to direct WHO reform.<br/><br/>A Special Session on the Ebola emergency took place on Sunday 25 January 2015, ahead of the regular WHO Executive Board which runs from 26 January to 3 February. The objectives of the session were to review the current state of the Ebola response; make recommendations on further steps to stop the epidemic; and discuss how to strengthen WHO's capacity to prepare for and respond to future large-scale and sustained outbreaks and emergencies. Discussions focused on the need for stronger systems at national and international level, and within the WHO, to respond to future health crises.<br/><br/>I am advised by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that Ireland delivered a national statement at the Special Session supporting the statement on behalf of the EU and its Member States. Ireland noted that experience on the ground shows that health systems need to focus on surveillance, logistics and political leadership as vital components in the fight against future epidemics. In particular, human resources and community health systems need far greater attention and investment.  Ireland called on WHO to continue providing strong and close technical support to the current processes being led by the governments of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea for the formulation of national health systems strengthening plans.<br/><br/>Ireland also called on the WHO to ensure that the strongest possible country level leadership is put in place to support the three national governments in meeting the enormous post-Ebola recovery and systems strengthening challenges in the medium term and noted that the key skills required by the WHO Representatives in the coming period will not be Ebola response skills, but systems strengthening and health service delivery skills and experience.<br/><br/>Ireland underlined the pressing need for action now for a global network of skilled health care workers with adequate support systems in place that can be drawn upon with more speed and efficiency.<br/><br/>Finally, Ireland stressed the need for vigilance in moving from the current crisis to longer term recovery and the need to remain alert and ensure that adequate precautions are taken to avoid a reversal of trends or the overstretching of health systems that have become heavily reliant on external support.<br/><br/>The session saw the adoption of a resolution which, inter alia, requests the commissioning of an external assessment on all aspects of the WHO&rsquo;s response to the outbreak, calls for reforms to WHO human resource structures and appointments systems, and requests the setting up of adequate surge capacity to tackle future health crises.  A copy of the Resolution will be published on the WHO website .<br/><br/>A Report by Dr Margaret Chan the Director-General of the World Health Organisation,  to the Special Session of the Executive Board on Ebola is available at .</p></reply>

Services are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers.  The services include the provision of medical/surgical aids and appliances on the basis of assessments carried out by a range of multi-disciplinary staff and based on an assessed need for the service, rather than a specific diagnosis such as muscular dystrophy.  Prioritisation is based on the results of the assessment and a prioritisation process approves items which are essential to ensure safety, dignity and independence.

This programme will be responsible for, among others:<blockquote>Mapping, developing and implementing care pathways for rare diseases;<br /><br />Facilitating timely access to centres of expertise - nationally and internationally;<br /><br />Developing treatment guidelines for many rare disorders; and<br /><br />Developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.</blockquote>In line with this recommendation, a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases has been established in the HSE. A Clinical Lead for this programme has also been appointed. This clinical programme will ultimately be a channel for advancing and implementing other recommendations in the plan, such as those on National Centres of Expertise for rare diseases. <br/><br/>The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office featured prominently in the recommendations of the Rare Disease plan. The HSE is in the process of establishing such a national office. It will, among other functions, provide up-to-date information regarding new treatment and management options, including clinical trials.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the HSE and the EU Commission plan to fund jointly a rare disease post of Information Scientist in the HSE with a number of recommendations in mind. These refer to rare disease registries and the utility of data currently captured in health information systems. <br/><br/>The Health Identifiers Bill - the publication of which was recommended in the plan - has now been enacted. A similar recommendation on the Health Information Bill is being advanced.<br/><br/>My officials have convened a number of informal meetings with some members of the National Steering Group on Rare Diseases.  I expect that a formal Oversight Implementation Group will be established in the near future. </p></reply>

The change from the application of a rigid employment control framework, with its particular focus on a moratorium on recruitment and compliance with employment ceilings and targets, to one operating strictly within allocated pay frameworks will allow for recruitment where it is determined that this can achieve more economical service delivery. <br/><br/>  The HSE has the capacity to recruit where it is necessary to deliver front-line services.  This is reflected in the current recruitment campaign where the HSE is actively recruiting to fill 1,600 approved nursing posts.  These are across all grades and all divisions of the register spanning acute hospitals, community, ID and mental health. Many of these posts are currently being filled on a temporary or an acting basis.  Following a high profile online campaign at the end of 2014 the HSE is currently processing 3,700 applications to meet current needs.<br/><br/>However, there will always be certain posts that are difficult to attract suitably qualified candidates to and individual strategies are developed for these in conjunction with the line managers.  Where frontline staffing shortages exist, the HSE makes alternative arrangements to ensure continued service provision, including recourse to agency cover.  However, it is preferable that sufficient numbers of nurses are recruited to permanent posts to support the most efficient and effective delivery of services.<br/><br/>I have asked the HSE to reply directly to you in relation to the post at the Midlands Regional Hospital.</p></reply>

In our statement of Health priorities for 2015, the Minister for Health and I have reiterated our commitment to implementing the Strategy.<br/><br/>The National Positive Ageing Strategy published in 2013 provides a vision for an age-friendly society and includes four National Goals and underpinning Objectives to provide direction on the issues that need to be addressed to promote positive ageing.  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy, chaired by the Taoiseach, will oversee the implementation of the Strategy<i>. </i>As Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I will drive implementation at political level.  As the Strategy is a cross-Departmental one, my Department has an overall coordinating and collating role and a more direct role for the health-related objectives.<br/><br/>The Objectives included in the Strategy are quite high level and must be followed by the identification of concrete actions which can then be implemented and measured.  My Department has had on-going contacts with all relevant Government Departments and agencies in this context, and while it has been possible to identify actions and activities which are very positive for older people, it has been harder to identify new actions which have been introduced in direct response to the Strategy.  This is perhaps understandable given the resource limitations and competing priorities that apply across all Departments and Agencies, but my Department is committed to bringing renewed impetus to implementation if at all possible.  We are considering how this might be achieved and I will keep the Deputy informed as this process develops.<br/><br/>It is important to point out the many initiatives are already in train which contribute to the Strategy's goals.  For example, in the health sector,  in the area of older people&rsquo;s services and supports, the Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will be completed shortly.  The Single Assessment Tool, which will allow for a systematic assessment of need and allocation of services to older people, is being developed by the HSE, measures are being taken to ensure integrated care for older patients, and palliative care services are being improved.  The Deputy will also be aware of the recent initiative which saw an additional &euro;25 million provided to address the issue of delayed discharges in acute hospitals.  The majority of these patients are older people, and these funds are being applied across both long term and short term residential services and at community level.  As a result the waiting time for funding of approved patients under the Nursing Home Support scheme has fallen to eleven weeks now from fifteen weeks a short time ago.<br/><br/>A Healthy and Positive Ageing Outcomes Initiative (HPAOI) has also been established to implement the research objective of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  It is a joint initiative between the Department of Health, the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies and will run from October 2014 to December 2017, with a commitment to Department of Health funding for a further two years. The Initiative will monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing linked to the Goals and Objectives of the Positive Ageing Strategy.  This will be done primarily through the development of positive ageing indicators to be published every two years.  The HSE will also develop a physical activity communications campaign under the Initiative.</p></reply>

The Policy is designed to ensure an open, consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in the provision of their healthcare.  It is important that the patients and their families are kept informed and that feedback is forthcoming on investigations.  It is vital that we establish the steps that need to be taken to prevent a recurrence of adverse events.  The HSE has now begun implementing the Policy across all health and social services.</p>  <p>  In addition, I intend to bring legislation forward to give effect to recommendations made by the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance to facilitate open disclosure of adverse events to patients.  The Commission recommended that legislation be enacted to provide legal protection for open disclosure and said that such legislation should ensure that open disclosure, which is undertaken in good faith in compliance with national standards, cannot be used in litigation against the person making the disclosure.  These provisions will be in the Health Information Bill.  Because of changes to the Bill since the general scheme was approved by Government, I will be bringing a revised general scheme to Government in the coming months, with a view to publishing the Bill this year.</p></reply>

The Government decided that the preparatory work required for a new travel subsidy scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Department is seeking a solution which would best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the costs of their mobility needs, while remaining within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns. In the meantime, monthly payments have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Monthly Allowance at the time that the scheme closed.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme.

An Inter-Sectoral Group on Obesity, comprising relevant Government Departments and key stake-holders, was established early in 2009 to oversee and monitor implementation of the Task Force recommendations.  Its report, published in April 2009, detailed the progress made on each of the 93 recommendations.  It showed that significant progress was made in the case of 32% of the recommendations, partial implementation occurred on 31%, action progressed on a further 28%, leaving 9% where little progress was reported.<br/><br/>Since 2009 work on initiatives to tackle obesity is continuing and progress has been made in a number of key areas:<br/><br/>- A suite of guidelines and algorithms e.g.  guidelines for treatment of adults with the ICGP, guidelines for treatment of Children with the Faculty of Paediatrics and the ICGP, Guidelines for before, during and after pregnancy in conjunction with the Faculty for Obstetrics and Gynaecology &amp;amp; ICGP.  Currently the HSE is developing the last of these guidelines which looks at men between the ages of 35 and 65.<br/><br/>- Development of Physical Activity Plan for Ireland and the development of a &quot;one stop shop&quot; website for physical activity (www.getirelandactive.ie) in conjunction with Department of Health, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Transport, Department of Environment, Department of Sport, Representatives of the County Managers, Academic Institutions and the Irish Sports Council.<br/><br/>- Development of Healthy Eating Guidelines and food pyramid.<br/><br/>- Setting up Research and Surveillance Systems e.g. Growing Up in Ireland and the Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative.<br/><br/>- Social Marketing Campaigns in conjunction with <i>safe</i>food e.g. Little Steps, Stop the Spread and the three multimedia childhood obesity campaign.<br/><br/>In 2011 the then Minister for Health established the Special Action Group on Obesity (SAGO), comprising representatives from Department of Health, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, The Department of Education and Skills, the Health Service Executive, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and Safefood to examine and progress a number of issues to address the problem of obesity.  <br/><br/>Progress has been made on the Healthy Eating guidelines, Calories on Menus initiative and the Report on Recommendations to reduce consumption of high fat, salt and sugar foods and drinks from the Top Shelf of the Food Pyramid. Treatment algorithms are available for those in Primary Care health services. Arising out of the Irish Presidency of the EU an Action Plan on Childhood Obesity has been developed and Ireland is playing a key role in this initiative. In relation to funding:<br/><br/>- The HSE grant aids a number of organisations and voluntary bodies to help in reducing obesity in Ireland in a more targeted way e.g. Healthy Food For All, Irish Heart Foundation, Irish Cancer Society, Special Olympics, Community Games, Local Sports Partnerships and Diabetes Federation of Ireland.<br/><br/>- Providing funding for treatment of obese individuals and hence the establishment of adult obesity treatment centres (including Bariatric surgery) and one paediatric treatment centre.<br/><br/>- The HSE does not have a financial system that indicates clearly the level of funding for obesity but the HSE confirms that it employs Endocrinologists, Paediatricians, Surgeons, Allied Health Professionals (Physiotherapists, Physical Activity Co-ordinators, Dieticians, Health Promotion Officers), Public Health Nurses, Practice Nurses, Psychologists and Family Therapists.  They all have an implied responsibility for treatment and prevention of overweight and obesity.</p></reply>

Within Hospital Groups, all hospitals, irrespective of size, will work together in an integrated way. </p>  <p>  While Future Health sets the broad direction of travel for reforming the system, it was always made clear that an incremental approach to implementation would be taken. Future Health specifically referred to a &ldquo;reform-learn-reform&rdquo; approach being taken to the process which would enable us to make changes to the proposed approach while simultaneously making progress towards the final structures and delivering tangible improvements as we go.</p>  <p>  Seven hospital groups have been established on a non-statutory administrative basis.

The change from the application of a rigid employment control framework, with its particular focus on a moratorium on recruitment and compliance with employment ceilings and targets, to one operating strictly within allocated pay frameworks will allow for recruitment where it is determined that this can achieve more economical service delivery. It will also allow continuation of the policy of recruiting front line staff where necessary to ensure service delivery.</p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has advised that the HSE and Department of Health will be required to submit a 2015 Pay and Numbers Strategy.  Following approval of the strategy by DPER, a letter of delegated sanction for staffing will be issued. Pending this sanction, the existing moratorium and ECF arrangements will continue to apply.  </p>  <p>  The number of nurses employed has increased by nearly 500 in the past 12 months. This increase can be attributed to the very positive initiatives undertaken by the HSE to reduce reliance on agency and to offer contracts of employment where agency can be replaced by full time posts. The HSE is actively recruiting to fill 1,600 approved nursing posts. These are across all grades and all divisions of the register spanning acute hospitals, community, ID and mental health. Many of these posts are currently being filled on a temporary or an acting basis. Following a high profile online campaign at the end of 2014 the HSE is currently processing 3,700. </p>  <p>  There will always be certain posts that are difficult to attract suitably qualified candidates to and individual strategies are developed for these in conjunction with the line managers. Where front-line staffing shortages exist, the HSE makes alternative arrangements to ensure continued service provision, including recourse to agency cover. However, it is preferable that sufficient numbers of nurses are recruited to permanent posts to support the most efficient and effective delivery of services. </p></reply>

The HSE has already put in place specific measures to address waiting lists more efficiently in collaboration with acute hospitals, the SDU and the NTPF. These include observation of the National Waiting List Management Protocol (2014), adherence to relevant HSE National Clinical Programme guidelines and prioritising Day-of-surgery admission where clinically appropriate.<br/><br/>The National Waiting List Management Protocol, <i>A standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, January 2014,</i>has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This protocol, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes by which hospitals are to manage waiting lists.<br/><br/>The scheduling of appointments for individual patients is a matter for the hospital to which the patient has been referred taking into account his or her clinical need.  Should a patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he or she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved. In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

The additional eligible population is approximately 100,000 and, when fully implemented, 540,000 women will be included in the BreastCheck Programme.<br/><br/>To accommodate such a substantial increase safely and effectively, it will be necessary for BreastCheck to implement the extended screening on a phased basis.  All women involved in breast screening are offered screening every two years and this complicates the organisation of an age extension.  The broad approach will involve those who are under the current programme having their period of screening extended until they reach 69 years of age.  Accordingly, those aged 65 will be the first to be invited. <br/><br/>Exact details of when women of each age will be invited will be worked out as part of the on-going planning process.<br/><br/>Women of any age who have concerns about breast cancer should seek the advice of their GP who will, if appropriate, refer them to the symptomatic breast services in one of the eight designated cancer centres. </p></reply>

Every person who uses our disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care.  <br/><br/>The safeguarding and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the health service is of paramount importance and the Director General of the HSE has written to all staff instructing them to take personal responsibility for ensuring that individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect.  <br/><br/>In December 2014 the HSE initiated both an expert investigation chaired by Mr. Christy Lynch, and an independently chaired review of services at this facility led by Dr. Kevin McCoy.  Mr Lynch&rsquo;s investigation team is working independently of the HSE and its findings will be a precursor to any disciplinary process consideration at which the HSE will undertake. <br/><br/>Dr. McCoy is undertaking an Assurance Review of the services at &Aacute;ras Attracta and the final report will include an individual plan for improvement in each bungalow within the complex.  The review will identify system wide learning involving engagement with relevant expertise as well as input from staff. <br/><br/>A  Garda investigation into allegations of abuse at the centre is ongoing and the garda&iacute; had requested that a stay be placed on HSE investigations until such time as the Garda investigation is completed.  However, the HSE has informed me that the garda&iacute; have now cleared the way for the investigation to commence.<br/><br/>The HSE has undertaken a number of additional initiatives to ensure that quality and safe care in residential services for people with disabilities is appropriately implemented and monitored, including: <br/><br/>- The establishment of a National Implementation Taskforce, including a series of National Summits to improve client safety, dignity, respect and  culture;<br/><br/>- Implementation of the <i>National Policy &amp;amp; Procedures on Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse</i>;<br/><br/>- Development of an advocacy programme;<br/><br/>- Implementation of an evaluation and quality improvement programme in disability residential centres;<br/><br/>- Development of an implementation plan for any recommendations arising from the McCoy review of residential services in &Aacute;ras Attracta when complete and,<br/><br/>- Development of long-term sustainable &amp;amp; evidence-based safeguarding practices and training programmes specific to residential settings.  <br/><br/>I have asked the HSE to keep me informed of progress.<br/><br/>I am informed that the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) commenced the regulation of residential centres for people with disabilities in November 2013. The purpose of this regulatory process is to ensure that service providers deliver a safe and good quality service to people with disabilities.  Where HIQA finds that this is not the case, providers are required to take action to address the issues identified.<br/><br/>In 2014, HIQA conducted 603 inspections of designated centres, and 116 centres received two or more inspections.  </p></reply>

It is important to note that the expenditure in question was for the management of specific projects and events under Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme.  It was not for general public relations services. In 2007, following a competitive tendering process, a contract valued at just over &euro;5,000 was awarded to a firm to support the work of the Government&rsquo;s Hunger Task Force.  The Task Force comprised 14 Irish and international experts who examined the particular contribution that Ireland could make to tackling the root causes of hunger.  The Hunger Task Force Report was published in 2008 and continues to guide Ireland&rsquo;s approach to this priority global issue.  The firm concerned assisted the Hunger Task Force in engaging with the public and media on Ireland&rsquo;s role in tackling hunger in the developing world.  Between 2008 and 2010, following a competitive tendering process, the Department engaged a firm with a public relations background to provide professional services including project management, logistics and event management for the national Africa Day celebrations, which were hosted by the Department in Dublin Castle in 2008 and in Iveagh Gardens in 2009 and 2010.  In partnership with a number of local authorities, the firm also administered a small grants scheme for community and other groups to participate in regional Africa Day events.  A small public awareness-raising dimension was involved in this work on Africa Day events and was conducted in close cooperation with the Department&rsquo;s press office.<br/><br/>Following a competitive tender process, the same firm was engaged in 2010 to manage and administer the Department&rsquo;s Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF), which provides small grants to journalists to facilitate coverage of the developing world and raise awareness of development issues in Ireland.<br/><br/>The contract involved the management of three funding rounds each year, entailing:<br/><br/>Processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records;<br/><br/>Convening national and regional information workshops;<br/><br/>Managing and administering the application process;<br/><br/>Organising the process of judging of applications by an independent panel;<br/><br/>Providing detailed feedback to all applicants;<br/><br/>Maintaining and updating the SCMF website<br/><br/><b>Expenditure, 2007 - 2010</b><table><tr><th>Receipt and Project/Event</th><th><div>2007</div></th><th><div>2008</div></th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th></tr><tr><td>Bannon &amp;amp; Bannon &ndash; Support to the Hunger Task Force</td><td><div>&euro;5,082</div></td><td><div>Nil</div></td><td><div>Nil</div></td><td><div>Nil</div></td></tr><tr><td>DHR Communications &ndash; Simon Cumbers Media Fund</td><td><div>Nil</div></td><td><div>Nil</div></td><td><div>Nil</div></td><td><div>&euro;31,363</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>DHR Communications &ndash; Africa Day</div></td><td><div>Nil</div></td><td><div>&euro;34,485</div></td><td><div>&euro;63,058</div></td><td><div>&euro;56,023</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;5,082</td><td>&euro;34,485</td><td>&euro;63,058</td><td>&euro;87,386</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The President and the Taoiseach have both made official visits to Spain in recent years while Prime Minister Rajoy visited Dublin in March of last year.  Government Ministers maintain direct contacts with their Spanish counterparts.  Most recently Minister Coveney visited Madrid on 29 January for discussions with his Spanish counterpart, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Environment Isabel Garc&iacute;a Tejerina.  I meet regularly with my Spanish counterpart, Jos&eacute; Manuel Garc&iacute;a-Margallo, at the EU Foreign Affairs Council where we can discuss bilateral issues informally, in addition to the EU agenda.  At last week&rsquo;s Council meeting, I conveyed the sympathy of the Irish people to Minister Garc&iacute;a-Margallo on the death of a Spanish UN peacekeeper with UNIFIL in Lebanon where an Irish contingent also serves.  I would be most happy to receive Minister Garc&iacute;a-Margallo if an occasion arises on which he would wish to visit Ireland.</p></reply>

The Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952 gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs primary responsibility for the regulation of activity by foreign military aircraft in Ireland.  The regulation of civilian aircraft is governed by the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the Chicago Convention) which came into force on 4 April 1947.  Ireland&rsquo;s rights and obligations under the Convention have been incorporated into Irish law through the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1946, as amended.  The legislation provides that the Minister for Transport has primary responsibility for the regulation of civilian aircraft.</p>  <p>  Where it is proposed that military personnel travelling on civilian aircraft should be accompanied by personal weapons, an exemption must be sought from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.

As a result, Ireland does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan and does not have an Embassy in Taipei.  Irish citizens travelling to, or resident in, Taiwan can register their details on the Citizens&rsquo; Registration facility on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.dfa.ie.  The Citizen&rsquo;s Registration service is a voluntary service which encourages Irish citizens travelling or living overseas to register their contact details with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This means that in the event of an unforeseen crisis such as a natural disaster or civil unrest, the Department can proactively contact the citizen, ensure they are safe, keep them informed of any evacuation plans and provide assistance where necessary.  Citizens resident in Taiwan are advised to submit their passport applications through the Irish Embassy in Beijing.  The turnaround time averages about 4-6 weeks which is the equivalent turnaround time for citizens resident in the UK.  Additionally, citizens requiring passport information may also contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin on +353 (0) 1 408 2000.</p>  <p>  If Irish citizens are in difficulty in Taiwan and require Consular Assistance, they can call our Consular Assistance Unit in Dublin on +353 (0) 1 408 2000.

The overarching aim of the Programme was to increase the number of Irish qualifying graduates with top quality international experience in their chosen discipline, thereby enhancing the capability of Ireland to trade internationally.</p>  <p>  Officials in the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment carried out a review of the programme in early 2010.  At that time, the core remit of F&Aacute;S was to focus its training and employment programmes on those cohorts who were most likely to remain unemployed.  Following the review it was decided that this programme did not fit with that core remit and it would be inappropriate for F&Aacute;S to retain responsibility for its management and the programme was closed down.</p>  <p>  At that time Enterprise Ireland managed a comparable overseas programme, aimed at graduates in almost identical disciplines.  The overarching objective of the Enterprise Ireland's International Graduate Programme is the provision of in-depth international marketing experience to graduates to ensure that they can contribute to the success of emerging Irish companies in rapidly changing international business environments.

There is no mechanism for separate payment and allocation to schools for pupils that are not on POD, and from a practical point of view it is difficult to see how much a system could work in practice.</p>  <p>  Under Section 12 of the Education Act 1998, the Minister of Education shall determine and publish the criteria in each school year by which funding shall be provided to schools in the following academic year.  Over 3 billion euro of taxpayers money is spent annually on funding our primary school system.  The vast majority of this funding is allocated to schools on the basis of reported pupil numbers.  It is more than prudent from an audit and financial accountability point of view that we validate the data underlying these payments and ensure that payment is made only once in relation to each pupil.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an  assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists  approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this  assessment directly. <br/><br/>  In common with many other psychological services and best international  practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on  empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from  mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving  and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for  these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and  intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial  assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with  learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their  NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the  event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best  efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with  an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.  <br/><br/>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and  also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It  also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological  intervention.  <br/><br/>I have made enquiries in the matter and find that the child in question has not  been brought to the attention of the assigned Psychologist by school  authorities. <br/><br/>  If the parents of the child have specific concerns about his educational  progress I would advise in the first instance that they speak to the Principal  of the school with a view to raising these concerns with the assigned NEPS  psychologist.</p></reply>

Such individuals may  apply to the Department/VEC (now ETB) as appropriate for a derogation from the  general position within 3 months of the date of receipt of the award.&quot;Teachers  who were not in employment in an Oireachtas funded post on 5 December 2011 and  not eligible for receipt of a qualification allowance in respect of any  teaching post on that date, do not qualify for payment of an allowance in  respect of the qualification related to the course being undertaken at that  time. <br/><br/>  The issues raised by the Deputy have been brought to the Teachers' Conciliation  Council (TCC) by representatives of the teachers concerned and it would  therefore not be appropriate to comment further until the issues have been  deliberated on by that forum. The TCC is part of the scheme of Conciliation and  Arbitration Scheme for Teachers, the purpose of which is to provide a means of  dealing with claims and proposals relating to the salaries and terms and  conditions of teachers.The Council is composed of representatives of the  teacher representative bodies, school management, the Department of Education  and Skills, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is chaired by  an official of the Labour Relations Commission.</p></reply>

The question in relation to ethnic and cultural background are based on the categories from the <br/><br/>two most recent Census of Population questions, and similar to those asked in many other countries.<br/><br/>The Department welcomes and will take under consideration all feedback in relation to the structure of the Ethnic and cultural background question. We are committed to continually reviewing the variables in POD, and in response to feedback given we are proposing to review some of the labelling of the categories in this question. We will notify schools on this in due course. <br/><br/>In relation to the overall question the Statistics Section of the Department met with the CSO's Census of Population Division to discuss concerns around this question.  They accept that the variant of the ethnicity question on the 2016 census may fall short of what could be expected in today's multi-racial Ireland. Given the no-change' census approach being adopted for Census of Population 2016 it is not possible to change the CSO question at this stage.  <br/><br/>However the CSO has indicated that it is considering holding a seminar this year to examine how the data in this area can be improved from the point of view of maximising the number of write-in responses to increase the variety of ethnic descriptions captured, the classification system used, and also looking at the nationality vs. citizenship issue and examining generally how the outputs from the census can be improved in this important area. The Department of Education and Skills will be participating in this seminar. <br/><br/>Note that the question on POD is intended to capture ethnic and cultural background only and there is a separate question on POD for nationality. If a category such as other black background or other inc. mixed background is chosen the pupil can record their Irish nationality in the nationality question.</p></reply>

This encompasses measures to promote physical activity, healthy eating, and overall healthy lifestyles. <br/><br/>Schools are required to deliver a minimum of 1 hour per week Physical Education at primary level and 2 hours per week at post primary level. In 2012, this Department carried out a Lifeskills Survey in primary and post primary schools. The data indicated that, in addition to this formal PE provision, over 80% of schools encourage not only physical activity and regular exercise during school breaks, but they also facilitate young people's participation in sport outside school time.  <br/><br/>My Department's Professional Development Support Service for Teachers (PDST) is currently developing a CPD programme for primary and post primary teachers in P.E.. The initial focus of this professional support will be on developing fundamental movement skills and building the knowledge, skills and capacity of teachers to meet the physical literacy needs of learners through the P.E. curriculum.<br/><br/>The Department also supports the Active Schools Flag. This initiative, which was launched in 2009, recognises schools that provide a quality programme for all students and promote physical activity across the whole school community. A total of 434 primary and 33 post primary schools have achieved an Active Schools Flag to date. More schools are registering to participate each year. <br/><br/>Physical activity by pupils is not the sole remit of schools. PE in schools is designed to complement activity and other lifestyle habits outside of school. In fact, this &quot;whole of life&quot; approach is being adopted in the National Physical Activity Plan, which is currently being finalised by a cross-sectoral working group co-chaired by the Department of Health and the Department of Tourism and Sport.  The Department of Education and Skills is a member of this group.<br/><br/>Supporting our young people to acquire the knowledge and develop the skills to make healthier choices in life is also very important to overall student well-being. The issue of promoting healthy eating is addressed in schools through subjects such as Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), and Home Economics as well as in PE. With such skills and knowledge it is hoped that our young people will make appropriate choices so that this informed approach will help to reduce the incidence of obesity in our young people. <br/><br/>In my November 2014 proposal on junior cycle, Well-being is included as a compulsory element of a school's junior cycle programme. It would include Physical Education; Social, Personal and Health Education; and Civic Social and Personal Education. <br/><br/>In addition, I will shortly be issuing guidance to all schools about measures to promote healthy lifestyles. This guidance encompasses measures to promote healthy eating, healthy vending, as well as the promotion of P.E. and Physical Activity. The guidance has been drafted in consultation with the Department of Health and the HSE.</p></reply>

My Department's design guidelines for schools include guidance in the provision of P.E. Halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts. <br/><br/>I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department fully recognises the key role of physical exercise within the school environment and continues to respond to the need to improve PE facilities for all pupils attending schools within the constraints of the available funding.<br/><br/>I also wish to advise the Deputy that the Physical Education curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary. Many primary schools have a general purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the P.E. programme. A similar situation with sports halls and outdoor facilities applies at second level. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.<br/><br/>In December 2014, the Minor Works Grant issued to all primary schools for the school year 2014/2015 at a cost of over &euro;28 million and it is open to schools to use this funding for the development of a play facility.<br/><br/>Where schools are unable to address all issues arising on an incremental basis, it is open to the school authority to apply for funding for developing play space under the Summer Works Scheme.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that spending of more than &euro;70 million was approved for the 2014 Summer Works Scheme to allow over 770 schools undertake improvement works. This allowed for the funding of applications received under categories 1-6. Schools which had applied under categories 7-10 were advised that their applications would be retained for prioritisation if funding for further summer works projects could be secured for 2015.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of POD will be to monitor the education progress of primary pupils (in DES aided schools), throughout the primary system and onwards to post primary level and to help them develop their full educational potential. Once up and running other secondary purposes of POD will include becoming the basis for the allocation of teachers and capitation grants. Aggregated POD data will also be used for the production and publication of primary level statistics.Parental consent is also required to answer the questions relating to religion and ethnic or cultural background. The information in relation to religion is being gathered purely for statistical purposes &ndash; there will be no other use made of this information. In relation to ethnicity and cultural identity, organisations like the Irish Traveller Movement and advocates of greater social equality have been campaigning for a record of Traveller identity to be kept as part of a learner database for many years. This is to allow us to determine the effect of targeted educational interventions on Travellers, and indeed to direct the additional capitation grant funding to schools who enrol Traveller pupils.The current retention policy for Primary Online Database (POD) data is for records to be maintained for the longer of either the period up to the pupil's 30th Birthday or for a period of ten years since the student was last enrolled in a primary school. In future schools will no longer be required to keep the Cl&aacute;rleabhar therefore POD will be the official register of pupils in schools and data will be retained to allow pupils to obtain their records in the future. The Department's retention policy is for audit and accounting purposes as pupil's data is used in the allocation of teaching posts and funding to schools. The policy also serves to trace retention trends in the education system, is important for longitudinal research and policy formation, as well as being an important statistical indicator nationally and internationally. Aggregate and not individual data is used for the majority of these purposes. My Department  has consulted with the Data Protection Commissioner in December 2013 and no issues of concern were raised at that time. My Department will review, on an ongoing basis, our retention policy taking account of any concerns raised. I am also aware that the Data Protection Commissioner has made clear that there is still active engagement between her office and my Department on this issue.  I welcome that confirmation.The Department takes the protection of pupil's data very seriously. Pupil data is stored securely in the Department's Oracle database. This database is hosted on the Department's servers which are located in the Revenue Commissioners data-centre in St Johns' Road. Access to the servers is protected by both Revenue and Government firewalls. Staff of the Revenue Commissioners do not have access to the data in the database. POD application roles have been developed which limit school staff to viewing and maintaining their own pupil records. Access within the Department to POD data is limited to the POD team which is currently less than 15 people. No agency or other Government Department will have direct access to the Primary Online Database. </p></reply>

The scope of works approved permitted the school authorities to carry out works including roof repairs, replacement of windows &amp;amp; doors and of two heating boilers, the upgrade of dust extraction systems plus the provision of a fire alarm &amp;amp; emergency lighting. In addition, in September 2013, the school in question was invited to participate in the Prefab Replacement Scheme II to replace four temporary rented general classrooms with permanent accommodation and in February 2014, my Department approved further devolved funding to provide two new Science Rooms.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. </p>  <p>As set out in the Water Services Act 2014, which was enacted on 28 December 2014, water charges for domestic customers commenced on 1 January 2015 , with the first bills due to issue from April 2015. The Act also provides for the payment of an annual water conservation grant.   </p>  <p>  To promote sustainable use of water and to enhance water conservation in households, the Department of Social Protection will administer, on behalf of my Department, a &euro;100 water conservation grant for households (principal private dwellings) that complete a valid response to Irish Water&rsquo;s customer registration process. It is proposed that the grant will be paid in one instalment to all eligible households in September 2015 and on an annual basis thereafter. I will shortly bring forward regulations and a communications campaign that will set out the terms, conditions and eligibility criteria applying to the scheme, including the date by which a response to Irish Water&rsquo;s customer registration process will be required in order to be eligible for the grant. </p>  <p>While Irish Water, as part of the transition phase, will have a &lsquo;first fix free&rsquo; scheme to fix customer leaks, it is recognised that some leakage may be internal to the house. The &euro;100 annual water conservation grant can be used in this regard to address issues such as leaking cisterns, dripping taps etc. Equally, households can use the grant towards other conservation measures such as the costs of water butts or installing dual flush toilets or rain water systems, de-sludging septic tanks or maintaining wells to ensure operating efficiency.   </p>  <p>The water conservation grant replaces the tax rebate and social protection measures previously announced, as it is a more straightforward means of addressing water issues for all households on equal terms and will reduce households&rsquo; outlay on water services both now and in the future.   </p>  <p>As the Department of Social Protection will administer the grant the process is streamlined and clearer for householders. It is also important that all households have an equal chance to reduce their water consumption in their principal private dwellings.   This approach has a number of policy advantages as it makes water charges more affordable for lower income groups; conservation ensures a better use of our water resources and avoids unnecessary or premature expansion of water treatment plants; and it is environmentally sustainable and protects our water environment which is to the benefit of all citizens.</p></reply>

Stage one, a call for Expressions of Interest to design and implement LEADER Local Development Strategies for the 2014-2020 programme period, will commence shortly. This stage will be open to any entity that can demonstrate broad local and community participation and that has a coherent vision for the development of their area. In stage two of the selection process Local Action Groups successful in stage one will be invited to submit a Local Development Strategy for their area. Groups will be given a minimum of six months to prepare their strateg ies however if a strategy should be complete within the six month period it will be assessed on completion with a view to getting successful strategies operational as soon as possible.

As part of implementation of the Government&rsquo;s waste policy, <i>A Resource Opportunity</i>, my Department carried out a public consultation last year on options for revising the existing regulatory regime which applies to waste collection. Arising from that process, my Department is finalising a robust new regulatory framework aimed at professionalising and modernising Ireland&rsquo;s system of household waste collection. I expect to finalise the new legislation shortly.Key among the new provisions will be the introduction of a pay-by-weight pricing structure for household waste collection. The intention is that collectors will be required to be &lsquo;pay-by-weight&rsquo; ready by 1 July 2015 and will be required to charge all their customers on a pay-by-weight basis from 1 July 2016. The period of 12 months during which collectors will be required to weigh the waste collected and indicate the weight to customers will allow householders time to adjust to the new pricing structure before it becomes mandatory. <br/><br/>Weight-based charging for waste collection has been shown to significantly reduce the quantity of waste that households produce and provides clear pricing incentives for households to prevent and better segregate their waste. It also gives households greater control over their costs - the less their bins weigh, the less they will pay. Clear and effective communication with households on the new pricing system and on how to best reduce waste management costs is essential and a comprehensive awareness campaign will be commencing shortly.<br/><br/>My focus is on full implementation of the Government&rsquo;s waste policy and I have no plans for the establishment of a waste regulator at the current time. </p></reply>

The report also identified significant non-compliance among those with responsibilities under the current Waste Tyre Regulations.    To address these significant shortcomings, my Department has been working, in full consultation with all parts of the tyre industry, to assist it in putting in place a system of producer responsibility, in line with those that apply to other sectors, to provide for the collection, sorting and management of the waste they produce in an environmentally sound manner. This is in line with the &ldquo;polluter pays principle&rdquo; which is a firmly established feature of both domestic waste policy and legislation.  This will require an overhaul of existing structures, but I believe that this can be achieved without distorting the tyres market in Ireland, without encouraging customers to buy tyres outside of the jurisdiction and without widespread job losses. Moreover, I believe that such a scheme could be provided for without introducing any new costs, but rather by effectively formalising the existing charge that is already applied to almost all tyre purchases. </p>  <p>Arising from the work of the Tyres Working Group, which includes representatives from across the waste and tyres industries, my Department has now received proposals for the future management of waste tyres from the Independent Tyre Wholesalers and Retailers Association (ITWRA) and the Irish Tyre Industry Association (ITIA). While it would have been my preference for all sides within the industry to come together in support of a single proposal, the separate proposals have been considered by my Department, and I have now i nformed all sections of the tyre industry of my decision to establish a full Producer Responsibility I nitiative scheme for waste tyres .     </p>  <p>A copy of the letter to the tyre industry, setting out in greater detail the specific details of the scheme and proposed next steps has been forwarded separately to the Deputy. </p></reply>

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.<br/><br/>The maximum grant per beneficiary for equipment is as follows:<br/><br/>- Monitored personal alarms (with pendant) - &euro;250<br/><br/>- Additional pendant/Re-installation - &euro;50<br/><br/>The annual monitoring costs (generally between &euro;60 - &euro;80 per annum) are borne by the beneficiary.<br/><br/>My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and arising from this, it was decided that the scheme be managed by Pobal, given that organisation&rsquo;s significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government.<br/><br/>Pobal&rsquo;s management and administrative services for the Scheme included an invitation to tender for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, which was publicly advertised on eTenders on 20 October 2014. The tender process, which is being led by Pobal, is almost complete and following this a panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas. <br/><br/>Monitoring has always been the responsibility of the beneficiary and this is not changing. There are no implications for existing installations in respect of the Pobal tender competition; however, under the new arrangements, Pobal are also providing a facility for beneficiaries to choose from a panel of monitoring companies or to continue with their current monitoring company. In this regard Pobal will also set up a panel of pre-qualified telecare service providers, who provide monitoring services and this was publicly advertised on eTenders on 6 November 2014. <br/><br/>This new approach will reduce the administrative burden for the many hundreds of community and voluntary groups registered under the Scheme, who provide an excellent service for the elderly. It will enable the groups to concentrate on the main purpose of the Scheme, namely to support and interact with the elderly in the local community. <br/><br/>The funding allocated for the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2015 is &euro;2.35m. The following table outlines the expenditure for this scheme and the overall number of beneficiaries from 2012 to 2014. <table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Expenditure </th><th>Beneficiaries  </th></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>&euro;2.52m </td><td>9,142 </td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;2.32m </td><td>10,597 </td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>&euro;1.7m </td><td>7,120 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

In this regard, communities regularly identify the arts and creative industries as priorities for action in their areas and indeed many projects of this nature have been funded under the current Leader elements of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2014 and the Local Community Development Programme.<br/><br/>In relation to the role of the arts in rural communities and future funding of arts projects, the forthcoming LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020 will provide &euro;250 million in resources to support the sustainable development of rural communities across the country. This funding will be delivered using a community led local development approach based on local development strategies designed and implemented by groups of people from a given sub-regional area or a Local Action Group (LAG). It should be noted that all decisions related to funding specific projects, including those that relate to the arts and creative industries, will be a matter for the Local Action Group and will be made based on the needs and priorities that the Local Action Group have identified in their local development strategy. My Department will have no role to play in the selection of individual projects at local level under this programme.<br/><br/>The Local Community Development Programme (LCDP) is the largest social inclusion intervention, of its kind, in the state.  It is a key tool of Government.  The successor programme to the LCDP, the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) to be rolled out in April next, will build on the LCDP aims and objectives <font color="#1F497D">, </font>including supporting and resourcing disadvantaged communities and marginalised target groups through life-long learning opportunities and interventions which may involve the arts. <br/><br/>As part of the programme of reform of local government, Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) were established in all local authorities and these Committees, comprising public-private socio-economic interests, will have responsibility for local and community development programmes on an area basis, including the role of co-ordinating, managing and overseeing the implementation of SICAP. They will develop, co-ordinate and implement a more coherent and integrated approach to local and community development than heretofore, with the aim of reducing duplication and overlap and optimising the use of available resources for the benefit of citizens and communities.</p></reply>

Rents for houses were 4.3% higher while apartment rents were 7.3% higher than in the same quarter of 2013. In Dublin, which is seeing the highest rates of increase nationally, overall rents were higher by 9.5% although the rate of annual increase was down slightly.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, the main cause of rising rents is a lack of supply in the market and the recently published <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>sets out clear, measureable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list. In addition, the implementation of the range of actions under the Government&rsquo;s <i>Construction 2020</i>Strategy will support increased supply in the wider housing market.<br/><br/>A recent poll for the PRTB found that only 64% of tenants are aware of their rights under the 2004 Act, including in relation to rent increases. Tenants must be given 28 days&rsquo; notice of new rent and can make an application for dispute resolution to the PRTB where they feel the rent increase is in excess of the market rent. These provisions have effect notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in a lease or tenancy agreement.<br/><br/>The PRTB is developing a new education and communications strategy to address the awareness issue . The first element in the strategy, a &lsquo;do you know&rsquo; campaign, commenced recently in the national press and will be rolled out in citizens information centres, libraries and other public spaces as well as on social media.<br/><br/>The Government is monitoring the rental market closely and is considering policy options in relation to achieving greater rent certainty. The options put forward in the report, <i>Rent Stability in the Private Rented Sector</i>, commissioned by the PRTB and published in Autumn 2014, form part of these considerations.</p></reply>

The ban proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in Dublin.  As well as bringing air quality levels into compliance with the then EU standards, the ban also had the effect of significantly improving human health in the capital. Research indicates that the ban in Dublin has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths. The ban was subsequently extended to other urban areas.  In August 2012, following a public consultation process, new solid fuel regulations (S.I. No. 326 of 2012) were introduced with the aim of ensuring that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of certain residential solid fuels. The ban now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people, bringing the ban areas broadly into line with national EPA air quality management zones. While my Department keeps the matter under regular review, I have no immediate plans at present to extend the ban to new towns.</p>  <p>  Air quality monitoring by the EPA has shown that air quality is poorer in towns where the smoky coal ban does not apply, although there is evidence that smaller smoky coal ban areas tend to be less effective. The further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the most effective solution to addressing the problem of emissions from residential solid fuel use in these areas. Similarly, the border with Northern Ireland would present enforcement challenges if a national ban on smoky coal were unilaterally introduced. However, it is recognised that having different regulations between urban and rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for citizens in different locations.   </p>  <p>  Under the auspices of the North South Ministerial Council, and in conjunction with the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, my Department has commissioned a study to inform a discussion on policy options to further address emissions from residential solid fuel use on an all-island basis. The study includes- </p>  <p>  -  an assessment of the solid fuel market and barriers to the use of cleaner fuels; </p>  <p>  -  consideration of the role and impacts of biomass (primarily wood and wood-based products) and the links to climate policy; and </p>  <p>  -  an economic analysis addressing the potential positive and negative effects on the consumer, for example, resulting from potential fuel switching, the availability of smokeless fuels to supply an all-island market and job creation opportunities in the manufacture and supply of smokeless fuels. </p>  <p>  A final report is expected to be presented to the North South Ministerial Council in May 2015.

My Department assists local authorities in developing and maintaining their housing stock   through various funding programmes .  The effective management of vacant and boarded up social housing units is a key area for local authorities in making effective use of their existing social housing stock and for achieving best practice and value for money in housing management. To this end, my Department in 2014 funded a planned programme of returning vacant and boarded up properties to productive use, under which over 2,3 00 units were remediated nationally at a cost of &euro;26.1 million. Kildare County Council received funding in excess of &euro;500,000 under this programme and returned 49 vacant units back into productive use throughout the county, including 13 units in the Athy area.</p>  <p>  For 2015, I will provide further support to local authorities to target 1,000 such units. My Department has recently requested all local authorities, including Kildare County Council , to submit a list of vacant properties for consideration for 2015 funding.</p>  <p>  In addition , Kildare County Council also received funding approval of &euro;833,000 under my Department&rsquo;s 2014 Local Authority Construction and Acquisition Programme to purchase and refurbish 10 derelict properties in the Athy area and I understand that work on this project should be concluded in 2015.</p></reply>

The purpose of Regulation 6 is to ensure that each rental property has exclusive access to its own sanitary facilities and that those facilities are contained within the dwelling unit. Regulation 7 relates to effective heating which can be independently managed by the tenant, while Regulation 8 provides for sole access to adequate facilities for the hygienic storage, preparation and cooking of food.  The 2008 Regulations came into effect generally on 1 February 2009 but allowed a four year phasing-in period to facilitate any improvement works that needed to be carried out in respect of Regulations 6, 7 and 8. Responsibility for their enforcement rests with the local authorities, funded from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB). Since 2005, over 149,000 inspections have been carried out by local authorities on properties in the sector. </p>  <p>  Census 2011 indicated that there were approximately 4,500 bed-sits across the country &ndash; the majority of which are found in Dublin &ndash; accounting for 1% of households in the private rented sector. A recent report from Dublin City Council found that the majority of dwellings selected for inspection (which were pre-1963 multi-unit buildings and more likely to be in this category of accommodation) were non-compliant with the regulations on initial inspection.</p>  <p>  These inspections were part of an intensified inspection programme funded by my Department that commenced in 2012 and is due to run until March 2015. It specifically targeted concentrations of rented properties which were deemed to be at risk of non-compliance with the legislation. Up to October 2014, 66% of the non-compliant properties had been brought into compliance. Enforcement action continues against the remainder, including legal action in certain cases.   </p>  <p>  The purpose of the regulations is to provide a basic standard for decent, safe and secure accommodation and I have no plans to rescind the legislation. </p></reply>

Ireland also has ambitious renewable energy targets. Our 2020 target is to have 16% of our energy from renewable sources through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 10% of our transport and 12% of our heat from renewable sources. In 2013, 7.8% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy, made up of 20.9% of electricity demand, 5.7% of heat demand and 2.8% of transport demand. The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure, sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers.</p>  <p>  To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity. The total amount of wind generation connected to the grid is approximately 2,200MW. It is estimated that a total of between 3,500MW and 4,000MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target.</p>  <p>  With regard to 2030, the October European Council endorsed a binding EU target of at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. In addition, an EU target of at least 27% is set for the share of renewable energy consumed in the EU in 2030, and an indicative target at EU level of at least 27% is set for improving energy efficiency in 2030 compared to projections of future energy consumption.</p>  <p>  Ireland intends to make a cost-effective, achievable and fair (in terms of effort sharing among Member States), contribution to these high level EU goals. My Department is overseeing detailed and rigorous energy system and economic modelling to identify the contribution which is appropriate for Ireland taking account of our specific economic circumstances. This analysis will address issues such as the quantum of additional renewable electricity we should seek to achieve by 2030, the technologies that should be supported in this regard, and the level at which any future supports should be set.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department participates fully in the whole of Government approach to addressing the challenges of climate change and the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by the year 2050.  </p></reply>

These objects provide the companies&rsquo; statutory mandates and encapsulate national policy in terms of public service broadcasting. They include the specific objective of providing national, free-to-air public service broadcasting services, as well as the provision of a broad range of other additional services that are seen as fundamental to the role of the public service broadcaster. In their pursuit of these objects, the provisions in the Act subject the public service broadcasting corporations to a range of additional requirements.</p>  <p>  These statutory objects and requirements clearly set the State-owned public service broadcasters apart from their commercial counterparts who, while bringing choice and competition to the market, are privately owned and funded companies that have entered the market on the basis of a commercial proposition.</p>  <p>  In relation to the funding of the public service broadcasters RT&Eacute; and TG4, this is met through a mix of licence fee revenues, Exchequer grant-in-aid and commercial revenues obtained largely from advertising.</p>  <p>  The rationale for providing State funding for Public Service Broadcasting is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their public service objects, while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence. This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.</p>  <p>  A proportion of the television licence fee monies is available to both public and independent broadcasters through the Broadcasting Funding Scheme. The purpose of this Scheme is to encourage the inclusion of additional programming of a particular character in broadcasters programme schedules. The Scheme is open to independent producers and all &lsquo;free to air&rsquo; broadcasters. It is funded by way of a payment of 7% of net licence fee receipts, which is paid to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) in respect of this Scheme. This amount was increased from 5% to 7% under the Broadcasting Act 2009.  </p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades. Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br/><br/>On the 24 November last, a public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 was launched. This consultation will close on the 12th February next. The map can be accessed at . The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016. The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention. This includes Ardaneanig, Co Kerry.<br/><br/>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands throughout the entire country including County Kerry.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.<br/><br/>In tandem with the mapping consultation, intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy. The strategy will address a range of issues in relation to the intervention including the optimum procurement model, ownership model for the infrastructure, intervention cost and likely market impact. <br/><br/>Following the public consultation, towards the end of this year a detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. The Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible. I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within a 5 year period. <br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

The studies are required to take account of environmental (including visual amenity) impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors.  The IEP will comment on the completeness, objectivity and comparability of the studies and reports. </p>  <p>  The Panel was also asked to consider what work it might usefully undertake to establish whether or not there has been parity of treatment between the N/S project and the Grid West and Grid Link projects, including route-specific studies of overhead and underground options. Having considered and discussed all of the material provided by EirGrid, in July 2014 the Panel provided its unanimous opinion that, in all material respects, what has already been done on the N/S project is compatible with the methodologies now being employed on the Grid West and Grid Link projects. </p>  <p>  The N/S project is part of an on-going process which is expected to be subjected to rigorous assessment as part of the planning processes in both jurisdictions (Ireland and Northern Ireland).  I understand that EirGrid, prior to submitting its planning application, will re-engage with communities in Meath, Cavan and Monaghan.  I am advised that this will involve opening offices in Navan, Kingscourt and Carrickmacross and that EirGrid also intend to appoint dedicated community liaison officers to ensure all interested stakeholders are engaged with fully.</p></reply>

In addition, biomethane, produced by removing impurities from biogas, can be used as a substitute for natural gas and can be injected directly into the gas grid.    Electricity and combined heat and power produced from biogas is already supported under the REFIT schemes and biogas and biomethane, when used as a transport fuel, can be used to meet the obligations set under the Biofuel Obligation Scheme. </p>  <p>  Academic and industry research suggests that there is a potentially significant role for biogas and biomethane in the heat and transport sectors.  However, given the stage of technology development and cost, more detailed economic analysis of the supply chains, from production through to distribution and use, would be helpful to guide future policy.  In this regard, the draft Bioenergy Plan proposes that the Bioenergy Steering Group, which has been established to coordinate the implementation of the draft Plan, would consider the matter further.</p></reply>

The CER was established in 1999 and has a wide range of economic, customer protection and safety responsibilities in the energy sector.  The CER is also Ireland's economic regulator of the public water and wastewater sector.While the CER is entirely independent in the execution of its statutory duties, I am satisfied that it carries out its statutory duties to the highest standard. <br/><br/>The Green Paper on Energy Policy in Ireland, published in May 2014, sought views on the conduct of a review of the regulatory framework.  The responses to that consultation are being considered and will be taken into account in developing our future energy policy.  The White Paper on Energy Policy will be published in September and will include a commitment to review the regulatory framework and the CER mandate. <br/><br/>I am acutely aware of the financial challenges faced by families and businesses from high energy prices.  While electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive, and operate within national and European regulatory regimes, I intend to meet with the CER later this week to discuss recent developments.<br/><br/>The CER was assigned the function of market monitoring under the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulation 2010 (S.I. 450 of 2010) under which they are charged with advising me, <i>inter alia</i>, on rates of customer switching, disconnection rates, customer complaints and whether the development and operation of competition in the supply of electricity is benefiting final customers.  As part of the CER&rsquo;s function under those Regulations, I intend to get its advice on whether customers are benefiting from competition and on the perceived slowness with which energy suppliers have passed wholesale price reductions on to consumers.  I will also be seeking CER&rsquo;s advice as to what can be done to address the high proportion of customers that have never switched suppliers. <br/><br/>I welcome the recent announcement of major suppliers to reduce domestic gas and electricity prices and I am encouraging other suppliers to pass savings on to their customers.  As with any competitive market, it is hugely important that consumers would shop around to ensure that they get the best price and I would encourage all consumers to either switch supplier or to contact their current supplier to ensure that the best available deal is being provided.</p></reply>

There is free entry to the Irish oil market, no price control and it is Government policy to encourage price competition and consumer choice.  As the Irish oil sector is completely privatised, liberalised and deregulated, the CER has no role in the oil market.Oil is consumed in two sectors of the economy - in transport and heating.  The amount of oil used in the electricity sector is negligible at less than 1%.  In terms of gasoline and diesel prices at the pump and home heating prices, the Consumer and Competition Commission (under the aegis of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation) has a role in ensuring that the market is functioning correctly and that consumers are not being disadvantaged.<br/><br/>Previous investigations and surveys into oil prices, including home heating oil, have been undertaken by the National Consumer Agency (now the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission), and these are available at .  The research indicates that the price paid by consumers is largely determined by taxation levels, the internationally traded price of crude oil and the consequent price at which refined product is traded in Europe, along with the level of competition in the retail market.<br/><br/>It is a general Government policy to avoid excessive regulatory burden and allow market forces and competition to determine price insofar as possible.  Regulatory intervention in the oil market could only be justified if investigations by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission indicated that consumers were being unfairly treated by oil companies.  Notwithstanding that, in my forthcoming consultation on energy affordability, I intend to consult with the public on whether the oil market in Ireland should be regulated by the Commission for Energy Regulation.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.The national high-speed coverage map which I published on the 24th November last shows clearly those areas of the country where public investment will be required.  On the same day I also published a public consultation on the mapping process. This consultation will close on the 12th February next.  This consultation process aims to ensure the accuracy of the map and to establish where the State will need to intervene. It will further inform the Government&rsquo;s proposed intervention strategy.<br/><br/>The map and county by county breakdown, which includes lists of every townland on a county-by-county basis, can be accessed at .  The areas on the map marked Blue will all have access to high speed broadband services of at least 30Mbps from the commercial sector by end of 2016.  The areas marked Amber will require the intervention of the State. It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.<br/><br/>The map allows all member of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end of 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government&rsquo;s proposed intervention.  It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands throughout the entire country including Counties Longford and Westmeath.<br/><br/>Intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy.  The strategy will address a range of issues in relation to the intervention including inter alia, the optimum approach to enable high speed broadband services to be delivered to the premises identified on the Map.  The next steps in this process will see a further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy in mid-2015.  The Intervention Strategy will be notified to the European Commission for State Aid clearance. <br/><br/>Following the public consultation, towards the end of this year a detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders.

The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads, such as the Naas Bypass widening, is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  The assessment and prioritisation of individual national road projects is a matter for the NRA within its capital budget and in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Osberstown interchange and the Sallins bypass the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources, supplemented by State road grants.  The selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is, therefore, a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  Owing to the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in roads expenditure in recent years.  The reality is that the available funds do not match the amount of work that needs to be done to maintain existing road infrastructure or address demands for new road improvement projects.  Funding in 2008 was &euro;2.3 billion while funding this year is around &euro;730 million for the national, regional and local road network.  Unfortunately, the current financial realities are such that the budgets proposed for my Department for 2016 and 2017 indicate that capital funding will continue to be very tight, and my ability to progress new projects and PPPs is limited.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge it is important to restore over time capital funding for the transport sector to ensure that infrastructure is maintained but, as of now, I am not in a position to give a commitment in regard to funding of the projects in question, although I acknowledge their national and local importance.</p></reply>

That connectivity is seen as being a significant contributory factor underpinning Ireland's economic recovery and sustainable development into the future.</p>  <p>  As a result, Exchequer supports for the four regional airports (Donegal, IWA Knock, Kerry and Waterford), where appropriate and in accordance with the 2014 EU Guidelines on State aid to airports and airlines, will continue under the Regional Airports Programme 2015 &ndash; 2019.  The draft Programme is currently with the EU Commission for approval.  Following approval, the Programme should provide a level of certainty around support over a multi-annual period, where regional airports can provide a business plan leading to stand-alone commercial viability within a 10-year period.  It is envisaged that future funding will ultimately be provided from a mix of local authority, local business and Exchequer sources.</p></reply>

There are over 14,000 registered boat owners on the seven waterways managed by Waterways Ireland.  These seven waterways make a vital contribution to tourism, attracting visitors from around Ireland and from abroad.<br/><br/>The proposed new bye-laws are intended to enhance the ability of Waterways Ireland to manage the Royal and Grand Canals and the Barrow Navigation for the benefit of all canal users.  Investment by Waterways Ireland in these waterways has made them more attractive for boat owners and is helping to develop them as a vibrant recreational and tourist amenity for all waterway users.  In this context, it is now necessary to update the bye-laws to ensure that the rules governing use of the waterways are fit for purpose and best meet the needs of all waterway users.<br/><br/>I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding certain aspects of the proposed bye-laws.  Waterways Ireland undertook a public consultation process in relation to the proposed bye-laws in 2014.  I am advised that the main stakeholders, including the Inland Waterway Association of Ireland, the Heritage Boat Association, the Royal Canal Amenity Group and the Irish Boat Rental Association, were contacted individually and invited to meet with the Chief Executive and the senior management team of Waterways Ireland prior to submitting their views.  The current permit holders on the three waterways, including traditional canal users and canal dwellers, received individual written notices and were given the opportunity to make their views known. <br/><br/>I understand that over 2,000 submissions were made in the course of the public consultation process and that Waterways Ireland has concluded its analysis of the submissions received.  A summary of the consultation process and of the submissions received is available on the Waterways Ireland website at . <br/><br/>My officials are currently liaising with Waterways Ireland with a view to finalising draft bye-laws which will be referred to me, as Minister, with recommendations for consideration and final decision.  It is my intention to afford interested Deputies and Senators an opportunity to discuss the proposals with me prior to making a final decision on the draft bye-laws.</p></reply>

As the Deputy can appreciate, the scope for funding for the conservation of the built heritage is currently constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances.  Nonetheless, I keep the competing priorities regarding the preservation and enhancement of the national heritage under on-going review having regard to the resources available to my Department.  Funding for the protection of built heritage will continue to be provided by my Department in 2015 via a number of schemes, which will be either directly administered or delivered through local authorities, such as Longford and Westmeath County Councils, or through the Heritage Council.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports in 2015 and future years having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.</p></reply>

This forms the underlying basis of the work of my Department for the remainder of this Government's term of office.  The Government's policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, to increase access to and participation in the arts, and to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life. <br/><br/>Primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council.  The Arts Council is the main channel of State current expenditure on the arts and it will receive almost &euro;59 million in 2015.  Although the Council is funded by my Department, it is statutorily independent in its funding decisions as provided by the Arts Act 2003.  I believe that the Arts Council serves the arts and this country well and the Council has my full confidence.  I do not envisage any fundamental change in the institutional arrangements which encompass the arm's length approach of Arts Council distribution of Exchequer funding to the arts.  Expertise on the arts resides in the Arts Council and it is therefore best placed to identify and fund excellence in the arts.  I have, therefore, no plans to review the Arts Act.<br/><br/>I understand that the Arts Council is examining new, more informative and transparent ways of presenting information on the combined local authority and Arts Council funding of the arts.  The Council&rsquo;s revamped website gives details of all funding distributed to local authorities and to arts organisations in each local authority area.<br/><br/>In November 2014, I met with local authority arts officers to discuss their concerns and their ideas for the future.  Following on from that, I am looking for ways which would improve communication and linkages between the arts officers and other stakeholder bodies.<br/><br/>I am also committed to ensuring the delivery of the country's first ever national cultural policy &ndash; Culture 2025- which will set out the high level aims and policies of the Government in the period up until 2025.  I will shortly be initiating a wide-scale consultation process to ensure that all stakeholders and members of the public can make their views know. <br/><br/><i>Artsandhealth.ie</i>is an independent, national arts and health website developed by the Waterford Healing Arts Trust and Create.  The website providing a focal point and resource for the field of arts and health in Ireland via resource documents, project case studies, a directory of contacts, perspectives on a range of issues and current news.<br/><br/>The Deputy may be interested to know that following publication of <i>Inspiring Prospects - Arts Council Strategic Review</i>in June 2014, the Arts Council is now embarking on a process to develop a new strategy for the arts in 2015 which includes approaches around purposeful engagement with members of the public.  Further details are available on the Arts Council website.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the Group has been proactive in meeting many organisations from both the arts and education sectors.  The process of holding meetings with stakeholders, as well as receiving submissions from key agencies, is in accordance with the provisions under <i>Dialogue and Partnership</i>in the Charter and is ongoing.  In addition, progress is being made by the Group on a number of initiatives, including increasing the number of artists in residence in colleges of education and developing a portal as a key communications and information channel for both the education and arts sectors.</p></reply>

I am satisfied that this promotional work continues to make a significant impact through Culture Ireland's regular grant rounds and showcase programme.  Since its establishment in 2005, Culture Ireland has promoted and supported over 7,500 Irish cultural projects and events worldwide, ranging across music, theatre, dance, literature, film, visual art and architecture.  This support has created significant goodwill and influence for Ireland and has helped to contribute to the strength of Ireland's reputation for creative excellence. <br/><br/>In line with a critical review of Culture Ireland undertaken as part of the Public Service Reform Plan in 2012, the functions of Culture Ireland were fully merged into my Department and an Expert Advisory Committee was established to oversee the programme, with representation from a range of bodies with a shared interest in Ireland&rsquo;s international promotion, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Tourism Ireland, the IDA and the Ireland Funds, as well as representation from the arts community.  The Expert Advisory Committee works with my Department to ensure that the Culture Ireland Programme continues to promote Ireland's artists and gain further opportunities for them worldwide, while maximising the potential of Ireland's creative talent as a motivator for business and tourism interests for Ireland.<br/><br/>Culture Ireland continues to provide critical financial support for Irish artists for events and activities abroad.  For many individual artists and companies, it is their international work which helps make a life in the arts sustainable.  International presenters also value the support of Culture Ireland, both in terms of showcasing and introduction to new Irish talent, as well as in providing financial support to assist artists' travel.<br/><br/>In 2014, Culture Ireland supported over 300 events, which reached audiences of over 3 million and a further 6 million television viewers.  During last year also, Culture Ireland focused on a number of special initiatives, including in particular the hugely successful <i>Ceiliuradh</i>concert in the Royal Albert Hall, which formed part of the State visit by President Higgins to Great Britain.  This role in delivering high profile international programmes is a key element of the work of Culture Ireland.  <br/><br/>In 2015, I have maintained the level of Culture Ireland's funding, which is a measure of the importance I place on its work, and I am confident that it will continue to operate effectively on the international promotion of Irish arts into the future.</p></reply>

While the working title for the project to date has been <i>Cult&uacute;rlann Chonamara at Teach an Phiarsaigh,</i>an official name has not yet<b></b>been chosen for the proposed centre.  I can assure the Deputy that full consideration will be given in due course to all relevant factors in choosing an appropriate name for the building.  Clearly, the Government's decision to include it as one of the flagship capital developments for the 2016 Commemorations will be important in this regard.  The management by the OPW of the national monument at Teach an Phiarsaigh and the presentation of different aspects of Pearse's history and legacy will also be of importance in choosing an appropriate name for the centre.</p></reply>
