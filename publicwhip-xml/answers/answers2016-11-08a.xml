However, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I recognise that every interaction with a child or young person brings an opportunity to improve their health and well being.  In Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures improving Health and Well Being is one of the five major national outcomes that we seek to achieve for children and young people.</p>  <p>  My Department funds the National Longitudinal Survey, Growing Up in Ireland, which has just this week released the key findings resulting from a survey of children first looked at aged 9 and who are now 17 and 18.  The survey shows that children who start drinking or smoking earlier are more likely to drink or smoke more frequently than those who start drinking alcohol later.  For example of the 15% who had had a drink at 13 years of age, 62% of those drank 2-4 times per month, compared with 47% who had not.  The survey also showed whilst 69% of 17/18 year olds had never used cannabis, 8% reported using it occasionally and 2% used it more than once a week.</p>  <p>  Much work has been done with respect to the development of alcohol and drug policies in youth settings through funding provided by my Department.  We support these services under the Youth Service Grant Scheme and the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund, and through the work of a range of youth work organisations.</p>  <p>  I believe we need to continue this development throughout all youth organisations within the National Quality Standards Framework for Youth Work, and I am committed to working with youth organisations for this purpose.  The National Youth Health Programme is a partnership operated by the National Youth Council of Ireland with the Youth Affairs Unit of my Department and the Health Promotion Unit of the HSE respectively.</p>  <p>  The Programme aims to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion/education support and training service.  It includes making healthy choices in relation to alcohol and other drugs, to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in the non-formal education setting.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-08a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110800056#WRA01000"><p>Tusla has had operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme since 2014.  This includes decisions on the allocation of funds to local projects.  The aim of the School Completion Programme is to retain young people in the formal education system until they complete the senior cycle.  The Programme is designed to improve school attendance and participation of young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage.  The programme provides targeted supports annually to approximately 37,000 children.</p>  <p>  The Economic and Social Research Institute reviewed the programme on behalf of Tusla and its report was published in October 2015.  Tusla has taken a number of actions to address the findings of the review and to strengthen the operation of the programme for the future.  My focus now is on ensuring that the reforms proposed in the review are implemented.  I believe that we should examine the case for additional investment when these reforms have been achieved, particularly after the governance arrangements at local and national level have been put in place.  The Agency has confirmed that the cost of funding the School Completion Programme in 2016 is &euro;24.756m the same as 2014 and 2015. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that the Programme is now achieving a school completion rate of over 90%.  This is a welcome illustration of its effectiveness, and represents a 7% increase since 2006. </p>  <p>  An important priority for me as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is to improve attendance and participation in education, particularly for vulnerable children.  The Programme for Government commits to publishing a new School Completion Strategy to further improve school completion rates, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  I will work closely with the Minister for Education and Skills in developing the new Strategy and in the context of the Government programme commitment to a  new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.  The aim is to secure quality educational outcomes for all children, especially those at risk of educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

I want to establish an accountable national system for service management and delivery, and to provide assurances regarding the quality and sustainability of services into the future.  In particular, I want to provide in  legislation for the status and functions of the Guardian ad litem, as well as for the professional qualifications and practical experience required to be eligible to act a Guardian ad litem.</p>  <p>  In order to inform key areas of reform, my Department conducted a consultation with stakeholders.  Some 26 detailed responses to my Department's paper "Preparing a Policy Approach to the Reform of Guardian Ad Litem Arrangements" have been received.  The responses were published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 28th  September 2016.</p>  <p>  The overall objectives of my reforms will be to extend the GAL system to benefit the greatest number of children and young people, and to provide a service that is high quality and sustainable into the future. </p>  <p>  I have recently brought detailed policy proposals to Government and obtained approval for the drafting of a General Scheme and Heads of Bill.  This new Bill will address key areas such as the establishment of a nationally organised, managed and delivered service which is underpinned by clear principles and policies.  The circumstances where a Guardian ad litem should be appointed will be set out in the legislation.  The role and powers of the Guardian ad litem will be delineated, together with the  professional qualifications and practical experience required to be eligible to act as a Guardian ad litem, will be specified. </p>  <p>  I also intend to provide for appropriate access to legal advice and legal representation for GALs, while recognising that not every case will require this legal support.  The best interests of the child will be the paramount consideration in all of these matters.  I am committed to progressing these proposals as quickly as possible, and am aiming to have Heads of Bill ready in draft form by the end of the year.</p></reply>

Tusla services are delivered geographically through 17 areas in total and the social worker whole time equivalent is reflective of the service needs of the particular area&rsquo;s population. </p>  <p>  Tusla continues to have ambitious recruitment targets and expects to recruit an additional 90 whole time equivalent social workers before the end of 2016 and an additional 135 whole time equivalent social workers in 2017.  I understand that the allocation of these additional social workers in Tusla's 17 areas, including the two areas incorporating Tipperary, will be informed by on-going discussions between Tusla and its Regional HR Managers to identify positions required to meet service needs. </p>  <p>  2017 will be the second year of a three year initiative to tackle the issue of child protection cases awaiting allocation to a social worker and the additional funding announced by my Department for Tusla in 2017 will allow the Agency to continue its programme of social worker recruitment to address this issue.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-08a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110800056#WRA01600"><p>I am pleased to assure the Deputy that no recipients will be made worse off as a result of the improvements I am introducing.  Under the current programmes, including the TEC programme to which the Deputy refers, there are many families with low income-levels who are not currently able to access subsidised childcare because of the requirement to be in receipt of certain state benefits or attending certain training programmes. </p>  <p>  The benefits of moving to an income-basis for eligibility under the new scheme include:</p>  <p>  - Clarity, with a move away from a complex array of eligibility criteria to a single, clear basis. </p>  <p>  - Reduction of welfare traps and increased support for progression into employment and retention in employment. </p>  <p>  - Equity, in ensuring that low-income working families are not excluded from benefitting from subsidised childcare.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the vast majority of people (95%) who avail of the current targeted childcare schemes will benefit from the change to the new Affordable Childcare Scheme.  For example, under the most generous of the current TEC programmes, the maximum parental contribution of &euro;25 per week equates to &euro;0.62 per hour.  By contrast, under the new scheme, those getting the maximum rate of subsidy might be expected to face a lower average parental contribution of &euro;0.30 per hour. It is estimated that 77% of the current scheme beneficiaries will get the maximum rate of subsidy under the new scheme.  Furthermore, 'saver provisions' will mean that nobody will be made worse off in the immediate transition to the new scheme, i.e people will either gain or have their subsidy protected for a transitional period.</p>  <p>  In 2017, the number of children benefiting from the new Affordable Childcare scheme is estimated at 79,000.  This includes 25,000 children who will benefit from the universal subsidy.  An estimated 54,000 children will benefit from the targeted subsidies, including 31,500 children who already receive support under the current targeted schemes and 22,500 new beneficiaries.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-08a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110800056#WRA01800"><p>I am satisfied that the new scheme is properly funded to support people on the lowest incomes.  Budget 2017 provided an additional &euro;19m to enable the introduction of a new single Affordable Childcare Scheme from September 2017.  This is in addition to the existing funding which supports the current targeted schemes and which equates to &euro;87m annually.  The full year cost of the scheme will be approximately &euro;150m. </p>  <p>  From September 2017, the new Affordable Childcare Scheme will:</p>  <p>  -  replace the existing targeted subsidisation schemes with a new streamlined and simplified scheme which is more accessible for both parents and providers,</p>  <p>  -  provide a fair and consistent scheme of progressive financial support towards the cost of childcare, with a particular initial focus on lower income families but also incorporating universal supports, and</p>  <p>  -  provide a robust and flexible platform for future investment in childcare in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 provided an additional &euro;19m to enable the introduction of a new single Affordable Childcare Scheme from September 2017.  However, this is in addition to the existing funding which supports the current targeted schemes and which equates to &euro;87m annually.  The full year cost of the scheme will be approximately &euro;150m. </p>  <p>  The new scheme will make childcare more affordable, and will enable both universal and targeted subsidies for parents towards their childcare costs.  In 2017, the number of children benefiting from the new Affordable Childcare scheme is estimated at 79,000.  This includes 25,000 children who will benefit from the universal subsidy.  An estimated 54,000 children will benefit from the targeted subsidies, including 31,500 children who already receive support under the current targeted schemes and 22,500 new beneficiaries.</p>  <p>  Under the targeted element of the scheme, the maximum income threshold ensures that all families within the bottom 5 income deciles should receive some level of support.  However, the scheme also provides a flexible platform for future investment, allowing income thresholds and subsidy rates to be adjusted over time so as to expand support to more families.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-08a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110800057#WRB00300"><p>I am committed to implementing the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 which entitles eligible young people to a formal aftercare plan, prepared by Tusla in collaboration with the young person leaving care.  I am pleased that the Act creates an explicit, as opposed to a current implicit, statement of Tusla&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the young person's need for assistance and support as they leave care.</p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with Tusla to ensure that the provisions of the Act can be fully implemented as quickly as possible in the coming months.</p>  <p>  At present, there are some 1,900 young people receiving aftercare services from Tusla.  In the first six months of this year, 315 young adults were discharged from State care on reaching the age of 18.  Some 98% of them were eligible for an aftercare service and 91% of those eligible (or 280 young people) availed themselves of it.</p>  <p>  In terms of funding, I secured an additional &euro;37m for Tusla in Budget 2017, which will bring its total allocation to &euro;713m.  Tusla will shortly prepare a Business Plan for my consideration which will set out how it proposes to allocate its total funding for the year.  This will include its spending plans for implementing the legislation on aftercare, as well as all of the other services it provides.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the costs arising here relate only to implementing the provisions of the aftercare legislation itself.  Young people leaving care typically receive supports relating to accommodation, further education, employment and training, which are funded by other Government Departments.  This means that the part of Tusla&rsquo;s budget for 2017 which is ultimately allocated to aftercare services under the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 will represent just a small proportion of the total spending by the State on those in receipt of aftercare services.</p>  <p>  I believe that our young people leaving care deserve high quality supports throughout the system, and that full implementation of the Child Care (Amendment) Act will be a key element of how our society helps them to make this critical transition in their lives.</p></reply>

The study found that childcare type-and hours explain only 1% of the variance or difference in children's scores on the tests used.</p>  <p>  In the best interests of children (and families) the new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme intends to make subsidies payable to services that are quality assured.

In order to meet the needs of parents whose preference is to use a childminder, and to build capacity to cater for increased demand in future years, the Department has commenced talks with Childminding Ireland (CMI) in recent months to explore a number of options around how quality can be assured within the childminding sector.</p>  <p>  A working group has been established, chaired by CMI, and including officials from Tusla and the DCYA, to make recommendations on reforms for the sector including proposals in relation to quality assurance, whether on a voluntary/non-statutory basis in the short term, or on a mandatory/statutory basis in the long term.  These will include recommendations in relation to childminders who are exempt from registration with Tusla (those minding three or fewer pre-school children, or those minding school age children only).  The recommendations received are likely to include proposals to be progressed in the short, medium and long term, including the development of National Quality Standards for childminders and a proportionate system of quality assurance and regulation.</p></reply>

International evidence indicates that systems based on universalism are associated with lower rates of child poverty and deliver better outcomes for <i>all</i>children, with disadvantaged children benefitting more when services are provided within a universal programme design.  Progressive universalism further recognises the importance of the provision of additional support to those with the greatest need.</p><p>The new scheme is highly progressive overall, with eligibility based on net parental income and the highest levels of support offered to those on the lowest incomes.  It is more equitable and accessible than the current targeted subsidy programmes, under which many low-income families are not currently able to access subsidised childcare because of the requirement to be in receipt of certain state benefits or attending certain training programmes.  It will also enhance affordability, offering greater levels of support overall to low income families than the current targeted schemes.  For example, a person in receipt of the maximum level of subsidy under the current Community Childcare Scheme (by far the largest of the current targeted schemes) might face a weekly co-payment of &euro;89 per week.  Under the new scheme, a person in receipt of the maximum rate of subsidy might be expected to face an average weekly co-payment of &euro;12 per week.</p><p>The universal subsidy for children under 3 recognises the fact that the cost of childcare is generally highest when children are under 3 years of age and this cost can push many parents out of the labour market when paid maternity leave ends.  This higher cost is due to both the hours of care required (i.e. notably longer than afterschool care needs) and the underlying cost of providing quality childcare for very young children.  Recent reports also suggest that cost and sustainability issues are affecting the availability of childcare places for children under 3 years.  The Government commitment to provide a universal subsidy for this age cohort, as well as to provide higher rates of targeted subsidy, recognises and responds to these issues.</p><p>Finally, the Deputy has also asked about families above the income cut-off for targeted subsidies.  Of course, all targeted schemes, by their nature, have thresholds and cut-off points.  However, the new Affordable Childcare Scheme is designed to be flexible, with the ability to adjust income thresholds, subsidy rates and income taper rates, over time and as further Government investment becomes available.</p></reply>

The new scheme will provide a system from which both universal and targeted subsidies can be provided towards the cost of childcare.  This new scheme will replace the existing targeted childcare programmes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme and is intended to provide &ldquo;wraparound‟ care for pre-school and school-age children.</p><p>The universal element of the Scheme will be available to all families with children between the age of 6 months and 36 months (or until the child qualifies for the free pre-school programme if later than 36 months), who are attending a registered childcare provider.</p><p>The targeted element of the scheme will be available to families with children between the age of 6 months and 15 years, with eligibility based on net parental income.  For parents with net incomes up to &euro;22,700 per annum, the maximum rate of childcare subsidy will be payable.</p><p>The rate of subsidy will taper downwards as net income rises, with no means-tested / income related subsidy payable when <b>net</b>income reaches &euro;47,500.  The income thresholds increase where there is more than one child in a family, so a family with two children under 15 years of age would have a maximum net income threshold of &euro;51,300 and a family with three children under 15 years would have a maximum <b>net</b>income threshold of &euro;55,100.</p><p>Budget 2017 has allocated funding for the development of an online IT application system that will allow parents to apply for subsidies online by entering their PPS number and other details such as their work or training status.  In order to make the application process as easy as possible for parents, it is intended that the means-testing will, in most cases, be carried out through an automatic link with income data held by the Revenue Commissioners and by the Department of Social Protection.  However, parents will be able to appeal decisions and/or request a manual means test by the delegated scheme administrator, which will require the submission of documentary evidence of income and relevant deductible expenses.  The use of the PPS number and data sharing across public bodies and agencies will be enabled and supported through legislation and formal data sharing agreements.</p><p>The full year cost estimate for the new scheme is &euro;150m which includes the current budget of &euro;87m for the existing targeted childcare schemes.  For 2017, the additional budget requirement (over and above the 2016 budget) is &euro;19m.  The cost estimates include the cost of administering the scheme, and the 2017 costs also include the once-off cost of developing the IT infrastructure to underpin the scheme.  While it is intended that most income assessments will be automated, the administration costs include provision for resources to carry out manual assessments when requested.</p></reply>

However, it is important to note that due to normal attrition, such as retirements and resignations, the social worker whole time equivalent has increased by 71 since the start of 2016.</p>  <p>  During 2016, Tusla has been very proactive in what is a challenging recruitment market.  Earlier this year, Tusla ran a successful recruitment campaign in third level colleges throughout Ireland, including Northern Ireland, to attract social work graduates.  Following its campaign, Tusla conducted  interviews during the summer and 248 candidates were successfully placed on a panel.  I understand 101 social work posts have been offered to date and accordingly the social worker whole time equivalent numbers should increase in the coming months as the new recruits commence work.  In addition, Tusla is also launching an on-going recruitment campaign to attract social workers specifically interested in working in child and family services.  Tusla has also commenced work on its 2017 graduate recruitment campaign which will include colleges in the UK.</p>  <p>  In addition to its recruitment campaigns, Tusla has undertaken a range of activities to raise its profile as an employer of choice.  These include the introduction of an internal transfer policy to allow staff mobility, more flexible work practices and protected time for Continuing Professional Development.</p></reply>

The new scheme will provide a system from which both universal and targeted subsidies can be provided towards the cost of childcare.</p><p>The new Affordable Childcare Scheme, which will replace the existing targeted childcare programmes, aims to:</p><p>-  streamline the existing targeted schemes to make them more accessible for both parents and providers,</p><p>-  provide a fair and consistent scheme of progressive financial support towards the cost of childcare, with a particular focus, at least initially, on lower income families but also incorporating universal supports, and</p><p>-  provide a robust and flexible platform for future investment in childcare in Ireland.</p><p>By achieving the above aims, it is intended that the new scheme will contribute to:</p><p>-  poverty reduction in Ireland,</p><p>-  ensuring that access to affordable childcare is not a barrier to labour market participation, including female labour market participation,</p><p>-  promoting positive child outcomes,</p><p>-  narrowing the gap in attainment between more and less advantaged children by enabling all children to access high quality, affordable childcare, and</p><p>-  driving quality across the sector.</p><p>Under the scheme, a progressive system of income related subsidies will be available to all parents with children aged between 6 months and 15 years, with eligibility for a subsidy based on net parental income, i.e. the combined income (or sole income in the case of a one parent family) net of income tax, PRSI, USC and certain allowable deductions, including a &lsquo;multiple child deduction&rsquo; which recognises the cumulative effect on families of childcare costs for multiple children.</p><p>All parents with children between the age of 6 months and 36 months with net incomes above the maximum income level will receive a universal subsidy towards their cost of childcare.  Parents with net incomes below the maximum income threshold will receive a higher (targeted) subsidy rate.  The rate that they receive is dependent on their net income as a tapered subsidy applies which reduces as parental income increases until the subsidy reaches the universal rate of &euro;0.50 per hour.</p><p>Under the current programmes, including the TEC programme to which the Deputy refers, there are many families with low income levels who are not currently able to access subsidised childcare because of the requirement to be in receipt of certain state benefits or attending certain training programmes.</p><p>The benefits of moving to an income basis for eligibility under the new scheme include:</p><p>-  Clarity, with a move away from a complex array of eligibility criteria to a single, clear basis.</p><p>-  Reduction of welfare traps and increased support for progression into employment and retention in employment.</p><p>-  Equity, in ensuring that low-income working families are not excluded from benefitting from subsidised childcare.</p><p>It is anticipated that the vast majority of people (95%) who avail of the current targeted childcare schemes will benefit from change to the new Affordable Childcare Scheme.  Furthermore, 'saver provisions' will mean that nobody will be made worse off in the immediate transition to the new scheme, i.e people will either gain or have their subsidy protected for a transitional period.</p></reply>

Against this backdrop, my Department has engaged in a reform programme to ensure quality effective, value for money services that are evidence based and designed to secure the best outcomes for young people.</p>  <p>  My Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector.  The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people.  It is estimated that the voluntary youth services involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working throughout the country.</p>  <p>  The schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme under which funding is made available on an annual basis to thirty national and major regional youth organisations, the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme which supports youth work activities at a local level and the Youth Information Centre Scheme which funds twenty five Youth Information Centres.</p>  <p>  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.</p>  <p>  My Department, along with all government departments, was required to deliver substantial savings on all funding programmes in line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012 &ndash; 2014.  My Department sought to ensure that front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people, were protected as far as is possible from the impact of any necessary reductions in funding.</p>  <p>  You will be aware that the targeted schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of the impact youth service provision has on young people&rsquo;s lives.  The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead.</p>  <p>  The work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the Value for Money and Policy Review of Youth Programmes over the coming years.</p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020, published last October, was developed in close consultation with statutory youth interests and the voluntary youth organisations and services that work with young people.</p>  <p>  The strategy sets out Government&rsquo;s aims for young people, aged 10 to 24 years, so that they are active and healthy, achieving their full potential in learning and development, safe and protected from harm, have economic security and opportunity and are connected and contributing to their world.  The Strategy identifies some fifty priority actions to be delivered by Government departments, state agencies and by others, including the voluntary youth services over 2015 to 2017.  They include actions to address issues which are a high priority for young people themselves.</p>  <p>  There have been other significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services.  These include the setting up of the North South Education and Training Standards Committee for youth work and the introduction of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 which, inter alia, provides for a statutory function for Education and Training Boards in supporting the provision and assessment of youth work services at local level.</p>  <p>  At EU level, the Council of Ministers for Youth has adopted an EU Youth Strategy and has taken a number of policy initiatives to promote quality in the provision of youth work services.  The National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making 2015-2020, which was published by my Department in June, 2015 is particularly relevant.  I am deeply committed to ensuring that young people are involved in the preparation, planning and implementation of policies that impact on their lives.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Budget 2017 has provided some &euro;57m in current funding to my Department to support the provision of youth services.  The increase of &euro;5.5m effectively reverses the cuts which had to be endured in recent years.</p></reply>

Tusla will shortly prepare a Business Plan for my consideration which will set out how it proposes to allocate its total funding for the year.  This will include its spending plans for implementing the legislation on aftercare, as well as all of the other services it provides.</p>  <p>  I am committed to implementing the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 which entitles eligible young people to a formal aftercare plan, prepared by Tusla in collaboration with the young person leaving care.  I am pleased that the Act creates an explicit, as opposed to a current implicit, statement of Tusla&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the young person's need for assistance and support as they leave care.  My Department is working closely with Tusla to ensure that the provisions of the Act can be fully implemented as quickly as possible in the coming months.</p>  <p>  In order to fulfil its obligations, Tusla will have to increase the number of aftercare workers available to help young people identify and plan for their needs.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the costs arising here relate only to implementing the provisions of the aftercare legislation itself.  Young people leaving care typically receive supports relating to accommodation, further education, employment and training, which are funded by other Government Departments.  The role of Tusla is to provide advice, guidance, support and signposting, which are key elements of this service and these supports are available to all care leavers.  This means that the part of Tusla&rsquo;s budget for 2017 which is ultimately allocated to aftercare services under the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 will represent just a small proportion of the total spending by the State on those in receipt of aftercare services.</p>  <p>  At present, there are some 1,900 young people receiving aftercare services from Tusla and approximately half of these young people remained with their carers while 6% were in a residential placement.  Data provided by Tusla show that in the first six months of 2016, approximately 315 young people were discharged from care by reason of turning 18.

It is expected that the policy will be supported by additional guidance and training for staff when the review is completed and an implementation plan has been finalised.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the handling of retrospective disclosures is a complex issue, and have raised this issue with Tusla senior management during meetings.  I have emphasised the importance of dealing with cases as soon as possible, while recognising the practical difficulties that can often arise in relation to alleged events of many years ago.  I have asked to be informed of the challenges Tusla face in its efforts to protect children, while preserving a person&rsquo;s right to natural justice and fair procedure, where there is an allegation involved.  Tusla will and does act on behalf of the child where there is a credible report of risk involved.</p>  <p>  Children First guidance includes a description of retrospective disclosures, and makes clear that any current concerns about children which come to light should be reported to child welfare and protection services.</p>  <p>  Tusla is undertaking a full review of all referrals of allegations of retrospective abuse.  This review is looking at all referrals to establish their priority for action.  I am expecting this review to conclude later in the year and I have requested Tusla to keep me up to date on its progress and on any emerging issues of concern.  Tusla has identified specialist staff to undertake this work nationally.</p>  <p>  My Department has begun a process to review the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, and is currently sourcing information on any aspect of the handling of allegations of abuse that might be examined as part of this review.</p></reply>

The new scheme will provide a system from which both universal and targeted subsidies can be provided towards the cost of childcare. This new scheme will replace the existing targeted childcare programmes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme and is intended to provide &ldquo;wraparound‟ care for pre-school and school-age children.</p><p>The universal element of the scheme will be available to all families with children between the age of 6 months and 36 months (or until the child qualifies for the free pre-school programme if later than 36 months), who are attending a registered childcare provider.</p><p>The targeted element of the scheme will be available to families with children aged between 6 months and 15 years, with eligibility for subsidies based on net parental income.  For parents with net incomes up to &euro;22,700 per annum, the maximum rate of childcare subsidy will be payable.</p><p>The rate of subsidy will taper downwards as net income rises, with no means-tested / income related subsidy payable when <b>net</b>income reaches &euro;47,500.  The income thresholds increase where there is more than one child in a family, so a family with two children under 15 years of age would have a maximum net income threshold of &euro;51,300 and a family with three children under 15 years would have a maximum <b>net</b>income threshold of &euro;55,100.</p><p>Under the current programmes there are many families with low income-levels, including lone parents, who are not currently able to access subsidised childcare because of the requirement to be in receipt of certain state benefits or in attendance at certain training programmes.</p><p>It is envisaged that the introduction of the new single affordable childcare scheme will increase the accessibility and affordability of childcare for families, including lone parent families. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-08a.123.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110800058#WRC02600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 to 69, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The legally binding accounting rules which must be used by all EU Member States for producing Government Finance Statistics (GFS) are those of the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010). The Manual on Government Deficit and Debt (MGDD) provides further guidance on the implementation of ESA 2010 when reporting GFS.</p>  <p>  To test whether a unit is in government, the decision rules that need to be followed are as per ESA 2010 and MGDD. These rules establish that an entity should be classified in the government sector if it is (a) under public (government) control and (b) if it is a non-market entity.  The first step in the classification process is therefore to determine  if the unit is under public control.  Not all publicly controlled entities are in general government. This is because if a publicly controlled unit is a market producer (i.e. selling their output at economically significant prices) it is classified outside government as a public corporation.</p>  <p>  Historically the universities were classified as privately controlled non-profit institutions in the National Accounts.  The CSO, having reviewed the Universities Act, 1997, concluded that, on balance, the universities have sufficient degree of autonomy under this legislation to be classified as being privately and not publicly controlled. Therefore the universities are not currently included in the list of public corporations published by the CSO.  </p>  <p>  In 2012 the CSO reclassified the universities as market producers meaning they were classified to the non-financial corporations sector rather than the non-profit sector.  Therefore, currently the universities are classified outside Government on the basis that they are (a) privately controlled and (b) market producers.   This second assessment currently considers the fee income including the portion paid by the State (which is considered a transfer to households who then pay the fee) as sales.  Other income combined with these fees is sufficient to meet over 50% of costs. </p>  <p>  According to the rules of the MGDD the market / non-market criterion is applied taking results over a "number of years" - in practical terms usually a three year period is taken.  Only when a clear pattern is observed is a reclassification undertaken.  This ensures that government figures are not made volatile through reclassifications arising from exceptional events. </p>  <p>  In common with other entities in receipt of significant public funds the universities are subject to routine checks on their sector classification by the CSO.  If the universities were to be classified as under public control as a result of such a review, only then would the market/non-market criterion apply to the decision as to whether they should be classified in the government sector or not.</p></reply>

It will provide for the licensing of all forms of on-line gambling.</p><p>The General Scheme was referred to what was at the time the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for consideration and observations. The Joint Committee received 29 submissions and held public hearings following which it issued a report on 6 November 2013 which contained 8 conclusions and was laid before the Houses.</p><p>The 2013 General Scheme provides for the conferring of responsibility for all regulatory matters in this area on the Minister for Justice and Equality, including licensing, inspections and prosecutions, and it envisages that these functions would be carried out by a body located within the Department of Justice and Equality.</p><p>The General Scheme also provides for a dedicated inspectorate to ensure compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licences and with the new legislation generally. </p><p>The Gambling Control Bill will have consumer protection generally as one of its core principles, and it is envisaged that it will include several measures aimed at the protection of vulnerable persons, including children, from risks to their well-being arising from gambling. </p><p>  The 2013 Scheme includes measures that will require licence holders to act in a socially responsible way. These measures include controls on advertising, promotions and sponsorship. </p><p>It would remain the intention to proceed with this legislation at the earliest feasible opportunity. In support of these efforts the Government has delegated powers of the Minister for Justice and Equality under the gaming and lotteries legislation to me as Minister of State. Since my appointment I have requested my departmental officials to review the Scheme published in 2013 by way of taking account of intervening developments and technologies in the gaming sector. This review will help to update policy in this area.</p><p>At the same time, and pending the bringing forward of the main Bill, which, I am sure Deputies are aware, is a major undertaking, I have also asked my Department to examine whether there are any individual pressing areas of concern, intended to be dealt with in the Bill, which could be dealt with sooner by separate legislative measures and this is being actively considered.<font color="#000080"> </font>I am aware that there are a number of areas of immediate concern to Deputies and to the wider community. It is my intention, therefore, that work on such early measures will continue in tandem with the wider review of the existing Scheme of a Bill to avoid any undue delay. My officials and I will continue consultations with relevant stake-holders and I intend to move forward as quickly as possible with the appropriate legislation.</p></reply>

For the 32 week duration of phase 1 of their training they receive a</font>basic weekly allowance of &euro;184 and full board in the Garda College.  After 32 weeks they are fully attested and move onto the first point of the Garda incremental pay scale of &euro;23,750.  The incremental scale rises to &euro;42,138 per annum after 8 years with two further increments after 13 and 19 years' service which bring the maximum of the pay scale to &euro;45,793 per annum after 19 years.  New Garda&iacute;, like all public servants, will see their salary increased by &euro;1,000 in September 2017 under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, as part of the Government's commitment to the gradual restoration of pay. </p><p>When considering Garda pay it is, however, important to recall that the Garda salary scale does not represent the full earnings of a Garda as it does not include any allowances which form a very significant part of Garda earnings.  Newly attested Garda&iacute; assigned to frontline duties work the Garda Roster which attracts unsocial hours payments.  They also qualify for uniform allowance and boot allowance.  Taking account of these allowances I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the average earnings of a newly attested Garda in the first year of their probation is approximately &euro;30,500. </p><p>In January 2010, the first point of the Garda salary scale was &euro;25,745.  Having regard to a restructuring of the training programme in the intervening years this is not directly comparable with the position that pertains at present.  In addition, newly attested Garda&iacute; at that time qualified for the rent allowance.  Following a review of all allowances in the public service during 2011 and 2012, the Government decided on 18 September 2012 that this allowance should be abolished for all new public servants including Garda&iacute;, Prison Officers and Fire Officers.  It is acknowledged that this decision has had a significant impact on new Garda&iacute; recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, on Thursday last the Labour Court issued recommendations in respect of disputes involving the Garda Representative Association (GRA) and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI).  The Court's recommendations, which are to be balloted on by members of the two Associations in the coming weeks, would benefit new recruits in a number of ways.  In particular, the Court has recommended that the rent allowance abolished for new recruits in 2012, be restored and increased by &euro;500 per annum to &euro;4,655.  The allowance is to be incorporated into pay which would result in increased unsocial hours and overtime payments.  The Labour Court has also recommended the introduction of a premium payment of &euro;15 for every annual leave day to acknowledge the fact that the operation of the administration of justice has the effect of diminishing the certainty of approved annual leave for Garda&iacute;.  Paid 15 minute pre-tour briefing/tasking sessions are also recommended by the Court and together with the recommendations referred to above, would benefit all Garda&iacute;, including new recruits.</p><p>These recommendations, if accepted, will have a significant positive effect on the remuneration of new recruits and I am sure that all concerned will give them the detailed consideration that they deserve.</p></reply>

Last month I launched <i>Abhaile, </i>the Government&rsquo;s Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service.  Under this scheme, free legal advice is available to insolvent borrowers who are in danger of losing their family home.  263 people have been referred to this free legal advice under this scheme since it began.  In addition the Board has arranged for a duty solicitor to be present at every repossession list at county registrars&rsquo; courts to assist insolvent borrowers who do not have legal representation for such proceedings. </p><p>This is a new additional service and separate to the traditional provision of civil legal aid which is subject to the application of a merits test under section 24 and section 28(2) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.  These criteria include whether the applicant is reasonably likely to be successful in the proceedings, assuming that the facts put forward by him or her in relation to the proceedings are proved before the court or tribunal concerned.  In many repossession cases the applicant is unlikely to have any prospect of success as the lender will usually be entitled to orders for possession and sale in circumstances where the mortgage is valid and is in arrears.  In such circumstances the applicant is unlikely to meet the criteria for granting civil legal aid.</p><p>The Deputy should note that proceedings for ejectment are not normally within the scope of civil legal aid by virtue of section 28(9) (a) (ii) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, save where a local authority is seeking to exclude a person from social housing or where certain exemptions to this rule apply.</p><p>The number of applications for legal aid and legal aid certificates granted for repossession or ejectment from 2013 to 2016 (to date) are as set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of applications</th><th>Number of legal aid certificates granted</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>24</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>93</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>147</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>1/1/16 &ndash; 2/11/16</td><td>86</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>2016 - Abhaile scheme referrals </td><td>263</td><td>- </td></tr></table></p><p>Data of this nature is not available for the years 2011 and 2012.

However, I can assure the Deputy that the investigation of white collar crimes remains a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this Government will continue to provide the necessary legislative and administrative supports to help bring the perpetrators of such crime to justice.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) has dedicated expert staff to address white collar crime.  There are currently two full-time forensic accountants assigned to the Bureau and a competition to appoint a further two forensic accountants has recently been completed by the Public Appointments Service. </p>  <p>  The previous Government brought forward new legislation in the Criminal Justice Act 2011 which was an important step forward in our response to this form of criminality.  Its main purpose is to address delays in the prosecution and investigation of complex white collar crime by improving certain important procedural matters and strengthening Garda investigative powers.  Another recent provision is Part 5 of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 which allows for the selection of additional jurors for longer trials, such as those involving complex financial matters where jurors might become unavailable due to the length of the proceedings.</p>  <p>  In terms of forthcoming legislation, work on the drafting of the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill  is at an advanced stage and it is hoped to publish it in the coming weeks in line with the Government's legislative programme.  Provisions in the Bill  will replace  and update the offences of giving and receiving bribes, address the bribery of foreign officials, provide discrete offences outlawing trading in influence, criminalise the making of payments knowingly or recklessly to a third party who intends to use them as a bribe.  The Bill will also enhance the ability of the DPP to bring prosecutions by providing presumptions of corrupt gifts or payment.</p>  <p>  I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop relevant investigative strategies utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodology.  Multiple approaches, including the powers in the Criminal Justice Act 2011 as well as proceeds of crime legislation, money laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau, are all utilised to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted.  I am also advised that there is the closest of cooperation between the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>  <p>  As illustrated in the major banking investigations, the GNECB also works closely with other bodies with relevant enforcement functions, but whose legislative and regulatory functions are not under my Ministerial remit, including the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Central Bank and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I might add that some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021.  This major investment as well as the programme of ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment will clearly benefit all criminal investigations, including those relating to financial crime.</p></reply>

I regret that attempts are being made to create a contrary perception.   </p>  <p>  The Courts Bill 2016 is a short, technical Bill which is being introduced to address the implications of a Court of Appeal ruling in July last.  In that case, the Court of Appeal ruled that where Circuit Court jurisdiction to hear cases involving property is based on the property's rateable valuation, that Court has no such jurisdiction if the property is not rateable under the Valuation Act 2001.  While the Court felt obliged to reach this conclusion, it acknowledged that the ruling was likely to lead to consequences which were &ldquo;both unfortunate and unintended&rdquo;.  The Court added that certain proceedings would have to be commenced in the High Court instead of the Circuit Court and that this would simply create additional costs for litigants &ldquo;and will serve to deprive the parties of access to local courts in the manner in which the Constitution actually intended.&rdquo;  The Bill seeks to address these unintended consequences and to avoid disruption to the orderly management and discharge of court proceedings already under way, as well as any additional costs arising from a collapse or withdrawal of proceedings based on rateable valuation. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a new, innovative mortgage arrears resolution service - Abhaile - was officially launched recently by myself and the Minister for Social Protection.  The new nationwide service marks a departure in State assistance by providing free, independent expert advice and support on financial and legal issues.  The number one objective is to help people to stay in their home wherever possible.  The scheme started in late July and is already proving very effective.  The scheme is designed to help keep families in their homes by identifying sustainable solutions in mortgage arrears cases.  Under the scheme, eligible clients are given vouchers to obtain expert advice from financial and legal advisers in order to resolve their debt issues.  In addition, they can get assistance in court where needed, have access to solicitors, and get help obtaining legal aid.  A major Government information campaign will be launched in the coming weeks to raise awareness of the scheme.  I believe that the introduction of the scheme will help people get out of debt and, wherever possible, to stay in their own homes and would strongly encourage anyone worried about mortgage arrears on their home to contact MABS, the Government gateway for accessing free expert help and advice.</p>  <p>  This new service builds on the protections granted by the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 which assists homeowners in mortgage arrears by granting the Court specific powers to adjourn repossession proceedings in order to allow such a borrower to consult with a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP) with a view to making a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) under the Insolvency Acts and to instruct the PIP to make such a proposal.  In addition, the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015 has been enacted in order to further assist homeowners in mortgage arrears.  The 2015 Act introduced a new "court review" process applicable in cases where creditors such as a lending institution refuse a proposal for a PIA drawn up to resolve the homeowner's debts, including the mortgage on their home.</p>  <p>  Addressing mortgage arrears is necessary in order to assist homeowners in mortgage arrears to remain in their homes and avoid additional pressures on the rental or social housing sectors.  The Government is committed to building on recent reforms and creating a framework that removes fear and brings predictability to a difficult process.  Through a range of actions, including the launch of Abhaile, Government Departments and relevant bodies will continue to work to find ways to encourage those who have not been able to engage with their lending institutions to date to reach suitable long-term debt solutions with a view to avoiding repossessions.</p></reply>

There are currently two Taxing Masters, the maximum permitted under existing legislation, on fixed term appointments that will expire in the coming months.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Part 10 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 provides for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients in this area. It also provides for the creation of a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators that will take over the current functions of the Office of the Taxing-Master and will modernise and reform the existing system for the adjudication of legal costs. Provision is also made, for the first time in legislation, for a set of Legal Costs Principles which are found in Schedule 1 of the 2015 Act and will underpin the adjudication of disputed legal costs. The new Office will also maintain a publicly accessible register of its determinations and will have modern governance and reporting structures. It should also be noted that the Legal Costs Adjudicators will, like the present Taxing Masters, be officers of the Court.</p><p>We are, therefore, in a period of structural reform where what has been traditionally known as the &quot;taxation&quot; of legal costs is concerned. The transition to the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators is, therefore, a matter that requires detailed planning and sequencing so that the relevant legal and administrative arrangements are properly in place. This process will also have to take account of any intervening vacancies that may arise in the Office of the Taxing-Master in relation to the anticipated staffing and management requirements of the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators so as to ensure a smooth and legally robust transition. This includes arrangements within the Courts system where the adjudications of legal costs under the new structure will be conducted in succession to the existing taxation of costs regime.  As I have indicated, this will all be part of the significant transformation of the existing taxation of costs system that will come into place with the forthcoming commencement of Part 10 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 which, the Deputy will wish to note, also contains several transitional provisions.</p><p>On 19 July 2016 I commenced those provisions of Parts 1 and 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 necessary to support the appointment and start-up of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority &ndash; S.I. No. 383 of 2016 refers.  On 29 September, as provided under section 7 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, I appointed, by order, 1 October 2016<b></b>as establishment day of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority &ndash; S.I. No. 507 of 2016 refers.  The resolutions of both Houses approving those nominated by the prescribed nominating bodies for membership of the new Regulatory Authority were completed on 6 October in accordance with the relevant procedures and criteria in Part 2 of the 2015 Act.  Dr. Don Thornhill has been appointed Chairperson of the new Authority, which held its inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016. Following these developments, it is intended that the phased commencement of the remaining Parts of the 2015 Act will be implemented over the remainder of this year and into early 2017 in relation to major undertakings in the new legislation including, I would expect, the completion of all aspects, including staffing, of the transition to the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators under Part 10 to which I have referred.</p><p>At present, my Department is examining the position as regards existing Taxing Master contractual periods and the relevant transitional provisions in the 2015 Act with a view to identifying interim solutions to facilitate the effective transition from Taxing-Master to Legal Costs Adjudicator regimes.</p></reply>

The aim of the booking system is to give certainty to applicants that they will be dealt with on a particular date and within a stated time period. The introduction of the appointment booking system has been a major success and has meant that the long queues that have been associated with the Office are now a thing of the past. This has resulted in a significant improvement in the customer experience. Since its introduction, over 20,000 appointments have been booked on the appointment system.</p><p>As this is the busiest time of the year for the registration office additional staff on overtime have been engaged and the Office is also open on most Saturdays in the autumn. This is in addition to the normal office hours of 8 am - 9 pm Monday to Thursday and 6pm on Fridays. The capacity of the Office to accommodate appointments is monitored on a daily basis, taking into account staffing levels, the type of appointments sought and the general number of appointment cancellations. Where additional capacity is identified further appointments are released.</p><p>The Burgh Quay registration office has facilitated appointments in certain emergency situations, since the introduction of the appointment booking system, and continues to do so. Applicants are advised to email the following address in such cases.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>The relevant NGOs and third level institutions have been briefed by INIS regarding this procedure.</p><p>The Burgh Quay Office also operates an on-line appointment service for Re-entry visas. However, there is no reason for the applicants to present in person for this service as there is also a postal service in place which customers are encouraged to use in the first instance.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the nature of the service provided is such that it is demand led and accordingly, there are peaks in the numbers of callers to the Office at different times of the year. For example, there is a marked increased in demand for registrations during the autumn period primarily due to the surge in demand from third level students at that time of year. Similarly, there are peaks for re-entry visas at the start of the summer and in advance of the Christmas / New Year holiday period. Additional resources are assigned during these periods.</p><p>In accordance with section 9 of the 2004 Immigration Act an applicant is required to register within the registration district in which he or she is resident. For the Dublin Metropolitan Region registration must take place at the Burgh Quay Office.</p><p>If the Deputy has any particular cases in mind, could I suggest that he utilise the Oireachtas mail service which is established for this purpose.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Garda authorities that these vehicles, when used in a public place, must comply with the Road Traffic Acts, including in relation to motor tax, insurance and possession of a valid driver licence or learner permit.  Under the Road Traffic Acts, any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is allowed to stop a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place and demand production of a driver licence or learner permit.  In addition, Garda&iacute; may inspect the vehicle for compliance with vehicle standards legislation, which makes it an offence to drive without reasonable consideration, drive carelessly, or drive dangerously.  The Garda authorities also have powers of seizure, detention, storage and disposal of vehicles under road traffic legislation.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the use of quad bikes and scramblers in public parks and open spaces is strictly prohibited by the local authorities under the Parks and Open Spaces Bye-Laws 2011.</p>  <p>  Despite the road traffic and other relevant legislation available in this area, the Garda authorities have indicated that the use of quad bikes and scramblers by minors and youths in public parks has proven difficult to deal with from an enforcement perspective. Garda members are instructed not to pursue youths on quad bikes, scramblers, etc. owing to the inherent safety risk in pursuing these vehicles.  If such pursuits were to take place, there would be a high risk of these ending in collisions at speed resulting in serious injury or death, so the opportunity to actually bring these vehicles to a stop is rare.</p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have advised that the issue is one which is best addressed through a multi-agency approach.  In this regard, Garda&iacute; are working with local authorities, including park authorities, to examine other solutions, such as engineering solutions.  Enhanced fencing and bike gates are examples of engineering measures taken to restrict access to parks.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Community Policing Unit and Juvenile Liaison Officers will deliver an awareness programme in an effort to discourage parents from purchasing quad bikes and scramblers for children at Christmas time.  I share the Deputy's concerns in relation to the public safety and anti-social issues associated with the misuse of such vehicles and I intend to raise the issues highlighted by the Deputy with the Road Safety Authority in advance of its Christmas road safety campaign.</p></reply>

No. 383 of 2016, I commenced those provisions of Part 1 and Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 as necessary to get the new Regulatory Authority up and running, particularly in terms of its membership and appointment. On 29 September 2016, I signed the Order appointing 1 October 2016 as the official &ldquo;establishment day&rdquo; of the Regulatory Authority as provided under section 7 of the 2015 Act - S.I. No. 507 of 2016 refers. In conjunction with these initial steps the nomination, approval and appointment procedures for the eleven members of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority set out in Part 2 of the 2015 Act have been completed. This has included the required resolutions approving such appointment having been passed by each House of the Oireachtas. Dr. Don Thornhill has also been appointed as Chairperson of the Regulatory Authority. The Authority, which has a lay majority and Chairperson, held its inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016. I had the opportunity to meet with the members of the Authority to mark this historic occasion which I have warmly welcomed as a key step towards the realisation of the important reforms to the provision of legal services and to the transparency of legal costs that are contained in the 2015 Act.</p>  <p>  Now that the new Authority has had its inaugural meeting as an independent statutory regulator, the working focus is, of necessity, on the managed roll-out of the Authority's functions in tandem with the phased commencement, by the Government, of the various remaining Parts and provisions of the 2015 Act. This is no small endeavour as the setting of establishment day of the Authority for 1 October 2016 has automatically triggered a number of working obligations on the new Authority. Moreover, several of these are statute-bound in terms of their delivery deadlines and in terms of the completion of public consultations and reports on the specified matters concerned. These are tasks for which the new Authority will need to build up its working resources in the short term. My Department and the new Regulatory Authority will, therefore, continue to liaise closely to ensure that we can successfully coordinate the commencement, from my side as Minister, and delivery, by the Authority as the new independent statutory regulator, of the various provisions concerned.</p>  <p>  Against this background, it is intended that the phased commencement of the remaining Parts of the 2015 Act will be implemented over the remainder of this year and into early 2017 in relation to major undertakings such as the start-up of the Authority&rsquo;s critical public complaints function. The immediate focus includes the phased commencement of respective sections or Parts of the 2015 Act such as those requiring early public consultations and reports and those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the Roll of Practising Barristers and Pre-Action Protocols. Following this, in the new year, the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced in tandem with the developing resource base and capability of the new body. I would anticipate that the planning and progress of all of these matters will come to be determined in much more precise terms by my Department in conjunction with the Legal Services Regulatory Authority over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This represents a dramatic improvement in turnaround times for the processing of vetting applications in recent years, falling from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013. This improvement has come about as a result of an unprecedented investment by the Government and the Garda Authorities in providing this service, including an increase of over 80 percent in staffing levels and the roll out earlier this year of an e-Vetting system.</p>  <p>  In April this year I commenced the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 and in tandem with that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched the e-Vetting system.  E-Vetting facilitates the on-line processing of applications and this has significantly streamlined the vetting process and contributed to a sustained reduction in processing times for vetting applications.  I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that the vast majority of vetting applications, over 85 percent of applications, now received by the Vetting Bureau are received and processed via the e-Vetting system.</p>  <p>  One very important feature of the e-Vetting system is that the individual applicant can track the progress of their own vetting application on-line and can, therefore, see when their application has been processed and returned to the relevant registered organisation.</p>  <p>  There are a small number of registered organisations who are not yet operating the e-Vetting system and continue to use the old paper format for applications.  For vetting applications that continue to be submitted in paper format, the average turnaround time is in the order of four weeks from the receipt of the application by the Vetting Bureau and this represents a minimum time frame given the administrative input required.  The Garda Authorities continue to work with the organisations who are not yet operating the e-Vetting system to encourage and support them to do so.</p>  <p>  Processing times for any given application can be longer in individual cases when, for example, additional enquiries may be necessary or where errors have been made in the application.  It is important to note that delays can also occur in other aspects of the application process which are outside of the control of the Garda Authorities, for example, in the submission or return of applications by the registered organisations.</p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the vetting service is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account the importance of protecting children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, the current processing period is not unreasonable.</p></reply>

The scheme was originally introduced in response to concerns raised by cross border workers concerning the tax position of employees resident in the State and employed in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The purpose of section 825A TCA is to give relief to those workers who commute to a place of work outside the State and who exercise the duties of their employment wholly outside the State. The relief therefore is not easily aligned in a self-employed context as many elements of a self-employed business of an Irish resident would most likely be carried on from within the State. This could include for example, planning and organisation of activities and jobs, as well as various other ancillary and administrative functions. Therefore, unlike a foreign employment which is a clear, discrete activity carried on in wholly in another jurisdiction, self-employment assignments are much less defined and could present control issues. It should be noted of course that the employees of a self-employed contractor would be eligible for the relief.</p>  <p>  In addition, an extension of the relief to the self-employed would likely provide an incentive for businesses to relocate north of the border in circumstances where the Irish income tax rates compared unfavourably with the prevailing UK rates. Finally, self-employed individuals have the option to incorporate and benefit from lower corporate tax rates whereas employees have no such option. One of the reasons for introducing the relief for cross-border employees was to shield their exposure to the higher rates of Irish income tax. There are no such exposures for a self-employed individual who incorporates his/her sole trade.</p>  <p>  I understand the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is aware of this position.</p></reply>

Exclusion has not been part of ISIF's Responsible Investment strategy with the only exclusions from the Fund being mandated by legislation.  To-date, the Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Act (2008) is the only relevant legislation and the ISIF operates a prohibited securities list of 19 companies on this basis.  There is currently no basis for tobacco exclusions in legislation.  I am informed by ISIF that its senior management and the NTMA Board's Investment Committee agreed to review their current policy on exclusions. This review is underway and is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2017.</p>  <p>  Separately, a review of ISIF's investment strategy, due to take place 18 months after the establishment of the ISIF, is also underway. The review will include an appraisal of the success of ISIF's mandate to date. I am informed by ISIF that preparatory work in respect of this review has commenced and is due to be completed by end-2016.</p>  <p>  The NTMA (Amendment) Act 2014 provides that ownership of the Fund vests with the Minister for Finance. It also provides that the Fund shall, in reviewing its investment strategy, consult the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The review of the ISIF will be conducted in accordance with these provisions. In addition, the legislation provides that the Minister for Finance may consult with other Government Ministers as appropriate.</p>  <p>  In light of all of the foregoing I am satisfied with the approach adopted by ISIF to date in implementing its agreed investment strategy while taking into account international best practice. Both the NTMA and Government are mindful of the fact that public attitudes and policy are not fixed and can evolve. The ongoing review of exclusions by the NTMA and the wider review of ISIF's investment strategy are opportunities to fine tune in the light of relevant developments both nationally and internationally.</p></reply>

In addition, motor tax receipts, which is remitted to the Local Government Fund, is also not included in the figures.  By way of contrast, in 2015, which takes account of the most up to date finalised data, the Exchequer tax revenue as a percent of GDP was c. 18%.  However, if the 2015 social security contributions of c. &euro;8.6 billion and 2015 motor tax receipts of c. &euro;1.1 billion were included in the calculation, it would be around 22%.</p><p>In addition, while the forecasts of tax revenues for the period 2016 to 2021, as a percentage of GDP and GNP remain relatively flat, it is important to point out that the forecasts take account of an indicative c. &euro;2.5 billion of fiscal space allocated to proposed tax reductions to be implemented over this period.</p><p>Furthermore, the decline in the Exchequer tax revenue as a percentage of GDP and GNP in 2015 is primarily due to the revision to the 2015 National Income and Expenditure data, which resulted in a significant upward revision to Ireland's GDP and GNP levels.  This development raises questions regarding the relevance of comparisons using GDP and GNP as a denominator.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, an expert group chaired by Prof. Philip Lane, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, has been convened to consider this issue and is expected to report shortly.</p></reply>

The relevant row in the table is titled "Rented Residential Relief - Section 23". For years prior to 2004, claims for incentive schemes on property were aggregated in tax returns with other claims and could not be separately distinguished. Accordingly data for earlier years are not available.</p>  <p>  The Section 23 tax costs show the estimated tax cost relating to the total allowable expenditure in respect of the claims made.  Under Section 23, the full amount of the relief must be deducted from the rental income of the particular property in the first year of letting, so the tax cost is shown by the year the claim was first made, despite the potential carry-forward which applied to this measure.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that the annual cost to the Exchequer of Section 50 Student Accommodation tax relief and the Rural Renewal Scheme for 2011 to 2014, the years for which data are readily available on these schemes, are included in their 'Certain Property Based Tax Exemptions' table located on their webpage at www.revenue.ie/en/about/statistics/property-exemptions.html.</p>  <p>  Due to the manner in which the data are recorded and published, there may be overlap between the costs in two tables cited above (some of the costs shown for the schemes specified are included in the cost for Section 23 relief but it is not possible quantify the exact amount of overlap).</p>  <p>  With regard to the second question, the table cited above includes the numbers of claims for Section 23 relief.

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p>  <p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>- be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>- be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>  <p>  The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Scheme. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual. The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.</p>  <p>  The Medical Board of Appeal's clinical determination is limited to the scope of the six qualifying criteria, and the Board does not have discretion in relation to the application of these criteria. The criteria to qualify for the Scheme are necessarily precise and specific.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;50.3 million to the Exchequer in 2015, an increase from &euro;48.6 million in 2014. These figures do not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities. I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation. From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

It is hoped that turning notional demand into real demand will generate the supply response, as developers who may have been struggling to raise funding to build houses will be in a position to point to this increased real demand in negotiations with lenders.</p>  <p>  Extending the scheme to apply to second hand properties would have no impact on increasing the supply of new homes being built and thus could not contribute to increased supply.

Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has informed me that it made an application on 2 November 2016 to the High Court to have joint provisional liquidators appointed to Rush Credit Union Limited (Rush Credit Union). Jim Luby and Tom Rogers of McStay Luby were appointed as joint provisional liquidators on that date by the President of the High Court, Mr Justice Peter Kelly.  The full application will be heard on 21 November, when the Central Bank will seek the winding up of Rush Credit Union.  The appointment of the joint provisional liquidators to Rush Credit Union has no impact on members' savings in any other credit union.</p>  <p>  The Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS) provides protection up to &euro;100,000 per depositor per financial institution.  Following the appointment of the joint provisional liquidators, the DGS has been activated. Payments will automatically issue to the address held on file by the credit union.  Members do not have to contact the credit union or the Central Bank, as compensation payments will automatically issue by cheque to all duly verified depositors.  The DGS will make compensation payments as early as possible within the statutory deadline of 20 working days to duly verified depositors. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank is conscious that there is a demand for the services of a credit union in the local area and will examine what arrangements can be put in place to provide specific credit union services in the community in the future.  The Central Bank is keen that credit union services are available to the people of Rush and Lusk.

That is what this Government is doing.  This will help enhance the resilience of the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  At a more micro-economic level, Budget 2017 contains several measures designed to ensure that firms in Ireland - especially those in the SME sector - are prepared for a potentially more difficult trading environment.  This includes tailoring the wide range of State supports currently available such as low cost credit and increased credit supply from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI); funding for growth and efficiency from Enterprise Ireland; and financing for micro enterprises from Microfinance Ireland so that they provide effective support to SMEs affected by challenges arising from the UK referendum.  Furthermore, there are a number of additional supports for SME credit coming on stream, including a &euro;150 million agri-loan fund; and a revamped Credit Guarantee Scheme.  An SME-focused, share-based incentive scheme, is also planned to be introduced in Budget 2018.   </p>  <p>  Further, Budget 2017 retained the reduced 9 per cent VAT rate for the hospitality sector a measure  sought by Retail Ireland in their pre-budget submission. </p>  <p>  It is crucial to maintain competitiveness and in particular in those areas in which we can influence, as clearly we cannot affect exchange rate developments.  It is also important to stress that the recent depreciation of sterling is likely to increase UK consumer prices in the near term as increases in import prices give rise to additional inflationary pressures.  Conversely, there are some signs that recent exchange rate developments are benefitting consumer prices in Ireland which have fallen by almost 1 per cent since the referendum.  This will help mitigate some of the negative impact on the retail sector in Ireland from the depreciation in sterling.</p></reply>

The EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.   </p>  <p>  The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and the need to provide for adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  </p>  <p>  My Department has embarked on a review of policy in the insurance sector which is being undertaken in consultation with the Central Bank and other Departments and Agencies.  The objective of the Review is to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector.   </p>  <p>  As part of that Review, I have established a Cost of Insurance Working Group, chaired by the Minister of State Eoghan Murphy T.D.  This Working Group is examining the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance and identifying what short-term, medium-term and long-term measures can be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  The initial focus of the Working Group is the issue of rising motor insurance premiums, which includes the difficulties facing the taxi sector.  </p>  <p>  At the end of October 2016, the Working Group provided me with an initial set of emerging recommendations.  From November to December, the Working Group will finalise the Report and develop an action plan to enable the relevant Government Departments and Offices to commence the implementation of agreed priority actions. </p>  <p>  Finally, it may be of interest to your constituent that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  In the event that a person is unable to obtain a quotation for motor insurance or feels that the premium proposed or the terms are so excessive that it amounts to a refusal to give them motor insurance, they should contact Insurance Ireland, 5 Harbourmaster Place, IFSC, Dublin 1,  Telephone +353 1 6761820, quoting the Declined Cases Agreement.</p></reply>

Such teachers may also have been entitled to incremental credit for other service.  The teacher could also have received an additional payment of &euro;1,769 per annum if they had opted in to the Supervision and Substitution scheme.</p><p>The typical starting pay for a post-primary teacher in 2010 teacher was &euro;39,195, comprising of basic salary of &euro;33,041 and an honours degree allowance of &euro;4,918 and an allowance for the Higher Diploma in Education of &euro;1,236.  Such teachers may also have been entitled to incremental credit for other service.  The teacher could also have received an additional payment of &euro;1,769 per annum if they had opted in to the Supervision and Substitution scheme.</p><p>Where a teacher commences employment at either primary and post-primary levels on 1 November 2016, those teachers who are covered by the Lansdowne Road Agreement start on a salary of &euro;31,805 as the first moiety of the Supervision and Substitution payment has been included in the pay scale for such teachers.  Teachers who are outside the Lansdowne Road Agreement have not had that moiety included in the pay scale and therefore have a starting salary of &euro;31,009. </p><p>The typical starting pay from January 2018 onwards for a primary and post-primary teacher who is covered by the Lansdowne Road Agreement will be &euro;35,602 due to the recent agreement with TUI and INTO in the context of the Lansdowne Road Agreement. </p><p>The agreement substantially addresses the current difference in pay between those recruited since 2011 and those recruited since 2012.  It will result in increases of up to &euro;2,000 per year for new teachers at the start of their careers.  The increase varies depending on the point of scale that a teacher is on - the highest increase being &euro;7,700 and the increase at the maximum of the scale being &euro;4,300.  It is estimated that over a teacher&rsquo;s career the value of these increases will be &euro;135,000. </p><p>The revised salary arrangement will be implemented in two phases on 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.</p><p>When other Lansdowne Road increases are also factored in, there will be a 15% increase in the starting pay of new entrant teachers between 31 August 2016 and 1 January 2018 (from &euro;31,009 to &euro;35,602).  For an individual TUI/INTO member who started teaching in September 2015, they will see a 22% increase in their pay (including increment) between 31 August 2016 and 1 January 2018 (from &euro;31,009 to &euro;37,723).  In terms of career earnings, this deal in addition to measures already agreed will restore approximately three quarters of the reductions for new entrants put in place since 2011.</p><p>The full text of the agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following address:  </p><p>The Government has also committed to establishing a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p></reply>

The Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) (Amendment) Act 2013, provided the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with the power to make regulations that set out the specific details of the Public Service Sick Leave Scheme.  These regulations are contained in SI 124 of 2014 and provides for the following:</p><p>- A maximum of 3 months (92 days) on full pay in a year</p><p>- Followed by a maximum of 3 months (91 days) on half pay</p><p>- Subject to a maximum of 6 months (183 days) paid sick leave in a rolling four year period.</p><p>A teacher who becomes incapacitated as a result of a critical illness or serious physical injury may be granted extended paid sick leave, in exceptional circumstances of:</p><p>- A maximum of 6 months (183 days) on full pay in a year</p><p>- Followed by a maximum of 6 months (182 days) on half pay</p><p>- Subject to a maximum of 12 months (365 days) paid sick leave in a rolling four year period.</p><p>Where the relevant period of sick leave has been exhausted, a teacher with a minimum of 5 years&rsquo; service at the end of the period of paid sick leave may, subject to certain conditions, be granted Temporary Rehabilitation Remuneration (TRR).</p><p>TRR will not exceed 18 months (548 days) in the case of ordinary illness.

The NCSE local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) has liaised with the Parents and helped identify available school placement options.</p><p>The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents/guardians of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  Parents can choose which school to apply to and, where the school has places available, the pupil should be admitted.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school.

I have no role in regard to the organisation&rsquo;s day to day operations. </p><p>I understand that up to the end of September 2016 Caranua had received over 5,500 applications and had spent almost &euro;53 million on supports to or on behalf of 3,884 applicants.Therefore a significant level of funding has been provided to a large number of former residents, a fact which is to be welcomed.</p><p>I am aware that there have been complaints about aspects of Caranua&rsquo;s services.  In that regard I understand that Caranua takes all complaints seriously and that it has a Customer Service Charter and Feedback and Complaints Policy which may be accessed on the organisation's website (<i>www.caranua.ie</i>).  The website allows applicants to provide feedback, submit comments and make formal complaints in cases where there is dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided.  Furthermore, Caranua comes within the scope of the Ombudsman Acts 1980 to 2012 and its administrative actions are subject to review by the Ombudsman.  I should also note that Caranua is amenable to scrutiny by the Oireachtas, including its committees.  Decisions of Caranua may be appealed to an independent Appeals Officer appointed in accordance with the provisions of the 2012 Act. </p><p>The 2012 Act sets out the classes of services in relation to which the Board of Caranua may determine particular services to be approved services.  Provision is also made for the prescribing of additional classes of services by way of ministerial order.  I am satisfied that this is an appropriate framework and is one which provides flexibility to enable Caranua meet the emerging needs of former residents.  In that regard I understand that earlier this year Caranua decided to widen the range of approved services it could support including the provision of a contribution towards funeral costs.  Accordingly no legislative changes are envisaged at this point in relation to this aspect of Caranua's work.</p><p>In fulfillment of a commitment given during the passage of the 2012 Act through the Houses of the Oireachtas, I have agreed that a review of the issue of eligibility will be carried out.  The terms of reference and arrangements for review are being finalised at present.  The review will have regard to the level of uptake of the funding available to Caranua and will also have regard to the views of all interested parties.  Any proposal that might emerge from the review process to widen eligibility would require legislation. </p></reply>

It will work towards improving accountability for educational outcomes across the system.  It will take particular account of the needs and requirements of learners with disabilities or with special educational needs</p><p>Under Goal 2 of the Action Plan, target policies and supports for learners with special education needs to support their participation and progression across the continuum of education, we aim to improve the participation, including participation in inclusive mainstream settings, and progress of children and young people with special educational needs across the whole education system and develop better whole-school approaches. </p><p>The following objectives and actions have been identified to support people with disabilities:</p><p>- Develop and pilot a new model for allocation of teaching resources for children with special educational needs.</p><p>- Consult with education partners on implementation of sections of the EPSEN Act and on the provision of services to children with Downs Syndrome.</p><p>- Undertake a comprehensive assessment of the S Scheme to identify the most appropriate form of support options to provide better outcomes for students with special educational needs.</p><p>- Work with relevant Government Departments and agencies to introduce a new in-school speech and language service creating stronger linkages between parents, teachers and Speech and Language Therapists.</p><p>- Establish an Inclusion Support Service under NCSE to assist Schools in the provision of education to children with special educational needs.</p><p>- Implement strands of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education, so that higher education becomes more representative of the population in general, by publishing the Review and implementing the recommendations of the Fund for Students with disabilities </p><p>- Increase the proportion of students with disabilities as a percentage of all entrants to higher education to 8% from the current rate of 6% by 2019.</p></reply>

Under this scheme, my Department provides funding of &euro;15 million annually to primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme.</p>  <p>  A recent survey from Barnados indicates that it would require an additional investment of around &euro;40 million per annum to provide all school children with free school books.  This should not be taken to mean that this organisation does not see the value of school book rental schemes.  It should be noted that the organisation's &euro;40 million estimate is in addition to the Department's existing annual investment under the school books grant scheme.</p>  <p>  All schools must be sensitive to the financial pressures on parents in making decisions, not just about books, but about any matter that has cost implications for parents. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Education outlines hundreds of actions to be implemented over the 3 year period 2016 to 2019.  Some of the actions as part of the plan are to strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents by:</p>  <p>- Restoring capitation funding over a three-year period as resources permit.</p>  <p>- Increasing the financial support for book rental schemes, in order to reduce or eliminate school book costs for parents.</p>  <p>- Issuing a new circular to school authorities and ETBs regarding school uniform policy and other costs and the need to put a greater emphasis on reducing the cost of school uniforms and other costs.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 represents the start of a major programme of reinvestment in education, and the first phase of implementation of the Action Plan for Education, aimed at becoming the best education system in Europe within a decade. </p>  <p>  It was not possible to provide additional funding in Budget 2017 in relation to this element of the Action Plan due to the many competing demands for the available funding.  However, this commitment remains a priority for me to address as soon as possible during the lifetime of the Action Plan.  It is important to note that the total allocation to this Department for additional policy measures, after demographics and Industrial Relations commitments, was &euro;130 million and out of which all our commitments in higher and further education and primary and secondary schools had to be funded.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic analyses at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>  The most recent demographic analyses showed that, while the school planning areas in South Kildare are experiencing some demographic growth, the level of growth and the rate of year-on-year increase is not to such an extent that would currently warrant the provision of additional new schools at this point.  With the addition of both planned and recently-delivered infrastructural provision in areas in South Kildare, the existing schools should between them be able to cater for the overall level of demographic demand for post-primary school places.  The areas are continuing to be kept under review by my Department to take account of updated child benefit and enrolment data and the impact of capacity increases in these and adjoining areas.</p>  <p>  The patronage assessment process to determine who will operate a new school is a separate process.  This process is run after it has been decided that a new school is required.  It is open to all patrons and prospective patrons to apply for patronage of a new school under this process.  Parental preferences, together with an analysis of the extent of existing diversity in an area, are central to this process and prospective patrons are required to provide evidence of demand for their particular school model.</p></reply>

The system uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and information from my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic analyses to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and at post-primary level.</p>  <p>  For school planning purposes, Citywest falls within the Tallaght school planning area.  A new 1,000 pupil post-primary school in the Kingswood area of Tallaght opened in September 2016 to serve the needs of the students in the school planning area, which includes the Citywest area.</p>  <p>  In addition, among the 13 new schools (4 primary and 9 post-primary) announced to open in 2017 and 2018 to cater for increased demographic needs, is a new post-primary school which will open in 2018 in the Firhouse/Oldbawn school planning area, which is adjacent to the Tallaght area.  When fully developed, this school will provide 1,000 pupil places.</p>  <p>  As with the other school planning areas nationwide, the demographic data for the Tallaght area is being kept under review by my Department to take account of updated enrolment data and capacity increases in this and adjoining school planning areas.</p></reply>

Section 31 is essentially a safeguarding mechanism that follows on from statutory consultation by planning authorities with the Minister in drawing up or amending their statutory development or local plans.</p>  <p>  It must also be noted that Ministerial directions have issued in relation to a broad range of planning issues, including excessive or inappropriate land use zoning objectives and failure to take account of flood risk assessment in preparing development plans and local area plans.</p>  <p>  With regard to directions that have issued in relation to wind energy policy content of development plans, such directions have been focused on ensuring broad alignment between settled Government policy and local development plans and where, without such directions, there would be marked inconsistencies between local authorities as regards the treatment of this specific form of development, which would also be unacceptable in relation to other categories of development.</p>  <p>  Mindful of the considerable focus on planning policy aspects of wind energy developments in relation to location, set-back, height and related aspects that underscore much of the development plan debates that have taken place across the country, my Department is continuing to advance work on a focused review of the statutory guidelines on wind energy development, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and in line with the relevant commitments under the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the updated Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.

From a planning legislation perspective, section 4 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides a general exemption for works carried out by local authorities except in certain circumstances where works require environmental impact assessment (in accordance with the EIA Directive) or appropriate assessment (in accordance with the Habitats Directive).</p>  <p>  While general debris and vegetation clearance activities would not normally come within the scope of such obligations, local authorities proposing to undertake more extensive works, such as drainage and channel modifications, need to be cognisant of the potential impact on habitats and the environment and the associated legislative requirements.</p>  <p>  More specifically, section 175 of the Planning Act provides that where works carried out by the local authorities exceed the thresholds set out in Schedule 5 of the Planning Regulations, an Environmental Impact Statement must be prepared and submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for approval.</p>  <p>  Similarly, section 177AE of the Planning Act provides that where local authority works require Appropriate Assessment the authority is required to make an application for consent to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  In addition, as outlined in section 20 of the recently published Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill 2016, it is proposed to introduce a new stand-alone EIA screening process in planning legislation - separate from the requirements in relation to the obtaining of planning permission - to essentially determine whether EIA is required in respect of proposed development, including flood related works.  Where the screening process determines that a proposal will have significant effects on the environment, then a full EIA and planning permission will be required in respect of the works.  However, if no significant environmental impacts are likely to occur from the proposed development or activity, then no EIA will be required; furthermore, planning permission will not be required if the proposed works are below the exempted development thresholds for such flood related works, as set in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (as amended).</p>  <p>  Works relating to the road network are a matter for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I have no role in that matter.</p></reply>

In accordance with section 37(2) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services, including accommodation, rests with individual housing authorities.</p><p>No guidelines have issued from my Department to local authorities in relation to the matter raised in the question nor is it intended to do so.  However, it is fully recognised that the period of time that families spend in emergency hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation should be minimised.  This is reflected in the commitment in <i>Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>that by mid-2017, hotels should only be used in limited circumstances for emergency accommodation for families; this will be achieved by meeting their housing needs through the enhanced Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme and general housing allocations, and by providing new supply to be delivered through an expanded Rapid Build Housing Programme and a Housing Agency initiative to acquire vacant houses.  My Department is working closely with local authorities and the Housing Agency towards the achievement of these actions and initiatives.</p></reply>

HAP is now available to all qualified households in 19 local authority areas, with over 14,500 households currently being supported by the scheme and 9,500 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to those households.  A breakdown of the number of households supported by HAP in each local authority area at the end of Quarter 3,2016 is available on my Department's website at the following link: <i></i>.</p><p>As HAP is deemed to be a social housing support under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, households in receipt of HAP are not included on the local authority waiting list for social housing support.  However, HAP recipients may access other forms of social housing supports by applying to go on the local authority transfer list.</p><p>On 16 December 2014, a statutory direction was issued to all authorities involved in the HAP statutory pilot, instructing them to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefitting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through a transfer option.  Local authorities were also directed that HAP recipients, who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.  The practical operation of transfer lists in the context of the Ministerial direction is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their scheme of letting priorities.  In general, housing authorities offer HAP recipients the opportunity to apply to go on the transfer list at the point when their HAP application is approved and the differential rent contribution is signed by the household.  The 2 week period referred to is not a statutory period.  I understand that it is a timeframe operated by local authorities for the purposes of receiving a reply to correspondence with HAP recipients.  Local authorities and my Department are working closely together in order to ensure the successful implementation of the scheme and the Ministerial Directive relating to the operation of transfer lists, and I am satisfied that all local authorities are informing HAP applicants of the opportunity to apply to go on to the transfer list , as a matter of course.  It is ultimately the choice of the HAP recipient to choose if they wish to be placed on a local authority's transfer list and I understand that the majority of HAP households do avail of this option.  As of the start of November 2016, over 190 households across the country have transferred from the HAP scheme to other forms of social housing support.</p><p>The Homelessness Pilot of the HAP scheme has been operational since February 2015 across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region, i.e. Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council, and is being implemented through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE).  The focus of this pilot scheme is to transition qualified households from emergency accommodation, including hotels, into private rented tenancies.  There are currently 637 households being supported by the Homeless HAP pilot scheme across Dublin.  At this point, the full HAP scheme is only available to all qualifying households in one of the four Dublin local authorities, South Dublin County Council.  The full roll-out of the scheme to the remaining Dublin local authorities is planned for Q1, 2017.</p><p><i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>commits to meeting the housing needs of 1,750 homeless households through the Homeless Pilot of the HAP scheme over 2016 and 2017, as part of the overall accelerated HAP target of supporting 27,000 new households over the same period.  As of 7 November, 586 tenancies had been set up under the pilot scheme this year, meeting the <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>target of 550 homeless households to be supported by the scheme in 2016.  My Department does not hold data on the number of persons that have been offered the homeless HAP scheme that have refused to participate in the scheme to date.  The performance of the Homeless HAP scheme continues to improve with a doubling in the number of new households being supported by the scheme each week since the review of HAP rent limits in July of this year.</p><p>While I am happy with the improved performance under the scheme, I have asked my Department to continue to monitor it closely and engage directly with the relevant local authorities to ensure its effectiveness and its attractiveness to homeless households.</p><p>The data sought in relation to numbers of HAP- supported households in full time employment, in part time employment, in training and that are unemployed broken down by local authority is not held by my Department.  My Department, local authorities and the HAP Shared Service Centre (SSC) - being provided by Limerick City and County Council - are working together to develop data collection and reporting mechanisms to provide robust indicators in relation to the activation objective of the HAP scheme.  The development of these indicators is being overseen by the HAP Oversight Group that is jointly chaired by the Secretaries General of my Department and the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of the scheme under review.  I am very satisfied with how the HAP scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>.</p></reply>

The assessment of households for social housing support is the responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, which set down a standard procedure for assessing applicants for social housing support.</p>  <p>  A household may apply for support to one housing authority only (the &ldquo;housing authority of application&rdquo;), which may be the authority for the area in which the household normally resides or with which it has a local connection, or the authority that agrees, at its discretion, to assess the household for support.  In determining whether a household has a local connection with its area, a housing authority must have regard to whether a household member: </p>  <p>- lived in the area for a continuous 5 year period at any time in the past, </p>  <p>- is employed in the area or within 15 km of the area, </p>  <p>- is in full-time education, or attending specialist medical care in the area, or </p>  <p>- has a relative (defined in the Regulations) living in the area for 2 years or longer.</p>  <p>  In 2013 my Department issued a clarification to all local authorities on the issue of the normal residence and local connection criteria, which advised that households were only required to meet either criterion, not both.  Thus, where a household resides in a local authority&rsquo;s area, there is no requirement to have a local connection in order to apply to that authority for support.</p>  <p>  The clarification provided that &ldquo;normally resides&rdquo; was generally intended to refer to the housing authority where the household is currently resident and the household was required to provide proof of this, such as a utility bill, proof of a social welfare payment, a lease etc.  In relation to a household living in emergency accommodation, the only proof of residence may be a social welfare payment and it was not the intention that such households would also have to demonstrate a local connection.</p>  <p>  As the 2011 Regulations do not provide for a housing authority to impose a minimum period of residence in the area prior to application for social housing support, authorities were advised that it was not intended that households were required to have resided in the functional area of the housing authority of application for a minimum length of time in order to be considered eligible for assessment.</p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the tenant to raise the finance to purchase the house.  A tenant may fund the purchase money for a house from a mortgage loan and/or their own resources which may include funds provided by family members.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, to be eligible for this Scheme, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum. In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant&rsquo;s income is of a long-term and sustainable nature.  This is necessary to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period.  This ensures compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p><p>In line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>and reaffirmed in <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>- Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, it is intended that a review of the Scheme will be undertaken in January 2017 following the first 12 months of operation and any changes to the terms and conditions of the scheme which are considered necessary based on the evidence gathered at that stage will be brought forward.</p></reply>

My Department's role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.</p><p>Local authorities adopted the fourth and current round of TAPs in April 2014, with the five-year rolling programmes running from 2014 to 2018.  These programmes provide a road map for local authority investment priorities over the period.  They also form the basis for the allocation of funding from my Department for traveller accommodation.</p><p>In 2015, Sligo County Council submitted two proposals for funding.  One of these was a preliminary proposal and further details and costings were requested from the Council which have not yet been received.  In relation to the second proposal, the Council was asked to submit a detailed appraisal that would address some concerns raised by my Department and no such appraisal has been received to date.</p><p>In 2016, the Council submitted three proposals for funding.  The Council has been notified that indicative funding in relation to two of these proposals in the total amount of &euro;192,292 has been approved. Indicative funding means that the Council will be eligible for a formal allocation and recoupment in 2017 should the proposals proceed. Further information has been requested of the Council in relation to the third proposal and a response is awaited from the Council in this regard.</p><p>Given the complexities and timelines associated with capital projects, the funding sought for individual projects can vary at different stages.  However, the actual capital allocations and recoupments to Sligo County Council in respect of Traveller-specific accommodation for the years 2011 to 2016 are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Allocation </th><th>Recouped </th></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>500,000 </td><td>624,885 </td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>18,090 </td><td>17,225 </td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>8,000 </td><td>9,700 </td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The provision of social housing is carried out by local authorities and Approved Housing bodies (AHBs) through a range of delivery methods, including construction, acquisition, leasing and other approaches, which allow local authorities, as housing authorities, to respond flexibly to meet local demand and operate within local property circumstances. The operation of the rent supplement scheme is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.  The Government&rsquo;s Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan For Housing and Homelessness published in July 2016 recognises the need to significantly increase the level and scale of supports available to those whose circumstances mean they need State help in meeting their housing needs. The Action Plan allows for a broad range of flexible delivery mechanisms including an accelerated and expanded social housing construction programme. The Action Plan sets an ambitious target to deliver 47,000 units of social housing in the period to 2021, while at the same time making the best use of the existing housing stock and laying the foundations for a more vibrant and responsive private rented sector. Of the 47,000 units-  </p><p>- 26,000 will be exclusively built as social housing;</p><p>- 11,000 will be acquired by Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies from the market or the Housing Agency; and</p><p>- 10,000 will be leased by Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies.</p><p>I have secured &euro;5.35 billion exchequer investment to deliver these 47,000 new social housing units over the period of the Action Plan.  This &euro;5.35 billion investment comprises some &euro;4.5 billion in capital funding and &euro;844 million in support of programmes funded from current expenditure, specifically the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).  This significant capital investment will assist local authorities and AHBs to continue their re-engagement in substantial social housing construction activity.</p><p>A number of financial and economic studies carried out support the rationale for the provision of social housing through mechanisms such as the leasing and renting of privately owned accommodation. In 2010, the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG) published a specific chapter (Chapter 23 of the C&amp;amp;AG's 2009 Annual Report) relating to the leasing of social housing. In addition, a financial appraisal of the long-term costs of leasing in comparison with other social housing delivery options, commissioned by my Department was carried out by the Housing Agency in 2011. Both the C&amp;amp;AG findings and the study commissioned by my Department broadly indicated that leasing represents good value for money in social housing provision when compared to direct market acquisition or construction of units. A copy of the Housing Agency report entitled Comparative Financial Appraisal of the Projected Long-Term Costs of Social Housing Delivery Mechanisms is available on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at: <i></i>.</p><p>The introduction of the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) was underpinned by an economic assessment which was submitted to Government in 2013 and informed the Government&rsquo;s decision to initiate the HAP scheme at that time.</p><p>I continue to keep all of the social housing delivery mechanisms under review to ensure that they remain relevant and are meeting the needs of citizens in a cost effective way.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.  The capital allocation in respect in respect of Traveller-specific accommodation for 2016 is &euro;5.5 million, of which almost &euro;1.73 million has been recouped to date<font color="#1F497D">.</font>Typically, the bulk of expenditure occurs in the last quarter of the year, having regard to lead in times for planning, design and construction of capital projects.  To ensure maximum expenditure and delivery of accommodation, local authorities submit quarterly profiles of expenditure to my Department.  These are monitored against actual expenditure and if a difficulty is identified in drawing down funding allocated for a particular scheme during the year, it is reallocated to another scheme.  Expenditure during 2016 is being closely monitored and my Department is currently contacting every relevant local authority in order to ensure that drawdown is maximised.</p><p>My Department also provides current funding for accommodation-related supports to operate in tandem with the capital programme. Current funding of &euro;4.3m is being provided in 2016. Over &euro;3.2m has been recouped to local authorities in 2016 to date, of which &euro;0.943m was self-funded by local authorities from surplus Local Property Tax receipts. A similar level of current funding will be provided in 2017.</p><p>Capital funding of &euro;9m is being provided for Traveller-specific accommodation in 2017, an increase of &euro;3.5m (64%) on the 2016 allocation.  This is the second consecutive year that the Traveller Accommodation capital budget has been increased. Included in this is provision to assist local authorities with the costs of capital works arising from the fire safety review of Traveller-specific accommodation.</p><p>As regards the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation and associated funding, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to establishing a special working group to audit the current delivery and implementation of local authorities&rsquo; Traveller Accommodation Plans and consult with stakeholders on key areas of concern.  This commitment has been underpinned in Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, which provides for the commissioning by the Housing Agency of an expert, independent review of Traveller accommodation expenditure and delivery of units, having regard to the targets contained in the local authority Traveller Accommodation Programmes.  The review has commenced and is due to be completed in quarter two of 2017. The review will provide factual information and a key platform for the special working group to progress its work effectively.  The working group will be established as soon as possible after completion of the review.</p></reply>

They were developed as part of a coherent framework in conjunction with the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy and Congregated Settings Report.  De-congregation is a policy matter for the Department of Health who, in conjunction with the Health Service Executive (HSE), decide which institutions close and which clients are appropriate to community living with required supports.  The ongoing health, home care and other supports for individuals, under the remit of the HSE, are essential components that facilitate this objective.  The provision of appropriate housing is another component of the wider strategy, and this element is supported by my Department in accordance with the NHSPWD.</p>  <p>  Since 2013, &euro;1 million has been provided by my Department to support the on-going transition of people with disabilities from congregated settings and I have secured equivalent funding for 2017.  In addition, to help accelerate progress, my Department has provided ring-fenced funding of &euro;10 million in 2016 under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), specifically for the provision of housing for people with disabilities who are moving out of congregated settings into community based living arrangements. CAS funding will also be available to provide housing for people with disabilities in the community more generally that is not specifically targeted at deinstitutionalisation.  The CAS provides funding of up to 100% to Approved Housing Bodies for the provision of independent living accommodation to meet the needs of people requiring specific categories of needs, including those with disabilities.  Further capital will be available in 2017 for housing provision for people with disabilities.  This is additional to capital funding which is being provided separately by the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

The suitability of employment is a key factor in ensuring that jobs are sustainable.

As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid under that scheme.  There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory.  These include that the person must be aged 66 or over, and that they have at least 520 paid contributions, i.e., a minimum of 10 years of paid contributions.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age).</p><p>Social insurance contributions (Class S PRSI) were introduced for self-employed people on 6 April 1988.  These contributions provide<font color="#004080"> </font>cover for self-employed people for long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widows/widowers pension (contributory).  In addition to the qualifying conditions above, a person must have paid self-employment contributions in respect of at least one contribution year prior to reaching age 66,<font color="#004080"> </font>and all self-employment contributions payable must have beenpaid in full.</p><p>There is also a State pension (contributory) half-rate pension for self-employed people.  The legislation providing for this partial pension came into effect from 9 April 1999 to provide a basic payment for groups who would not otherwise qualify for a contributory social welfare pension, and who did not satisfy the means test for the State pension (non-contributory).  In this case, the measure was designed to benefit self-employed people who were already over 56 years of age when compulsory self-employed social insurance was introduced in 1988, who had not paid other contributions (such as voluntary contributions, or other contributions while in employment), and who could not therefore satisfy the condition of having entered insurance 10 years before pension age.  The pension requires a minimum of 5 years contributions and is payable at 50% of the standard rate.  The pension was seen as a reasonable response to the position of the self-employed who were in their late 50s when Class S contributions were introduced, and I believe most would agree that it represents good value for the contributions made  <font color="#0000FF">.  </font></p><p>It is worth noting that the most recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund found that the self-employed achieve very good value for money from the fund.</p><p>Where a person<font color="#0000FF"> </font>is unable to meet the qualifying conditions for a State pension (contributory), or is only eligible for a reduced rate of contributory pension, they may alternatively apply for State pension (non-contributory) amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate which is subject to a means-test. </p><p>It is the case, therefore, that a person in receipt of this pension, in addition to having made very little contribution to the Social Insurance Fund (which funds contributory pensions), would have significant other means, as otherwise they would be expected to receive the State pension (non-contributory), at up to 95% the rate of the full contributory pension rate.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The person did not indicate in his application form that he had been self- employed, nor did his social insurance record contain any self-employment contributions.  Based on the person&rsquo;s record as it stood, he satisfied the state pension (contributory) eligibility conditions and was awarded a pension, together with an increase for qualified adult, with effect from 28 December 2009.</p>  <p>  In January 2010, it was noted from the Department&rsquo;s self-employment system that the person concerned had been assessed by Revenue as having a self-employment tax liability, with payments outstanding for the years 2003-2005, inclusive.  As the discharge of all assessed self-employment liabilities is a key eligibility condition for state pension (contributory), following a period of monitoring to check if the liability was paid, and noting that it had not been, a Deciding Officer suspended the payment of the person&rsquo;s state pension under the relevant social welfare legislation, with effect from 27 May 2011.  The person was notified of the impending pension suspension in a letter issued on 28 April 2011 and advised to contact the Department in due course, when the liability had been fully paid.</p>  <p>  Over the following years, the Department contacted Revenue periodically to check if the person had paid the outstanding liability, but was advised each time that it remained outstanding.  In November 2016, Revenue confirmed that the liability had been paid. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the pension has been reinstated with effect from the date of payment suspension, and the due arrears will issue shortly.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.  </p><p>The fuel allowance is a means tested payment, targeted at those who are more vulnerable to energy poverty, including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.  </p><p>VTOS is operated through local education and training boards who are funded<font color="#2F2F2F"> by the Department of Education and Science, and not by my Department, and so it</font>is not a qualifying payment for fuel allowance or the Christmas bonus<font color="#2F2F2F">.

The use of a means test is to ensure that scarce resources are directed to those in greatest need.  </p>  <p>  Payments from the United Kingdom (UK) are assessed as income under current legislation.  In assessing means derived from payments received from non-European Monetary Union (EMU) States, the Department uses the conversion mechanism provided for under Article 107 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 574/72 on Social Security for Migrant Workers.  The exchange rates for converting sterling and other non EMU currencies are published quarterly in the Official Journal of the European Union.  The Department obtains this rate at the beginning of each quarter and uses it in all conversions during the course of that quarter irrespective of whether the value of the currency concerned rises or falls in that period.  The conversion rates published in 2016, which are reflective of the changes in the value of sterling, are  Q1: 1.36450;   Q2: 1.32523;   Q3: 1.26216;   Q4: 1.18898.</p>  <p>  In the case of a new claim, when calculating the value of a sterling payment, the conversion rate used is that applicable to the quarter in which the effective date of the claim falls.  </p>  <p>  It is open to any person in receipt of a social assistance payment to request that his/her entitlement be reviewed if they wish.  It is important to note, however, that any such review will involve a full reassessment of all of the customer&rsquo;s means to ensure that the person continues to receive the correct payment in line with their overall entitlement and such reviews cannot of their nature just focus on the income derived from the UK.  When conducting such a review, the conversion rate used is that applicable to the date of last increase in the sterling payment of the UK State Pension or the rate applicable in a subsequent quarter if that rate has been published by the date of the decision and is more favourable to the customer. </p>  <p>  Following the outcome of the UK referendum, negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU will take time.  In the interim, it is important to stress that all payments made by the Department of Social Protection, including those to recipients who are resident in Britain and Northern Ireland, and payments from the UK to residents in Ireland, will continue to be paid.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Social welfare legislation provides that the yearly value of property (including capital) owned but not personally used or enjoyed is assessable for means testing purposes.  Such property includes all monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares as well as houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use.  However, it does not include property such as the family home a person is personally using or enjoying i.e. residing in or, for example, a premises used by the claimant in carrying out a business. </p>  <p>  In order for property to be assessable for means purposes, it must be owned by a claimant (or his or his spouse/partner, where applicable).  In this regard, a property which is under probate administration is not assessable for means testing purposes.  A claimant should advise the Department of any increase in their means as soon as probate is granted. </p>  <p>  However, where a person is in beneficial occupation of a property and is carrying out a business thereon e.g. farming, the income from such a business may be assessable despite the fact that probate has not as yet been granted.  Claimants should notify the Department where this is the case.</p></reply>

The loans under the scheme range from &euro;100 to a maximum of &euro;2,000, and have a maximum interest rate of 12% per annum.  Over 1,200 loans were drawn down under the Scheme during the pilot with an overall value of over &euro;720,000.  The average individual loan value drawn down was &euro;500.  The focus of the pilot scheme was social welfare recipients who availed of the loans from their Credit Union and were facilitated, with their consent, in the repayment of such loans through the Household Budgeting facility, operated by An Post.  The deductions from their weekly social welfare payments were then transmitted on to the relevant Credit Union. </p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>provides for the rollout and extension of the Personal Microcredit Scheme.  Following an evaluation of the pilot, the Implementation Group, which is chaired by my Department and comprises all relevant stakeholders, is working towards this aim.  </p><p>Incremental progress is being made towards extending the geographical coverage of the Personal Micro Credit Scheme through efforts to recruit Credit Unions to participate in the scheme.  To help with this I have written to all Credit Union Chairpersons and Managers to encourage their participation.  This is being followed up with engagement with the Credit Union representative bodies and individual credit unions.</p><p>Almost 80 Credit Unions are currently signed up to participate in the scheme, which will result in the availability of the <i>It Makes Sense </i>loan in almost 150 local Credit Union offices.  While coverage is increasing, planned Credit Union mergers and internal resource constraints are impacting on the decision or timing of some Credit Unions joining the scheme.</p><p>While the pilot scheme was targeted towards social welfare customers with access to the Household Budgeting facility, the scheme has been extended to social welfare recipients who receive their payment electronically into accounts in financial institutions, provided the loan repayments are made by direct debit or standing order to the credit union.  </p><p>A number of other enhancements to the scheme are under consideration, including extension of the Household Budgeting facility to borrowers transitioning to small loans under the credit unions&rsquo; normal lending policies.  The Implementation Group is working through these enhancements and they will be incorporated into the scheme when finalised and the appropriate structures are in place.  </p><p>In regard to advertising, the Implementation Group has decided that the most appropriate approach is to promote the availability of the <i>It Makes Sense</i>loan at a local level, in the areas where Credit Unions are participating in the scheme.  The Irish League of Credit Unions, which has representation on the Implementation Group, is actively supporting local Credit Unions in marketing the scheme through the provision of posters, leaflets and raising awareness in local media.  The availability of the scheme is also promoted at a local level by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and St. Vincent de Paul which also have representation on the Implementation Group. </p><p>The list of participating Credit Unions is updated regularly on the website for the <i>It Makes Sense</i>loan scheme at www.itmakessenseloan.ie/participating-credit-unions and on the <i>It Makes Sense</i>Facebook page.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This naturally has implications for how we approach trade, cooperation, and the movement of persons, both north-south and east-west. </p>  <p>  Regarding trade, we are all acutely conscious of the importance of the UK market to Irish exporters &ndash; let me assure you that every effort is being made to protect existing trade and to continue to grow it.  Furthermore, in my role as Minister for Trade, I am also intensifying our efforts on other markets, near and far.  I believe we have the capacity for much greater market penetration in other EU member states.  But we are also looking beyond Europe&rsquo;s borders.  Indeed, at a meeting of the Export Trade Council on 18 October there was a strong focus on markets in Asia in particular.  In September I attended the UN General Assembly where I had a series of bilateral meetings with countries from the Americas, Asia and the Antipodes.  I gave the strong message that Ireland will remain at the heart of Europe; we will continue to be an English speaking gateway to a market of 500 million people; and we will continue to offer a business friendly environment and a talented and adaptable workforce.   </p>  <p>  The Government continues to work closely and cooperatively with the Northern Ireland Executive, and at the last North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in July, it was agreed that the Irish Government and the Northern Irish Executive would work together to ensure that the Peace Process is protected. It was also agreed that how we cooperate north-south has to be fully recognised in any new arrangements.  An agreed work programme of ten clear actions was agreed, and these issues will be discussed again at the next NSMC on 18 November.  Regarding east-west relations, contacts between the Irish and British governments are ongoing at a political and official level, and the next British Irish Council summit will take place in Cardiff later this month.</p>  <p>  As part of our commitment to working cooperatively and collaboratively, the Government also held the inaugural All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit on 2 November in order to hear from people from all parts of the Island, with representatives from a broad range of civil society groups, trade unions, business groups, non-governmental organisations and representatives from political parties. Both north-south and east-west issues were discussed in detail, and the Government plans to deepen the analysis and build on the insights generated by this dialogue. </p>  <p>  Regarding the movement of people, the Irish Government has been clear throughout all our discussions with our UK and EU counterparts that we are committed to maintaining the open and effectively invisible border and protecting the Common Travel Area (CTA).  The CTA is an important feature of the close relationship between Ireland and the UK with long-established benefits for trade and tourism between our two countries, both north-south and east-west.  The CTA allows for free movement between Ireland and the UK, but it also facilitates voting rights and access to social welfare for our respective citizens.</p></reply>

We attach great importance to combating all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.</p><p>In cooperation with our EU partners, we consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council.</p><p>I have repeatedly condemned the horrific crimes by Daesh against religious and ethnic minorities in Syria and Iraq.  Daesh has boasted of its use of murder, torture, mass sexual violence and forced religious conversion in areas under its control and has committed grave crimes against members of all religious denominations in Syria and Iraq.  </p><p>Removing the threat to Christian communities and other religious minorities requires effective action at EU and UN levels to prevent and counter international terrorism, especially the actions of Daesh, in line with international law and human rights.</p><p>International terrorism has featured high on the EU agenda in the past 18 months.  In discussing international terrorism, the Council has given particular priority to countering the actions of Daesh.  Comprehensive conclusions on a &lsquo;<i>Regional Strategy for Syria and Iraq as well as the Daesh threat</i>&rsquo; were adopted by the Council in May 2016.  As has been underlined previously by the Council, there will be no resolution of the conflict in Syria in the absence a political solution. </p><p>The EU&rsquo;s approach is guided by and consistent with the approach taken by the UN to countering Daesh.  Last January, the UN Secretary General issued a report on the threat posed by Daesh, and the measures being taken against them, such as countering their financing, preventing and disrupting the travel of foreign terrorist fighters, countering recruitment and preventing violent extremism.</p></reply>

I condemn unreservedly any use of force against peaceful protestors.  Ireland does not have diplomatic representation in Honduras, but my officials have raised the incident referred to by the Deputy with the European External Action Service and requested an update from the EU Delegation in Tegucigalpa.  We will continue to monitor the situation closely. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are in regular contact with the organisation mentioned by the Deputy, as well as other organisations active in the Central American region, in order to listen to their concerns regarding the context they face on the ground.  We value and appreciate that engagement.    </p>  <p>  On 3 March 2016, Ms. Berta C&aacute;ceres, a leading human rights defender and environmentalist, was killed in Honduras.  Her colleague, Mr. Nelson Garc&iacute;a, was killed just days afterwards.  Ireland raised those cases and the difficulties facing human rights defenders in Honduras in public statements at the UN Human Rights Council and at the UN Commission on the Status of Women.  Senior officials also discussed the situation faced by human rights defenders in Central America with the Executive Director of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights during his visit to Dublin earlier this year. </p>  <p>  My officials raised further instances of threats against human rights defenders at a discussion on Honduras at the EU Working Group on Latin America and the Caribbean in May 2016. </p>  <p>  Honduras was last reviewed under the UN Human Rights Council&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review mechanism in May 2015.  Ireland intervened to express its concern at the climate of violence and insecurity in which human rights defenders operate in Honduras, and recommended that adequate financial and human resources were allocated to ensure the implementation of legislation protecting human rights defenders and journalists. </p>  <p>  In keeping with Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, we will continue to raise our concerns regarding threats against human rights defenders in discussions on Honduras at EU and international level. </p></reply>

We have conveyed these concerns to the Israeli authorities, and worked to focus EU attention on them.  My Department cannot, however, attempt to track and take action on every report of decisions involved in this process. </p>  <p>  Our concerns over these policies are most acute in relation to the West Bank, where they are making impossible the achievement of a peace agreement and the establishment of a Palestinian state.  By contrast, it is generally acknowledged that any comprehensive peace between Israel and the Arab states will involve the return of the Golan area to Syria.   </p>  <p>  My primary focus in relation to Syria at present is on the appalling violence, destruction and slaughter afflicting the Syrian people across much of the rest of the country.  </p></reply>

The cost of these changes is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018.  This substantial PSPR amelioration, delivered via a three-stage restoration schedule under FEMPI 2015, provides PSPR-affected pensioners with a significant measure of reversal of the originally imposed reductions. </p>  <p>  Pensions paid to survivors of deceased public servants are based on the pre-PSPR value of the corresponding member pension, with any PSPR then applied.  Survivor's are in most cases equal to half the corresponding member pension.  Where a higher ratio than half applies, as is the case for most 1995-2012-hired members of the mainstream civil and public service pension schemes, the cash value of the corresponding member pension tends to be low because of shorter service and the Contributory State Pension offset used in the integrated occupational pension calculation.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the survivor's pension itself, PSPR does not apply in all cases of pre-PSPR value up to &euro;18,700 at present, &euro;26,000 from 1 January 2017 and &euro;34,132 from 1 January 2018.  These thresholds are considerably higher in cases where the member pension award date is after 29 February 2012. </p></reply>

I can confirm that while the nature and length of the Statement of Strategy is such that it is not possible to reflect each of these submissions in detail, it does reflect, at a high-level, the Public Sector Duty obligation imposed by Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014 to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of the Department's employees and everyone affected by its functions and services.  </p></reply>

SIPOC has established a register for recording lobbying activity which may be viewed at www.lobbying.ie. SIPOC is an independent statutory body and as such is not accountable to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or to the Government in the performance of its functions. </p>  <p>  The first three reporting deadlines for those who have lobbied designated public officials have now passed.  Those who undertook any lobbying since 1 September 2015 were required to register and submit returns of their lobbying activity on the online Register.  I am very pleased with the level of compliance achieved in these initial return periods.  There are currently more than 1,490 organisations and individuals who have registered, and almost 7,500 returns have been submitted to the Register.  </p>  <p>  The information available on the Register provides the Irish public with unprecedented insight into the role that lobbying plays in contributing to policy and funding discussions and decisions.  Communication between the political systems, public service and all sectors of society is, and will continue to be, supported and strengthened by this Register leading to better informed policy and decision making. The overall level of compliance is a very positive indicator that there is an acceptance of the need for openness and transparency in lobbying.</p>  <p>  It is clear that the work undertaken by my Department and the SIPOC in building awareness and understanding of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 has been effective and I am confident that this momentum will be maintained as this work continues.  </p>  <p>  Currently, part 4 of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015, which relates to enforcement provisions, has not been commenced.  This was a deliberate decision made to allay any concerns that stakeholders may have had about inadvertent non-compliance with the provisions of the Act and to allow those lobbying a period of time to become familiar with their legal obligations and the registration system.  Given the success of the system, and the high levels of compliance, I have decided to commence these provisions from 1 January 2017.  The SIPOC is preparing for the commencement of these enforcement provisions and is actively engaging with Registrants to ensure that they are aware of the requirement to submit returns (including nil returns) on time and to make them aware that enforcement provisions will commence with effect from 1 January 2017.</p>  <p>  The Commission's focus in the first year of the Act's commencement has been on building understanding and encouraging compliance with the Act. To that end, a significant amount of outreach and education initiatives throughout the past year has served to create awareness and understanding of the Act and its obligations among those who may be lobbying. The website has been populated with helpful information for both potential registrants and those whom they lobby featuring tailored guidelines for lobbyists and designated public officials, instructional videos, sample returns and frequently asked questions. This emphasis on education and outreach has proven effective. The SIPOC continues to regularly engage with stakeholders through presentations, publications and events, as well as through its website. It also conducts regular information sessions for any interested member of the public, who may register their interest on lobbying.ie. </p>  <p>  Finally, my Department is currently undertaking the first review of the operation of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 as required under section 2 of the Act.  A public consultation process has already taken place and submissions received are now being examined.  The Report on this review will cover the findings, conclusions drawn from these findings and any recommendations for amendments to the legislation consequent of these findings.  Subsequent reviews will be required every 3 years.  </p></reply>

Under the scheme, heritage items that are considered outstanding examples of their type and that are pre-eminent in their class, whose export from the State would constitute a diminution of the accumulated cultural heritage of Ireland, or whose import into the State would constitute a significant enhancement of the accumulated cultural heritage of Ireland, and which are considered suitable additions to the accumulated heritage of the State, may be donated to an approved body and 80% of the market value of the item(s) is then offset against the current tax liability of the donor.  The approved bodies are as follows: National Archives, National Gallery of Ireland, National Library of Ireland, National Museum of Ireland, Irish Museum of Modern Art and Crawford Art Gallery Cork. </p>  <p>  The legislation provides that approved body can also mean "in relation to the offer of a gift of a particular item or collection of items", any other such body (being a body owned, or funded wholly or mainly, by the State or by any public or local authority) as may be approved, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The local authority referred to by the Deputy has been approved as an authorised body as required under Section 1003 in relation to the particular donation in this case.   </p>  <p>  The Section 1003 Selection Committee formally approved the proposed donation and the Revenue Commissioners were asked to place a formal valuation on it in accordance with the provisions of subsection(3) of Section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The donation has been formally valued on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners and, while my Department is aware of the valuation, it is not in a position to confirm it until the donation process has been completed.  It should be noted that the donation process is not yet complete.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the National Collections, amongst others, have benefited greatly from the operation of this scheme since its inception in 1995 as it has allowed for donations of items of significant heritage and cultural importance which might otherwise have left the country.  </p></reply>

Under the terms of the Directive, all Member States of the EU are bound to take measures to protect all wild birds and their habitats. Under Article 9(a), Member States may derogate in the interests of: public health and safety; air safety; to prevent serious damage to crops, livestock, forests, fisheries and water; and for the protection of flora and fauna.</p>  <p>  These derogations are achieved by way of declarations, which are made on an annual basis, under the European Communities (Wildlife Act, 1976) (Amendment) Regulations 1986, as amended, which allow the capturing and killing of some listed bird species in certain situations. There are no specified formats for, nor specified sources from which, relevant information which may be considered in this regard.  The declarations are made under the legislation by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and there is no voting process involved.</p>  <p>  The herring gull, the greater black-backed gull, the lesser-black-backed gull, the starling and the sparrow, while listed in the European Communities (Wildlife Act, 1976) (Amendment) Regulations 1986, are not currently included in the derogations.  A review of the derogations is scheduled for 2018, as advised to the EU Commission, and this will take account of all relevant factors, including perceived threats, distribution and population data available on the bird species in the derogations. The review will include a public/stakeholder consultation element. In the meantime, species can be added to or dropped from the derogations list, depending on new information available at the time of making annual derogations.</p></reply>

The allocation for mental health in 2017 will total around &euro;851 million, thereby giving an increase of &euro;24.7 million, or approximately 3%, over 2016.</p><p>In line with the recommendations of <i>A Vision for Change</i>, the HSE continues to prioritise the mental health needs of those under age 18 by developing services in line with annual HSE National Service Plans.  Child and Adolescent Mental Health services fall within the secondary and tertiary levels of specialist care.  A young person, therefore, must have a moderate to severe mental illness in order to access such specialist services, based on professional assessed need.  The publication of a new Standard Operating Procedures in 2015 has provided greater clarity and consistency on how specialist  mental health service for children are delivered nationally.  It is important to note that, despite increasing demands overall on the Child and Adolescent Mental Health system, individual cases assessed as urgent receive priority.</p><p>The HSE is, for example, improving collaboration between Mental Health and Primary Care in the key areas of Preventative, Early Intervention and Counselling services for young people. In the vast majority of cases, young people will be assessed and treated at Primary Care level, in Social Care or Disability services, without needing specialist clinical input.  The latter is only one element of an overall care approach provided to young people to promote positive mental health and Recovery, as appropriate.  In the context of expanding services, the HSE is pursuing various initiatives to address widely recognised difficulties in the recruitment and retention of healthcare staff, including child psychologists.</p><p>While there were significant reductions in the length of waiting times for HSE Primary Care Psychology services in 2015, there was also an increased demand for treatment.  To address this, significant funding in 2017 will resource improved recruitment of additional psychologists, and also fund rapid access to better evidence-based stepped care interventions.  The provision of improved integrated services should ensure that Child  and Adolescent Mental Health Services are able to operate at the specialist mental health service level intended.</p><p>The Deputy may rest assured that the Department of Health, in conjunction with the HSE, will continue to closely monitor planned service improvements for this key care area.</p></reply>

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and debilitating.  Many infected people have no symptoms at all.  The commonest noticeable evidence of infection is a rash called erythema migrans that is seen in about 80-90% of patients.  This red, raised skin rash (often called a bulls-eye rash) develops between 3 days and a month after a tick bite and spreads outwards from the initial bite site.  People can also complain of 'flu-like symptoms such as headache, sore throat, neck stiffness, fever, muscle aches and general fatigue.  Occasionally, there may be more serious symptoms involving the nervous system, joints, the heart or other tissues.  Lyme Disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe. </p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis is a notifiable infectious disease, the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form, Lyme neuroborreliosis.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collects and collates surveillance data on the condition.  The Weekly Infectious Disease Report, published by the HPSC on 26 October 2016, indicated that for week 42-2016 (16/10/16-22/10/16) there have been 16 cases notified so far in 2016 - an increase of 5 on the same period last year.  However, the diverse and unspecific nature of the symptoms means that a number of the less serious cases may not be diagnosed, leading to an underreporting of cases.  Recent estimates suggest that there may be up to 50-100 cases in Ireland per year.</p>  <p>  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered. In Ireland, treatment by most clinicians is based on that laid out in evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and babesiosis published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2006.  This pharmacological regime can be summarised thus:</p>  <p>  - Doxycycline, amoxicillin or cefuroxime for the treatment of adults with early localised or early disseminated Lyme disease associated with erythema migrans, in the absence of specific neurologic manifestations (ceftriaxone in early Lyme disease for adults with acute neurologic disease manifested by meningitis or radiculopathy);</p>  <p>  - Doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime for adults with Lyme arthritis but without clinical evidence of neurologic disease;</p>  <p>  - For late neurological disease in adults - intravenous ceftriaxone, cefotaxime or Penicillin G.</p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency and an Environmental Health Officer.  Representation has also been sought from a Lyme Disease advocacy group.</p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference of the Sub-Committee are:</p>  <p>  - To raise awareness in Ireland of Lyme Borreliosis amongst clinicians and the general public;</p>  <p>  - To identify and highlight best international practice in raising awareness about Lyme Borreliosis for the general public;</p>  <p>  - To develop policies of primary prevention of Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland based on best international practice;</p>  <p>  - To explore ways in which to improve surveillance of neuroborreliosis in Ireland;</p>  <p>  - To develop strategies to raise awareness among the general public particularly in areas of higher tick populations;</p>  <p>  - To produce a Final Report covering all the above areas.</p>  <p>  The initial work of the Lyme Borreliosis Sub-committee involves a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners, the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland for general practitioners, and ongoing work in drawing together the Final Report of the Sub-committee.  The Sub-Committee  is expected to report in 2017.</p></reply>

This is based on an assessment of the level of parking demand, developed in consultation with the medical planning team.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB), the statutory body responsible for planning, designing, building and equipping the new children's hospital has confirmed, that this level of parking provision will facilitate 100% car parking provision for inpatient, daycase and emergency attendances, and 65% car parking provision for outpatient attendances.  The car parking stock and appointment schedules will be actively managed to ensure that all patients wishing to avail of parking will be facilitated.  In addition, a condition of the planning permission granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la is that a minimum of 20 spaces be marked and designated as &ldquo;parent and child&rdquo; spaces and reserved for parents of children with specific needs (equipment etc.). </p>  <p>  In regard to parking costs, these will be considered in due course having regard to the needs of patients and families, including families of long-stay patients.</p></reply>

The vaccine has not been available in Ireland since the end of April 2015.  The manufacturer has had difficulties in the production of the BCG vaccine.  The manufacturer has informed the HSE there will be no supply of BCG until 2017.  Consequently, BCG vaccination clinics in HSE Clinics and Maternity hospitals have been postponed until new stock arrives.</p>  <p>  There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland and to other countries within the EU.  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG vaccine to ascertain when the vaccine might be available.  The HSE has also asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which licenses and regulates all human medicines in Ireland, to source an alternate supplier of the BCG vaccine.  Efforts have been made to find a company who can provide the vaccine for use in Ireland which satisfies all the HPRA requirements on safety and efficacy.  To date no suitable alternative BCG product has been found.  Therefore the HSE has been unable to procure the BCG vaccine from any other source and still awaits the product from the HPRA licensed supplier of the vaccine. </p>  <p>  The supplier has indicated that supplies of the vaccine are not expected to be delivered into Ireland until early 2017.  When there is confirmation of the date of new supply a decision will be made, guided by the recommendations of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, on who should be prioritised to receive the vaccine.  Arrangements will then be made to administer the vaccine,  including to those prioritised in Cavan and Monaghan.</p>  <p>  In Ireland the number of cases of tuberculosis (TB) has been falling.  TB is a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2016 (S.I. No. 276 of 2016).  In 2015, 318 cases of TB were notified to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, giving a national TB notification rate of 6.9 per 100,000, the lowest rate reported since surveillance commenced.  According to the World Health Organisation, the definition of a low incidence TB country is one with a national TB notification rate of less than 10 cases per 100,000, Ireland is in this category.  The risk to babies remains unchanged, even allowing for delay in getting BCG vaccine in Ireland. </p></reply>

In addition, one of the means to help improve health outcomes in this area is through the expansion of the National First Response Network.  Community first responder groups comprise this national network.  These are people from local communities who are trained in basic life support and the use of defibrillators that attend a potentially life threatening emergency in their area.  They are then able to provide an early intervention in situations such as heart attack or cardiac arrest by providing, among other things, resuscitation and defibrillation.</p>  <p>  Cardiac First Responders (CFR) Ireland, launched in 2015, is the national umbrella organisation for Community First Responders Groups.  CFR Ireland works with the National Ambulance Service, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council and the Centre for Emergency Medical Science UCD.  There are currently 141 Community First Responder groups tasked by the National Ambulance Service.  If an emergency 999/112 call for cardiac arrest, choking, chest pain or breathing difficulties is made to the National Ambulance Service in an area where a CFR group is established, the on-duty CFR member gets a text from the National Ambulance Service at the same time that an ambulance is despatched with location and call details.  The First Responder then goes straight to the scene and administers initial care (defibrillation if required) until the National Ambulance Service Emergency resources arrive.</p></reply>

The Nursing Homes Support Scheme provides financial support for residents at the facility who are participants in the Scheme.  The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme requires each private and voluntary nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme.  The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State.</p><p>In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:</p><p>- Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;</p><p>- Price(s) previously charged;</p><p>- Local market price; and</p><p>- Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p><p>The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis.  The Department of Health has no role in such individual negotiations.</p><p>The HSE also provides funding to Cobh Community Hospital under Section 39 of the Health Act.

The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis. The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State. In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:</p><p>- Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;</p><p>- Price(s) previously charged;</p><p>- Local market price; and</p><p>- Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p><p>The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, which was published in July 2015, committed to a review of pricing mechanisms by the NTPF, with a view to:</p><p>-Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p><p>- Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p><p>- Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p><p>The issue of an appeals process will also be considered in this context.</p><p>Work has been underway on this Review for a number of months now and it is expected to be completed in the coming months.</p><p>The HSE has recently published the cost of care for all public nursing homes.  There are a number of reasons why the costs of public facilities are generally higher than those in the private sector, including a higher nurse staffing ratio and the impact of public service rates of pay and conditions of employment.</p><p>The geographical spread of residential placements is also a factor.  In some rural areas long stay beds are provided for geographical reasons in smaller centres which would not be profitable for a private provider to supply, e.g. Achill Island; Donegal.</p><p>With that said, it is important that public facilities operate as efficiently and economically as possible and deliver the best possible value for money.  Towards that end the HSE is already engaged in a comprehensive exercise to review and streamline the operation and cost structures of public facilities. Differences in the comparative cost of public and private long-term residential care will be the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review to be undertaken by the Department of Health in 2017 to assess reasons for and components of current cost differentials.</p></reply>

Prior to deciding whether to reimburse a medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available. </p>  <p>  The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) of pharmaceutical products for the HSE, and can make recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process. </p>  <p>  The NCPE is currently conducting an assessment of Respreeza as maintenance treatment of emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency. Once this assessment is completed, a summary report will be published on the NCPE website. The HSE will then consider the NCPE assessment as part of its decision-making process when considering the drug for reimbursement. </p>  <p>  As the NCPE's assessment of Respreeza is ongoing, it is not possible to provide further details at this time.</p>  <p>  I understand that for patients currently accessing Respreeza on a compassionate use basis, the company CSL Behring, will continue to provide and administer the drug until the end of the year. However the operation of compassionate access schemes are at the discretion of manufacturers. I have previously asked manufacturers to show compassion to reopen or maintain compassionate access schemes to patients during the assessment process by the HSE.</p></reply>

The Agreement involves a tightening and earlier activation of the National Escalation Policy and prioritising staffing of emergency departments.  The proposals involve the designation of all Emergency Departments as distinct workplaces under the Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. Enhanced health and safety and risk management and mitigation measures are being implemented.</p>  <p>  The Escalation Framework was issued to the acute hospitals for immediate adoption in December 2015. The intent is that both capacity and patient throughput are appropriately managed during periods of excess demand, in order to maintain a safe and controlled environment for patients. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Winter Initiative has provided &euro;40 million of additional funding to assist with surges in demand for unscheduled care during Winter 2015-16.  The Initiative aims to strike a balance between hospital avoidance measures, supporting patient flow through acute hospitals and increasing the availability of social care services. </p>  <p>  In terms of additional measures under the Winter Initiative targeted to specific hospitals, Tallaght Hospital has been allocated 4 extra Home Care Packages per week until the end of the year and 2 additional Transitional Care Beds per week until the end of February 2017. Funding has also been made available to allow patients on the orthopaedic and scoliosis waiting lists at Tallaght and other hospitals avail of treatment at Cappagh Hospital and other facilities. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that there is a very strong focus on reducing Emergency Department overcrowding in all my interactions with the HSE, hospitals and other interested parties.</p></reply>

Indeed, 2016 has been a landmark year for maternity services with the publication of the country's first National Maternity Strategy <i>- Creating A Better Future Together 2016 - 2026</i>. The publication of the Strategy demonstrates a new and enhanced focus on maternity care at both policy and service delivery level, and provides a roadmap for how we can improve maternity and neonatal care in the years ahead.</p><p>The Deputy will also be interested to learn that HIQA will publish new<i>National Standards for Safer Better Maternity Services</i>in the coming weeks.  The Standards will provide a framework for maternity service providers to ensure that they are meeting the needs of women, their babies and their partners, and that a consistent service is delivered across the country. I believe that the National Maternity Strategy and the National Maternity Standards represent the necessary building blocks to provide a consistently safe and high quality maternity service. </p><p>I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly in relation to your query regarding the resignation of senior midwifery staff, as this is an operational matter.</p></reply>

The NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health. The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. </p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers. Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests. NIAC recommended that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.  </p>  <p>  The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Gardasil on 20 September 2006.  By January 2016, over 200 million doses of Gardasil had been distributed worldwide. In Ireland over 580,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and over 200,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010. No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use. The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.   </p>  <p>  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the formulation of any pharmaceutical product authorised for use in the EU.</p></reply>

It provides managers with a high level overview of the services&rsquo; risk status at a particular point in time, and becomes a dynamic tool for the monitoring of actions which need to be taken to mitigate that risk. </p>  <p>  I am aware that the South/South West Hospital Group risk register had identified out of hours access to interventional cardiology services as a risk. However, to manage this risk protocols are in place for STEMI patients out of hours, which includes patients being transferred to Cork or Dublin for primary PCI. Alternatively, STEMI patients receive thrombolysis at the nearest hospital before later being referred to a PCI centre. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the review of cath lab services at UHW which was undertaken by Dr Niall Herity. Dr Herity has made clear recommendations that a second cardiac cath lab at UHW is not justified. However, he recommends investing in UHW to enhance the existing cardiology services including increasing the number of weekly sessions currently provided, in order to address waiting times and to provide improved access for patients. He also recommends that new specialist equipment be provided to improve contingency for radiological equipment failure during a procedure. I am happy to provide the additional resources necessary to implement these recommendations. This investment will be reflected in the HSE National Service Plan for 2017. </p>  <p>  Dr Herity also recommends that some services be provided elsewhere. In this regard, I have asked my Department to address the implications of this recommendation by undertaking a national review of all primary PCI services with the aim to ensure that as many patients as possible have access to a 24/7 basis to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack. I expect the review to be completed by the end of July 2017. </p>  <p>  Implementation of Dr Herity&rsquo;s report will, I believe, strengthen the provision of safe and sustainable primary PCI services for STEMI patients in the South East.  </p></reply>

Recruitment is challenging given nursing shortages globally, intense competition at home and abroad and the standing of Irish trained nurses and midwives.</p>  <p>  There are many initiatives currently underway to improve staffing levels throughout the country.  The HSE is offering permanent posts to 2016 degree programme graduates, and full time permanent contracts to those in temporary posts.  The HSE is also focused on converting agency staffing to permanent posts.  The HSE's National Recruitment Service is actively operating rolling nursing recruitment campaigns.  The campaigns encompass General, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability and Registered Children's Nurses, and also Midwives.  In addition, a relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 is available to nurses who return from overseas.</p>  <p>  A number of specific measures have also been taken in relation to pay that will support the recruitment and retention of Irish nursing and midwifery graduates.  Measures to date  include the first stage of pay restoration under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, additional pay in return for taking on some duties from doctors and an increase in the rate of pay for the student nursing placement to 70% of the first point of the staff nurse pay scale.  Last month the Government approved restoration of incremental credit for all nurses in respect of the 36 week clinical placement undertaken by 4th year student nurses in the context of the 2017 Estimates.  This decision means that all nurses and midwives will receive incremental credit for the 36 week placement restored from 1 January 2017, restoration of the credit to 2016 and future graduates having been approved earlier this year.  It is estimated that the inclusion of 2011 to 2015 graduates will benefit around 4,000 nurses who are currently working within the public health service and potentially another 3,000 who may wish to return to the public system in the future.</p>  <p>  There has been an increase of almost 1,200 nurses employed in the public health service (34,336 to 35,534) from September 2014 to September 2016, numbers having fallen by almost 4,600 from 2007 to 2014.  The total budget for the health service in 2017 is &euro;14.6 billion, the highest budget ever allocated to the health service and this will allow for the recruitment of additional frontline staff to meet service needs.  It is intended that this will support the recruitment of up to 1,000 additional nurses.  Given recognised difficulties in filling psychiatric nursing vacancies, an additional 60 undergraduate places have been put in place this autumn with a further 70 additional places to be provided next year.</p></reply>

Hospital Groups must increasingly focus on networks of service provision with smaller hospitals managing routine, urgent or planned care locally, more complex care managed in the larger hospitals and better linkages with primary, continuing and social care.</p>  <p>  A number of developments at the hospital have been funded in recent years including the refurbishment of the Emergency Department and upgrade of general theatres and Central Sterile Services.  There has also been an increase in day surgical activity, with surgeons from the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital carrying out day surgery in Navan.  Further developments in relation to surgery and other clinical services are being considered by the Group.  There is significant potential for enhancing the hospital&rsquo;s role as a constituent hospital within the Hospital Group.  As a smaller hospital, the challenge is to make sure that Navan provides more of the right type of services, which can safely be delivered, so that we maximise the benefit to patients.</p>  <p>  Any proposed change to services provided at Navan Hospital, will need to take account of existing patient flows, demands in other hospitals and the need to develop particular services in the context of overall service reorganisation in the Hospital Group.</p>  <p>  As previously stated I would be happy to consider a request to meet with  the group referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Treatment Programme is responsible for implementing the clinical prioritisation criteria and any further extensions as the Programme is rolled-out.</p><p>At the time of establishment of the Programme, the Government provided a commitment that, at the very latest, by the end of 2017, all persons who contracted Hepatitis C through the administration of blood and blood products in the State will have access to these new medicines, if prescribed for them by their treating Clinician.  This process is currently being managed through the Treatment Programme.  Data from the HSE shows that as of September this year a total of 358 Health Amendment Act cardholder patients have been approved for treatment and the HSE have indicated that all cardholder patients will be offered treatment by the end of next year.</p><p>Further details on the Treatment Programme can be found at: www.hse.ie/eng/about/Who/primarycare/hepcprogramme%20.html.</p></reply>

This ensures that the specified title of physiotherapist will be protected for the exclusive use of registrants when the register&rsquo;s two-year transitional period ends in September 2018.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, my predecessor, Deputy Leo Varadkar, having consulted with relevant parties, concluded that protecting the title of physical therapist under the Act as a variant of the title of physiotherapist would be the best way to eliminate the ongoing risk of title confusion and the consequent risks to public safety.  He also decided to allow particular existing users of the title of physical therapist, who are not physiotherapists but who hold qualifications of a certain standard, to continue to use the title. </p>  <p>  New grand-parenting provisions will allow such practitioners to apply, on a once-off basis and for a limited period, to register in the physiotherapists register, confining their practise to musculoskeletal therapies.</p>  <p>  I am implementing these decisions which were welcomed by the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists and the Irish Association of Physical Therapists. </p>  <p>  Preparation of the necessary legislation to give effect to these decisions is now at an advanced stage.  The legislation will involve the making of regulations under the 2005 Act in tandem with the enactment of necessary amendments to that Act to allow existing qualified title users to continue to use the title.  It is my intention to seek Government approval to include these amendments to the Act in a Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that is currently being drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. </p></reply>

The administration of the Scheme in each Member State is subjected to close scrutiny by officials of the EU Commission and the EU Court of Auditors to ensure that the regulatory requirements are met and that the Schemes are applied in a uniform manner across the European Union. </p>  <p>   All applications under the Scheme are subject to administrative checks, with a further 5% also subject to land eligibility inspections in compliance with EU legislation. </p>  <p>  Where issues preventing payment are identified contact is immediately made with the applicant concerned in order to resolve the query.  Work is well under way in resolving the queries that have arisen following these checks and farmers are being contacted as necessary.</p>  <p>  I am keenly aware that the advance payment of the BPS is a vital support to farmers across sectors in maximising cash flow and my Department will continue to prioritise the processing of all outstanding cases.</p></reply>

The organisation and location of Green Cert courses within the Teagasc network is a matter for Teagasc management to determine.</p>  <p>  The current exceptional demand reflects renewed interest and opportunities in agriculture, but is also directly linked to the education requirements of the Young Farmers Scheme and National Reserve, which require applicants to have a prescribed Level 6 agricultural qualification - a Green Cert or equivalent in order to qualify for payment.  This was to ensure that payments were targeted at &lsquo;trained young farmers&rsquo; who have a genuine interest in farming as a career.  Approximately 2,000 young farmers required Green Cert places arising from the education requirements of the Young Farmers Scheme and National Reserve.</p>  <p>  In order to address this situation, it was agreed that additional temporary resources would be provided to Teagasc to enable them to rapidly expand the number of Green Cert places and clear the back log of applications in the shortest possible timeframe.  In conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Teagasc was approved to appoint 70 education officers and 7 administrative staff on two year employment contracts.  The allocation of those resources to the different agricultural colleges etc. is an internal operational matter for Teagasc and not my Department.  I understand that most have been hired and are helping to deliver record numbers of Green Cert enrolments, which are forecasted to top 4,500 for the period 2014 to 2016.</p>  <p>  As can be expected, the Young Farmers Scheme and National Reserve has stimulated added interest in the adult Green Cert among other farmers who have &ldquo;registered an interest&rdquo; with Teagasc in completing the course.  My Department has asked Teagasc to explore other staffing measures, beyond further temporary recruitment, to ensure that any residual demand for the Green Cert can be accommodated within a realistic time-frame. My Department will continue to monitor the Green Cert situation in Teagasc closely.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-08a.1161.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110800077#WRW02800"><p>Under EU Regulations, all Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme applications are subject to robust administrative checks prior to payment.  The main element of the administrative check is an area assessment. This is achieved by using the Land Parcel Identification System which currently records some 1 million individual land parcels.</p>  <p>  The work of my Department in this critical area must meet demanding EU and national audit requirements.  Only valid applications under the BPS and ANC that fully comply with the requirements of the EU legislation are paid.  Consequently, all applications under the schemes are subject to administrative checks.  In 2016 these administrative checks commenced on 31st May when on-line applications were subject to preliminary checks to identify in particular over-claims and dual claims.  An overall  validation process was then carried out on all applications once the data capture of 31,000 paper applications was completed.</p>  <p>  Cases that did not pass the validation process went into error and cannot be paid until the error concerned is resolved.  These errors include over-claims, dual claims and incomplete application forms.  My Department entered into correspondence, mainly through the issuing of query letters to farmers, in order to resolve these error cases.</p>  <p>  The selection of cases for on-the-spot-checks, either by means of ground or remote sensing inspection, is governed by EU regulations.  All cases to be selected for inspection must be eligible beneficiaries under the various area-based schemes.  Therefore the selection of cases for inspection, while commencing after the closing date for receipt of applications, i.e. 15 May for the 2016 Scheme year, is an on-going process so as to ensure this specific regulatory requirement is adhered to.</p>  <p>  The process of a remote sensing inspection involves the comprehensive review of a range of satellite imagery received at various stages during the year to ensure that the actual claimed area in the application form corresponds to the area farmed by the applicant, that the different crop types are as claimed, and that ineligible land or features are not included for payment purposes.  The EU regulations prescribe that for on-the-spot checks involving land eligibility, any notice of an inspection must be strictly limited to the minimum period necessary and must not exceed 14 days.  As the commencement of a remote sensing inspection is dependent on the receipt of a range of satellite imagery throughout the year it is not possible to give a definitive notice date.  Furthermore, it is not possible to notify an applicant of errors on their case until such time as the inspection process is fully completed, given the phased process of a remote sensing inspection.</p>  <p>  Payments under the 2016 Basic Payment Scheme commenced on 17 October, which is the earliest date allowed under the EU legislation.  In addition, following discussions with the EU Commission I confirmed that the level of the advance payment under this scheme would be set at 70% for 2016, rather than 50% as provided for in the EU legislation.</p>  <p>  To date payments in excess of &euro;770m have issued to over 117,000 applicants under the Basic Payment Scheme.  A further &euro;183m has issued to some 84,500 applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department is prioritising the processing of all outstanding cases subject to administrative checks or inspection and cases continue to be finalised to payment stage on a daily basis. Regular payment runs are being made for both the BPS and ANC to ensure prompt payment of fully processed cases.</p></reply>

The multi-annual pay ceiling is binding and it falls on Teagasc to deliver services within the agreed ceiling.  This includes responding to emerging expenditure pressures without recourse to additional Exchequer allocations and involves commitment to ongoing reform and efficiency measures as appropriate. </p>  <p>  The arrangements enable Teagasc to replace staff when they retire and to make 75 new permanent appointments, subject to compliance with the pay ceilings.  The specific arrangements to allocate available staff resources to Teagasc research, advisory and/or education services are matters for Teagasc management to determine. I understand that a number of appointments have been made in the education area.  While Teagasc must remain within its overall pay budget, the flexibility provided by the new arrangements will allow them to fill critical vacancies and to react faster when such vacancies arise in the future. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above measure, my Department in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, approved the appointment of 70 education officers and 7 administrative staff on two year contracts to enable Teagasc dramatically increase enrolments for the Green Cert Programme.  The allocation of those resources to the different agricultural colleges etc. is an internal operational matter for Teagasc and not my Department.  I understand that most of the teachers have been recruited and are helping to deliver record numbers of Green Cert enrolments, which are forecasted to top 4,500 for the period 2014 to 2016. </p>  <p>  My Department has asked Teagasc to explore other staffing measures, beyond further temporary recruitment, to ensure that any residual demand for the Green Cert can be accommodated within a realistic time-frame.  My Department will continue to monitor the Green Cert situation in Teagasc closely. </p></reply>

There were some 6,250 successful applicants under the 2015 National Reserve. </p>  <p>  There was no National Reserve in 2016 as all available funding of &euro;24 million had been utilised under the 2015 scheme.  In order to provide for a National Reserve in 2017 funding is required to replenish the Reserve.  EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that funding for the replenishment of the National Reserve may be obtained by means of surrender of entitlements that remain unused by farmers for two consecutive years and by clawback derived following the sale of entitlements without land.  It is envisaged that funding derived from these two sources in 2017 will be very limited.  The Regulations also provide for the application of a linear cut to the value of all farmers&rsquo; entitlements to replenish the National Reserve.  Decisions in relation to the National Reserve for 2017 will be considered once the position on potential funding has been established. </p>  <p>  The Young Farmers Scheme is a separate annual scheme which provides an additional payment for &lsquo;young farmers&rsquo; on activated entitlements.  The closing date for the Young Farmers Scheme in 2016 was 16 May.  Applications for the 2017 Young Farmers Scheme will be made available well in advance of the 2017 closing date.  </p></reply>

The Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff schemes support the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind.  Figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) for 2015  indicate that 9.1% of the overall 16% target was met and that 25.3% of electricity was generated by renewable sources, of which 22.8% was generated by onshore wind. </font></p><p>In addition to our onshore wind resource, bioenergy, solar, offshore wind and other technologies may play a role in diversifying our renewable generation portfolio over the period to 2030.

It should be noted that there has never been a national waiver scheme for household waste collection.  During the period in which local authorities were directly involved in the collection of household waste, a minority of individual Councils offered different levels of discount to selected households, based on different qualification criteria.  As local authorities exited the waste collection market, some required the private operators which took on the Councils&rsquo; customers to provide a level of discount for existing waiver customers only, and even then, for only a limited time. </p>  <p>  The vast majority of such contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired.  In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price.  However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis. </p>  <p>  In addition, a very limited number of local authorities make financial contributions towards the cost of, or pay for, the collection of waste from certain households.  Again, the qualification criteria and level of support differ from area to area. </p>  <p>  With the exception of one or two municipal districts, local authorities no longer collect waste.  Waste collection is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged are a matter between service provider and customer and the range of services and fees offered vary amongst providers and across the country.  In that regard, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a national waiver scheme could not be imposed in the context of an open market for waste collection.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, as previously stated, a review of the way households are charged for the collection of waste, with a focus on encouraging households to prevent, separate and recycle waste and to reduce residual waste going to landfills, is due to be completed by July next year.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services. </p>  <p>  Approximately 1.3m premises in Ireland can now get high speed broadband and at least one mobile operator is delivering 4G services to over 90% of the population.  It is estimated that up to 42% of premises in Co. Monaghan will have access to  commercial high speed broadband services provided by telecommunications operators, while the remaining 58% consisting of just over 19,000 premises in Co. Monaghan will fall within the proposed State led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.  </p>  <p>  The breakdown of premises covered, per townland, is available on the High Speed Broadband Map at www.broadband.gov.ie.  The maps shows that 9% of the townland of Dohamlat, Co Monaghan  falls within the AMBER area and will therefore be included in the State intervention procurement process.  The remaining 91% of Doohamlat is included in the BLUE area where commercial providers are either currently delivering or previously indicated that they have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p>  <p>  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  If customers in Doohamlat, Co Monaghan cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at broadband@dccae.gov.ie, quoting their address and Eircode, and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services. </p>  <p>  The rollout of services by commercial operators in the BLUE area is being kept under constant review by the Department to ensure that all premises can get access to services, either through commercial investment or the State intervention. </p>  <p>  The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area comprising over 750,000 premises, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  Householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but potentially up to 1000 megabits per second with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given that discussions are ongoing in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. </p>  <p>  In parallel, and in accordance with commitments in the Programme for Government, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p>  <p>  In July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.  I expect the Taskforce to report by end 2016. </p>  <p>  &euro;15m  has been provided for the NBP in my Departments Estimates for 2017 to provide for early stage mobilisation payment that may be required by winning bidder(s).  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band. </p>  <p>  In addition, I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, to provide an 86% increase in total  spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. </p>  <p>These initiatives should assist in significantly improving the quality of broadband and mobile phone services across Ireland, putting Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity.   </p></reply>

This is a solution that will endure for 25 years and beyond.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at shows the extent of the State Intervention area and provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including Co Meath.</p><p>The maps shows that the townland of Kellystown falls within the AMBER area and will therefore be included in the State intervention procurement process.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to </p><p>The rollout of services by commercial operators in the BLUE area is being kept under constant review by the Department to ensure that all premises can get access to services, either through commercial investment or the State intervention. </p><p>Over 750,000 premises are currently within the State intervention area.  This includes over 31,000 premises in County Meath.</p><p>The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network to over 750,000 premises in Ireland, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. </p><p>My Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms service, including parts of Co.

The environmental impact of the project was considered in the context of the North Dublin Study and will be considered further in the context of the Railway Order application for new Metro North.    </p>  <p>   I understand that over 8 km of the route would run in a tunnel from Griffith Avenue through the City Centre in addition to running under Dublin Airport, and this involves reduced tunnelling from the original Metro North project.  It is proposed that the service would operate with 60-metre light metro vehicles, which offers a design capacity for 9,900 passengers per hour per direction, although expandable in future if required.</p>  <p>  The NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) have commenced preparatory work on planning and design of new Metro North.  My Department will continue to monitor progress, including funding for the project, as the planning and design process evolves.</p>  <p>  Discussions in relation to potential funding by the European Investment Bank will be initiated at a later stage when the NTA and TII have further progressed the planning and design work for the revised project.</p></reply>

The framework reflects the Programme for Partnership Government 's commitment to establishing a dedicated LEV taskforce.  It is certainly recognised that greater penetration of LEVs in the Irish market would assist Ireland in meeting emissions reduction, energy efficiency and air quality targets as well as achieving 10% renewable energy in the transport sector by 2020.​</p>  <p>  As policy in relation to electric vehicles rests with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, his Department is working closely with mine to establish the taskforce in the coming weeks.  It will work to present a range of potential measures and incentive options to Government for the purpose of accelerating the deployment of LEVs, including taxis.  Proposals to ​support the uptake of lower emitting public service passenger cars, including wheeelchair accessible taxis, will be considered within its work programme.</p></reply>

A contract of employment will generally contain a retirement age but this is a matter of contract between the parties.</p>  <p>  The upper age limit for bringing claims under the Unfair Dismissals Acts was removed by a provision in the Equality Act 2004. It is now the case that a person of any age, when dismissed, may take a case under the Unfair Dismissals Acts unless she or he has reached the &ldquo;normal retiring age for employees of the same employer in similar employment&rdquo;, if one exists. In such circumstances, the burden of proof is on the employer to prove the normal retiring age. Furthermore, the upper age limit of 66 years for receipt of statutory redundancy payments was removed by the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Act 2007. </p>  <p>  As the issue that arises around compulsory retirement at a given age is whether this entails discrimination on age grounds, the more usual avenue of redress for employees compulsorily retired is to take a claim, under the Employment Equality Acts, to the Workplace Relations Commission. Responsibility for employment equality legislation rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that an Inter-Departmental Group (IDG), chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER), was established by the Government earlier this year to consider policy around retirement age in both the public and private sectors. The IDG concluded its work during the summer and the Group&rsquo;s report was published in August by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The IDG made a number of recommendations, one of which related to my specific area of responsibility. On foot of that recommendation I wrote to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to request them to prepare a Code of Practice under Section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 around the issue of longer working, which should set out best industrial relations practice in managing the engagement between employers and employees in the run up to retirement, including requests to work beyond what would be considered the normal retirement age in the employment concerned.</p></reply>

The scheme was originally introduced in response to concerns raised by cross border workers concerning the tax position of employees resident in the State and employed in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The purpose of section 825A TCA is to give relief to those workers who commute to a place of work outside the State and who exercise the duties of their employment wholly outside the State.  The relief therefore is not easily aligned in a self-employed context as many elements of a self-employed business of an Irish resident would most likely be carried on from within the State. This could include for example, planning and organisation of activities and jobs, as well as various other ancillary and administrative functions. Therefore, unlike a foreign employment which is a clear, discrete activity carried on in wholly in another jurisdiction, self-employment assignments are much less defined and could present control issues. It should be noted of course that the employees of a self-employed contractor would be eligible for the relief.</p>  <p>  In addition, an extension of the relief to the self-employed would likely provide an incentive for businesses to relocate north of the border in circumstances where the Irish income tax rates compared unfavourably with the prevailing UK rates. </p>  <p>  Finally, self-employed individuals have the option to incorporate and benefit from lower corporate tax rates whereas employees have no such option. One of the reasons for introducing the relief for cross-border employees was to shield their exposure to the higher rates of Irish income tax. There are no such exposures for a self-employed individual who incorporates his/her sole trade.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance is aware of this position.</p></reply>

The increasing demand as the economy returns to growth is having an impact on commercial offices rents in Dublin. Commercial rents for office space have increased since the end of 2012, following a period when office rents in Dublin almost halved over the period 2008-2012 post the property crash.</p>  <p>  The availability of cost effective and flexible property solutions continues to play a key role in supporting enterprise growth and expansion and the attraction of new investment into Ireland. ESRI research undertaken in 2015 shows the high level of demand for commercial property amongst FDI firms - 70 per cent of the take-up of such office space in Dublin in 2015 was by new and existing FDI.</p>  <p>  The construction of new office space has turned around quickly over the last three years, from a situation where as the ESRI noted that Dublin was the only European capital where there was no office space construction between 2011 and 2013, there is now an estimated 3.1 million sq. ft. currently under construction of which 82 percent is in the city centre. Large scale developments are underway in Burlington Road, Molesworth Street and St Stephens Green, as well as in the South Docklands and the IFSC. This significant increase in office development activity should contribute to meeting demand into the future. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland, an agency of my Department, has valuable insights into the technical and commercial requirements of FDI spanning sectors and activities.   IDA is in continuous dialogue with key stakeholders in the property market to ensure that the required competitive property solutions are available in the short and medium term.</p></reply>

The Commission is also aware from our contacts with them that Ireland, above all Member States, stands to be uniquely impacted by Brexit.  </p>  <p>  In order to build further on the foregoing, my Department is currently scoping out various possible responses to the short term currency challenge and I expect to be in a position to announce more detail, based on actual company needs, shortly.  Any new initiative must be tailored, targeted and evidence-based in order for our SMEs to receive the maximum support possible, and in the sectors most needed.</p></reply>

Section 9 (5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the CCPC is independent in the performance of its functions, including carrying out investigations of alleged anti-competitive practices. As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the CCPC, I, as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation have no direct function in the matter.It is important to note that while the CCPC has responsibility to investigate alleged cartels, it is the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) who decides whether to prosecute, and any resulting sanctions are imposed by the courts. Due to the inherently secret nature of cartels and the evidential threshold of &ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt&rdquo; for criminal cases, cartel investigations, like any other form of white-collar crime, are resource intensive and usually of long duration.</p><p>I have been advised by the CCPC that up until July 2016, the DPP secured 33 convictions for cartel offences on indictment; 17 of those convictions were against individuals and 16 were against undertakings. </p><p>These resulted in fines of &euro;629,000 being imposed (with &euro;316,000 of this being imposed on individuals).  Nine persons have been given custodial sentences totalling 11 years.  Custodial sentences have ranged from three months to two years.  In all cases the custodial sentences were suspended.  One person was jailed for non-payment of the imposed fine.</p><p>In addition to the above, the DPP took two criminal prosecutions which resulted in acquittals, and one file was referred to the DPP who decided that there was insufficient evidence to launch a prosecution. </p><p>In summary the DPP prosecuted 50 alleged cartelists and secured 33 convictions on indictment. </p><p>The sectors and industries in which the alleged price collusion took place were:</p><p>-home heating oil</p><p>-cars</p><p>-domestic waste collection</p><p>-railway vegetation clearance</p><p>If the Deputy is aware of any alleged cartel activity that is taking place (be it price-fixing, market-sharing or bid-rigging), or knows of potential whistle blowers or immunity applicants I would urge him to forward specific details to the CCPC for their attention and possible further investigation.</p></reply>

I met with the chairman, Professor Peter Clinch on 5 July to discuss Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness performance. I subsequently brought the Council&rsquo;s Competitiveness Scorecard report to the Cabinet Committee for Economy, Trade and Jobs and to Government for consideration prior to publication.  I set out how improved competitiveness has been a key part of the upturn and how Brexit means competitiveness is more important than ever for growth and jobs. All of the countries with whom we trade and compete with for FDI and export share are improving their performance. We cannot stand still.   Recommendations to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness particularly in light of Brexit will be included in the Council&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge report which will be submitted to me later this year.</p>  <p>  Favourable exchange rates vis-&agrave;-vis our main trading partners makes firms based in Ireland more cost competitive and allows them to trade more effectively in international markets. The value of the Euro against Sterling is critical for Irish exporters, particularly SMEs and employment intensive sectors such as the agri-food sector which are very dependent on strong trading activity with the UK. The value of Sterling weakened in the run up to the Referendum in the UK and has declined further in light of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s exposure to currency fluctuations &ndash; arising from our high level of trade outside the Euro area, particularly with the UK&ndash; reinforces the need to maintain focus on domestically influenced aspects of competitiveness. Exporting firms need to ensure that appropriate currency risk strategies are in place and a sustainable cost base is maintained.   From the perspective of the firm, companies should also seek financial advice relating to hedging and managing risks.</p>  <p>  While Irish policy makers cannot influence exchange rates, since the announcement of the vote of the UK to leave the EU, I have been in regular contact with key agencies, in particular Enterprise Ireland to address the impact of Brexit and exchange rate volatility on enterprise. Enterprise Ireland has put together a range of supports to clients impacted by Brexit. Key measures include market diversification plans, enhanced UK market supports, management and competitiveness supports.   </p>  <p>  As part of the Budget 2017, I secured additional resources for our enterprise agencies to put more people on the ground in foreign markets to attract investment and to help Irish business who export to the UK and helping others diversify into new markets. I have asked that Enterprise Ireland intensify its work with clients exporting to the UK by providing support to improve their competitiveness in the market through its management capability and development programmes such as LEAN.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this considerable uncertainty, the immediate implications for Ireland of the UK leaving the EU are being addressed by Government. While there is a lack of clarity as to how the negotiation process will proceed, the UK will remain an attractive market for many Irish companies, with a population of over 65 million people.</p><p>As a small, open, trade-dependent economy exchange rates, in particular, have a significant impact on Ireland&rsquo;s national competitiveness. The importance of exchange rate fluctuations was raised earlier this year by the National Competitiveness Council in a Competitiveness Bulletin, published in April.</p><p>This Bulletin noted that volatility in exchange rates always presents challenges. The current situation of a weakened Sterling rate means that Irish exports are now relatively more expensive in the EU, while conversely, imports from the UK are cheaper. This naturally, presents particular challenges to Irish firms exporting to the UK. </p><p>The present exchange rate volatility highlights the importance of focusing on a wide spectrum of competitiveness policies &ndash; in particular policies to enhance competition and productivity. A competitive, sustainable, cost base can help to create a virtuous circle between inflation, wage expectations and productivity, and can provide a buffer against such exchange rate fluctuations and other uncontrollable, external factors.</p><p>In July of this year, the National Competitiveness Council published its annual <i>Competitiveness Scorecard</i>benchmarking report which provides an in-depth assessment of all aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness performance. As well as highlighting Ireland&rsquo;s strong overall competitiveness, this year&rsquo;s report highlighted a range of competitiveness implications arising from Brexit &ndash; slower growth in the UK, the realignment of the deep inter-linkages between Ireland and the UK in terms of physical , economic and regulatory systems, both on and off the island, together with exchange rate fluctuations. </p><p>The Council also noted that Brexit brings into sharp focus the need for Irish based enterprise to step-up their own productivity and innovation performance to compete in international markets and for Ireland's policy system to be agile in responding to the competitiveness challenges and opportunities of the UK outside the EU.</p><p>The analysis contained in the Scorecard report is informing the development of the Council&rsquo;s annual policy report <i>Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge 2016</i>which will shortly be submitted to Government for consideration. I understand that this report will include a chapter specifically dealing with the competitiveness implications of Brexit. </p><p>Furthermore, having met with the Chair of the Council earlier this year, and in light of the significant competitiveness impacts of Brexit, the National Competitiveness Council are undertaking a specific benchmarking exercise to fully understand Ireland&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses in the wake of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union.</p><p>Much like the NCC&rsquo;s Competitiveness Scorecard report, this study will provide a comprehensive statistical assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness performance across a range of competitiveness metrics against both the UK and Northern Ireland (where data is available), and will highlight areas where policy attention should be focussed to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness. I expect that this report will be completed by the end of Q1 2017.</p></reply>

That is why I am making sure that I am in possession of all the detail of how Brexit impacts on each and every sector and company type &ndash; be they micro, small, medium, or even larger companies in some instances - before I finalise my proposals or make any announcements about specific measures.</p>  <p>  My Officials have also engaged with the European Commission to gain clarification on, and a full understanding of, the scope of EU State Aid rules.  The Commission is also aware from our contacts with them that Ireland, above all Member States, stands to be uniquely impacted by Brexit.</p>  <p>  In order to build further on the foregoing, my Department is currently scoping out various possible responses to the short term currency challenge and I expect to be in a position to announce more detail, based on actual company needs, shortly.  Any new initiative must be tailored, targeted and evidence-based in order for our SMEs to receive the maximum support possible, and in the sectors most needed.</p></reply>

The consultation is focused on the details of the new scheme, as set out in the published policy paper, and is intended to inform the further refinement of the scheme in advance of its implementation in September 2017.</p><p>I am very much open to hearing views about supports for parents raising children at home, but I also want to ensure that the measures I announced recently are implemented with the needs of children and their parents to the fore. The Affordable Childcare Scheme responds to a specific need to increase the affordability, quality and supply of early years and school-age care and education services in Ireland.  It also reflects a core recommendation of the 2015 Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare in Ireland to replace the existing targeted childcare schemes, which are administratively complex and inadequate in terms of accessibility, with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme.</p><p>It is important to recognise that the Affordable Childcare Scheme is only one element of a broader set of commitments and supports aimed at parents and children.  The provision of improved services for centre-based care is very important, but I will not lose sight of the needs of children who do not attend them. In this regard, <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People</i>contains a commitment to produce Ireland&rsquo;s first-ever National Early Years Strategy.  The intention is to deliver a cross-cutting strategy which will take a joined-up, whole of Government approach to the issue of supporting children and their families during the early years (0-6 years). The drafting of the National Early Years Strategy is very advanced and I intend to host an Open Policy Debate on the strategy before the end of the year with a view to publication shortly thereafter.</p><p>I believe that we need to develop the quality, affordability and accessibility of centre-based care, and that achieving this does not affect the supports that we can offer parents who opt for other forms of care for their children.</p></reply>

For a childcare room/session to be approved for the ECCE Higher Capitation Rate the following criteria applies:</p><p>-  Pre-school leaders must satisfy the minimum qualification requirements as approved on the published list of my Department's Early Years Recognised Qualifications and have at least three years' experience working in the early years sector</p><p>-  Pre-school assistants must have a minimum qualification of Level 5 or equivalent in a recognised Early Years Qualification </p><p>-  The appropriate qualified staff should be present for each ECCE session applying for Higher Capitation in accordance with the ECCE child:staff ratio requirement. </p><p>It is my understanding that an administrative error occurred while the application from the service in question was being processed. The nominated person from this service was incorrectly deemed to be a Higher Capitation room leader. Upon noticing this error, officials from my Department corrected it and informed the service provider. Officials have reviewed the relevant qualifications, as sent in by the service provider, and have advised that they do not meet the minimum requirements for Higher Capitation. </p><p>If a provider feels that their qualifications meet the required criteria there is a mechanism to submit their full qualifications portfolio to the Department to have them individually assessed.

My Department cannot make a decision regarding higher capitation payment until such a provider submits their qualifications portfolio to be assessed, and the outcome of this assessment is known, or the qualification is on the DCYA Early Years Recognised Qualifications list.  Further information on this is available at .</p><p>In relation to Nursing Degrees my Department has published the following information:</p><p>&quot;This qualification is accepted as meeting the minimum Regulatory requirements to work in early years.

While operational responsibility for these do not fall within my policy remit as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I support the extension of parental leave for parents; particularly in the crucial first year. The Government has provided additional support for stay-at-home parents through the home carer tax credit, which has been increased to &euro;1,100 per year. I support an increase in the earnings threshold for this, and have raised this with the Minister for Finance. </p>  <p>  My Department provides a number of childcare schemes available to all families, including the ECCE free pre-school year, which has been extended into a second year from this September - children&rsquo;s eligibility for ECCE has increased from 38 weeks for all children, to an average of 61 weeks (ranging from 51 to 88 weeks depending on date of birth and age starting school). The Department projects that the expanded ECCE scheme will have a peak enrolment of 127,000 children in the April-June session in 2017. This is an increase of 60,000 children from the pre-expansion volume. Registrations for the September intake are on-going. Presently, the Department expects up to 89,000 children to take part in ECCE from September 2016. Over the last number of years, up to 96% of pre-school children have accessed the ECCE Programme, demonstrating both good supply and good take-up across the country. All children can benefit from the learning and socialisation provided through this scheme.</p>  <p>  The proposals reflect a key recommendation of the 2015 Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare in Ireland to replace the existing targeted schemes with a new single Affordable Childcare Scheme for Ireland.  They also reflect commitments in the Programme for Government to &ldquo;streamline the existing schemes to make them more accessible for both parents and providers&rdquo;, to &ldquo;continue to support subsidised childcare places for low income families&rdquo;, and to provide &ldquo;a robust model for subsidised high quality childcare for children aged 9-36 months&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Some media comments have claimed the scheme discriminates against stay at home parents. However, this scheme responds specifically to the high cost of childcare in Ireland, which has been criticised by the European Commission and Irish families.</p></reply>

The draft was prepared following consultations with external stakeholders, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, other Government Departments and the staff of my Department. The content is informed by the commitments in the Programme for Partnership Government for which I have responsibility, my stated priorities and my Department's ongoing responsibilities. The draft is also informed by the guidance issued to all Departments by the Department of the Taoiseach. Subject to some final adjustments, I expect it will be published shortly.</p><p>Although, I do not have lead responsibility in the area of disability I have lead responsibility on an initiative under my Department which provides supports for children with disabilities through the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM).  This model, launched earlier this year, will enable all children with disabilities to fully access the ECCE scheme. When published, my Department's Statement of Strategy will reflect my ambition to<font color="#0000FF"> </font>continue to develop and implement this model which I believe to be a huge step forward for children with disabilities and their families.</p><p>The Strategy will also reflect my commitment to have a child welfare and protection system that is effective and responsive to the needs of all children, particularly the needs of most vulnerable groups that include children with disabilities. It will reflect the importance I attach to the participation of children and young people in decisions that affect their lives. I intend to implement the National Strategy on the Participation of Children and Young People in Decision Making 2015-2020 which includes particular initiatives to involve marginalised  children, including children with disabilities and other vulnerable groups.</p><p>Central to the priorities that I want to advance, as reflected in my Statement of Strategy, will be the implementation of <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures,</i>the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020. This framework requires collaboration with all stakeholders and provides the context for our own work as well as the agenda for our leadership of effort to improve outcomes for children and young people, including children with disabilities.</p></reply>

The precise level of funding to be allocated in 2017 to the Family Resource Centre Programme will be considered by Tusla in preparing its Business Plan for next year, which will be submitted to me for consideration. </p>  <p>  There are currently 109 communities supported through the Family Resource Centre Programme which is funded by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. The Family Resource Centre Programme is a national programme with its own dedicated budget.

In 2016, Tusla provided &euro;13.5m in funding for the Family Resource Centre Programme. </p>  <p>  I recognise and value the very positive impact of the work of Family Resource Centres in supporting families and local communities.  The Centres provide a holistic service of child, family and community support and advocacy to all children and families in their communities. This universal accessibility allows for early identification of need, provision of appropriate interventions, and timely referrals to appropriate services for more intensive and targeted work as required. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to support the work of the Family Resource Centres and the targeting of available resources at those services which make the greatest impact on vulnerable children and families.</p></reply>

Sections 1 to 5 are standard provisions in relation to title, citation, regulations, definitions etc.  Section 28 relates to corporal punishment and removes the common law defence of reasonable chastisement in relation to same.</p>  <p>  (ii)  Section 18 (Part III) and Sections 20-26 (Part IV)  were commenced on 1 May 2016. Section 18 of the Act is a technical amendment to ensure that the Child and Family Agency is a specified body for purposes of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012. Sections 20-26 deal with establishing the Children First Interdepartmental Implementation Group (CFIDG) on a statutory basis and expanding the Group to include all Government Departments. </p>  <p>  As the Act imposes obligations on certain individuals working with children and on relevant service providers, I think it is vital that all individuals and sectors are fully prepared and ready to implement the legislation before it is commenced. Therefore, in relation to those provisions of the Act which have not yet been commenced, I have recently signed off on a proposal for phased and structured preparations for implementation which will allow for full commencement of the Act by end February, 2018. These provisions include those related to mandated reporting of child abuse, mandated assisting and the preparation of Child Safeguarding Statements by organisations providing relevant services to children. </p>  <p>  The phased implementation timetable will also allow Tusla to undertake the significant preparatory work required to enable it to fully meet its obligations under the legislation.  This will include ensuring that the appropriate internal systems are in place to deal with the intake of mandatory reports by Tusla and that a suite of resources is available to support and assist all sectors in implementing the legislation. My Department is working closely with Tusla in relation to making available basic Children First training, information and resource materials. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department will continue to work closely with the Statutory Children First Inter-Departmental Implementation Group, which includes Tusla, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE, who will take a key role in ensuring that all necessary preparations and supports are in place for those who will acquire legal obligations under the Act.</p></reply>

Under the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016, registered providers of pre-school services will, from 31st December 2016, be required to ensure that each employee working directly with children attending the service holds at least a major award in Early Childhood Care and Education at Level 5 on the National Qualifications Framework or a qualification deemed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to be equivalent. </p><p>Earlier this year my Department asked Childcare Committees Ireland (CCI) to lead on a national piece of work, with the 30 City and County Childcare Committees, to ascertain whether there were services who would struggle financially when the new regulations came into effect and all staff who were treated as part of the staff / child ratios would have to have a Level 5 qualification.</p><p>In working with services on this exercise, CCI was asked to explore  how challenges could be resolved <i>within existing resources. </i>In any services where difficulties are being experienced, the CCCs are tasked with supporting services to assess the contributing factors and manage any change that may assist the service.  This is done initially through the use of of business tools which focus on the finances and overheads of the service. For example, a fee calculation exercise looks at whether the fee being charged by the service is appropriate.  There is also a staff ratio calculation applied to look at the numbers of children in the service, when they are booked in, and what ratio needs to be applied.  For example, it may be that the service should take two fewer children in the morning, and two more in the afternoon in order to maximise the potential and run a viable service.  </p><p>This methodology has been found to be very effective in many services across the country, and whilst sometimes unpopular decisions have had to be made in the short term, the medium and long term results should justify these decisions.</p><p>I hope that the support offered to the services can assist them reform their services to enable them to continue. I will of course be working extremely hard to seek further investment in childcare that will improve affordability for parents but also assist providers in running viable and high quality services. My Department has long-standing relationships with community/not-for-profit childcare providers, and recognises the important role that this sector has to play in childcare provision. I can certainly empathise with the challenges these services face and I continuously commend all early years services, particularly those operating on a not for profit basis, for the work they do.  </p><p>The CCI review  is due to be completed shortly, but preliminary results suggest that some services became over-reliant on unqualified CE participants to be part of core staff ratios over the years. Many services across the country began preparing for the regulations some time ago and have reduced or eliminated their reliance on CE participants as part of the ratios, but I understand that some remain, and this seems to be the case in the service in question.  </p><p>I believe that the work presently being undertaken by my Department and the CCI will influence policy over the coming months and years as we seek to establish a high quality childcare infrastructure in Ireland. You will also be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to independently evaluate the cost of providing childcare. This report will give us solid evidence which will also inform future policy. Such evidence will be critical to ensuring that whilst we work to make high quality childcare more accessible and affordable for parents, we also invest sufficiently to enable services to operate to high standards and attract and retain their valued staff.</p><p>CCI and Cork City CC are engaged with this service to identify the specific challenges that the service face and to make recommendations on a sustainable business model.</p></reply>

I am satisfied that Tusla takes its responsibility very seriously regarding the welfare of children in care and that there is a robust framework of regulations and standards, to ensure that children are placed in safe and caring settings.</p>  <p>  Tusla, within its national office, has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team.  This team produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, and includes detailed reporting on child safety and protection services.  Tusla also provides me with information on children in care, their placement type, care status and allocation of social workers.  Within my Department there is a Unit which scrutinises these reports and briefs me and senior officials on issues of note.  The reports also provide statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlights challenges and areas where further improvement is required such as the recruitment of additional social workers including link workers.  The additional funding of &euro;37 million which has been secured for Tusla in 2017 will provide increased resources for this extra recruitment. </p>  <p>  All foster care organisations and statutory residential centres are inspected by the Health Information &amp;amp; Quality Authority (HIQA), and private and voluntary residential centres are inspected by Tusla against national standards.  These inspection reports of children's residential centres, fostering services and child protection services are also reviewed and analysed by my officials.  The overview from these reports provides me with a level of assurance on the overall capacity of Tusla to identify and provide services to families and children at risk.</p>  <p>  Additional information is gleaned from the National Review Panel reports on individual cases and findings from investigations conducted by the Ombudsman for Children.  Officials meet Tusla management on a regular basis to review the overall level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement.  I meet on a regular basis with the CEO and Chair of Tusla.  Contact is maintained with the non-governmental bodies on issues within the sector, including, for example, the Children's Rights Alliance, EPIC and the Irish Foster Care Association.</p></reply>

The number of referrals reported over the last five years is detailed in the table categorised by child welfare or child protection concerns.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Child Welfare Referrals</th><th>Child Protection Referrals</th><th>Total Number of Referrals</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>21,143       (53%)</td><td>19,044      (47%)</td><td>40,187</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>22,192       (53%)</td><td>19,407      (47%)</td><td>41,599</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>24,954       (57%)</td><td>18,576      (43%)</td><td>43,630</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>25,361       (58%)</td><td>18,235      (42%)</td><td>43,596</td></tr><tr><td>2016 (Q1) </td><td>6,754        (60%)</td><td>4,552      (40%)</td><td>11,306</td></tr></table></p><p>Referrals can come from a number of sources so there are some duplicates in these totals, and some will be more appropriate for universal services, such as those provided in the education or health sectors.  Also, not all referrals will result in a need for a social work service or in a child being received into care.  </p><p>Each referral received by the Agency is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team.  Preliminary screening is aimed at establishing the appropriateness of the referral to Tusla services and, if necessary, is followed by an initial assessment of the concern to determine the best course of action for the child and their family.  As a result, every year, approximately 50% of referrals can be expected to proceed from preliminary enquiry to the initial assessment stage. </p><p>Tusla's policy is to refer child welfare referrals to relevant family and community support services.  At any stage, if a determination is made that there is abuse, whether physical, emotional, sexual or neglect, from which there is an ongoing risk of significant harm, the child protection pathway is followed.  In a minority of cases this may lead to the child being placed on the Child Protection Notification System (CPNS) or the child being received into care.</p><p>At the end of August 2016, the number of cases awaiting allocation to a social worker stood at 4,727, a 30% decrease since December 2015.  The priority or category of high, medium or low given to the case after a preliminary enquiry, is based on information received.  It is important to note that &quot;high priority&quot; should not simply be equated with immediate risk.  Examples of cases categorised as high priority would include cases relating to a child subject to a child protection plan, a child in care living with non-approved relative carers, a child in care in an unstable placement or a young person at high risk.  At the end of August 2016, the number of high priority cases awaiting allocation was 639, a 36% decrease on December 2015.  Social work duty teams keep unallocated cases under review by regular checking to ascertain risk to the child, and where necessary will reprioritise the case. </p><p>My Department has a range of systems in place to ensure it is informed of risk to children and families.  Tusla, within its national office, has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team.  This team produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, and includes detailed reporting on key performance indicators on waiting times for cases to be allocated.  Tusla also provides me with information on children in care, their placement type, care status and allocation of social workers.  My officials use information provided by Tusla to monitor the current status of service provision and the effect as reforms to services take effect.  Activity indicators allow for attention to be focussed on areas where further improvement is required.  In addition to regular reports, Tusla also provides occasional or special topic reports, as needed, which can then be used for budget and resource planning.</p><p>As required under Section 8 of the Child Care Act 1991, my Department also receives the annual 'Review of Adequacy' report compiled and published by the Tusla, which reviews the adequacy of the child and family services provided by the Agency.</p><p>The additional funding of &euro;37 million which has been secured for Tusla in 2017 will provide increased resources to meet identified risks and service demands.  Key to reducing the number of cases awaiting allocation to a social worker, and the associated risk, is the recruitment of staff, including additional social workers and support personnel.</p></reply>

These are foregrounded in policy through Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures and supported by structures such as Children and Young People's Services Committees.  These support and guide the range of services and supports across DCYA, its agencies and constituent sectors.</p><p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People (2014-2020)</i>is the first overarching national policy framework which comprehends the age ranges of children and young people 0 &ndash; 24 years.</p><p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>puts the everyday lives of children and young people at its centre and requires Government Departments and State agencies to work together in an integrated way along with non-government organisations to improve services in order to achieve better outcomes for children and young people.  The Framework provides for Five National Outcomes which we are seeking to achieve for all children and young people.</p><p>My Department is developing a national indicator set to track progress against these five national outcomes.  This indicator set will, as well as tracking progress towards the Five National Outcomes, inform policy formulation and future service provision.</p><p>In terms of structures, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures identifies Children and Young People&rsquo;s Service Committees (CYPSC) as key structures for the planning and co-ordination of local children and young people services.  The overall purpose of the CYPSC is to improve outcomes for children and young people through local and national interagency working.  There are 23 CYPSCs across 27 local authority areas, with two further CYPSCs in the process of setting up.</p><p>Each CYPSC is required to produce a 3 year Children and Young People's Plan (CYPP) which provides for the implementation of national policy, local needs and priorities.  Plans will also take into account the requirements of Local Economic and Community Plans to ensure that there is complementarity between these plans and local CYPSC plans.  This plan identifies local needs and available services, and seeks to address the issues affecting children and young people within the local area concerned.</p><p>Allied with these local structures are those in place such as the National Advisory Council under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures.  These are all informing the identification of needs and the development of responses across the sectors and settings dealing with children and young people and through service provision in the work of the ABC Programme, Early Years, Youth and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  It is my full intention to continue to work closely with these groups and organisations to ensure that we can develop and plan the best services for children according to their needs and to ensure that such services are evidence-informed and quality focused.</p></reply>

In September there were 1,173 families in emergency accommodation, including 1,568 adults and 2,426 dependents.  I am committing to supporting implementation of <i>Rebuilding Ireland: the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>.  We have made some progress in this regard, but more remains to be done.</p><p>The Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) is working to provide free public transport for family travel and for school journeys for those homeless families in the Dublin Region who are residing in hotel accommodation.  Each family is being given five 24-hour family LEAP cards, which will be valid for use on all Dublin transport systems, allowing for family days out at weekends or during holiday periods.  Distribution of the family cards is almost complete.  This will be quickly followed by the distribution of the school journey cards.</p><p>My Department is funding research, commissioned by Focus Ireland, to identify issues regarding access to food and potential nutritional impacts on families in emergency homeless accommodation.</p><p>My Department is also enhancing access to early years services for homeless families through a new Community Childcare Subvention Scheme for homeless children.  It will provide part-time childcare for children aged between 0 and 6 years of age.  It is planned to launch the Scheme next January.</p><p>Also, I recently secured the agreement of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government that the provision of accommodation for young people leaving State care would be eligible for funding under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) operated by his Department.  My Department and Tusla will work to ensure that any accommodation proposed, and ultimately delivered, will be provided with the appropriate levels of protective factors for the young person making the transition to independent living.</p><p>Many of the remaining child-focussed actions in the Action Plan are being advanced by Tusla and progress is being made on several fronts.  The joint protocol between Tusla and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive governing child welfare and protection matters is fully operational and it is intended to replicate this protocol across the State.</p></reply>

This figure currently represents 100,000 children. </p><p>In order to understand and improve the lives of our children, my Department commissioned the Growing Up in Ireland study.  The study examines the lives of Irish children from a wide range of perspectives including economic vulnerability.  My department is also developing a national indicator set to track progress against the five national outcomes in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Future </i>including Outcome 4: Economic security and opportunity which covers the issue of child poverty.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection has the lead role in coordinating Government strategies on child poverty.  It also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion and has identified child poverty as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed.  Officials in my Department are working closely with the Department of Social Protection in informing the plan for this cross-sectoral priority.</p><p>As part of its role in implementing Better Outcomes Brighter Futures, my Department has identified prevention and early intervention as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed in conjunction with a sub-group of the Advisory Council. </p><p>My Department addresses this priority through three levels.  Firstly, it co-finances, with The Atlantic Philanthropies, the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2017) to the combined value of &euro;29.7 million.  The ABC Programme is designed to prevent inter-generational poverty through area based programmes with a strong prevention and early intervention focus.  The ABC Programme has a strong evaluation component allowing us to identify the programmes, initiatives and approaches which impact positively on children's outcomes.  Secondly, my Department is developing the Quality and Capacity Building Initiative that aims to mainstream learning from prevention and early intervention initiatives and take a co-ordinated approach the improve capacity and quality of services for children at risk of developing poor outcomes.  Thirdly, my Department provides significant funding in a range of key areas which support a concerted response to addressing child poverty.  These include the areas of Early Years and Youth.  It also includes resourcing of Tusla services focusing on the welfare, protection and support for children, young people and their families.  These are all key in  supporting outcomes which assist in reducing the impact of child poverty.</p><p>I believe that over the next five years we can further strengthen these essential supports.  In particular I am very interested in and committed to the area of prevention and early intervention.  I believe that identifying and transferring the best learning in terms of interventions and supports for children in this area through a coordinated and collaborative effort is key.  As referenced my Department is actively working on this at present in conjunction with a range of key informants under the Better Outcomes Brighter Futures implementation infrastructure.</p></reply>

Prevalence rates based on information provided by the child&rsquo;s mother were substantially lower than rates based on children&rsquo;s reports, with 23% of the mothers of nine year- olds reporting that their child had been victimised in the previous year.</p>  <p>  Many mothers were unaware of their children&rsquo;s experiences of bullying.  For the children who did report victimisation in the previous year, only 39% of their mothers appeared to have been aware that their child had been the victim of bullying.  This emphasises the importance of parents talking to their children about bullying and schools having policies on bullying which are disseminated to parents</p>  <p>  The Action Plan On Bullying: Report of the Anti-Bullying Working Group to the Minister for Education and Skills was published in January 2013 clearly recognised the necessity to tackle this issue in a holistic way which saw schools as pivotal but placed the issue within a much wider social context.  Amongst the actions which will be taken are the development of a national anti-bullying website to provide information for parents, young people, youth workers, sporting and cultural associations and school staff on types and methods of bullying and how to deal with bullying behaviour.</p>  <p>  Schools are strengthening collaboration and interaction with youth services and promote the active participation by pupils in youth focused services within their local communities.  DCYA supports the National Youth Health Programme which is in partnership with the HSE and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  The programme's aims are to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion/education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings, and includes programmes aimed at exploring bullying and cyberbullying with young people.</p></reply>

This provides places for girls up to the age of 18, for boys up to the age of 18 who are remanded in custody and up to the age of 17 who are sent by the courts to serve a sentence of detention.  Boys aged 17 who are sentenced to detention are currently accommodated by the Irish Prison Service.  This practice will cease shortly, meeting the commitment in the Programme for Government to end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities, when a number of additional units are put into use extending the capacity on the Oberstown campus.  It is intended that this will provide sufficient accommodation for all children under 18 years of age ordered to be detained by the courts. </p>  <p>  In the interim, the existing facilities at Oberstown are being used to meet demand from the Courts.  Oberstown operates a twenty four hour bed management service for children detention places, with the aim of having the maximum degree of coordination in this area.  This service is available at all times to courts, the Probation Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assess the up to date position with regard to the availability of places.  This is a demand led service and every effort is made to meet the needs of the courts in this area.</p>  <p>  Oberstown continues to deliver services focused on education and rehabilitation of all young people detained in order to address offending behaviour and to support their early re-integration into the community.  The new capital development at Oberstown includes a new purpose-built education, training and recreation unit.  This provides sufficient age and ability appropriate facilities to support the delivery, by Dublin and Dun Laoghaire Education Training Board, of the necessary education and training services to young people in detention.</p>  <p>  The child care model of detention delivered in Oberstown provides for a range of rehabilitative supports for each child as part of an overall programme, with a strong ethos of school attendance, education and training and an emphasis on rehabilitation.  It is important to note that a range of rehabilitative supports is offered to every child entering Oberstown as part of an overall programme, focused on their individual needs.  The extent to which each child avails of these services depends on the individual profile in each case.</p></reply>

A key focus of the Strategy Statement is to ensure that the Defence Organisation retains the capacity to meet its high level goal and to fulfil all roles assigned by Government in the White Paper on Defence 2015.  The White Paper sets out a comprehensive policy framework for the next decade and this has been a key factor in driving the identification of priorities over the period of the Strategy Statement.  Having regard to section 42(2) of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, the human rights and equality issues that are relevant to the performance of functions of the Department of Defence have been considered in the preparation of the Strategy Statement. </p>  <p>  In compliance with Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005, the Department of Defence, where practicable, promotes and supports the employment of people with disabilities.  It abides by the principles and standards set out in the Code of Practice for the employment of people with disability in the Irish Civil Service by taking measures which include the appointment of an Access Officer, A Disability Liaison Officer, the provision of workplace accommodation for staff with disabilities on request, and by promoting disability awareness within the Department.</p></reply>
