Ireland maintains strong political, economic and development ties through our Embassies in Ethiopia and Kenya. These will be further enhanced by the Minister&rsquo;s visit.   During that visit, Minister Coveney will see first-hand the development and humanitarian programmes supported by Ireland, and managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral country programme in Ethiopia is our largest and this year amounts to &euro;29 million. The programme is focused on supporting social protection, agriculture, maternal and child health and nutrition programmes, and on meeting the significant humanitarian needs in the country. </p>  <p>  Ireland has a small development programme in Kenya of &euro;450,000 which is focused on developing business links, and on improving the business environment in Kenya. Ireland also supports the development work of missionary and civil society organisations in Kenya.  </p>  <p>  Working with our UN and NGO partners, Ireland provides significant humanitarian assistance to Somalia.  To date in 2017, &euro;5.7 million has been provided to support life-saving operations.   We also support our NGO partners&rsquo; long-term development work in Somalia.</p>  <p>  While at the UN General Assembly in New York this week, Minister Coveney will have a series of bilateral meetings with a number of African national leaders and will discuss Ireland&rsquo;s political and economic relations with the continent.  It is likely that these meetings will result in further requests to deepen links including through inward and outward visits.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-09-21a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092100044#WRB00400"><p>Protecting the existing family reunification rights under EU law of EU citizens residing in the UK at the date of entry into force of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement is one of the key issues that has been identified by the EU within the context of its wider objective of safeguarding the rights and entitlements of EU citizens resident in the UK. Irish citizens resident in the UK &ndash; whether in Northern Ireland or Great Britain &ndash; are among those covered by this objective.  As set out in the comprehensive document published on 2 May entitled <i>Ireland and the negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union</i>, the Government believes that an agreement on the rights of citizens should be wide, ambitious and comprehensive.  In particular, the comprehensive document notes that the Government will be alert to any developments which might possibly affect Irish citizens currently living in the UK and UK citizens currently living in the EU and, in particular, their non-EEA family members.I am satisfied that the Guidelines for the negotiations adopted by the European Council (Art. 50) on 29 April and the more detailed negotiating directives agreed by the General Affairs Council (Art. 50) on 22 May fully reflect Ireland&rsquo;s approach in this regard. </p><p>The detail of the EU&rsquo;s position has been formally conveyed to the UK by way of an essential principles paper, which was published on 12 June and presented in detail to the UK side during the first round of negotiations on 19 June. In particular, Section II (c) of the EU&rsquo;s paper states that the scope of the Withdrawal Agreement should extend to<i>&ldquo;the family members of [EU27 citizens who reside or have resided in the UK at the date of entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement] regardless of their nationality, as covered by Directive 2004/38, who have joined or will join the holder of the right at any point in time after the date of entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement [i.e. current and future family members]&rdquo;. </i></p><p>The UK Government subsequently published its approach to the issue in a paper entitled <i>Safeguarding the position of EU citizens in the UK and UK nationals in the EU</i>and discussions between the EU and the UK have taken place on this issue throughout the three rounds of negotiations that have taken place to date. </p><p>After rounds 2 and 3 of the negotiations on citizens&rsquo; rights, the EU and the UK issued a joint technical note, which indicates areas of convergence between the EU and the UK and areas where further discussion is required to deepen understanding. The document indicates that there is a good level of convergence between the EU and the UK on the rights of current family members. However, the rights of future family members is one of the areas where further discussion will be required to deepen understanding. </p><p>Discussions on citizens&rsquo; rights will resume during the fourth round of negotiations, which will take place in the week commencing 25 September.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-09-21a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092100044#WRB00700"><p>Dealing with long-outstanding issues relating to the legacy of the conflict in Northern Ireland are of the utmost importance to the Government. The Programme for a Partnership Government makes specific reference to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the establishment of the legacy framework provided for under the Stormont House Agreement, with the needs of victims and survivors at the core of the approach. These legacy institutions include the Historical Investigations Unit (HIU), an independent body with police powers that will conduct investigations into outstanding criminal cases from the Troubles. One of the issues that has delayed agreement on the establishment of the HIU has been the question of balancing the right of families to access information with the national security onward disclosure considerations sought by the British Government.In the most recent discussions at Stormont Castle, the Government has underlined to the British Government and all political parties, the urgent need for compromise so that there can be a collective move forward to establish an Article 2-compliant HIU and the other legacy bodies of the Stormont House Agreement.</p><p>In the absence of definitive progress with the Stormont House framework, victims and survivors of the Troubles across all communities in Northern Ireland continue to seek effective investigations &ndash; often after decades. The Government shares the deep disappointment and frustration of victims and survivors at this unacceptable and continuing wait for access to truth and justice.</p><p>At present, many families of victims have no other avenue but to seek relief from the courts, across the range of issues relevant to the conduct of an effective investigation, including disclosure of information. Victims&rsquo; families have to seek the vindication of their basic Article 2 right to an effective investigation under the European Convention on Human Rights, through arduous and unsuitable court processes.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his Department monitor the outcome of relevant cases in the Northern Ireland courts, and raise concerns with the British Government where necessary. I would note that judgments have been given on aspects of some current cases, but these remain substantively before the courts for further determination and the Government therefore does not propose to comment specifically on the details of cases.</p><p>In overall terms, the Government shares the concerns expressed by senior members of the Northern Ireland judiciary regarding the unsuitability of the current system for dealing with long-outstanding cases from the Troubles and at the hurdles that are experienced in seeking disclosure from relevant authorities.</p><p>On 5 September, in his speech at the opening of the new legal year, the Lord Chief Justice of Northern reiterated his disappointment at the lack of progress on dealing with legacy issues and his frustration that he has not yet received a response to his proposals for dealing with the backlog of legacy inquests.</p><p>The Government supports the proposals of the Lord Chief Justice. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has emphasised in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties, the need to ensure that legacy inquests are properly resourced. The Government has urged all with responsibilities in relation to the legacy inquests to move forward as quickly as possible to implement the proposals of the Lord Chief Justice.</p><p>At the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, the Government participates proactively in monitoring the implementation by the UK of judgments by the European Court of Human Rights which relate to the effective investigation of cases from the Troubles. Ireland made a national statement yesterday at the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers during a debate on the <i>McKerr group</i>of cases, which set out the Government&rsquo;s view on the need to urgently progress with the establishment of the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework and the adequate resourcing of legacy inquests in Northern Ireland, consistent with the UK&rsquo;s obligations under the European Convention of Human Rights. In this context, the Committee&rsquo;s attention was drawn to recent judicial statements in Northern Ireland.</p><p>The Government will continue to engage with the British Government and the political parties to seek an urgent move forward on legacy issues, to establish the Stormont House legacy framework in a manner that will provide for Article 2 compliant investigations of all outstanding cases regardless of the perpetrator, meet the other legitimate needs and expectations of victims and survivors, and contribute to broader societal reconciliation and normalisation as an integral part of the Peace Process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-09-21a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092100044#WRB01100"><p>I strongly condemn all human rights violations and abuses against refugees and migrants, both in Libya and along the Central Mediterranean Route. I am aware of reports of appalling conditions currently faced by migrants and refugees in Libya. The security situation in Libya is fragile, which exacerbates the situation for migrants on the ground. The government has only partial control of the territory, which limits the capacity of the international community to ensure accountability for these alleged abuses.   Migration issues are principally discussed at the Justice and Home Affairs Council. However, EU efforts to address the external aspects of migration were discussed at the June 2017 Foreign Affairs Council. At that meeting, Ireland expressed deep concern at the conditions experienced by migrants in detention centres in Libya, and emphasised the importance of addressing the root causes and humanitarian aspects of the migration crisis. EU Foreign Ministers adopted Council Conclusions on Libya in July 2017, which urge the Libyan authorities to improve humanitarian access to and conditions in migrant detention centres, as well as to look for alternatives to detention.</p>  <p>  The EU has a number of initiatives which provide assistance and protection to migrants, refugees and host communities in Libya, in particular inside detention centres. The EU also provides training (including in international humanitarian law, human rights and gender issues) and other support to enhance the border management capacities of the Libyan authorities. The EU also supports the work of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), to ensure that there are adequate reception facilities for migrants. The EU has mobilised &euro;162 million on migration-related projects for Libya under the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF) and a further &euro;20 million from other budget lines. These programmes are being implemented by a number of partners, including international agencies such as the UNHCR and UNICEF.</p>  <p>  A step-change in improving the situation of migrants in Libya requires political stability and a return of security, through the formation of a functioning government and a return to order throughout the country. Through the EU, Ireland both supports UN mediation and regional efforts in pursuit of stabilisation in Libya.</p>  <p>  The only long-term solution to the migration crisis is to improve conditions in countries of transit and origin. The fight to reduce poverty, which is one of the main drivers of large irregular migratory flows, remains firmly at the core of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme, which has a focus on ending extreme poverty, hunger and under-nutrition.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-09-21a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092100044#WRB01500"><p>As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade with special responsibility for Brexit, Minister Coveney is involved in  coordinating the whole-of-Government response to the significant challenges that arise for Ireland within the context of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union, including for many of our economic sectors and regions. In this capacity, he is working closely with his colleagues across Government who have policy responsibility in the areas that will need to be addressed in order to assist these sectors and regions in dealing with the many challenges resulting from Brexit. This co-operation also involves the relevant State Agencies   Ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are reflected in the EU&rsquo;s approach to the ongoing EU-UK negotiations is a central dimension of Ireland&rsquo;s strategic response to Brexit. In this regard, our overriding objective in this regard is to work with our EU27 partners to achieve the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK.  The closer we come to this objective, the less the negative consequences for Ireland and for specific sectors.</p>  <p>  We are also mindful of the milestones we must achieve in the immediate term in order to ensure the best outcome for Ireland, notably in ensuring that sufficient progress is made on those withdrawal issues, including in regard to Ireland&rsquo;s specific issues,  that are a priority in order to achieve an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU. We also continue to underline to both our EU and UK counterparts that a transition phase, supported by adequate governance arrangements, will be required to minimise the disruption of trade and to avoid a cliff edge scenario. Equally important will be to ensure a level playing field in any future EU-UK agreement and to ensure the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union. This is also in Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental economic interest.</p>  <p>  Beyond the negotiating process, the Government&rsquo;s overall response to Brexit will continue to be structured around five principal pillars:</p>  <p>  sustainable fiscal policies to ensure capacity to absorb and respond to economic shocks, not least from Brexit;</p>  <p>  policies to make Irish enterprise more diverse and resilient, to diversify trade and investment patterns, and to strengthen competitiveness;</p>  <p>  prioritising policy measures and dedicating resources to protect jobs and businesses in the sectors and regions most affected by Brexit;</p>  <p>  realising economic opportunities arising from Brexit, and helping businesses adjust to any new logistical or trade barriers arising;</p>  <p>  making a strong case at EU level that Ireland will require support that recognises where Brexit represents a serious disturbance to the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  Policy decisions in support of these objectives will arise across a wide range of policy areas and that will continue to fall within the direct responsibility of other Government colleagues, including the annual budgetary process; the forthcoming National Planning Framework 2040; the new 10-year National Capital Plan; the Review of Enterprise 2025 Policy, and sectorial policies and investment decisions in areas such as agriculture, enterprise, transport, communications and energy.</p>  <p>  In this regard, while many challenges are common to the State as a whole, it is appreciated that there are specific issues for some individual regions, including Wexford given its important sea connections with France and Wales, and for individual sectors.  As required, both our policy approach to the EU-UK and our domestic policy response will take account of and try to address these issues.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade with special responsibility for Brexit, Minister Coveney is also stepping up the overall strategic oversight of Brexit-related measures being implemented across Government. This will involve building upon the extensive cross-Government research, analysis and consultation with stakeholders that has already been undertaken and ensuring a coordinated approach that facilitates the early identification of potential synergies across Government. New interdepartmental coordination mechanisms are currently being put in place to reflect the enhanced responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in this regard. </p>  <p>  Minister Coveney and I will also be continuing the Government&rsquo;s intensive programme of engagement with EU partners and with the UK, with a view to ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s priorities and concerns with regard to the EU-UK negotiations are fully understood. This engagement, together with the Government&rsquo;s engagement with other international partners, are also aimed at supporting our trade diversification efforts and our efforts to realise the economic opportunities arising from Brexit. </p>  <p>  Engagement with stakeholders on the ground in Ireland will also be a key priority and Minister Coveney has already convened a new Brexit Stakeholder Forum, which met for the first time on 13 September. This brings together the voices of business, unions, state agencies, political parties and leading experts who have an important contribution to make in helping to shape the Government&rsquo;s response to Brexit, both in terms of the EU-UK negotiations and the Government&rsquo;s economic response. He is also convening the third plenary session of the All-Island Civic Dialogue on 28 September.</p></reply>

The war has entered into its third year, efforts to broker peace have not made any significant progress and fighting continues with increasingly devastating consequences for the civilian population. In addition, the country is on the brink of famine and suffering a major cholera outbreak. My predecessor, Minister Flanagan, raised concerns about the appalling humanitarian situation in Yemen, and about attacks which have directly impacted on civilians, with the Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr Nizar bin Obaid Madani, when he visited the Gulf in November 2016. Following this, he also raised these concerns with the UAE Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, both in the UAE and more recently here in Dublin. I can assure the House that I will continue to take every appropriate opportunity to raise these concerns in the future.    Ireland has close economic ties with Saudi Arabia, and this relationship has considerable benefits for the Irish economy. Bilateral trade was worth almost &euro;2 billion in 2015. However, this partnership does not prevent us from raising our concerns in the appropriate channels. In addition to concerns about the humanitarian situation in Yemen, Ireland regularly raises broader human rights concerns with Saudi interlocutors.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s long standing policy of military neutrality, which has been pursued by successive Governments and enjoys widespread public support, is characterised by non-participation in military alliances. This policy is underpinned by a set of complementary values which include: the protection of human rights, support for development, and the promotion of disarmament &ndash; values which Ireland champions and promotes in its interactions with its international partners irrespective of any trading relationships.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s support for the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed and his team, who continue to work towards a peace agreement that is acceptable to all parties to the conflict in Yemen. Ireland will also continue to call for all alleged violations of human rights and international humanitarian law to be investigated, and for those found guilty of violations to be held accountable.</p></reply>

This approach has yielded clear results in ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns have been fully understood by our EU27 partners and have been reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position.  As the negotiations enter an important phase over the coming weeks and months, continuing such engagement with EU partners, both at political and official level, will remain a key priority.   On Monday 4 September, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade met with Michel Barnier, the EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator on Brexit, and his team.  During our discussion, Minister Coveney thanked Mr. Barnier for pursuing Ireland&rsquo;s unique interests in the Brexit negotiations and for the high level of engagement that Ireland enjoys with his team.  It was agreed that, while good progress was made in the last round of negotiations on the Common Travel Area, more detailed work is required on protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the peace process, including in regard to North South cooperation and to avoiding a hard border, as well as other issues such as protecting the EU rights of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland.  Overall, Minister Coveney welcomed the indications that EU and UK objectives on the Irish issues are converging but noted that the UK needs to back this up with tangible commitments that can pave the way for practical solutions.  </p>  <p>  Following this meeting, on 7 September, the European Commission Taskforce published a paper on &ldquo;Guiding Principles for the Dialogue on Ireland/Northern Ireland&rdquo;, building on the European Council Guidelines agreed earlier this year.  This paper reflects the priority Irish issues identified by the Government, including the complex issue of the border, and makes it clear that it is the UK&rsquo;s responsibility to propose workable solutions in this regard.  It is the Government&rsquo;s view that the UK staying in the customs union and single market, or as close as possible to that, would be the best solution.</p>  <p>  In all of our engagements, the Government has laid particular emphasis on Ireland&rsquo;s objective of protecting the gains of the peace process and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  The Government has been clear on the unique nature of the circumstances on the island of Ireland and this point has been echoed by Mr Barnier.  We are acutely aware of the potential impact of Brexit on the border region and on people living there.  In emphasising the need for imaginative and flexible political solutions for the island of Ireland, the Government has been equally clear that we will only pursue solutions that are compatible with our aim of protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.  Minister Coveney and I will continue to deliver this message in our engagements in the coming weeks and months.  </p>  <p>  With respect to the creation of a special economic zone, as Minister Coveney has previously indicated to Deputy Martin, the Government is open to careful consideration of any approach or proposal that makes sense for progressing such a fundamental matter as the future of relations between Ireland and the UK.  Apart from the UK, Ireland is the country most vulnerable to the effects of Brexit and it is everyone&rsquo;s interests that we maintain an openness to new ideas and proposals.  </p>  <p>  In relation to specific provision for Brexit in the budget for 2018, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is currently engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the 2018 estimates process.  The 2018 allocation will be announced by the Finance Minister on budget day.</p></reply>

As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is determined to ensure that all aspects of the Agreement are fully respected throughout the process of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union, and thereafter.  </p>  <p>  Our EU partners are fully aware and supportive of the importance of respecting the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and protecting the gains of the peace process.   On Monday 4 September, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade met with Michel Barnier, the EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator on Brexit, and his team.

The Government has been clear on the unique nature of the circumstances on the island of Ireland and this point has been echoed by Mr. Barnier. </p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to minimising the impact of Brexit on trade and the economy.  While imaginative and flexible solutions will be required to address the complex issues associated with the border, the Government is clear that we will only pursue solutions that are compatible with our aim of protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.  Our membership of the EU, including the Single Market and Customs Union, has been central to the success of our open, competitive economy and has been the foundation for much of the economic and social progress we have made over the last four decades.  Ireland will continue to work with our EU partners as a fully committed member of the European Union.</p>  <p>  The Government has also been clear in its desire to maintain the closest possible trading relationship with the UK after it leaves the EU.  Questions regarding the future relationship between the EU and the UK are a matter for the second phase of negotiations, and discussions on these can only begin once sufficient progress has been made on the three baskets of issues identified for the first phase of the EU-UK negotiations.  </p>  <p>  We are not under any illusions about the complexity of the UK exit from the EU.  We have taken important steps to prepare our economy, through Budget 2017, the Action Plan for Jobs 2017 and our Trade and Investment Strategy.  More work is being carried out in this area.  Our enterprise agencies continue to work with companies to help them deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying their market exposure and up-skilling their teams.  </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to be proactive in its objectives to minimise the impact on the island of Ireland of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.</p></reply>

We are committed to combatting child sex abuse in every way possible. In terms of passports, all applications are subject to the terms of the Passports Act, 2008 (&ldquo;the Act&rdquo;), which provides a legal basis for the various policies and practices which are applied by the Passport Service in the issue of passports.  Irish citizens are entitled to be issued with a passport, subject to the requirements of the Act.There is provision in the Act to refuse a person a passport.The most common grounds for this course of action would be in cases where </p><p>the person&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship has not been demonstrated; or</p><p>the person&rsquo;s identity has not been satisfactorily established; or</p><p>in circumstances including where the Minister is notified by the Courts Service of a court order requiring a person to surrender his or her passport and to refrain from applying from a passport;</p><p>the passport application is fraudulent or misleading;</p><p>in the case of children the consent for the issue of a passport by the legal guardians has not been provided.</p><p>The Act requires the Minister to write to the person, who is being refused a passport, and cite the reason(s) for passport refusal.The Minister is obliged to offer a period of time to the person to make any representations and/or provide additional information that may be relevant to the proposed course of action.These requirements are important as they protect the right of Irish citizens (including those who in the past have been convicted of criminal offences and who have fully served the custodial sentences) to obtain and hold a passport for travel, subject to the requirements of the Act. </p><p>In addition to the reasons above, there are other possible grounds for passport refusal.In general, these relate to the likelihood, after consultation with the Minister for Justice and/or the Minister for Defence, of a person engaging in conduct that:</p><p>might prejudice national security or the security of another state</p><p>might endanger public safety or order, </p><p>would be contrary to the common good or </p><p>might endanger that person or others  </p><p>These provisions have been used in a limited number of cases to refuse a passport, usually in the context of terrorist sanctions or in cases involving mental illness.</p><p>Any refusal to issue a passport must be evidence-based and defensible in the case of legal challenge.</p><p>The Passport Services does not have any statutory power to impose or monitor travel restrictions on a passport holder.  Nor is it possible to issue a passport with a restriction limiting its use for travel to certain specified States only.</p></reply>

Improved maternal and reproductive health, including access to contraception, is an important focus of our aid programme and is critical to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.There is an important link between Ireland's support for improved maternal and reproductive health in developing countries and improved education outcomes for girls, also an important priority of Ireland's aid programme. </p><p>The UNFPA is one of Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding UN partners, and the agency&rsquo;s work is closely aligned with many of the priority areas identified in Ireland&rsquo;s Policy for International Development &lsquo;<i>One World, One Future</i>&rsquo;.  Ireland values the partnership with the UNFPA. We provide significant core funding to the agency, which amounted to &euro;2.8 million both this year and last. Core funding allows UNFPA to respond to the most important needs as they arise. In addition to core funding, we provide funding in our partner countries for specific programmes to improve maternal and reproductive health. This amounted to over &euro;1.5 million in 2016.My officials attended the UNFPA Executive Board meeting in New York earlier this month, and we will be considering our indicative budget for 2018 shortly.</p></reply>

Officials from my Department recently discussed this issue with the Hong Kong authorities in a meeting on Friday 8 September. Ireland, together with our EU partners, remains convinced that the principle of 'one country, two systems' continues to work to the benefit of the people of Hong Kong, the People's Republic of China and the world. Hong Kong's success is underpinned by its high degree of autonomy, rule of law, independent judiciary, democratic separation of powers, and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms.    The EU publishes an annual report on developments in Hong Kong and regularly discusses such issues with the Hong Kong authorities, notably during the annual structured dialogue. The EU&rsquo;s most recent annual report, published in April 2017, highlighted that all necessary steps should be taken to restore faith in Hong Kong&rsquo;s rule of law and the &lsquo;one country, two systems&rsquo; principle. </p>  <p>  Respect for the Basic Law and the &lsquo;one country, two systems&rsquo; principle also forms an integral part of the EU&rsquo;s engagement with the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, as outlined in the EU Strategy on China adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council in July 2016.</p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Beijing and the Consulate General of Ireland in Hong Kong, in cooperation with our EU partners, will continue to monitor developments in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

Together with my colleague the Minister for European Affairs, I propose to lead a process of public engagement in the coming months on the issues raised. Our extensive analysis of the consequences of Brexit came to an unequivocal conclusion that our future interests are best served by remaining a fully committed member of the European Union.  It is imperative, therefore, that we use our influence to shape the future direction of the European Union and each Member State, Ireland included, will be bringing its own contributions to the debate.  In taking forward this debate, our focus will be on delivering a positive EU agenda with concrete outcomes that directly benefit EU citizens.</p></reply>

The war has entered into its third year, the country is on the brink of famine, the political process has stalled, and fighting is continuing, with increasingly devastating consequences for the civilian population.  EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Yemen at the Foreign Affairs Council in April, where they adopted Council Conclusions expressing concern for the situation in Yemen and calling on the parties to start negotiating a peace agreement. Ireland will continue to support the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed and his team in their work towards a peace agreement that is acceptable to all parties to the conflict.   This conflict has been characterised by allegations of violations of human rights, including rights of the child, and infringements of international humanitarian law.  Ireland has been consistent in calling for an impartial, international investigation into these reports.  Unfortunately, consensus at an international level to launch such an investigation has not yet been possible. </p>  <p>  Ireland is currently leading calls at the UN Human Rights Council to establish an Independent Commission of Inquiry to investigate all alleged human rights violations by any party to the conflict in Yemen.

I am aware of reports of appalling conditions currently faced by migrants and refugees in Libya. The security situation in Libya is fragile, which exacerbates the situation for migrants on the ground. The government has only partial control of the territory, which limits the capacity of the international community to ensure accountability for these alleged abuses.   Migration issues are principally discussed at the Justice and Home Affairs Council. However, EU efforts to address the external aspects of migration were discussed at the June 2017 Foreign Affairs Council. At that meeting, Ireland expressed deep concern at the conditions experienced by migrants in detention centres in Libya, and emphasised the importance of addressing the root causes and humanitarian aspects of the migration crisis. EU Foreign Ministers adopted Council Conclusions on Libya in July 2017, which urge the Libyan authorities to improve humanitarian access to and conditions in migrant detention centres, as well as to look for alternatives to detention.</p>  <p>  The EU has a number of initiatives which provide assistance and protection to migrants, refugees and host communities in Libya, in particular inside detention centres. The EU also provides training (including in international humanitarian law, human rights and gender issues) and other support to enhance the border management capacities of the Libyan authorities. The EU also supports the work of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), to ensure that there are adequate reception facilities for migrants. The EU has mobilised &euro;162 million on migration-related projects for Libya under the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF) and a further &euro;20 million from other budget lines. These programmes are being implemented by a number of partners, including international agencies such as the UNHCR and UNICEF.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality has informed me that Ireland does not hand over or send back migrants to Libya, and they are not aware of any other EU Member States doing so.</p>  <p>  A step-change in improving the situation of migrants in Libya requires political stability and a return of security, through the formation of a functioning government and a return to order throughout the country. Through the EU, Ireland both supports UN mediation and regional efforts in pursuit of stabilisation in Libya.</p>  <p>  The only long-term solution to the migration crisis is to improve conditions in countries of transit and origin. The fight to reduce poverty, which is one of the main drivers of large irregular migratory flows, remains firmly at the core of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme, which has a focus on ending extreme poverty, hunger and under-nutrition.</p></reply>

However, only a small further transfer took place, and for over twenty years now Israel has resisted all suggestions of further transfers. Areas A and B, where the majority of Palestinians live, are islands of Palestinian administrative control surrounded and separated by Area C, which still includes some two-thirds of the West Bank. The future of Area C is therefore in a very real sense the future of the peace process itself. There can be no viable Palestinian state without Area C, and in practical terms it is the hinterland and developmental space for all the Palestinian cities and towns. Large areas of Area C have been taken by Israeli settlements, and Palestinians are excluded from most of Area C by various means including military zones and parks of various sorts. Israeli authorities refuse almost all planning permission to Palestinians in Area C, for houses or other structures, demolishing those that are built, while facilitating the construction of Israeli settler houses. Recent legislative and administrative moves have been described as &lsquo;creeping annexation&rsquo;, and are not consistent with an intention of ultimately ending the occupation of Area C. The Government is deeply concerned about this.   It is for these reasons that the Government in recent years has made the future of Area C, and the associated policies of land seizures, demolitions and evictions, and movement restrictions, the heart of our engagement on the Middle East issue. Area C is Palestinian territory, the construction of Israeli settlements in it is a breach of international law, and the occupation should be ended and the area transferred to Palestinian control as early as possible. I and my officials take every opportunity to raise this at EU, UN and international level. We shall continue to do so. </p>  <p>  I have also raised these issues in my engagement with the region, including on my recent visit to Israel and Palestine, where I raised our concerns with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. </p></reply>

Following the UK&rsquo;s vote to leave the EU, the need to accelerate and implement competitiveness, innovation and market diversification strategies at a national and company level cannot be underestimated.  My Department and Agencies have been at the forefront of providing information and advice to the business sector and in promoting and devising supports to that sector.</p><p>My Department has been working with the Department of Finance, Enterprise Ireland, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and the Department of Agriculture to develop potential supports to respond to the needs of businesses impacted by Brexit.  In particular, work is progressing on the development of a proposed Brexit related Working Capital Guarantee Scheme and also scoping out the need for a longer term Business Development Loan Scheme which would assist firms in investing for a post-Brexit environment.  Development of these proposed responses is subject to resources being agreed as part of the annual budgetary process.</p><p>In March 2017, Enterprise Ireland launched a &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo;, a new interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars. Based on answers supplied by the user, the Scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions and resources, and information on events for companies to attend, to prepare for Brexit. To date approximately 1,500 companies have utilised the Brexit SME Scorecard.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; provides client companies with the cost of preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit. This grant support, of up to &euro;5,000, can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and out of pocket expenses associated with researching the direction of their Brexit action plan. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s 2017-2020 <i>Build Scale and Expand Reach</i>Strategy and its new Eurozone Strategy to assist Irish exporters increase exports in Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020 is a medium term strategy particularly aimed at strengthening clients export offer and finding new export opportunities.  Enterprise Ireland is proactively engaging with client companies on Brexit issues and is working with its Brexit exposed clients on a one-on-one basis.  </p><p>At local level, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are hosting information events around the country for clients and other businesses impacted by Brexit. The objective of these sessions is to enable companies learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit, and to engage in a process of planning to ensure their companies have a robust strategy in place.</p><p>A key element of the range of LEO Brexit responses is a Lean4Micro programme, which was designed to encourage clients to adopt &ldquo;Lean&rdquo; business principles in their organisation to increase performance and competitiveness. </p><p>In addition to the LEO priming and business development grants, the LEOs are now offering two new funding programmes to assist micro-enterprises affected by Brexit.  The Technical Assistance for Micro-exporters (TAME) grant is designed to help LEO clients to find new markets and exports by part-funding expenditure incurred investigating and researching export markets, e.g. exhibiting at Trade Fairs, preparing marketing material and developing websites specifically targeting export markets.  The LEO Innovation and Investment Fund (LIIF) programme is a new scheme to support innovation in micro-enterprises and get them investor ready to scale their businesses.</p></reply>

Much will depend on the nature of the future trade deal that will be negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations are proving particularly complex and multifaceted.  </p>  <p>  Promoting diversified export markets in light of the potential impacts of Brexit is a key priority for my Department.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.  Overall, export growth in Ireland in recent years has been exceptionally strong and exports continue to contribute positively to growth.  Since 2009, the value of exports from Ireland has risen by over 60%.</p>  <p>  There is a whole-of-Government approach in place focusing on Brexit issues and my Department and its agencies are to the forefront of this effort.  In March of this year, the Government published a new Trade Strategy, Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World which supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification.  Promoting diversified export markets in light of the potential impacts of Brexit is a key priority for my Department.  This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth.  The programme of trade missions and trade events for 2017 includes a substantive focus on the EU and third country markets.  In 2017, we have 42 Minister led trade missions to existing and emerging markets.  These have been orientated to reflect an increased focus on EU markets.  Enterprise Ireland is also consistently working with client companies focussing on enhancing their competitiveness, capability and levels of innovation to assist them to diversify into new markets.  </p>  <p>  Later this month I will be leading a Trade and Investment Mission to Japan which will intensify Ireland&rsquo;s efforts in further developing the economic and trade links between Ireland and Japan, at this time of enhanced economic partnership.  This mission will reinforce the potential for Irish companies in the Japanese market and provide a platform for accelerated export growth and investment opportunities.</p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s suite of Free Trade Agreements with third Countries help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish firms.  These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.  In this regard Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements giving Irish Firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries.</p></reply>

Overall, export growth in Ireland in recent years has been exceptionally strong and exports continue to contribute positively to growth. </p>  <p>The EU&rsquo;s suite of Free Trade Agreements with third Countries help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish firms.  The EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) which will be provisionally applied on the 21st   September covers virtually every aspect of economic activity.  It will remove over 99% of tariffs and will create sizeable new market access opportunities in services and investment in many sectors for Irish firms.  </p>  <p>  Irish firms will be able to bid for Canadian public contracts at the federal and sub-federal level.  They will benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, thus saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.  CETA provides significant opportunities for the Irish dairy industry and has strong protections for our beef industry through restricted quotas for Canadian beef entering the EU.  There are a wide range of sectorial opportunities for Irish firms in Canada, including financial software, telecoms, digital media, agricultural machinery and life-sciences and medical devices.  The provisional application of CETA will ensure that Irish firms can immediately benefit from the Agreement and in turn generate jobs and growth for Ireland.</p>  <p>  On the 6th July 2017 the EU and Japan announced that they had reached political agreement on the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement.  The agreement between the European Union and Japan will be the most important bilateral trade agreement concluded by the European Union.  This trade deal has the potential to generate significant benefits for Ireland.  Later this month I will be leading a Trade and Investment Mission to Japan which will intensify Ireland&rsquo;s efforts in further developing the economic and trade links between Ireland and Japan, at this time of enhanced economic partnership.  This mission will reinforce the potential for Irish companies in the Japanese market and provide a platform for accelerated export growth and investment opportunities.</p>  <p>  On 13th September 2017, following the State of the Union address by President Juncker, the Commission punished its proposals for mandates seeking authorisation to open negotiations for Free Trade Agreements with both Australia and New Zealand.  </p>  <p>  However, the global trading environment is uncertain, particularly in light of Brexit and an increase in protectionist sentiment.  The EU&rsquo;s suite of Free Trade Agreements coupled with our programme of trade and investment missions have provided a key foundation on which to further build our strong economic and trading links in export markets and these will continue into the future.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements giving Irish Firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries.  To this end, I have also commissioned a major examination of the economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland arising from EU Free Trade Agreements including CETA.  This study is expected to commence in October 2017.</p></reply>

Provisional application is a standard part of EU trade agreements and allows only those parts of the agreement for which the EU has competence to be provisionally applied, pending the completion of each Member State&rsquo;s procedures according to the requirements of their national law. </p>  <p>  The EU and Canada have agreed that CETA will provisionally apply from the 21st September 2017.  This means Irish companies may immediately take advantage of the provisions of CETA including the elimination of tariffs on almost all of key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, easing regulatory barriers and more transparent rules for market access.  The provisions relating to investment protection, investor-state dispute settlement and the Investment Court System are excluded from provisional application.  This means Ireland or other Member States will not be bound by these provisions until they are ratified by all Member States in accordance with their national law.  Before CETA comes fully into force it would require the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  </p>  <p>  My Department is currently in the process of undertaking a comprehensive study which will examine in depth the economic impact of existing and forthcoming EU Free Trade Agreements including CETA.  The analysis from the study will inform the Department and relevant agencies in setting the policy framework required for Irish businesses to take full advantage of concluded trade agreements and preferential trade access, and to prepare for future opportunities.  The study will also identify the impact of free trade agreements at sectorial level, especially on employment and output.  The study is expected to commence in October 2017.  </p>  <p>  The final decision on the timing of the CETA ratification process will be made in due course, in the context of the results of the study and the Opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the EU-Singapore case.</p>  <p>  The means by which Ireland notifies the completion of its internal procedures is by way of a written letter, delivered in hardcopy, from the Permanent Representative of Ireland to the EU addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of the European Union.  </p>  <p>  Article 30.7.2 of CETA provides that the Agreement shall enter into force on the first of the second month following the date the EU and Canada exchange written notifications certifying that they have completed their respective internal requirements and procedures or on a date agreed by the EU and Canada.  Once all the Member States notify the General Secretariat of the EU that their internal procedures are complete, the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU may then submit a notification to Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development.</p>  <p>  I support the provisional application of CETA.  I believe that it is important to see the benefits of the Agreement taking effect so we can then have a fully informed, evidence based debate on the value of the Agreement to Ireland.</p></reply>

This aims, apart from cooperation on the multilateral trade system and trade in services and investment issues, to facilitate trade in industrial products between the EU and Australia by reducing technical barriers, including conformity assessment procedures.  EU and Australian leaders met on the 15th   November 2015 and agreed to commence work toward the launch of negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement.  </p>  <p>  Since 1999 the EU and New Zealand have a bilateral agreement for mutual recognition that aims to facilitate trade in industrial products between the EU and New Zealand by reducing technical barriers, including assessment procedures.  It covers medicine products and devices, telecommunication equipment, low voltage equipment, machinery and pressure equipment.  In 2003 a veterinary agreement entered into force aimed at facilitating trade in live animals and animal products while safeguarding public and animal health.  This was then updated in 2015.  </p>  <p>  The European Commission concluded preparatory talks with New Zealand on the 7th March 2017 and with Australia on the 6th April 2017 to assess whether the countries have similar interests for a formal trade deal to be feasible.  This scoping exercise defines the areas to be covered and the level of ambition of future free trade agreements. </p>  <p>  On 13th September 2017, following the State of the Union address by President Juncker, the Commission published its proposals for mandates seeking authorisation to open negotiations for Free Trade Agreements with both Australia and New Zealand.  In parallel, the Commission has finalised impact assessments of the potential impact of such trade deals. </p>  <p>  These impact assessments take into account new opportunities that such agreements could create for EU businesses, as well as taking into account EU agricultural sensitivities as provided for in the European Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;Trade Strategy for All 2015&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  The mandates authorisating the opening of negotiations with both Australia and New Zealand will require the approval of the Council and the European Parliament.  </p>  <p>The EU&rsquo;s suite of Free Trade Agreements with 3rd   Countries help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish firms.  These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be important for Ireland.

Following the UK&rsquo;s vote to leave the EU, the need to accelerate and implement competitiveness, innovation and market diversification strategies at a national and company level cannot be underestimated. This is at the crux of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s 2017-2020 <i>Build Scale and Expand Reach</i>strategy and its new Eurozone Strategy to assist Irish exporters increase exports in Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020.</p><p>The devaluation and volatility of sterling, and the uncertainty that has unfolded in the business environment since the UK vote to leave the EU cannot be underestimated. At the same time, Enterprise Ireland clients are challenged to prepare to operate in a yet unknown trading environment post Brexit &ndash; they must prepare for a hard Brexit.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s clients are actively utilising the agency&rsquo;s financial and non-financial supports to meet the innovation, competitiveness and market diversification challenges of Brexit as part of their strategic growth plans.</p><p>In March 2017, Enterprise Ireland launched a &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo;, a new interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars. Based on answers supplied by the user, the Scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions and resources, and information on events for companies to attend, to prepare for Brexit. To date approximately 1,500 companies have utilised the Brexit SME Scorecard.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Be Prepared Grant provides client companies with the cost of preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit. This grant support, of up to &euro;5,000, can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and out of pocket expenses associated with researching the direction of their Brexit action plan.</p><p>To date in excess of 40 companies have received approval for support under this initiative, and a strong pipeline of companies have applications undergoing review for approval. The number of applications at this early stage means that a county by county analysis is not particularly meaningful. Approximately 40% of applications are from the Dublin region and the rest from the other regions. Enterprise Ireland will continue to promote the Scorecard and the Be Prepare Grant to all counties and regions to ensure that the maximum number of clients are engaged in preparing for the impact of Brexit.</p></reply>

As it was a Maltese incorporated company, the  liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.</p>  <p>  The Supreme Court delivered its judgment on 25 May 2017 and overturned the previous decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal that the Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is liable in respect of third party motor insurance claims made against the policyholders of Setanta Insurance. The consequence of this is that the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) has been deemed responsible for the payment of such third party claims.</p>  <p>  As the judgment has been delivered, the process of making payments in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1964, as amended, has commenced. Payments can only be made out of the ICF, with the approval of the High Court and only if it appears to the High Court that it is unlikely that the claim can be met otherwise than from the ICF. If satisfied, the High Court can order payments out of the ICF up to 65% (or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser) due to relevant claimants. </p>  <p>  The Liquidator has informed the Department that, as of 31 August 2017, there are 1,576 active claims, of which 573 claimants have been paid compensation from the ICF subject to the 65%/&euro;825,000 limits. The Liquidator is currently working on the next batch of claims to be included in the next application to the High Court scheduled to be made in February 2018 in accordance with the legislation. </p>  <p>  Over and above the 65% ICF payment, it is expected that a proportion of the balance of money due to third party claimants will be met from the proceeds of the distribution of Setanta&rsquo;s assets on completion of the liquidation process. However, it is not possible to say definitively at this stage what proportion of the claims this will amount to. In this regard, a preliminary assessment was carried out by Towers Watson in 2014 who indicated that the Liquidator would not be in a position to meet more than 30% of claims out of the assets of the liquidation. The Liquidator has informed the Department that a new actuarial report is being commissioned and should be completed in Q4 2017.</p>  <p>  Before the Government can make a full assessment of any case for further payment of compensation to Setanta claimants, it will need to review the updated actuarial report on the available proceeds of the assets for distribution from the liquidation process. This will provide a clear indication of the extent of any shortfall (i.e. the difference between the full amount and the combined total of the 65% payment plus the Setanta distribution). </p>  <p>  Finally, there is a legal concern that any Government intervention could undermine the priority status of claimants in the liquidation. The Department is therefore seeking legal advice on the impact on the State's ability to recover from the liquidated company if it were to compensate third party claimants.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware the NAMA Act 2009 introduced Section 396C of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA 1997).  The purpose of the section was to restrict NAMA.</p>  <p>  Participating institutions in offsetting their losses against a maximum of 50% of their taxable profits in a given year. At the time, the Government had a limited role in the banking system. However, by the introduction of the second Finance Bill in 2013, this measure was considered to have outlasted its initial purpose. As the State then had substantial holdings in the banking sector, constituting 99.8% of AIB shares and 15% of Bank of Ireland shares, Section 396C TCA 1997 was deemed to be acting against the State&rsquo;s interests.</p>  <p>  Hence section 396C TCA 1997 was repealed to support the value of the banks' deferred tax assets and hence their capital ratios and by extension support the value of the State&rsquo;s banking investments.</p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that the provision to allow the carry-forward of tax losses for set-off against future trading profits is available not only for banks but for all Irish corporates. Accordingly, the removal of Section 396C TCA 1997 put the "covered banks" in the same position as other corporates including other banks operating in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Department does not have the information required to calculate the figure requested but I would note that the net impact on tax receipts is a timing measure largely and should not impact on the State&rsquo;s total Corporation Tax take over time. </p>  <p>  To recognise the part that the banks played in the financial crisis, in 2013, the Government also decided that the banking sector should make an annual contribution of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer for the period from 2014 to 2016.  In Budget 2016, the payment of this levy was extended until 2021.  The bank levy is expected to raise &euro;750 million over five years.</p></reply>

Following on from this, it was decided to retain the existing DIRT-based calculation methodology, but to update the base year and corresponding levy rate, in order to protect the &euro;150 million annual yield. Minister Noonan committed to the introduction of a rolling two-year series of base years which will introduce a new base year of 2017 for calculating the levy in 2019 and 2020, and a new base year of 2019 for calculating the levy in 2021. The levy rate may require updating when the base year changes to protect the &euro;150 million annual yield.  </p>  <p>  The current rate is 59% of the amount paid in DIRT by accounts within each institution in 2015. </p>  <p>  Doubling the current rate would give a rate of 118%. If everything else was held equal, a rate of 118% would give an approximate yield of &euro;300 million. </p>  <p>  The individual charge that would apply to each relevant bank would depend on the amount paid in DIRT by accounts within each institution in 2015.  The individual charge by bank is subject to the requirement to maintain taxpayer confidentiality.</p></reply>

This compares to Category A (passenger) vehicles which are charged at rates between 14% and 36% of their OMSP depending on the level of CO2 they emit. Motor homes also receive preferential treatment vis-&agrave;-vis Category A vehicles in relation to the application of annual motor tax.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of objectives of the Irish Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) system. VRT is an important source of revenue for the State.  It also seeks to reflect the negative externalities caused by using the vehicle in the State. These externalities are the costs to society and to the environment that, without the tax, would not otherwise be reflected in the price of the vehicle and for which the consumer would not otherwise have to pay.  </p>  <p>  In the case of motor vehicles, these include environment externalities such as air pollution, which is why one of the bases for imposing VRT is the vehicle's carbon emissions.  Other externalities which VRT seeks to reflect, include the costs to society of providing and maintaining the road infrastructure, traffic control, relevant emergency services, and vehicle registration and licensing.  The funds raised through VRT go towards compensating the Irish State for these significant costs.</p></reply>

Revenue had no input to the compilation of the &lsquo;Prescribed List&rsquo; and is obliged to disallow any claim to exemption where the property is not included in the list. </p>  <p>  The property in question is situated in a housing estate where some of the properties are on the &lsquo;Prescribed List&rsquo; and some are not. The owner in question filed an LPT return and claimed an exemption in 2013.  In 2015, as part of its compliance campaign, Revenue selected the claim for routine verification and subsequently withdrew the exemption, as the portion of the estate in which the individual&rsquo;s property is located is not included in the &lsquo;Prescribed List&rsquo;.  On that basis the property does not qualify for the exemption and the person is liable to pay LPT for all years since LPT was introduced in 2013.</p>  <p>  Revenue advised the person concerned of this situation in 2015 and on a number of occasions in the meantime and also made him aware of the various payment options (including phased arrangement) that are available to him.  In the absence of any suitable response from the individual, Revenue recently commenced collection of the LPT liability through Mandatory Deduction at Source (MDaS) from his salary.  If he now wishes to make an alternative payment arrangement he should contact the LPT Helpline at 1890 200 255.</p></reply>

The main purpose of this measurement is to identify the distance that families reside from their nearest school and to assess if they meet the distance eligibility criterion for school transport.</p>  <p>  In cases where distance eligibility is marginal or in dispute, vehicles fitted with calibrated measuring devices which measure the distance down to the nearest metre may be used to establish the exact distance.  </p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only.  Concessionary transport is subject to a number of terms and conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service and payment of the annual charge. Under the terms of the School Transport Schemes additional vehicles will not be introduced, nor will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for children travelling on a concessionary basis. </p>  <p>  Where the number of applications for transport on a concessionary basis exceeds the number of seats available, Bus &Eacute;ireann allocate these spare seats using a random selection process. Priority is given to existing concessionary applicants and their siblings provided they have paid the annual charge before the deadline date i.e. the last Friday in July.</p>  <p>  The terms of the School Transport Schemes are applied equitably on a national basis.</p>  <p>  I have asked Bus &Eacute;ireann to forward the specific details requested directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Apprenticeship is a demand driven alternance training programme and the allocation of provision is determined by the level of recruitment of apprentices by approved employers.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Apprenticeship Council was established in November 2014 to oversee the expansion of the apprenticeship system in Ireland into a range of new sectors of the economy. One of the Council&rsquo;s first tasks was to issue a call for proposals from industry and education providers for new apprenticeships.  Over 80 proposals were received from a wide range of sectors and occupations.   The Council has been working with consortia to develop their proposals into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.</p>  <p>  To date nine new apprenticeship programmes have been developed by the Apprenticeship Council following its first call for proposals, in Insurance Practice, Industrial Electrical Engineering, Polymer Processing Technology, Manufacturing Technology, Manufacturing Engineer, Accounting Technician, Commis Chef and two programmes in International Financial Services (Associate &amp;amp; Specialist). </p>  <p>  Further new apprenticeships are to be submitted for validation to Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) in September and, subject to successful validation, it is expected that a further six new schemes will get underway later this year in various sectors including ICT and Haulage.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year we published the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016&ndash;2020 which sets out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Action Plan for Education commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period. One of the key commitments set out in the plan for this year was the issuing of a second call for apprenticeship proposals to refresh the pipeline of proposals already established through the first call. The second call closed on the 1st September with 77 proposals received from a wide range of occupations.  The Council is currently assessing proposals received and will report its findings in November.</p></reply>

In this capacity, I am working closely with his colleagues across Government who have policy responsibility in the areas that will need to be addressed in order to assist these sectors and regions in dealing with the many challenges resulting from Brexit. This co-operation also involves the relevant State Agencies.   Ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are reflected in the EU&rsquo;s approach to the ongoing EU-UK negotiations is a central dimension of Ireland&rsquo;s strategic response to Brexit. In this regard, our overriding objective is to work with our EU27 partners to achieve the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK.  The closer we come to this objective, the less the negative consequences for Ireland and for specific sectors.</p>  <p>  Beyond the negotiations, the Government&rsquo;s overall response to Brexit will continue to be structured around five principal pillars:</p>  <p>  sustainable fiscal policies to ensure capacity to absorb and respond to economic shocks, not least from Brexit;</p>  <p>  policies to make Irish enterprise more diverse and resilient, to diversify trade and investment patterns, and to strengthen competitiveness;</p>  <p>  prioritising policy measures and dedicating resources to protect jobs and businesses in the sectors and regions most affected by Brexit;</p>  <p>  realising economic opportunities arising from Brexit, and helping businesses adjust to any new logistical or trade barriers arising;</p>  <p>  making a strong case at EU level that Ireland will require support that recognises where Brexit represents a serious disturbance to the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  Policy decisions in support of these objectives will arise across a wide range of policy areas and that will continue to fall within the direct responsibility of other Government colleagues, including the annual budgetary process; the forthcoming National Planning Framework 2040; the new 10-year National Capital Plan; the Review of Enterprise 2025 Policy, and sectorial policies and investment decisions in areas such as agriculture, enterprise, transport, communications and energy.</p>  <p>  The Government has already taken important steps in this regard, including in Budget 2017, the Action Plan for Jobs 2017, and our Trade and Investment Strategy.  Further discussions are taking place in the context of next month&rsquo;s Budget 2018. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade with special responsibility for Brexit, I will be stepping up the overall strategic oversight of these efforts across Government. This will involve building upon the extensive cross-Government research, analysis and consultation with stakeholders that has already been undertaken and ensuring a coordinated approach that facilitates the early identification of potential synergies across Government. New interdepartmental coordination mechanisms are currently being put in place to reflect the enhanced responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in this regard. </p>  <p>  I will also be continuing the Government&rsquo;s intensive programme of engagement with EU partners and with the UK, with a view to ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s priorities and concerns with regard to the EU-UK negotiations are fully understood. This engagement, together with the Government&rsquo;s engagement with other international partners, are also aimed at supporting our trade diversification efforts and our efforts to realise the economic opportunities arising from Brexit. </p>  <p>  Engagement with stakeholders on the ground in Ireland will also be a key priority and I have already convened a new Brexit Stakeholder Forum, which met for the first time on 13 September. This brings together the voices of business, unions, state agencies, political parties and leading experts who have an important contribution to make in helping to shape the Government&rsquo;s response to Brexit, both in terms of the EU-UK negotiations and the Government&rsquo;s economic response. I will also be convening the third plenary session of the All-Island Civic Dialogue on 28 September.</p></reply>

Protecting the gains of the Peace Process is one of the Government&rsquo;s priorities in the ongoing withdrawal negotiations, including the avoidance of a hard border. The avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland is a shared objective of the Irish and British Governments and our EU partners.  The EU negotiation guidelines contain a very strong acknowledgment of Ireland&rsquo;s unique circumstances, including the need to avoid a hard border.  The negotiating directives for the Task Force and the recent paper on Guiding Principles for the Dialogue on Ireland/Northern Ireland fully reflect this.</p>  <p>  On 4 September, I met Michel Barnier, the EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator on Brexit, and his team, our second meeting since my appointment.  During our discussion, I thanked Mr. Barnier for pursuing Ireland&rsquo;s unique interests in the negotiations and for the high level of engagement Ireland enjoys with his team.  We agreed that, while good progress was made in the last round of negotiations on the Common Travel Area, more detailed work is required on protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the peace process, including in avoiding a hard border.  I welcomed indications that EU and UK objectives on the Irish issues are converging but noted that the UK needs to back this up with tangible commitments that can pave the way for practical solutions.</p>  <p>  Flexible and imaginative solutions will be required to avoid a hard border, including any physical border infrastructure.  Ireland has made clear its expectation that there will need to be a political solution and not just a legal or technical one, given that this represents a unique and unprecedented set of circumstances.</p></reply>

Engagement with our EU partners has yielded clear results in ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns have been fully understood by the EU27 and have been reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position. As the negotiations enter an important phase over the coming weeks and months, continuing such engagement with EU partners, both at political and official level, will remain a key priority.   On Monday 4 September, I met with Michel Barnier, the EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator on Brexit, and his team. This was our second meeting since my appointment. It was a constructive meeting in which we discussed the evolution of the negotiations and the Irish specific issues, which are one of the three priority issues for phase one of the negotiations. While some progress is being made on these issues, most notably with regard to the Common Travel Area, much work is still required on protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including sustaining North South cooperation and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. The Government supports the Task Force&rsquo;s Guiding Principles on Ireland and Northern Ireland which reflects our priorities and sets out important principles that should form the basis of future solutions on the Irish specific issues as part of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. </p>  <p>  During my visit to Brussels earlier this month I also met with MEPs from across the political spectrum within the European Parliament, including with Guy Verhofstadt, the Parliament's Coordinator on Brexit, and with Irish MEPs. This provided a valuable opportunity to engage with them at the beginning of a new parliamentary term and to update them on Ireland&rsquo;s perspective on the negotiations. I am glad that Guy Verhofstadt is visiting Ireland today, as it is a further indication of the priority afforded by the European Parliament to Ireland&rsquo;s unique concerns within the context of Brexit. </p>  <p>  Since my appointment, I have also held bilateral meetings with a number of my EU colleagues, including my Estonian, Luxembourg, French, Slovak, Belgian and Spanish counterparts. I also welcomed the Finnish Foreign Minister to Ireland in July.  Earlier this month I had short meetings with my counterparts from Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Slovenia, as well as the Cypriot Minister for Defence, at the Gymnich/Informal Meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council.</p>  <p>  My officials also continue to meet their counterparts in other Member States, and of course the Permanent Representation in Brussels is also key to this work.</p>  <p>  In my meetings with EU partners to date, I have laid particular emphasis on Ireland&rsquo;s objective of protecting the gains of the peace process and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. I have been clear on the unique nature of the circumstances on the island of Ireland and this point has been echoed by Mr Barnier.  We are acutely aware of the potential impact of Brexit on the border region and on people living there.  In emphasising the need for imaginative and flexible political solutions for the island of Ireland, the Government has been equally clear that we will only pursue solutions that are compatible with our aim of protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.  I will continue to deliver this message in my engagements in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Engagement with the UK, in particular on Irish-specific issues, is also important. In this regard, I met the UK&rsquo;s Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, David Davis, in London on 6 July, the UK&rsquo;s Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson in the margins of the Foreign Affairs Council on 17 July, and more recently, with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, and the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, in Dublin on 22 and 31 August respectively.   In these meetings, I welcomed the publication of UK position papers on its exit from the Union, including the paper on Northern Ireland and Ireland, but stressed that the UK needs to back this up with tangible commitments that can pave the way for practical solutions. I emphasised that, while the Government maintains regular contact with the British Government, the serious issues involved can only be substantively considered and addressed through the ongoing EU-UK negotiations.</p></reply>

The international community&rsquo;s coordinated response can and is working. For example, following UN Secretary General Guterres&rsquo; February 2017 call to action to address the four famines threatening more than 20 million people across South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria and Yemen, the international community provided more than $2.4 billion in humanitarian support. The relief efforts, coordinated by OCHA (UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs), have saved lives and alleviated imminent famine &ndash; however, the severe threat remains.    The Irish Government is strongly committed to responding to the unprecedented humanitarian needs in the Horn of Africa. Today more than 22 million people are facing varying levels of food insecurity across the region - over 10 million people in Ethiopia, 6 million people in South Sudan, 3.2 million people in Somalia, and 3.2 million people in Kenya. The continued provision of timely humanitarian assistance to avert a catastrophe in the region is essential. Ireland, through the Irish Aid programme, has provided &euro;127 million in humanitarian assistance in the Horn region since 2012. We have provided &euro;23 million so far this year, and we continue to monitor the situation through our embassies on the ground and our humanitarian partners.  </p>  <p>  A priority for Ireland in responding to humanitarian crises, is ensuring that life-saving assistance reaches those most in need, as quickly as possible. Ireland supports the role of OCHA in coordinating the response to humanitarian crises, and provides them with core funding (&euro;2.9 million in 2017) to facilitate their operation.  Ireland also supports the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) which delivers funding quickly to humanitarian responders, including underfunded crises, aiming to ensure that competing demands do not mean crises are forgotten. In 2017, Ireland provided &euro;22 million to CERF making us the fifth largest donor this year.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to providing humanitarian assistance where it is needed most, working with partners who can ensure that such assistance is delivered in a coordinated and effective manner. However, we also recognise that humanitarian aid alone is not the answer. We will continue to focus our efforts on supporting the international system to find peaceful ends to conflict driving humanitarian need.</p></reply>

This approach, building on the work done by my predecessor,  has yielded clear results in ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns have been fully understood by our EU27 partners and have been reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position. As the negotiations enter an important phase over the coming weeks and months, continuing such engagement with EU partners, both at political and official level, will remain a key priority. In my meetings with EU partners to date, I have laid particular emphasis on Ireland&rsquo;s objective of protecting the gains of the peace process and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. I have strongly emphasised the need for an imaginative and flexible political solution. In so doing, I have been equally clear that we will only pursue solutions that are compatible with our aim of protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it. We have made clear to EU partners, to third countries, and to business and civil society, that Ireland&rsquo;s place is at the heart of the European Union. Moreover, the Irish people are strongly committed to EU membership as has been shown in numerous opinion polls over many years. It is imperative that we use our influence to shape the future direction of the European Union<font color="#004080">.</font>Each Member State, Ireland included, will be bringing its own contributions to the debate  . We will continue to work closely with partners to advance and defend Ireland's interests across the range of policy areas, including taxation.</p><p>We have undertaken extensive analysis of the consequences of Brexit and our unequivocal conclusion is that our future interests are best served by remaining a fully committed member of the European Union, notwithstanding the UK&rsquo;s departure. </p><p>I will continue to deliver this message in my engagements in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Ireland provides assistance through its Official Development Assistance (ODA) programme, Irish Aid. </p>  <p>   To effectively deliver services across a variety of contexts, we work with implementing partners such as national Governments, NGOs, and multilateral partners including the United Nations, and the European Union.</p>  <p>  Like other donor countries, Ireland participates in a system of peer reviews by the OECD. These reviews have commended our aid allocations to Sub-Saharan Africa and other areas of greatest need, and note that Ireland remains committed to delivering its programme according to international best practice. </p>  <p>  To ensure assistance reaches its intended beneficiaries, high standards of accountability are maintained.  Prior to funding, all requests are appraised against clear criteria that consider risk, results, and financial accountability.  Funding is regulated by agreements setting out the terms and conditions related to the funding award. Partners are subject to monitoring to ensure intended recipients are benefitting, results are being achieved, and resources are being used and accounted for in accordance with terms set out in the agreements. Partners must seek formal approval from Irish Aid prior to making adjustments to approved areas of activities or expenditure. Any breaches of the terms of agreements are addressed in accordance with Departmental policies and procedures.  Monitoring is undertaken by a combination of specialist staff, Embassy-based internal auditors, independent experts, and the independent Evaluation and Audit Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That Unit&rsquo;s work is regularly reviewed by the independent Audit Committee of this Department. In addition, the Comptroller and Auditor General provides independent assurance that Official Development Assistance is being provided in accordance with the law, is managed to good effect, and is properly accounted for. </p>  <p>The critical test is of course demonstrated results, which are reviewed quarterly and reported upon in the Irish Aid annual report. It is anticipated that the 2016 annual report will issue later this month.</p></reply>

This approach has yielded clear results in ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns have been fully understood by our EU27 partners and have been reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position.  Our EU partners are fully aware of and supportive of the importance of respecting the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and protecting the gains of the peace process.  On Monday 4 September, I met with Michel Barnier, the EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator on Brexit, and his team.  During our discussion, I thanked Mr. Barnier for pursuing Ireland&rsquo;s unique interests in the Brexit negotiations and for the high level of engagement that Ireland enjoys with his team.  We agreed that, while good progress was made in the last round of negotiations on the Common Travel Area, more detailed work is required on protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the peace process, including in regard to North South cooperation and to avoiding a hard border, as well as other issues such as protecting the EU rights of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland.  Overall, I welcomed the indications that EU and UK objectives on the Irish issues are converging but noted that the UK needs to back this up with tangible commitments that can pave the way for practical solutions.     Following this meeting, on 7 September, the European Commission Taskforce published a paper on &ldquo;Guiding Principles for the Dialogue on Ireland/Northern Ireland&rdquo;, building on the European Council Guidelines agreed earlier this year. This paper reflects the priority Irish issues identified by the Government, including the complex issue of the border, and makes it clear that it is the UK&rsquo;s responsibility to propose workable solutions in this regard.  </p>  <p>  In all of my engagements, I have laid particular emphasis on Ireland&rsquo;s objective of protecting the gains of the peace process and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.   I have been clear on the unique nature of the circumstances on the island of Ireland and this point has been echoed by Mr Barnier.  I am acutely aware of the potential impact of Brexit on the border region and on the people there.  In emphasising the need for imaginative and flexible political solutions for the island of Ireland, I have been equally clear that we will only pursue solutions that are compatible with our aim of protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.  I will continue to deliver this message in my engagements in the coming weeks and months.  </p>  <p>  The Good Friday Agreement itself is an international agreement conducted between the UK and Ireland which is registered with the UN.  Successive US Administrations have provided immensely valuable support to the peace process over the last three decades.  The Government look forward to continued engagement by the current US Administration in Northern Ireland, including that of the US State Department.</p></reply>

The EU&rsquo;s commitment to encourage progress was further underlined by the High Representative/Vice President Frederica Mogherini at various regional fora during the summer period, for example, the Dubrovnik Forum, South-East European Cooperation Process (SEECP) Summit and the Trieste Summit. All six candidate and potential candidate countries are advancing along their respective European paths. There has been real progress in the integration process, as illustrated in the outcomes of the Trieste Summit which include an initiative to develop a Regional Economic Area and the signature of a Transport Community Treaty for the region.</p><p>Serbia and Montenegro are furthest along in the accession process: Serbia is a highly influential player in the region, and, with ten out of the 35 chapters of the <i>acquis communautaire </i>already opened, is making good progress.Montenegro has 26 chapters open, and preparations to open the remaining chapters are well advanced. </p><p>A new Government has recently been formed in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which has been a candidate country since 2005. We hope that this will mark the end of an ongoing political crisis, which required intensive engagement by the EU over the last two years.  We also hope that the focus can now turn to the many reforms required to progress in the accession process. </p><p>It is expected that Albania will be the next country to formally open accession negotiations, having been granted candidate status in 2014. Albania has made considerable progress in its undertaking to address the &lsquo;Five Key Priorities&rsquo; on judicial reform and anti-corruption measures. </p><p>A potential candidate country,  Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted its formal application to join the EU in February 2016, and is currently in the process of completing a detailed questionnaire on all aspects of the <i>acquis</i>. The response to the questionnaire will  be assessed by the Commission before deciding whether candidate status can be granted.  </p><p>Kosovo is still at an early stage in numerous areas in terms of its EU path, although there has been some progress on the normalisation of relations with Serbia, including an agreement on infrastructure and the granting of an international dialling code for Kosovo  . </p><p>Ireland is a strong supporter of the accession process, viewing it as a transformative driver for stability, peace and democracy, and supports all efforts to enhance regional relationships and institutional reform.</p></reply>

This support includes loans, budget support, humanitarian aid, technical assistance and trade preferences. In addition, the EU is playing a key role in helping to reform the civilian security sector through its Advisory Mission to Ukraine. 1 September 2017 marked an important milestone in relations with Ukraine when the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement legally entered into force. The fully ratified Agreement will allow the EU to further strengthen its cooperation with Ukraine and to deepen the country&rsquo;s political association and economic integration with the Union. The provisional application of the trade part of the Agreement since last year has already seen a welcome increase of 25% in two way trade and this is expected to continue in the coming years.    The most recent EU-Ukraine Summit took place in Kyiv on 13 July and provided an opportunity to assess progress on the reforms, in particular the fight against corruption.   </p>  <p>  As regards the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, the EU continues to back efforts to secure implementation of the Minsk peace agreements within the framework of the OSCE Trilateral Contact Group (OSCE, Russia and Ukraine) and the Normandy Format (France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine). The Minsk agreements offer the only basis for a stable and lasting political resolution to the conflict in Ukraine and the European Union remains firmly committed to facilitating their full implementation.</p></reply>

At the most recent Eastern Partnership Summit in Riga in May 2015, the EU re-affirmed its determination to pursue closer relations with these six countries but also recognised the need for greater differentiation in the EU&rsquo;s engagement to take into consideration the particular interests and objectives of each partner country. Armenia has expressed a wish to negotiate a more tailored approach to its relations with the EU.  Negotiations on a new EU-Armenia Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement (CEPA) were concluded at the end of February 2017 and preparations for signature are underway. The new comprehensive agreement will provide a stable framework for the further development of bilateral relations.  The EU and Armenia have identified a series of Partnership Priorities across four key areas: strengthening institutions and good governance; economic development and market opportunities; connectivity, energy efficiency, environment and climate action; and mobility and people-to-people contacts.    The fifth Eastern Partnership Summit will take place in Brussels on 24 November 2017 and will be an opportunity for the EU to reaffirm its strong commitment to the Eastern Partnership initiative.</p></reply>

The brutal activities of these groups have resulted in thousands of deaths and the displacement of millions more. They also involve the clear and persistent abuse of human rights, especially of women and girls.    While it is difficult to identify the exact numbers of women and girls being held captive by Boko Haram, in recent months the Government of Nigeria has made substantial progress against the group. In 2014 over 200 girls known as the &lsquo;Chibok girls&rsquo; were kidnapped by Boko Haram in Borno State in the north-east of Nigeria. Varying numbers of girls have been released at different times, with the largest number freed in May 2017. However over 100 remain unaccounted for. </p>  <p>  Ireland, with our EU partners, has continued to support the Nigerian Government in its efforts, and reiterated the need for a regional approach to ensuring that those in captivity are released, and to prevent future occurrences. The EU has pledged up to &euro;50 million in support of the Multinational Joint Taskforce, which supports Nigeria and neighbouring countries promotion of regional security.</p>  <p>  The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), is tasked with supporting peacebuilding and state-building in the country. The EU contributes funding to the mission to reduce the threat posed by Al Shabab.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to monitor developments in relation to both Al Shabab and Boko Haram, and to work with the relevant Governments, regional authorities and other key partners to address the humanitarian crisis through diplomatic engagement and humanitarian funding. To date in 2017 Ireland has provided &euro;5.7 million in humanitarian assistance to Somalia, while &euro;5.2 million has been provided to Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region.</p></reply>

Since 2002, the United Nations Secretary-General has issued an annual report on children and armed conflict which lists all armed groups &ndash; both state and non-state &ndash; that recruit and use children. The most recent list, published in April 2016, includes groups operating in seven African countries.In 1999, the UN<b></b>Security Council passed its first Resolution (UNSCR 1261) highlighting the impact of armed conflict on children and condemning violations carried out in that context. Since then, the Security Council has developed important tools to strengthen child protection and to promote compliance with international standards.</p><p>The new Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict was appointed in May of this year. Ahead of the 20 year anniversary of Resolution UNSCR 1261 she has committed to raising public awareness, garnering lessons learned, and developing best practices to combat the recruitment and use of child soldiers.</p><p>Ireland has engaged on the issue of child soldiers in various ways including through the core work of our aid programme in addressing socio-economic factors, which are major root causes of this problem. Ireland has also actively supported more targeted and specific interventions including support to UNICEF as well as the International Criminal Court.

The excessive response by the security forces of Myanmar/Burma following these attacks is deeply troubling. It is critical that violence in Rakhine State be brought to an immediate end. It has led to a severe humanitarian crisis both within Myanmar, and across the border in Bangladesh, which is seeking to manage the humanitarian needs of well over 400,000 refugees. Ireland fully aligns with the statements made by EU High Representative Federica Mogherini on the 6 and 11 September, in which she called for humanitarian access to be restored and for the root causes of the issue to be addressed. During a European Parliament Debate on Myanmar on 14 September, she also criticised the excesses in the security operations carried out by the Myanmar security forces, and called for an end to the violence.    The EU is working to find a solution, both in its bilateral contacts with Myanmar and via its participation in international fora, including the UN General Assembly and Human Rights Council which are meeting this month in New York and Geneva. The EU has led a resolution on the human rights situation in Myanmar at the Human Rights Council on an annual basis, most recently in March 2017, in which it renewed the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Myanmar by another year. </p>  <p>  The EU has also raised its concerns directly with the Government of Myanmar. An EU delegation led by the EEAS raised this when it met with the Myanmar authorities in Naypyidaw in early September, and the EU Delegation in Yangon continues to do so on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  The situation in Rakhine State and the resulting humanitarian crisis has been highlighted by UN Secretary General Guterres and by High Commissioner Zeid on a number of occasions in recent weeks. The UN Security Council met on 13 September to discuss the issue. In a subsequent press briefing, the Security Council condemned the violence, welcomed the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s engagement with the Government of Myanmar and called for a long-term solution in the Rakhine State.</p>  <p>  In March this year, a Fact Finding Mission was established further to an EU-led resolution at the UN Human Rights Council to investigate allegations of human rights violations in Myanmar.  Ireland has called for an extension of the mandate of the Fact Finding Mission to enable it complete its work. Ireland has also consistently supported the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Ms. Yanghee Lee, who has been actively reporting on the situation in Rakhine State.</p></reply>

About 13.5 million Syrians are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria including 6.3 million internally displaced people, 1.5 million are living under siege conditions, and a further 5 million Syrian refugees have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.  Clearly, the situation at present is far from conducive to democracy; peace has to come first. The search for a resolution of the Syrian conflict is a top priority for Ireland and the international community.  The United Nations is leading the international efforts to bring about a peaceful, democratic solution to the crisis in Syria. The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura has convened political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254 which calls for an end to violence and the formation of a transitional governing body with executive powers and a constitutional reform process. Seven rounds of these talks have taken place, the most recent in July of this year. The eighth round of these talks is expected to take place in Geneva in October or November. Special Envoy De Mistura has also been attending the so-called Astana talks. These have been taking place in parallel to the Geneva talks and have focused on the establishment of ceasefire zones facilitated by Russia, Iran and Turkey. Ireland and the EU fully support the UN-led talks process and the work of Special Envoy De Mistura. At their April meeting, EU Foreign Ministers adopted a new EU Strategy for Syria which   reaffirms the EU&rsquo;s continued support for and direct assistance to the UN-brokered talks. This includes an EU-led initiative, in coordination with the UN, to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground for the end-state in Syria and the conditions for the reconciliation and reconstruction process. The EU will also host a conference on Syria in the margins of the UN General Assembly this week.</p>  <p>  Iraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. Provincial elections were held in 2013 and parliamentary elections in 2014. New parliamentary and provincial elections are due to be held next year. However, Iraq has continued to face a number of challenges, including security challenges, due to the presence of Da&rsquo;esh (ISIS/ISIL) in the country and ongoing sectarian violence. Ireland and its EU and international partners have consistently called for inclusive democratic measures in parallel with counter-terrorism and security measures to create the environment for long-term stability in Iraq and the wider region. In the Iraqi context, we have emphasised that the security effort must be accompanied by the implementation of the programme for national reconciliation set out by PM Abadi in late 2014 to avoid further sectarian divisions.</p>  <p>  In June, EU Foreign Ministers discussed Iraq at the Foreign Affairs Council and adopted Conclusions which called on the Government of Iraq to make tangible progress on political reforms to enable full national reconciliation based on justice and accountability, the principles of a functioning democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and the genuine involvement of civil society. The Conclusions also invite the High Representative and the European Commission to present elements for an EU strategy for engagement with Iraq in due course. </p>  <p>  Ireland has made a significant contribution to the humanitarian response to the crises in both Syria and Iraq, and since 2012 has provided over &euro;90 million to the Syria humanitarian effort, and over &euro;8 million to the UN Iraq Humanitarian Pooled Fund.</p></reply>

Foreign Ministers have consistently underlined that ultimately there will be no defeat of Daesh without a political solution to the crisis in Syria. This is reflected particularly in the comprehensive conclusions on a &lsquo;<i>Regional Strategy for Syria and Iraq as well as the Daesh threat</i>&rsquo;, which were adopted by the Council in May last year. Foreign Ministers have also focused on the contribution that the EU can make through external action to preventing and countering terrorism. Engagement with third countries to prevent violent extremism and to strengthen their capacity to detect and prevent terrorism, in full compliance with international law and human rights, is at the heart of the EU&rsquo;s strategy and is reflected in a substantial increase in assistance to third countries in this respect.The EU&rsquo;s approach is guided by, and is consistent with, the approach taken by the UN to countering Daesh and by the principles and measures set out in relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, including UNSCR 2161 (2014) on freezing funds and other assets of terrorist groups, and UNSCR 2178 (2014) on measures to suppress the recruiting, organising, transporting or equipping of individuals who travel to another State to plan or carry out terrorist acts or training.  </p><p>The former UN Secretary General&rsquo;s comprehensive <i>Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism</i>, presented in January last year, and his related reports are an important and welcome contribution to addressing the threat posed by Daesh, and to highlighting the measures being taken against them in areas such as countering their financing, preventing and disrupting the travel of foreign terrorist fighters, countering recruitment and preventing violent extremism.</p><p>Ireland supports the comprehensive approach being taken at EU level to preventing and countering terrorism.  At meetings of the Council, I have stressed the need to tackle underlying factors that contribute to radicalisation and terrorism and in particular the importance of the link between security and development.  I have also emphasised the need to ensure a joined-up approach in relation to the discussions of Foreign Ministers and those of our Justice and Home Affairs counterparts.</p><p>Increasing the effectiveness of information and intelligence-sharing and enhancing border security have been priority themes at recent meetings of the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council.  A series of measures is being rolled out to strengthen cooperation and to develop the EU's legal framework for information-sharing, combatting terrorism and controlling illegal firearms.  Ireland is fully engaged in pursuing these developments.</p></reply>

Our support is directed to key civil society and other trusted partners in Myanmar with the objective of meeting the needs of some of the poorest and most marginalised communities there, and to help underpin peace, prosperity and the political transition to full democracy.    Ireland&rsquo;s support to the people of Myanmar involves working with a range of Irish and international NGOs such as Tr&oacute;caire, Plan International and Misean Cara as well as supporting the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. </p>  <p>  Additionally, Ireland is a strong supporter of the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), which on 7 September, announced an allocation of US$7 million to urgently help tens of thousands of people fleeing violence in Myanmar and seeking refuge in Bangladesh. These funds will allow humanitarian partners to scale up urgent aid by providing additional shelter, food, and critical health care to those affected by the conflict, especially women and girls.  This allocation is in addition to US$6.5 million which was provided by CERF for emergency relief to Myanmar earlier in 2017.</p></reply>

In addition, Garda&iacute; may inspect the vehicle for compliance with vehicle standards legislation, which makes it an offence to drive without reasonable consideration, drive carelessly, or drive dangerously. The Garda authorities also have powers of seizure, detention, storage and disposal of vehicles under road traffic legislation.  I am further informed that the use of quad bikes and scramblers in public parks and open spaces is strictly prohibited by the local authorities under the Parks and Open Spaces Bye-Laws 2011. </p>  <p>  Despite the road traffic and other relevant legislation available in this area, the Garda authorities have indicated that there are issues of safety involved in enforcement of these laws which are best addressed through a multi-agency approach. I am informed that Garda&iacute; are working with local authorities, including park authorities, to examine other solutions, such as engineering solutions.  Enhanced fencing and bike gates are examples of engineering measures taken to restrict access to parks. </p>  <p>  I share the concern in relation to the very serious public safety and anti-social issues associated with the misuse of such vehicles and to better facilitate this multi-agency approach, I have written to the relevant parties, including the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, as well as the Garda Commissioner and the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, in order to ascertain whether there are additional legislative or other solutions which can assist us in dealing with this issue more comprehensively. A number of responses have been received and are being examined at present. As a next step, when all responses have been received, I intend to convene a meeting of all of the interested parties and in order to identify more effective possible solutions and assign responsibility and timeframes for them.</p></reply>

The Committee took the view that a ground landlord's ground rent is a form of property right which is constitutionally protected and that abolition of such rents would be unconstitutional in the absence of adequate monetary compensation for the landlord. The Committee also noted that where leases were approaching expiry, any legislation providing for the abolition of ground rents would have to provide for the payment of enhanced compensation. In light of the foregoing, I have no immediate plans to introduce legislation providing for a constitutional amendment.  </p>  <p>  I should add that section 2 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1978 introduced a prohibition on the creation of new leases reserving ground rents on dwellings. Moreover, as regards existing ground rents, Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978 contains a statutory scheme whereby a person may, at reasonable cost, acquire the fee simple in their dwelling. To date, over 80,000 applicants have acquired freehold title to their property under this scheme. In the case of property other than dwellings, such as commercial properties, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967 contains provisions which facilitate acquisition of the fee simple subject to agreed terms or on terms set out in an arbitration carried out by the County Registrar. As indicated previously, operation of existing ground rents legislation is kept under review by my Department.</p></reply>

Given the obligation to protect the identity of those who make protected disclosures, it would require a breach of this obligation to attempt to collate information on the number who may be off work for any reason. I understand that my predecessor has already explained this position in response to a similar question on 23 May, 2017 (Parliamentary Question No. 76).</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Protected Disclosures Act came into effect on 15 July 2014, and in relation to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na replaced the previous system of making disclosures to a Confidential Recipient.  The Act was part of the then Government's comprehensive approach to enhancing the protections available to whistle-blowers, including members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   </p>  <p>  Under the Act, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or they may make a disclosure to GSOC, which is a statutorily independent body, for investigation.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC, the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure. </p>  <p>  The legislation also allows that an individual employed by a public body may also make a Protected Disclosure to the Minister with responsibility for that body. I should point out that it is possible that the same individual could make a protected disclosure to more than one of the possible recipients under the Act.</p></reply>

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.  </p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland. Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification. </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  </p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).   Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.       </p>  <p>  The major issue at this stage is in relation to deprivation of liberty &ndash; in the case of persons in nursing homes for example, whose capacity to consent may be in doubt.  This is a sensitive and important issue and we must get it right. Unfortunately, it is taking longer than expected to develop a proposal that is constitutionally sound and operationally effective and reasonable.  The Department of Justice and Equality continues to engage with the Department of Health to assist with that work, but there is still some work to be done. </p>  <p>  While Ireland&rsquo;s not having ratified the CRPD is a recurring point of criticism by the UN as well as by domestic civil society and NGOs, it should be noted that in terms of quality of service and the actual position of people with disabilities in society, Ireland is in many respects in advance of other EU states.  This is not to be complacent and we are continuing to take practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.  The Report of the Make Work Pay Group was published earlier this year and already action, as announced by Minister Harris has been taken on its recommendations.  We have a Comprehensive Employment Strategy in place and the Government recently published a new National Disability Inclusion Strategy (2017 &ndash; 2021). This strategy contains a wide range of practical commitments to improve the position of people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains a very high priority for me as Minister.</p></reply>

The vision of the programme is to design standardised models of integrated care pathways for the delivery of clinical care to ensure sustained quality clinical operational management. Overall, the NCPS aims to improve quality, access and cost-effectiveness of stroke services in Ireland. </p><p>Some of the achievements of this programme in improving access to services to date include: </p><p><b>National 24/7 access to safe stroke thrombolysis </b></p><p>Emergency thrombolysis is provided to patients in all parts of the country, via improved hospital and ambulance protocols, health professional training and the appointment of new stroke physicians. The national stroke thrombolysis rate has increased from 1% in 2006 to a current rate of 12% (2016). </p><p>The NCPS has developed a number of initiatives including a telemedicine programme to allow delivery of expert thrombolysis therapy in smaller level three hospitals. It has been involved in the training of over 250 doctors nationally to deliver thrombolysis therapy and has participated in a training programme for Stroke in the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. </p><p><b>Improved access to stroke unit care </b></p><p>Access to stroke unit care has been shown to improve stroke patient outcomes through reduced mortality rates, reduced dependency and shorter lengths of stay in hospital by patients. Since the commencement of the NCPS, nine new stroke units have been opened, bringing the total number of stroke units in acute hospitals to twenty-two. Two further stroke units are currently in development with a third at planning stages. <table><tr><th>Stroke Unit Available n22 </th><th>Stroke Unit in development/planning n3 </th><th>No Stroke Unit n2 </th></tr><tr><td>Mater Misericordiae University Hospital </td><td>University Hospital Kerry </td><td>Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore </td></tr><tr><td>St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital </td><td>Connolly Hospital </td><td>Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital Navan </td></tr><tr><td>Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar </td><td>Letterkenny University Hospital </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford General Hospital </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Kilkenny </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>St James&rsquo;s Hospital </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght Hospital </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Naas General Hospital </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Beaumont Hospital </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan General Hospital </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>University Hospital Limerick </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>University Hospital Waterford </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>South Tipperary General Hospital Clonmel </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cork University Hospital </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mercy University Hospital </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Bantry General Hospital </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>University Hospital Galway </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Portiuncula Hospital </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo University Hospital </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo University Hospital </td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>This is a major improvement from the first national stroke care audit report in 2006 which reported one stroke unit in the country. However stroke units are typically too small and the recent national Audit showed that only half of stroke patients admitted spent any time in a stroke unit. </p><p>Admission to a stroke unit is a National Key Performance Indicator. In 2016, 65.6% of Stroke patients were admitted to a Stroke Unit. </p><p><b>Early Discharge of Stroke Patients</b></p><p>It has been recognised internationally that Early Supported Discharge of stroke patients from hospital, improves outcomes, reduces need for long term care and increases acute hospital capacity by freeing up beds. It is estimated the 10-25% of patients could benefit from an ESD service. </p><p>The programme has helped establish 3 small but effective ESD teams in Dublin and Galway. In 2016, 137 patients were discharged to ESD services representing 15.6% of total stroke discharges. It is estimated that there was an average reduction in length of stay of 10.4 days per ESD patient. </p><p>Funding for increasing capacity in the three operational sites has been secured for 2017 with further funding secured to support the establishment of two further teams in University Hospital Limerick and Cork University Hospital. Recruitment of these ESD staff is on-going. University Hospital Limerick is due to commence its ESD Service on 11/9/17. </p><p><b>Emergency Endovascular Therapy &ndash; Thrombectomy </b></p><p>Thrombectomy is an emergency endovascular procedure that permits patients with severe strokes caused by clots occluding the major vessels of the brain and neck to have these clots removed using specialist devices. HIQA has completed a Health Technology Assessment which finds that this intervention is value for money. Full report of the HIQA HTA can be found at:</p><p><i>. </i></p><p>Provision of emergency endovascular thrombectomy remains highly specialised in Beaumont Hospital and Cork University Hospital and this model has been endorsed by the HSE, Acute Hospital Division with a view to a third centre when numbers increase as expected. </p><p>To date, the number of patients undergoing this procedure has risen annually, on average almost 50% increase each year: 2015=122 cases, 2016=172 cases, 2017 &ndash; end of August=154 cases. These patients have been referred from 20 different hospitals around the country.</p><p>I have noted the contents of the Stroke Manifesto published by the Irish Heart Foundations and it will be one of the factors that will contribute to the on-going policy development in this area.</p></reply>

This group was established by the Department of Health in 2015 and it has met on a number of occasions. One of the principal recommendations in the Plan was the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases which was established in 2013 with Professor Eileen Treacy as the Clinical Lead.  Over time among other functions the Programme is assisting with mapping and developing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise &ndash; nationally and internationally; and developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Plan contains a number of recommendations and I have asked the Health Service Executive to reply directly to the Deputy outlining the progress to date.</p></reply>

It should be noted that human aplha1-proteinase inhibitor does not strictly speaking come within the scope of the above act as it is not intended for this drug to be included on the HSE's reimbursement list as defined in section 17 of the Act.</p>  <p>  The HSE Drugs Group considered the clinical information in relation to Respreeza. The HSE was unable to recommend reimbursement as they concluded that there is not enough evidence to suggest that patients will derive a clinically meaningful benefit from this treatment.</p>  <p>  The HSE was also required to consider cost effectiveness and deemed that the current price was not a cost effective use of resources. </p>  <p>  I am aware that there are a number of patients on a compassionate access scheme which is operated by CSL Behring.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines, is a key objective of the Irish health service. However, the challenge is to deliver this objective in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness, Drugs Payment as well as the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; including fees and ingredient costs, is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017. To ensure that patients receive the highest quality care, it is essential that these resources invested in medicines are used efficiently and effectively. This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, to deliver greater efficiencies across the supply chain and also to promote the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>In 2013, the HSE established the Medicines Management Programme (MMP). It is headed by the (NMIC) and the (NCPE) in collaboration with the (HSE-PCRS) and provides sustained national leadership relating to issues such as the quality of the medicines management process, access to medicines and overall expenditure on medicines.</p><p>The Medicines Management Programme has undertaken a number of initiatives aimed at enhancing evidence-based and cost-effective prescribing nationally and the review of Versatis is an example of this. </p><p>Versatis 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.</p><p>Following a review by the MMP of the evidence available to support the use of Versatis, the HSE has introduced a new system for the reimbursement of Versatis from 1 September 2017. This process will support the appropriate use of this medication while ensuring those with an indication of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) continue to have access to this treatment. </p><p>The product has been reimbursed under the community drugs schemes in Ireland since 2010. Initially, the projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication. However, total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, due primarily to off-license use i.e. prescribing Versatis as a general treatment for pain not associated with shingles. Currently, there are over 25,000 patients in receipt of this item. The MMP prescribing and cost guidance report highlighted that the clinical evidence to support the use of Versatis 5% medicated plaster for PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain. </p><p>The NCPE estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of the prescribing of this product is for the licensed indication of PHN.</p><p>All patients who currently receive antivirals for shingles, or patients who are prescribed antivirals for the treatment of shingles by their GP in the future, will automatically be approved for Versatis for a period of three months. No action is required by the GP in this instance and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy will be notified in real time of the patient&rsquo;s approval status.</p><p>All patients who are currently initiated on Versatis have been identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for a period of three months and will continue to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017.</p><p>From 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients will no longer be dispensed Versatis under the community drugs schemes. The HSE has produced patient information leaflets and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. </p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be dispensed for unlicensed indications. In such circumstance, the GP will be required to make an application for reimbursement for unlicensed indications for new and existing patients through the online system. </p><p>Where the application is under exceptional circumstances, the application will be reviewed by the MMP before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.</p><p>Full details of the review of Versatis are available on the HSE website at</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>As this is a matter for the HSE, I have no role in this decision in relation to individual treatments. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

The Inpatient/Daycase Action Plan is being delivered through a combination of normal hospital activity, as well as insourcing and outsourcing initiatives utilising NTPF funding.

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  </p>  <p>  In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services. The Inpatient/Daycase Action Plan is being delivered through a combination of normal hospital activity, as well as insourcing and outsourcing initiatives utilising NTPF funding. Under the Inpatient/Daycase Plan, since early February, over 23,000 patients have come off the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List.  </p>  <p>  The NTPF has  advised that to date 4,250 patients have been authorised for treatment in private hospitals under its Day Case Initiative, 2,000 patients have accepted an offer of treatment in a private hospital and that 1,016 patients have received their procedure. Over 700 of these patients have had ophthalmology procedures.</p>  <p>  The Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital is a national tertiary referral centre for complex eye diseases. A new cataract theatre in the hospital opened in July 2017. The new unit has the capacity to perform an additional 3,000 cataract procedures annually and has already significantly reduced public waiting lists for cataract surgery in the hospital.</p>  <p>  The Report of the HSE-led Primary Care Eye Services Review Group was published in June 2017. The Review Group determined that there is a need to move from community ophthalmic physicians managing all primary care referrals to a model centred on a multi-disciplinary Primary Eye Care Team and also for the Primary Care Eye Team to liaise closely with the local hospital ophthalmic service to ensure that all patients are managed within the most appropriate clinical service and location.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-09-21a.420.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092100051#WRJ02600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168 and 169 together.</p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS), commonly referred to as <i>A Fair Deal,</i>is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care. Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;</p><p>- Bed and board;</p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and</p><p>- Laundry service.</p><p>A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining  the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.</p><p>Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.</p><p>Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and the private or voluntary nursing home.</p><p>Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.  </p><p>I have met with both Nursing Homes Ireland and Age Action to discuss this issue in detail.  In order to improve the transparency of these additional charges, I outlined that a schedule of charges should be provided to potential residents on enquiry to an individual nursing home, rather than at the point of admission.  Nursing Homes Ireland undertook to advise their members to do so.  I have also recently met with  the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the Office of the Ombudsman and HIQA  to discuss this matter further.</p><p>I have asked the Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group established to oversee the implementation of certain recommendations contained in the 2015 Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to also consider this matter and examine the options that might be available, as part of its ongoing work.  It is not envisaged that a survey of individual nursing homes would be carried out.</p><p>I am committed to ensuring that our older population are protected, that they get the care that they deserve, and that they have access to all of the information they need in order to be able to make an informed decision, especially at such a vulnerable stage in their lives. The main priority is to ensure that nursing homes continue to provide a wide and engaging range of activities for their residents and to provide maximum and optimum transparency and consistency on all charges associated with same.</p></reply>

In order to be considered under the ANC scheme at an individual level each partner should individually declare all land farmed by them within the partnership.</p><p>1. All partners who declare designated ANC lands at individual level will be considered under the ANC scheme.</p><p>2. Individual maximum land thresholds will be applicable to each individual partner in respect of designated ANC lands declared.</p><p>3. Thereafter, scheme eligibility requirements in respect of the 7 month stock retention period and the annual average stocking density must be met at overall partnership level in respect of all forage hectares.</p><p>NOTE:Where the overall partnership holding fails to meet scheme eligibility requirements in respect of either the 7 month stock retention period or the annual average stocking density no payment will be due to the partnership or any of the partners.</p><p>Only one payment under ANC will issue to the Partnership. All Payments due to the individual partners will be combined into a single payment which will issue to the partnership.</p><p>The circumstances of this case have been reviewed and it is noted that in 2017 a total of 42.90 hectares was declared under farm partnership in question, which is a one herd partnership with only one registered herd number. As outlined above, the ANC Terms and Conditions provide for multiple payments within a partnership where lands are declared at an individual level and payments are based on individual maximum area thresholds as declared on the 2017 BPS/ANC application. However, as there is only one herd in the partnership in question, with all lands declared under same, only one ANC payment calculation is due on the 42.90 hectares declared and the maximum payable threshold of 30 ha being applied.</p></reply>

The extension followed a comprehensive review by the European Food Safety Authority. This review, which included detailed consideration of a report produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organisation, concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans and can be used safely without putting consumers or users at risk.</p>  <p>  The RAC delivered its opinion in March 2017 and concluded that glyphosate does not warrant classification as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction. This means that legally glyphosate does not meet any of the substance non-approval criteria specified in Regulation 1107/2009. The RAC opinion was adopted by consensus with the full support of all members and was formally submitted to the Commission by ECHA on 15 June 2017. A final decision on renewing the approval of glyphosate under the Plant Protection Products Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009) is due to be taken by 15 December 2017.</p>  <p>  The Commission has prepared a first draft of a proposal for renewal of the approval of glyphosate, which was discussed by Member State representatives at the technical experts standing committee meeting in July. The draft proposal is to renew the approval of glyphosate for a 10-year period, instead of the normal 15-year period, with various conditions of use specified. A further meeting of the standing committee is scheduled but it is not yet known if the renewal of glyphosate will be included on the meeting agenda. </p>  <p>  The current proposal is being considered and a position will be taken when the current text or any amended text is tabled again at the standing committee. The Department has supported previous Commission proposals in relation to the renewal of the approval of glyphosate.</p></reply>

However, the environment in which the post office operates is changing and the network needs to change to thrive particularly with the move to digital transactions. This involves harnessing existing strengths such as its trusted brand and the relationship of postmasters with individual communities to build the network of the future. The post office plays an important role in serving the needs of business and domestic customers alike and this is at the forefront of An Post&rsquo;s mandate. The mechanisms for disbursing payments from the Department of Employment and Social Protection are a matter for that organisation.  The Government is fully committed to a sustainable post office network which it sees as a key piece of financial and social infrastructure for both urban and rural areas. I understand that the report of the network renewal implementation group, which was undertaken by Mr. Bobby Kerr on behalf of An Post, is under consideration by An Post.</p>  <p>  The fundamental review of An Post, including the post office network, which will identify the strategic changes and restructuring necessary to maintain the company on a sound financial footing is nearing completion. All opportunities are being assessed by An Post in the context of the current strategic review.  Naturally, the outcome of the review will impact on the extent to which the recommendations contained in the report of the network renewal implementation group can be implemented.</p>  <p>  Until such time as the review is finalised and assessed it will not be possible to comment further. Government will be briefed once a definitive strategy has been agreed.</p></reply>

The Map is searchable by eircode.</p>  <p>  -  The BLUE areas on the Map represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering, or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  </p>  <p>  -  The AMBER areas on the Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of a procurement process. </p>  <p>  While the town of Kenmare and much of the surrounding area falls within a BLUE area and will be provided by commercial operators, the two businesses detailed by the Deputy are within the AMBER area and will be covered by the State intervention.

This is largely down to the historic higher costs associated with Solar PV in comparison to other renewable electricity technologies.</p><p>My Department is currently developing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions to EU-wide targets out to 2030. The design of the new scheme has included an extensive economic appraisal. This appraisal compared the cost of supporting Solar PV (both rooftop and ground mounted) and a range of other commercial renewable technologies, at various scales, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply. The assessment also included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines. </p><p>A public consultation on the design principles of the proposed new RESS was launched on 4 September and submissions are invited from the public. All submissions will be considered and following on from this final consultation, a design proposal will be brought to Government for approval.

This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area. The Map is searchable by eircode.  </p><p>-  The BLUE areas on the Map represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering (BLUE), or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services (LIGHT BLUE),  </p><p>-  The AMBER areas on the Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of a procurement process. </p><p>The position in relation to the eircode referred to by the Deputy is that the premises falls within an area being covered by the State Intervention.  The other specific premises referenced by the constituent falls within an area being covered by eir's planned rural deployment of 300,000 premises.</p><p>Those premises within the State Intervention area form part of my Department's on-going procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network. That procurement process is now at an advanced stage, with &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; to be submitted by bidders later this month. </p><p>To improve both mobile and broadband services in rural Ireland in advance of the roll-out of the high speed broadband network to be built in the State intervention area, I established a Taskforce to identify immediate solutions to mobile phone and broadband coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers. These solutions will enhance the existing services prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.</p></reply>

My aim is to ensure that resources are allocated in the fairest way possible and to make the maximum contribution to tackling disadvantage, enabling job creation and economic recovery. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s intention is, over time, to use the available knowledge of population levels and disadvantage to ensure that resources are targeted at areas of greatest need. As a tool to assist with this, a Resource Allocation Model, or RAM, has been developed which allows relative disadvantage to be measured across all census areas. In order to achieve the objective of moving towards allocating resources according to this model, my Department has in recent years worked to ensure that funding is protected for those areas which the RAM shows have greatest needs. This principle was used in deciding on funding allocations for SICAP and I am satisfied that the funding allocated to Fingal under SICAP is a fair allocation of resources for the area concerned.

The geographic distribution and allocation of resources for the SICAP programme uses the Pobal HP Deprivation index (or SICAP RAM- Resource Allocation Model).</p><p>The Index - SICAP RAM- takes into account the HP deprivation score as well as the population of each Lot area, and identifies an allocation of the national budget determined by these two figures. The model is a widely used social gradient metric, used across Government Departments and state agencies for the targeting of services as well as the allocation of resources. The index is recognised as a robust and reliable tool for the identification of relative levels of affluence or disadvantage across geographic areas, by utilising existing data from the national census. In the model, social deprivation / affluence is conceptualised as being driven by three key concepts; demographic profile, social class composition and labour market situation, each of which is measured through a set of observable indicators taken from the census. These include demographic profile, social class composition and labour market profile.</p><p>It is recognised that the issue of housing, and in particular, social housing is an area of particular importance. However, the inclusion of the percentage of individuals living in social housing, or in schemes such as Housing Assistance Payment, HAP, (which is not measured in the Census), is not specifically included in the RAM to ensure an equity of funding allocations and to avoid double counting within the index.  The model itself has been designed to avoid the double counting of predictive deprivation indicators. That is to say, the personal attributes of individuals within an area are already factored into the index.  The inclusion of, for example, the percentage of individuals living in social housing, would serve only to double count disadvantage in certain areas where social housing is more prevalent.</p><p>I am satisfied that the current application of the RAM is a fair and equitable approach to allocating funds. </p><p>It is important to recognise that the current SICAP, while targeting areas where there is clear evidence of high levels of deprivation, is by no means confined to those areas.  The Local Community Development Committees (LCDC) and Programme Implementers, in each area, have significant opportunity to look to members of the target groups that do not live in an area classed as disadvantaged.  The next iteration of the Programme sees no significant change in that regard.  </p><p>Further information on the construction of the index and the rationale for inclusion or exclusion of certain variables can be found on the Questions and Answers page on Trutz Haase&rsquo;s website <i></i></p></reply>

The Programme was rolled out in April 2015, and will run until 31 December 2017. Its aim is to tackle poverty, social exclusion and long-term unemployment through local engagement and partnership between disadvantaged individuals, community organisations, public sector agencies and other stakeholders. SICAP is a key intervention for the harder to reach cohort of the population, with delivery in each area (or Lot) overseen and managed by the relevant LCDC in the local authority area. </p>  <p>  The SICAP funding allocation for 2017 nationally is &euro;37.5m, which includes an allocation of &euro;3m under the European Social Fund (ESF) Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020. </p>  <p>  The next iteration of the programme, SICAP 2018-2022 is due to supersede the current programme with effect from 1 January 2018.  As with the current programme, and in accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice and good practice internationally, and also in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, SICAP 2018-2022 is subject to a public procurement process which is currently underway.  The public procurement process is a competitive process that is open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to deliver the new Programme. The matter of sub-contracting is dealt with in the Request for Tender (RFT) which issued in July last.  Given the deliberative process, currently underway, I am not in a position to comment further.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-09-21a.541.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092100053#WRL03600"><p>Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7.3 billion, is the largest block of expenditure in my Department. Demographic change alone will increase this by over &euro;220 million this year. </p>  <p>  The &lsquo;marriage bar&rsquo; describes a rule that existed in most of the public service and some private sector employments, where women were required to leave their employment upon marriage. This practice was abolished in 1973 when Ireland joined the EEC. As employees in the public service generally paid a reduced rate of PRSI, which provided no cover for the State pension (contributory), the marriage bar would not generally have reduced State pension entitlement, as such pensioners would not have qualified for that payment in the first place had they remained in public sector employment, and instead would have qualified for a Public Service pension. Any questions regarding that issue should be referred to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, which was introduced in 1994 and provides for periods since then, makes qualification easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  It does this by allowing gaps of up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. It is estimated that extending the period covered by this scheme to periods prior to its introduction would cost some &euro;290 million per year. </p>  <p>  Where people do not qualify for a maximum-rate contributory pension in their own right, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age. Where their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them, and is subject to a personal means-test. Alternatively, they may qualify for a State Pension (non-contributory), based on their household means, amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. There are very significant income and capital disregards in the means tests for these payments, which result in the large majority of payees &ndash; most of whom are women &ndash; being paid at the maximum rate. </p>  <p>  It should be noted the most recent CSO figures (from 2015) show that the rate of Consistent Poverty among women aged over 65 is 2.6%, compared to 2.9% for men in the same age group. Both of these figures (which are so close as to effectively be at parity) are very substantially lower than the rates of consistent poverty among the working age population, and attest to the role of the state pension system in keeping older people out of Consistent Poverty, and its success in doing so for men and women equally.</p>  <p>  The gap between average State pension payments to men and women over 66 made by my Department is 2% (to the benefit of men), an average difference of some &euro;4 a week, and this reflects the different dynamics of 4 payments &ndash; 3 of which benefit women more than men, and one (the State pension contributory) which benefits men more than women.  Changing patterns in working lives over the decades are expected to continue to see the outcomes for male and female retirees converge over time.</p>  <p>  I understand that the gender pension gap referred to in the material provided by the Deputy relates to an EU Commission statistic, used to calculate the difference in all pension income, including occupational pensions and personal investment pensions. While I understand this figure was approximately 37% in 2012, I am informed that when the Commission most recently calculated this figure for Ireland (earlier this year, in respect of 2014), the figure was 32.0%, compared to 39.1% across the EU.  While the Irish figure is higher than I would like, and reflective of higher occupational and private pensions among male pensioners than among their wives who would have spent years out of the workforce in the family home, raising their children, it is notable that the gap is higher in many other, larger EU countries such as Germany, the UK, France and the Netherlands, where female labour market participation was higher than here during the decades that our current pensioners worked, and I would hope that the increased female participation in the workforce in recent decades will continue to close this gap as much as is possible.</p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) announced that the Yearly Average system for calculating SPC entitlements will be replaced with a Total Contributions Approach.   The Framework noted that had this reform been introduced at that time, it would have disadvantaged certain pensioners who would have difficulty acquiring sufficient contributions to qualify for a full pension at that time.  This includes farmers and other self-employed people, who have only had coverage since 1988, and so the Framework proposed 2020 as the start date. Bringing the date forward to 2018, even if administratively feasible, would not be to the advantage of farmers, who generally qualify for a full rate of pension if they have been either paying Class S contributions for each year since 1988.</p>  <p>  The position of homemakers is being carefully considered in developing this new system of calculating the State Pension (contributory). This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation. Following completion of the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund this year, my Department will conduct a period of consultation with relevant stakeholders. Following the consultation period, I will submit a proposal to Government seeking approval for the new approach, and subsequently introduce legislation to give effect to the model decided upon.</p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This provides them with access to a range of social insurance benefits including state pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and paternity benefit.</p>  <p>  Since March 2017, self-employed contributors have access to the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearings aids.  From October 2017, for all workers including the self-employed, treatment benefit entitlements will also be extended to provide further dental and optical benefits.</p>  <p>  In December of this year, self-employed contributors will be eligible for invalidity pension, which, for the first time, will provide access to income support if they have a serious illness or injury that prevents them from working, without having to go through a means test.</p>  <p>  The requirement to pay a minimum annual class S charge is based on the need to maintain a relationship between contributions paid and the level of entitlements to which those contributions give access.  For example, entitlement to State pension (contributory) at the rate of &euro;238.30 per week can be generated on the basis of the single annual &euro;500 class S contribution.</p>  <p>The minimum annual class S charge was increased from &euro;253 to &euro;500 in January 2013, in line with increases in other minimum annual charges.  The &euro;253 class S charge had remained unchanged since 2002, even though the class S rate of contribution had increased from 3% to 4% in January 2011.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance as part of the household benefits package to approximately 429,000 customers, at an estimated cost of &euro;232 million in 2017.  </p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to the Department in as targeted a manner as possible. Back to work family dividend (BTWFD) is not a means-tested payment and therefore is not a qualifying payment for fuel allowance. BTWFD gives financial support to people with qualified children who are in or take up employment or self-employment and stop claiming any primary social welfare payment. Family Income Supplement (FIS) can be paid with BTWFD and the amount received from the BTWFD is not taken into account in the means test for FIS.</p>  <p>  Persons in receipt of one parent family payment that are in employment when their child reaches the age of seven can apply for jobseekers transition payment (JST). This is a means tested scheme that aims to support lone parents into the work force while they have young children. Fuel Allowance is payable with JST. </p>  <p>  There are no plans to extend the eligibility criteria for fuel allowance to include BTWFD as a qualifying payment. Any decision to do so would have to be considered in the overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a recipient of a social welfare or health service executive payment who has exceptional essential heating costs due to ill health or infirmity and who cannot provide for such costs from within his or her own resources may qualify for a heating supplement.  There is no standard rate for a heating supplement.  Each case is examined on its merits and the Community Welfare Officer determines the amount to be paid taking account of the level of the expenses in question and the ability of the applicant to contribute towards his or her exceptional heating costs.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision.  This demographic change alone is expected to increase spending on pensions by over &euro;220 million this year &ndash; not including the impact of rate increases.  </p>  <p>  A number of significant reforms to State pensions were introduced in recent years which have allowed my Department maintain the value of the State pension, and indeed increase it in the last two Budgets.  With effect from April 2012, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State Pension (contributory), or SPC, increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions. At the time this measure was introduced, the annual exchequer savings were expected to be in the region of &euro;6m per annum but rising substantially in the long term.  Therefore, the cost of reverting now would be significantly higher.  However, as people with 260-519 paid contributions no longer make claims to SPC, the data is not available to update this costing.</p>  <p>  The current rate bands applying to the SPC were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000.  These rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  </p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of over &euro;60 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 million each following year (e.g. it would be expected to cost some &euro;70 million in 2019).  This estimate reflects the numbers of those in receipt of reduced rate SPC payments, and does not include those who are claiming an alternative payment at a higher rate than their reduced SPC entitlement, and who might qualify for a higher rate of SPC if such a change were introduced. This estimate also assumes that any such change to rate bands would generally be implemented from a current date and as a result not generate retrospective arrears.</p>  <p>  The main beneficiaries from such a decision would be younger (post 2012) pensioners who both:</p>  <p>  (a)   haven&rsquo;t sufficient paid contributions into the Social Insurance Fund to qualify for a contributory pension at the maximum rate, or for the 98% rate applying to those with a yearly average of 40-47 weekly PRSI contributions paid or credited per year, and </p>  <p>  (b)  do not qualify for means-tested pension payments at the maximum rate because, in addition to their state pension, they also have means above a certain level (e.g. they are in receipt of an occupational pension and/or own a second residential property).</p>  <p>  The savings created by the new rate bands were an alternative to cutting the core rate of pensions, at a time when Exchequer savings were required, and other social protection payments were being reduced across the board.  Had a similar approach been taken with pensions, affecting everyone over State pension age &ndash; regardless of their means and their contribution record &ndash; the hardest hit would have been pensioners with no additional incomes, notably those paid a State pension (non-contributory), and widows and widowers living alone on one pension payment.  A very significantly higher proportion of such pensioners are women, and this would have been expected to result in more women over 65 experiencing consistent poverty, relative to men.  </p>  <p>  The alternative approach, taken by the Government at that time, made savings in respect of the State pension (contributory) by making rates of payment for new pensioners more reflective of contribution history, while maintaining the rates of payment for non-contributory and Widows/widowers pensions, as well as for contributory pensions paid to those who had contributed into the Social Insurance Fund throughout their working lives (i.e. with a yearly average of 40 or more).  This approach safeguarded those most vulnerable pensioners, whilst avoiding undermining the contributory system, which is the basis for collection of PRSI, which funds the SPC on a &lsquo;Pay-As-You-Go&rsquo; basis.  </p>  <p>  Where people do not qualify for a maximum-rate contributory pension in their own right, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Where their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them, and is subject to a personal means-test.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), based on their household means, amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. There are very significant income and capital disregards in these means tests, which result in the large majority being paid at the maximum rate.</p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The review process represented a realignment of the maximum rent limits with agreed rents, with rents generally benchmarked against the 35th percentile of those registered with the Residential Tenancies Board.  The review&rsquo;s methodology is evidenced based and reflects the pressures on rental properties in each location.  </p>  <p>The information requested by the Deputy, the estimated cost to increase rent limits to market rents at the 35th percentile and the 50th   percentile for 2018, is not available.</p>  <p>  The rent supplement scheme is being administered to take account of the on-going rental market difficulties through the implementation of a targeted case-by-case approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the rent limits.  In addition, a Protocol arrangement is in place with Threshold and is operational in the areas where supply issues are particularly acute covering Kildare, Dublin, Cork, Meath, Wicklow and Galway City.  For 2017 to date, some of 1,400 recipients have been supported with increased rent payments above the rent limits. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the strategic policy direction of my Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support with the introduction of the HAP scheme.  Any further review of prescribed rent limits would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability. Child Benefit is currently paid to around 619,880 families in respect of some 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of over &euro;2 billion in 2017. </p><p>The current estimated cost of expanding child benefit to parents with children that are 18 years of age or older but remain in second level education for 2018 based on figures from the Department of Education and Skills for 2016 which show 58,653 individuals 18 years of age and over in second level education. The estimated annual cost based on the current Child Benefit rate of &euro;140 per month is approximately &euro;98.5 million in a full year.</p><p>Budget 2009 reduced the age for eligibility for Child Benefit from 19 years to less than 18 years.  A value for money review of child income supports, published by the Department of Social Protection in 2010, found that the participation pattern of children in education supports the current age limit for Child Benefit. </p><p>Given the universality of Child Benefit, allowing for it to be paid in respect of 18 year olds still in full time education would not be a targeted approach. The adoption of such a proposal has significant cost implications and would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context. </p><p>Families on low incomes can avail of a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including: </p><p>-  Increase for a Qualified Child (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments;</p><p>-  Family Income Supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children;</p><p>-  The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance for low income families (paid at the full-time second level education rate). </p><p>These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked with household income and thereby supports low-income families with older children participating in full-time education.</p></reply>

The person in question can apply to the Community Welfare Officer for the means tested Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) if he is in need of financial assistance.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is a means tested social assistance payment whereas jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is a contribution based insurance scheme.  The 2017 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;2.5 billion.</p>  <p>  It is important in the interests of equity and fairness that the conditions for receipt of a jobseekers payment apply to all recipients, including those who could be categorised as seasonal and part-time workers.  </p>  <p>  Where a person exhausts his or her entitlement to JB, he or she must pay 13 additional PRSI contributions after the last day of payment in order to requalify.  The 13 contributions needed to re-qualify for JB can be paid in respect of full time employment, seasonal employment, part-time employment or casual employment.  If a seasonal or a part time worker meets this requirement they may requalify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p>  <p>  This requirement is in place to ensure the person has a reasonable connection with the labour market before he or she can requalify for payment.  If a person does not re-qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or has used up his or her entitlement to jobseeker's benefit, then he or she might qualify for JA, subject to the means test and other conditions.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions for receipt of JB is that the person must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 in order to qualify.   However, there are circumstances where it is possible for a person to be engaged in employment (either insurable or self-employment) on a given day and still satisfy the unemployment condition for that day.   This type of employment is known as &lsquo;subsidiary employment&rsquo;.  In order to be deemed &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo;, the employment must be capable of being carried out outside the ordinary working hours of person&rsquo;s &ldquo;usual employment&rdquo;.  In addition, the employment is subject to a daily earnings limit of &euro;12.70 per day unless the person has more than 117 contributions paid in the preceding three years from the date of their claim (in which case no earnings limit is applicable).   </p>  <p>  An Taoiseach, in his previous role as Minister for Social Protection, gave a commitment at D&aacute;il report stage of the Social Welfare Bill 2016 that he would ask officials to examine the issue of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the treatment of part-time and seasonal workers, including those categorised as having subsidiary employment.  As a result, my Department is currently finalising a report in relation to these issues.</p></reply>

JobsPlus is an employer incentive, which offers a financial support to employers who offer employment opportunities to people who are unemployed.</p>  <p>  JobsPlus is available to all employers in the private (including commercial semi-state), community, not-for-profit and voluntary sectors and is available to employers who offer any full-time work of over 30 hours per week and spanning at least a 4 day week. There is no limit on the number of new recruits per employer.</p>  <p>  JobsPlus was introduced in July 2013 as one of a series of measures contained in the Action Plan for Jobs to replace two existing schemes; the revenue job assist and the employer job (PRSI) exemption schemes. The scheme offers differentiated levels of subsidies to employers to encourage them to focus recruitment on jobseekers who are longer term unemployed.</p>  <p>  For jobseekers who are over 24 months out of the labour market, a subsidy of &euro;10,000 is paid monthly to the employer over two years.  A subsidy of &euro;7,500 paid monthly over two years is available to employers who recruit a jobseeker who is between 12 and 24 months unemployed.  In 2015, eligibility was broadened to include young jobseekers (under 25 year olds) unemployed for four months or more in the previous 6 months and jobseekers transitioning from a one parent family payment.  A subsidy of &euro;7,500 is payable in both instances.</p></reply>

There are currently more than 27,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP and some 20,000 separate landlords and agents currently in receipt of monthly HAP payments.</p><p>Limerick City and County Council provides a highly effective HAP transactional shared service on behalf of all local authorities. This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord. All landlord costs are recouped via the HAP SSC. </p><p>It should also be borne in mind that the HAP scheme was implemented on a statutory phased pilot basis with an initial 7 local authorities operating the scheme for four months in 2014, an additional 11 in 2015, a further 10 in 2016 and HAP became a national scheme with its extension to the 3 remaining local authorities in the Dublin Region on 1 March 2017.</p><p>Furthermore, revised HAP and Rent Supplement rent limits took effect from 1 July 2016. Additional flexibility to exceed the prescribed maximum rent limits was extended to all local authorities where HAP was operational.</p><p>Taking these factors into account, the annualised cost of the average monthly rent paid to landlords under the HAP scheme in each of the years since the inception of the scheme is as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Average monthly rent paid to landlords under the HAP scheme at year end</th><th>Annualised cost of the average monthly rent paid to landlords under the HAP scheme</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;462</td><td>&euro;5,544</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;527</td><td>&euro;6,324</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;636</td><td>&euro;7,632</td></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>&euro;688<br /><br />(at end of Q.2, 2017)</td><td>&euro;8,256</td></tr></table></p><p>I continue to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.

Critically, &euro;5.35 billion in Exchequer investment has been secured to support its implementation and to deliver 47,000 social housing units through build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, over the period to 2021.</p><p>This level of national funding to implement Rebuilding Ireland's targets means that funding is available to all local authorities, including Donegal County Council, to advance their housing delivery plans. Within the overall 21,000 social housing solutions targeted for delivery this year, some 4,500 of these will be delivered through new builds/acquisitions/refurbishments and a significant proportion of these will involve new construction.</p><p>A comprehensive status report of social housing schemes for all local authority areas can be accessed at the following link: . This status report covers the period up to the end of Quarter 1 of 2017 and lists 607 approved social housing construction projects, delivering 10,000 units, their locations and also includes a range of information relating to their advancement, including those delivered during 2016 and to the end of Quarter 1 of 2017. It also shows those progressing through planning, design and construction. Details in respect of Quarter 2 of 2017 will be published shortly.</p><p>These projects are funded under a range of different initiatives such as local authority construction, turnkey developments, rapid delivery, regeneration programmes and construction and turnkey developments by approved housing bodies. The status report includes 24 construction projects of various scale in County Donegal involving over 300 new social homes. The precise timing for the advancement of each of these projects, including completion dates and tenanting, is a matter for the relevant local authorities and approved housing body concerned, in the first instance.</p><p>Further project approvals are being added to the construction programme as they are developed by local authorities and approved housing bodies, updated details of which will be published on a regular basis. I am keen that all local authorities advance their social housing projects as speedily as possible and I have assured them that funding is in place to support their activity in this regard.</p><p>In addition to these construction schemes, Donegal County Council acquired 100 new social homes in the period since 2015 and have made great progress in returning vacant properties to productive use to further accommodate people on their housing waiting list in the same period.</p><p>There are also a range of other social housing delivery methods that are being utilised alongside traditional construction, including securing new properties under long-term lease agreements, the Rental Accommodation Scheme and the Housing Assistance Payment, all of which will be used to meet the 21,000 social housing solutions targeted for delivery nationally this year. Overall in 2016, over 1,100 social housing solutions were delivered in the Donegal County Council area. A breakdown of this delivery is available on my Departments website at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>Arising from the Social Housing Strategy, targets and provisional funding allocation were notified to Donegal County Council in April 2015 that covered the period out to 2017. Now with the increased national targets under Rebuilding Ireland, increased targets beyond 2017 will be issued to local authorities. These will be based on the most recent statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments, the results of which show that there were 91,600 households on local authority waiting lists as at 21 September 2016. Donegal County Council had 1,267 households qualified for social housing support, compared to 1,675 in 2013, a reduction of 24.4%.</p><p>It is essential that any new targets under Rebuilding Ireland are aligned with the results of the most recent  Summary of Social Housing Assessments, so that delivery and resources can be aligned with the up-to-date, priority housing needs locally. I anticipate new targets for individual local authorities will be finalised and notified to each authority shortly.</p></reply>
