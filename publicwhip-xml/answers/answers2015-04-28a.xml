It is proposed to update certain sections of the existing guidelines. There will also be a number of technical appendices developed to assist planning authorities in relation to noise assessment, monitoring and the setting of planning conditions. Draft guidelines were published in December 2013 for public consultation. Submissions were received from around 7,500 organisations and members of the public during the public consultation period. Following consideration of the submissions, the revisions to the guidelines will be finalised and issued to planning authorities under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.</p>  <p>  Ireland currently has approximately 2,600MW of renewable electricity generation of which 2,200MW is wind generation. It is estimated that between 3,500MW and 4,000MW of renewable electricity generation will be required to achieve the target of 40% renewable electricity by 2020. Given that we already have 2,600MW in place, we will need between approximately 1000MW and 1500MW additional generation to meet our 2020 target.</p>  <p>  My Department is preparing a Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework, which is to be underpinned by a Strategic Environmental Assessment and an Appropriate Assessment. The proposed Framework will be completed in 2015, and will be a high level strategic policy, which is intended for the guidance of persons seeking development consent primarily in relation to large scale renewable electricity projects, as well as for the guidance of planning authorities, statutory authorities and the public. The next stage of public consultation will commence in the coming weeks with the publication of the Draft Strategic Environmental Assessment Scoping Report.</p></reply>

This plan included a measure to close commercial and recreational fisheries for eels. There are reporting obligations under the Regulation and Ireland&rsquo;s first report was submitted in June 2012 and the second report is due by June 2015.</p>  <p>  In that context a review of measures within Ireland&rsquo;s Eel Management Plan, including the cessation of fishing, has already been undertaken in 2012. This review including a comprehensive scientific assessment of eel stocks nationally by the statutorily independent Standing Scientific Committee on Eels. The 2012 review also included a robust public consultation process during which many issues were raised and considered. Full details of the outputs of the public consultation are available on the Inland Fisheries Ireland web site. Similar reviews were carried out across EU Member States as the eel stock has radically declined throughout Europe. </p>  <p>  A further similar review of the measures in Ireland&rsquo;s Eel Management Plan will begin in the coming weeks with a view to submitting the required report to the EU by the end of June 2015. An opportunity for further consultation with, and submissions from, stakeholders will be advanced during that process.</p></reply>

A detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a potential bidder or bidders towards the end of the year and in this regard the tender will be designed in a way that maximise efficiencies and keeps the cost to taxpayers as low as possible.

ESB is working with a number of wave energy project developers to realise this 5MW project off the coast of Clare, and the details in regard to the developers, the procurement process and specific technologies involved are matters for ESB.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the ESB objective is that the WestWave project would be operational by 2020. This is a highly innovative project and it is imperative that the technical solution chosen would be appropriate for the energetic wave conditions on the west coast of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Wave and tidal energy is still at the research, development and demonstration stage globally, and while promising experimental devices have been developed, much more research, development and demonstration is required to bring wave energy technology to commercial viability.</p>  <p>  Policy action across a range of areas is required to support developers in bringing ocean energy devices from prototype to full scale commerciality. This action is being taken in the context of the implementation of the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan published last year, which sets out Government policy in relation to the sustainable development of Ireland&rsquo;s abundant offshore renewable energy resources.</p>  <p>  Exchequer support for ocean research, development and demonstration has been provided to the sector in recent years and is being increased under the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan. In total, my Department has allocated &euro;26.3 million for ocean energy for the period 2013 to 2016. This supports, inter alia, the Prototype Development Fund operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland which provides grant aid for the development of prototype ocean energy devices.</p></reply>

However, the postal sector is undergoing systemic change with migration towards electronic communications resulting in significant core mail volume declines.</p>  <p>  It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company, in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices in the community.</p>  <p>  The post office network has many strengths and can play an important role in the communications sector into the future. For example, it has the largest retail network in the country and was fully computerised some years ago. As a result, it can fill a vital role in the nationwide provision of over-the-counter services to the public, state services and other financial and commercial transactions.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the changing commercial environment, I established the Post Office Network Business Development Group in January of this year to examine the potential from existing and new Government business and commercial business that could be transacted through the post office network as well as identifying the new business opportunities for the network.</p>  <p>  I look forward to the findings of the Group later this year which, I believe, will play a significant part in the future of An Post and the maintenance of the post office network. </p>  <p>  I envisage a strong future for the post office network by using its existing strengths to remain a significant player in the provision of government, financial and other services. It has been long standing policy that An Post remains in a position to compete in a liberalised market and continue to provide wide ranging services to urban and rural communities.</p></reply>

Following a public consultation process on the draft Intervention Strategy this summer, I hope to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. In accordance with EU State Aid guidelines, the procurement process will be technology neutral.</p><p>I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within a 5 year period. </p><p>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government.

The paper underlines EirGrid&rsquo;s renewed efforts to engage with stakeholders and citizens with a view to encouraging greater public participation in the organisation&rsquo;s decision making. Eirgrid are seeking public comments on the discussion paper on or before 22 May 2015 and I would encourage citizens to participate.</p>  <p>  In my engagements with Eirgrid on grid development, I have highlighted the need to address local community and rural concerns, particularly those that are focused on the building of new infrastructure. The discussion document presents an ideal opportunity for all communities, both rural and urban, to provide their views on any future development of electricity transmission infrastructure. The discussion document is consistent with EirGrid&rsquo;s January 2014 commitment to address, in a comprehensive manner, issues of concern to the agriculture, equine and other sectors. </p>  <p>  In December 2014, having carried out a review of its public consultation process, EirGrid announced details of its new approach to enhance future public engagement regarding Grid25 projects. The new approach will involve the development of a more community focussed approach on projects; developing stronger relationships with stakeholders and communities; and seeking support from public representatives and public bodies in explaining energy issues and communicating the benefits of a stronger electricity system.</p>  <p>  As part of these changes, I am advised that Eirgrid is currently finalising specialist reports on addressing concerns relating to agriculture and equine matters and has liaised extensively with relevant key bodies and groups. I understand that those reports will be finalised shortly. I also understand that EirGrid is recruiting liaison officers with appropriate specialist expertise to follow through on its commitments. The liaison officers will be located regionally and will liaise with landowners on relevant rural concerns including agricultural and equine matters.</p></reply>

The Programme is managed by the EPA and co-funded by the EPA, my Department and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency with oversight from a broad based Steering Committee that includes my Department.</p>  <p>  As is usual in major and broad range projects such as this, the project team involves a range of expert institutions and companies and while CDM Smith is the lead consultant in the consortium engaged to carry out the programme of research, the project will be informed by the expert input of all of the participating bodies. The contract for this programme of research was awarded following a robust evaluation process in compliance with public procurement guidelines, where the tender submitted by the CDM Smith headed consortium was evaluated as being the strongest bid. The contract award procedure chosen for this competition was by open procedure. Six tenders were received. The evaluation panel was constituted to include personnel with the capacity to make informed decisions on the tenders received and the constitution of the evaluation panel was approved by the project Steering Committee.</p>  <p>  The research programme is broad in its scope, covering several environmental parameters as well as operational practice and regulatory approaches around the world. CDM Smith is leading a consortium of organisations which are tasked with delivering the detailed objectives and technical aspects of this research programme. The consortium comprises CDM Smith, the British Geological Survey, University College Dublin, Ulster University, Queens University Belfast, AMEC Foster Wheeler and Philip Lee Solicitors, each offering a particular specialism required by the project scope. </p>  <p>  One of the key requirements of the tender process was evidence of expertise in the field. The evaluation panel found that in this regard, that the tender led by CDM Smith provided an excellent response. The overall resourcing of the proposal was considered excellent with excellent legal expertise, a strong and experienced hydrogeological team, an excellent peer-review group proposed with high credibility in addition to a seismology team which was considered to be outstanding. Work undertaken by the consortium is reviewed by the members funding the programme and external experts appointed by them.</p></reply>

In 2013, 7.8% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy with 5.7% of heat demand being met from renewable sources.</p>  <p>  It is expected that most of the 12% renewable heat target will be achieved through the use of biomass technologies. In this regard, the uptake of combined heat and power under REFIT 3, along with the migration by certain heat users to renewable heat in response to market forces, will make a contribution to achieving the target. The requirements of Part L of the Building regulations are also expected to make a contribution to increasing the uptake of renewable heat. </p>  <p>  However, progress towards the renewable heat target is proving to be challenging and analysis by the Sustanable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) suggests that in the absence of additional measures a shortfall in the region of 2 to 4 percentage points could emerge in the heat sector. This would represent between 1 and 2 percentage points in terms of the overall renewable energy target. Any shortfall in meeting the 16% target for 2020 would need to be addressed by purchasing "renewable energy credits" from another EU Member State. While the cost of such credits has yet to be established, the SEAI has estimated that it could be in the range of &euro;100 million to &euro;150 million per percentage point shortfall. There could also be penalties associated with any shortfall. </p>  <p>  Analysis underpinning the Draft Bioenergy Plan, published in October last year, indicates that an additional bioenergy focussed measure in the heat sector would represent the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals including reducing the potential shortfall in our renewable heat levels. The draft Plan recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive to incentivise larger heat users in the industrial and commercial sector to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. A consultation on the development of this scheme will be published by my Department shortly.</p></reply>

Since its publication my Department undertook a public consultation process which included: (i) analysis of over 1200 written submissions and (ii) a series of stakeholder seminars on the various priority areas in the Green Paper. The seminars covered various topics including empowering energy citizens and putting the energy system on a sustainable pathway. A recurring message coming from both the written submissions and the seminars was the role that community energy could play in our future energy systems. The views submitted are being considered in the formation of the new energy policy framework.</p>  <p>  It is important to note the various community level initiatives currently supported by Government, including the development of community energy through the Better Energy Areas and Communities Programme which is administered on behalf of my department by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). The programme allows community and locally based organisations to apply for funding on a competitive basis to support sustainable energy upgrades to existing buildings and facilities. It also promotes the creation and development of locally based entities that can engage and mobilise community resources to lower energy bills and boost local employment.</p>  <p>  My Department is also preparing to publish a Draft Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework. The framework addresses the matter of community engagement and will be published for public consultation in the coming weeks.

The Programme is managed by the EPA and co-funded by the EPA, my Department and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency with oversight from a broad based Steering Committee that includes my Department.</p>  <p>  As is usual in major and broad range projects such as this, the project team involves a range of expert institutions and companies and while CDM Smith is the lead consultant in the consortium engaged to carry out the programme of research, the project will be informed by the expert input of all of the participating bodies. The contract for this programme of research was awarded following a robust evaluation process in compliance with public procurement guidelines, where the tender submitted by the CDM Smith headed consortium was evaluated as being the strongest bid. The contract award procedure chosen for this competition was by open procedure. Six tenders were received. The evaluation panel was constituted to include personnel with the capacity to make informed decisions on the tenders received and the constitution of the evaluation panel was approved by the project Steering Committee.</p>  <p>  The research programme is broad in its scope, covering several environmental parameters as well as operational practice and regulatory approaches around the world. CDM Smith is leading a consortium of organisations which are tasked with delivering the detailed objectives and technical aspects of this research programme. The consortium comprises CDM Smith, the British Geological Survey, University College Dublin, Ulster University, Queens University Belfast, AMEC Foster Wheeler and Philip Lee Solicitors, each offering a particular specialism required by the project scope. </p>  <p>  One of the key requirements of the tender process was evidence of expertise in the field. The evaluation panel found that in this regard, that the tender led by CDM Smith provided an excellent response. The overall resourcing of the proposal was considered excellent with excellent legal expertise, a strong and experienced hydrogeological team, an excellent peer-review group proposed with high credibility in addition to a seismology team which was considered to be outstanding. Work undertaken by the consortium is reviewed by the members funding the programme and external experts appointed by them.</p></reply>

These documents set out the European Union policy to achieve secure, sustainable competitive and affordable energy for all EU energy customers, household and business. Together with my fellow EU energy ministers I have contributed to the debate on the energy union strategy, most recently at energy ministers meetings in Brussels and Riga.</p><p>At the heart of the policy is a vision for an Energy Union composed of an integrated Europe-wide energy system where energy flows freely across borders, based on competition and the efficient use of resources, with effective regulation of energy markets and delivering a sustainable and climate friendly economy that is designed to last and serve the interests of Irish and European consumers. The five dimensions of the Energy Union framework are: energy security based on solidarity and trust; a fully integrated European energy market; energy efficiency contributing to moderation of demand; decarbonising the economy; and research, innovation and competitiveness.</p><p>Among the proposals in the strategy designed to achieve the full integration of the European internal energy market are the full implementation of the Energy Third Package legislation and the enhancement of regional approaches to energy market integration. The Commission also intends to ensure greater transparency in the composition of energy costs and prices by developing regular and detailed monitoring and reporting on energy prices, with particular attention to the role of taxes, levies and national supports. The Commission also intends to prepare an ambitious legislative proposal to redesign the electricity market, including a proposal to link wholesale and retail markets. </p><p>For our part, the Integrated Single Electricity Market Project (I-SEM), led by the regulators in Ireland and Northern Ireland, will deliver improved electricity regional market integration. This will achieve, inter alia, greater competition in the wholesale generation market and greater access to lower wholesale prices in neighbouring markets, with more efficient use of interconnection between the island of Ireland and Great Britain.</p></reply>

The process of identifying the renewable energy technologies to be supported considered the cost and wider environmental benefits that could be delivered by utilising waste as an energy resource. These are now established technologies and are making a contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy targets.</p>  <p>  Ireland is regarded as having a stable and favourable investment environment for renewable energy production and the existing feed-in tariff is a very cost effective tool to support renewable energy production, as outlined in a report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators in January 2015.</p>  <p>  My Department is considering the appropriateness of a new support scheme for renewable electricity, from 2016 onwards, and will examine the available technologies, their cost effectiveness and the level of support required. Any new scheme would be subject to State Aid clearance. The initial public consultation will commence in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Waste materials can also be used in the production of biofuels to displace fossil fuels in the transport sector. Provisional figures for 2014 indicate that almost 59% of the biofuel placed on the market in Ireland, through the Biofuels Obligation Scheme, was produced from waste materials and residues such as used cooking oil and tallow.</p>  <p>  In terms of further developing waste as an energy resource, the draft Bioenergy Plan recommends that the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government would endeavour to optimise the availability of waste for energy and that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would continue its support for innovative energy uses for animal by-products.</p></reply>

The CSO published the Register of Public Sector Bodies (including General Government Bodies) in Ireland in respect of 2014 on 1st April 2015. This register is compiled by the CSO and not all classification decisions are referred to Eurostat - this process is generally reserved for cases which are particularly complex, are the subject of new or changed guidance, or are material to deficit and debt measures.  The register as published on April 1st shows Irish Water as having been provisionally classified to the government sector.  This was in accordance with an approach agreed between CSO and Eurostat during the 2014 EDP dialogue visit, as a prudential measure, in the event that a final classification decision on Irish Water had not been reached by the time of the March EDP notification.  This provisional classification was reflected in the EDP notification sent to Eurostat at the end of March and in the government finance statistics published by the CSO on Monday 20th April.</p>  <p>  An initial classification proposal on Irish Water along with supporting documentation, as required, has been submitted by the CSO to Eurostat. In the submission to Eurostat, Irish Water is forecast to function as a market, publicly-controlled institutional unit, to be classified outside the General Government Sector in the non-financial corporations sector based on the current business plan and financial forecasts. The CSO and Eurostat are now engaging in a process of clarifications which may include the provision of additional material to Eurostat if required.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-28a.100.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015042800060#WRB02300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 65 and 96 together.</p>  <p>  At the outset, I wish to assure the Deputies that the Government is totally committed to maintaining and strengthening MABS and its local delivery of services.  While work is underway exploring how to optimise resources and governance arrangements to the greatest extent possible, I can also assure the Deputies that there will be no diminution of locally-provided services to the public, no closure of service locations, and no staff redundancies.  In fact, the aim of this exploration is to ensure that any efficiencies and savings achieved in governance arrangements can be used to expand and enhance local service delivery.</p>  <p>  The Citizens Information Board (CIB) is the statutory body responsible for providing information, advice (including money and budgeting advice service) and advocacy services on a wide range of public and social services.  CIB delivers on this remit through a network of delivery partners which includes 51 local Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS) and 42 local Citizens Information Services (CIS).  In 2015 the CIB has been allocated a budget of &euro;46m of which some &euro;17.9 million is allocated to the MABS network of companies.  </p>  <p>  There are over 600 permanent staff, approximately 200 scheme workers and an estimated 2,000 volunteers working for the 93 independent companies in the network (51 MABS and 42 CISs).  Each of these companies has a separate voluntary Board of Management, comprising an average of over 9 members per Board resulting in a governance structure of over 800 people.  The maintenance of such an unwieldy company and Board structure is no longer sustainable from an organisational or governance perspective and the resource effort required could otherwise be directed towards improved service delivery to citizens.  Therefore, as part of the implementation of its Strategic Plan 2012-2015, CIB commissioned a feasibility study to identify options for dealing with this issue through greater organisational consolidation and/or integration of its delivery partners.  This work was carried out by a company called Pathfinder and overseen by a Steering Group, comprising national representatives from MABS staff and Boards, Citizens Information Services staff and Boards, and staff from the Citizens Information Board.  The work included extensive and comprehensive consultation with all stakeholders, including representatives of CIB's delivery partner services (MABS and CIS) at local level.  It identified a number of options for consideration. Following on from this, the Board of CIB agreed to the establishment of a Design Group tasked with outlining and recommending possible new structural models.  The Design Group includes members of the voluntary boards and staff of a number of the MABS and CIS services, together with representation from CIB management.  Submissions were sought by CIB from the representatives of Boards and staff of MABS and CIS, to inform the deliberations of the Design Group.</p>  <p>  The Design Group recently furnished a progress report on its deliberations to the CIB executive, which in turn communicated an update to its network of service delivery partners.  The Design Group has identified, as an option for consideration by the Board of CIB in due course, that the 51 Boards of MABS companies and the 42 Boards of CIS companies could be consolidated across six (6) regions, resulting in six (6) independent MABS companies and Boards, and six (6) independent CIS companies and Boards, all reporting to the board of CIB.  However, it is important to note that any such consolidation would be at the Board level only. All existing MABS offices would remain unaffected. Local service delivery and personnel would not be impacted and would continue as before. The proposed option could provide a structure to ensure that advice and input in relation to local issues continues and for networking to maintain local connections.  It may be possible to take any savings that arise and use them for enhancing local service delivery or indeed offering additional services. It is also important to note that neither this option nor any alternative has yet been considered by the Board of CIB.  Accordingly, no decisions have been made by the Board and no proposal has been formally made by it to my Department for consideration.  It is expected that the Design Group&rsquo;s proposed option, when further developed, will be formally submitted to the Board of CIB for its consideration.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-28a.158.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015042800061#WRC02500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 103 and 107 together.</p><p>The rent supplement scheme provides support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. There are approximately 70,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for in 2015. The total paid in respect of rent supplement in 2014 was &euro;338 million. Data in relation to the number of rent supplement tenancies and new tenancies created for the first quarter in each of the last five years is provided in the attached tabular statement.</p><p>The Department recently published a review of the maximum rent limits, &ldquo;Maximum Rent Limit Analysis and Findings&rdquo; and it is available on www.welfare.ie. The review finds that increasing rent limits at this time could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not alone rent supplement recipients, but lower-income workers and students. Between the rent supplement scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market. The State is therefore a very significant player in the sector which has a responsibility not alone to rent supplement recipients but also to the market as a whole, including all those in private accommodation.</p><p>In light of the review&rsquo;s findings, the Department will instead continue to allow for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework. Under this approach, each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances throughout the country, including those in the Kildare area, are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents can be increased above prescribed limits as appropriate. I am satisfied that this is the appropriate response at this time which has assisted in excess of 1,000 rent supplement recipients throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation.</p><p>In addition, the Department in conjunction with Threshold operates a Tenancy Sustainment Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply is most acute.  The primary objective of the Protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance. Of the 1,000 recipients mentioned above, over 530 households in Dublin and some 14 in Cork city have been provided assistance through increased rent limits under the Protocol.</p><p>The review clearly points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting or seeking to rent at this time is the much reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation. The issue of supply is being addressed by Government through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy. My Government colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, is also considering a number of policy options in relation to achieving greater rent certainty. I can assure the Deputies that I am keeping this matter under close review to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided for rent supplement recipients.</p><p>Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct contractual relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme. However, social welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement to a nominated payee such as a landlord on behalf of the tenant. This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department. Recent figures shows that payments direct to nominated payees are made in approximately 20% of cases. A breakdown of expenditure data under rent supplement for nominated payments is not available.</p><p>It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent. Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated. The Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that every effort is made to prevent overpayments, but if they occur, they are regarded as a debt to the Exchequer and every effort is made to recover the amounts due.</p><p><b>Tabular Statement</b></p><p><b>Rent Supplement Tenancies</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Tenancies at End 1st Quarter</th><th>New Tenancies <sup>1</sup>1st Quarter</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>97,288</td><td>10,311</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>94,990</td><td>7,607</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>86,375</td><td>6,571</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>77,731</td><td>5,188</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>69,793</td><td>3,723</td></tr></table><sup>1</sup>Refers to cases that were not awarded at the end of the previous quarter.</p></reply>

Firstly there is the contributory principle.  Under this principle there is a direct link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid as of  right, where a particular contingency arises and without a means test.</p>  <p>  Secondly there is the solidarity principle.  Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable. In this regard, it should be noted that some PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life, or may not be in a position to benefit from one or more such payment. For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another. Similarly, there will be many contributors who would not require coverage for Maternity Benefit, but who nevertheless continue to be levied PRSI at the full rate during their working years.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is a general principle of one person, one payment, which applies across the whole of the social welfare system.  Given the contingency-based nature of this system, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time.  For example, an unemployed person may become sick.  As a consequence, if a person experiences more than one of these contingencies at the same time, he or she can receive only one of those payments.  This principle is common to social security systems across the world.</p>  <p>  There were a limited number of exceptions in the social insurance system to the general principle of one person, one payment.  These exceptions usually applied in the context of short-term benefits.  For instance, recipients of One-Parent Family Payment, Widows and Widowers Pensioners etc. could, until recent years, also receive short-term social insurance benefits, such as Illness Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit at half-rate at the same time.</p>  <p>  These overlapping payment arrangements were introduced in the early 1950s when the social insurance system was first established, at a time when there were only 10 individual social welfare payments and when rates were significantly lower in real terms than they are now.  </p>  <p>  The social welfare system has been significantly developed over the intervening period, with the result that the number of possible combinations of concurrent contingencies has increased greatly.</p>  <p>  In the context of the difficult fiscal environment in recent years and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to maintain existing core rates of primary payments for social welfare recipients, the concurrent payment of half-rate Illness Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit in addition to One-Parent Family Payment, Widows and Widowers Pensions etc. was discontinued from January 2012.</p>  <p>  It is realistic and prudent to maintain the underlying principle of entitlement to only one payment at any one time, that is, one person, one payment.  To do otherwise could potentially involve very significant and unsustainable additional expenditure in the long-term. </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, published in 2012 found that Fund has a strong redistributive nature. This is demonstrated by the fact that those on lower incomes fare considerably better than those on higher incomes and the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-28a.280.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015042800064#WRF00300"><p>The &lsquo;marriage bar&rsquo;, a requirement that women leave paid employment on entering marriage, was a condition of employment within most sectors of the public service until 1973.  A number of private sector employers operated similar restrictions at that time, generally in respect of &lsquo;white collar&rsquo; positions, notably in the financial sector.  The marriage bar was abolished in the public service in 1973, and similar provisions in the private sector were made illegal in 1977, by legislation prohibiting discrimination in employment on grounds of sex.  </p>  <p>  Issues relating to public sector employment and pensions are the responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. In general, civil and public servants recruited at that time paid a modified rate of PRSI (i.e. not the full Class A rate) which gave coverage for widow(er)'s and orphan's pensions, occupational injury benefit, bereavement grant and carer&rsquo;s benefit only. It did not provide cover for the State pension.   The modified rate of social insurance was a condition of employment for public servants at that time. Accordingly, even if those affected by the marriage bar in the public service had continued in employment, contributions paid at this rate would not have given entitlement to a State pension (contributory) under the social welfare system. </p>  <p>  It is not possible to estimate how many women in the private sector faced an equivalent requirement to leave their jobs upon marriage, nor how many of these would then have taken up employment with other employers that had no such policy.  At that time equivalents to the current jobseeker's benefit and allowance schemes were available to persons suffering the contingency of unemployment in a manner similar to that which exist today and there were provisions whereby persons not entitled to benefit or assistance could protect their social insurance record via credited contributions. </p>  <p>  Information provided to workers at the time clearly notified them with regard to the provision of credits, and persons leaving employment were also advised of the potential to continue making social insurance contributions via the voluntary contributions system.  Credits would generally only have been available to persons who were available for and genuinely seeking full-time work.</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.</p>  <p>  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes. The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  However, it is important to note that the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a SPC. The standard qualifying conditions for the SPC must also be satisfied. These require a person to enter insurable employment at least ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate (credited contributions do not satisfy this condition) and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited on their record. </p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support. If someone has paid little or no PRSI, they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;219, which amounts to just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory). Alternatively, if their spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory), they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just under 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory). </p></reply>

There has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to contribute to their pension scheme.  Rather, when a DB scheme is set up, the level of employer and employee contributions is agreed and established in contract in each schemes Trust Deeds and Rules.  The Trust Deeds and Rules differ from scheme to scheme, and as with any contractual situation, reflect the parameters on the level of obligation of the parties involved.  </p>  <p>  The trustees of a pension scheme are required under the Pensions Act, to maintain sufficient assets in a defined benefit pension scheme to meet the liabilities of the scheme in the event of the wind up of a scheme. Where a scheme fails to meet this requirement, the trustees of the scheme are required to submit a proposal to the Pensions Authority setting out how it is proposed to restore funding to the level required.</p>  <p>  The imposition of a debt on an employer or the provision of a pension protection fund has been considered in the context of measures introduced in recent years to support employers and the trustees of defined benefit pension schemes respond to the funding challenges facing many schemes. However,  given  the uncertainties as to the overall impact and potential for unintended consequences of applying debt on the employer selectively or otherwise, having regard to the small size of the defined benefit sector, and given the administrative complexities and costs associated with a pension protection fund, these measures were not progressed.  I  am satisfied that the measures put in place in recent years take an approach which will support schemes with funding difficulties to gradually move to more sustainable funding position. </p>  <p>  I must acknowledge that employers have, by and large, made great efforts to support and deliver on the pension promise made to scheme members.  As you aware, this process is generally managed through dialogue between trustees, employers and members, where efforts are made to reach agreement regarding the steps that must be taken to secure scheme viability.  These may include a mix of measures such as increased employer/member contributions, longer working or a restructuring of scheme benefits.</p></reply>

The Revenue Commissioners may assign responsibility in respect of functions in accordance with Section 9 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997. There is no compromise of the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). </p>  <p>  The Board of the Revenue Commissioners are independent in the management of Revenue and are extremely careful in ensuring proper governance and oversight of their compliance programmes including in relation to investigations and prosecutions.  I have no concerns about their governance arrangements in this area, and Revenue have provided the following additional background details for the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Solicitor's Division provides legal services for the Revenue Commissioners in a range of matters including the conduct of tax, customs, and general litigation before the Courts (in which the Division is generally named as the solicitor on record) and the Appeal Commissioners and other administrative tribunals, as well as providing legal advice on strategic and operational matters for Revenue. </p>  <p>  The Investigations and Prosecutions Division is responsible for leading Revenue's criminal investigation function but in addition oversees the national investigation functions including national and international initiatives aimed at cross border fraud, drug smuggling and diversion of taxable goods, management of the intelligence function and the oversight of the Offshore Assets Group and other large scale evasion programmes.</p>  <p>  The preparation of the cases for prosecution of summary offences is managed by the Prosecutions and Seizures Unit of the Border, Midlands and West (BMW) Division in Bridgend, Co. Donegal.  That Division is under the management of the Assistant Secretary for the BMW Region. The Revenue Solicitor/Assistant Secretary is responsible for the Revenue Solicitor's Division and the Investigations and Prosecutions Division and has no role in the management of the Prosecutions and Seizures Unit of BMW Division. </p>  <p>  The offences which are investigated by the Investigations and Prosecutions Division are indictable offences. An investigation is only commenced once it has been accepted as suitable for investigation by the Revenue Prosecution Admissions Committee.  The Assistant Secretary for the Investigations and Prosecutions Division is not a member of that Committee.  </p>  <p>  The Revenue Solicitor's Division may advise the Investigations and Prosecutions Division on the sufficiency of evidence and the appropriateness of charges in individual cases. Once the Investigations and Prosecutions Division has undertaken its investigation, the cases are transferred to the Revenue Solicitor's Division for preparation for potential onward transmission to the DPP. It is the DPP that decides on whether there should be a prosecution or not based on the file sent to it by the Revenue Solicitor's Division.  The DPP is an independent office. The internal management of Revenue functions does not affect that independence.</p></reply>

DIRT has been charged at 41% from the 1st January 2014 and is deducted at source by deposit takers (e.g. banks, building societies, credit unions, Post Office Savings Bank, etc.) from interest paid or credited on deposits of Irish residents.</p><p>The net yield from DIRT collected in the past three financial years amounts to &euro;1,516.8 million.

The incentive provides tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence. In the recent Budget I extended the scheme to include rental properties, whose owners are subject to income tax.</p>  <p>  Qualifying expenditure is expenditure subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.  The work must cost a minimum of &euro;4,405 (exclusive of VAT) which would attract a credit of &euro;595.  Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 (exclusive of VAT) a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply. The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out.   </p>  <p>  The tax credit is only available to the homeowner and not to children or other individuals who may fund the works. However, as the Deputy has mentioned, a Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability is available from local authorities. This scheme provides grant aid to applicants to assist in the carrying out of works that are reasonably necessary for the purposes of rendering a house more suitable for the accommodation needs of a person with a disability. The grant can assist with changes and adaptations to a home such as making it wheelchair accessible, extending it to create more space, adding a ground floor bathroom or toilet or installing a stair lift. This grant, which is means tested, can cover up to 95% of the cost of works carried out, which is far more generous than the relief available under the Home Renovation Incentive. </p>  <p>  Works which are grant-aided also qualify for the Home Renovation Incentive. Three times the value of the grant is deducted from overall expenditure, with any remainder attracting the tax credit of 13.5%. This is to align with best fiscal practice in that relief is not provided twice for the same expenditure. It is worth noting that the deduction in respect of grant-aided work is not taken into consideration for the purposes of reaching the minimum spend threshold of &euro;4,405, excluding VAT.</p>  <p>  My understanding is that applications for housing adaptation grants from local authorities are prioritised based on medical need. Therefore the grant scheme is highly targeted. </p>  <p>  Given the existing supports available, particularly for those on low incomes, through their access to the grant scheme, I am not predisposed to expanding the tax relief available under HRI for works that are funded by family members.</p></reply>

Other reasons for redaction as set out by the deciding officer, included that information contained in the records was obtained in confidence and that some records contained commercially sensitive information.  I believe my officials have provided you with a copy of this original FOI request, setting out the original question asked and the schedule to the documents released which includes the basis for their refusal by the deciding officer in line with the FOI Act 2014.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware these documents, along with others, have since been released under a subsequent FOI request which posed a broader question.  This FOI request asked for documents relating to meetings held with IBRC and was not specific to the company referred to in the question.  As a result the documents released under this request are less redacted as more material is relevant to the question.  The documents released under this request, including the schedule of documents and the reason for any refusal or redaction, are available on the Department of Finance website through the following link: .</p></reply>

In this regard solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners, who have responsibility for the collection of solid fuel carbon tax, advise me that, since its introduction on 1 May 2013, tax receipts for peat-related fuel products for the period of May to December 2013 and the period of January to December 2014, amounted to &euro;1,479,678 and &euro;4,291,892, respectively.  Tax receipts for coal related products for 2013 and 2014 amounted to &euro;5,625,248 and &euro;13,186,765, respectively.  The increase in tax receipts in 2014 reflects the increase in the rate of solid fuel carbon tax on 1st May 2014 from &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 emitted to &euro;20 per tonne of CO2 emitted. </p><p>The Commissioners advise me that they are unable to provide an assessment of the impact of the tax on sales of peat- related fuels.  However, in light of the forecast by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) in 2010, that the use of peat as an energy source would continue to decline in the period to 2020, the Commissioners expect that sales of peat-related products have reduced in the period since the tax was introduced and will continue to decline.

The Commissioners now apply these definitions when determining eligibility for charitable tax exemption.  The definitions are classified under four main headings:</p><p>1. The prevention or relief of poverty or economic hardship.</p><p>2. The advancement of education.</p><p>3. The advancement of religion.</p><p>4. Any other purpose that is of benefit to the community.</p><p>Prior to the Charities Act of 2009, and because the Tax Acts do not define charity or charitable purposes, Revenue relied on the general law and judicial decisions to determine a definition.  In this regard, an 1891 House of Lords judgment was the benchmark used to determine the legal meaning of charity.  This ruling also classified charitable purposes under four headings, known as the 'Pemsel Categories' and these closely mirror the four categories now contained in the 2009 Act. </p><p>The Charities Act of 2009 also provides for the creation of a Charity Regulator, which was established on 16 October 2014.  The role of the Regulator is to oversee compliance by Charities with their legal obligations and to ensure proper governance in respect of registration, the preparation of statements of account and the submission of annual activity reports (to the Regulator). </p><p>With regard to the second question, where a Body/Trust is aggrieved by a Revenue refusal to grant a charitable tax exemption, it is entitled to appeal that decision to the independent Appeal Commissioners.  However, there is no provision in the Tax Acts for a 3rd party to appeal the granting of a charitable tax exemption to a specific Body/Trust.</p></reply>

The Limerick revaluation will mean a reduction in the rates liability for 65% of ratepayers in that area.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the Limerick revaluation has led to large increases in the valuation of wind farms which could, subject to appeal, see the rates liability on those wind farms rise by c.200%.  Wind farms in other counties are not directly impacted by this revaluation.  I am also aware of the calls for the amendment to the Valuation Act 2001 referred to in the question.  The potential impact on the sector, of the revaluation in Limerick was raised at both D&aacute;il Committee and Report Stages of the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012, which has since been enacted.  </p>  <p>  The Valuation Act 2001 provides for an appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation, a subsequent appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal and an appeal to the High Court on a point of law.  I understand that appeals on the Limerick revaluations have been lodged with the Commissioner of Valuation.  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his functions and I, as Minister, have no function in the valuation of property for rates purposes or in an appeal.  This includes expressing a view on the  valuation of one type of property compared to another.  This is a matter for the qualified staff of the independent Commissioner of Valuation which can be tested using the appeals processes provided.  It is important to allow the independent process of valuation and appeal to take its course before a full assessment can be undertaken or any other actions considered, including whether the proposed amendment mentioned by the Deputy would be appropriate or necessary.</p>  <p>  The Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 was signed into law on 23rd April 2015. While there were calls to delay the passage of the Bill to allow further consideration of the issue raised, the main objective of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 is to accelerate the revaluation programme. It would not have been fair on ratepayers in counties that have yet to be revalued to delay measures that will accelerate this process while we await the outcome of appeals and further consideration of the impact of the revaluation on one sector.  As was stated in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad it is acknowledged that the revaluation has implications for the Wind Energy sector and, if after a full analysis of the situation post appeal, a legislative change is considered necessary, then appropriate consideration can be given to the matter at that stage.</p></reply>

PSPR reduces the value of those qualifying public service pensions.  It is a progressively structured measure, and as such takes account of the position of persons in receipt of modest-sized pensions.  Specifically in this regard, all pensions below &euro;12,000 are exempt from PSPR, while pensions below &euro;32,500 are exempt from additional PSPR measures legislated for in 2013 via the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.  In addition, for those pensions which are affected by PSPR, the reduction is proportionately greater for higher-value pensions than for lower-value pensions.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I am required to review the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009-2013 annually and cause a written report of my findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  As part of that review I consider whether the various measures, including the PSPR, continue to be necessary, having regard to the purposes of the legislation.  In my most recent report laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in June 2014 I concluded that the continuation of the PSPR remained necessary.</p>  <p>  However, as the economic and fiscal conditions move towards a more sustainable position, I believe it will be necessary to prepare for an orderly wind-down of the financial emergency legislation.  In this context, and as I have previously indicated, it would be my intention, as a matter of priority and at the earliest date economic progress permits, to move towards reducing the burden of public service pension reductions, with the initial focus on the people in receipt of low pensions.</p></reply>

On that basis, unless it was granted an exemption, the Irish Red Cross would automatically have become subject to FOI under the Act earlier this month.</p>  <p>  I accepted the case made by the Department of Defence that the inclusion of the Society for FOI purposes represented an anomaly in that it had to be established under legislation to ensure, in accordance with the Geneva Convention, that only one Red Cross Society could exist in the State.  It is a charitable organisation operating in an environment where both Exchequer resources and charitable donations have been reducing in recent years.  Application of FOI would represent a cost for the body which would require some diversion of resources at a time when other similar organisations are not facing such costs.    </p>  <p>  On the basis of the arguments outlined above, I agreed to make an Order under Section 6 of the FOI Act 2014 to provide an exemption from FOI for the Irish Red Cross.  This Order was debated at the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform on 1 April and in both the Dail and the Seanad on 2 April.  Before an Order can be made under Section 6 of the FOI Act, a positive resolution of both Houses is required.  These resolutions were made on 2 April.  The Order (S.I. 144 of 2015) was made on 13 April 2015.</p>  <p>  Consideration will be given in due course to the application of FOI to bodies in receipt of Exchequer funding, including the Irish Red Cross and other similar organisations, by way of Order under Section 7 of the FOI Act.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Act and the making of valuations is his sole prerogative.  The statute does not accord me as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform any function in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Valuation Act, 2001 provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose and constructions affixed thereto, such as plant, motive power and electricity generating facilities, including turbines, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act.  Such exempt buildings would ordinarily include domestic dwellings, farm buildings, those used for public worship, education and health-care provided on a not-for-profit basis, buildings occupied and used for charitable purposes and buildings occupied by certain societies established for the advancement of science, literature and the fine arts which are used exclusively for that purpose and otherwise than for private profit. </p>  <p>  I am conscious of the need to minimise costs on business and employment, including commercial rates.  Local Authorities have implemented efficiencies and have cut their budgets over the last number of years, but income from commercial rates remains an important source of revenue to provide services locally.  The compilation and maintenance of valuation lists of all commercial property by the independent Valuation Office aims to ensure that the rates burden is shared in an equitable way by the ratepayers in each local authority area.  The basic rationale is that the commercial property of all persons that occupy that property with the intention of making a profit is rateable.  The equal treatment of all such property is intended to provide equal treatment to all ratepayers. Exempting specific sub-sets of property would introduce anomalies and inequites.    </p>  <p>  While it is not clear if the issue the Deputy is referring to is the same,  I am aware of concerns with the valuation of wind farms  that have arisen from the revaluation of all commercial property in Limerick, in relation to increases in rates liability for those that operate them.  These valuations are under appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation.  There were calls for changes to the valuation legislation in the Bill that was recently enacted as the Valuation Amendment Act 2015 and which will be commenced shortly. The Valuation Act 2001 provides for an appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation and subsequent appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal and to the High Court on a point of law. In considering the Bill, it was decided that the independent valuation and appeals process should be allowed to run its course before a full consideration of the impact of the revaluation on the sector can be undertaken.  If the conclusion from that full consideration is that legislative change is necessary, then appropriate consideration can be given to the matter at stage.</p></reply>

KCC's submission included for strengthening works at Incherea, Glenbeigh and both repair and strengthening works at Cromane Lower.  The Council was advised by the OPW that strengthening works were outside of the scope of the Government Decision and that only the repair element of projects, such as that at Cromane Lower, were covered under the allocation.  The OPW approved KCC's programme of repair works, which included &euro;30,000 for Cromane Lower.

Work is continuing on the preparations for the full implementation of the Act, as the commencement of the Act is dependent on a number of factors set out in the legislation.  These factors include the appointment of a Chairperson and Panel of Adjudicators by Minister Nash.  The selection of the adjudicators for this Panel will be achieved through an open competitive process to be arranged by the Public Appointments Service, at the earliest opportunity. Minister Nash is also overseeing the preparation of a Code of Practice for the conduct of adjudications, which will be binding on all adjudicators operating under the Act.  The drafting of the Code is at an advanced stage and will be finalised after consultations have concluded with the relevant construction industry stakeholders.  A specific date for implementation of the Act will be announced in advance once the necessary arrangements have been finalised, in order to provide sufficient notice to those affected by the Act's provisions.</p></reply>

In particular the law relating to receivership is found in Part VII of the Companies Act 1963 as amended by Part VIII of the Companies Act 1990. However, for the most part, the relevant law is made up of rules which the courts have developed by applying general contract law and equitable principles.  The Companies Act, 2014, which is to be commenced on 1 June 2015, substantially re-enacts existing law on receivership.  The most important change to the existing law is the codification of the powers of receivers in section 437 of the Act, which until now has been contained in case law. This change is in line with the position of other common law countries. </p>  <p>  Additionally, various aspects of the law of receivership have been updated in light of technological advances. Existing requirements relating to business letters of companies in receivership have been extended to cover e-mails and websites and the requirement that the appointment and removal of receivers should be published in a daily newspaper has been replaced by the requirement that they be published in the CRO Gazette, which is freely available online.  </p>  <p>  As part of its Work Programme 2014 - 2016 the Company Law Review Group will be examining the area of receivership law and I look forward to receiving its Report in due course.</p></reply>

It should be noted that site visits are only one part of a longer negotiation process between IDA Ireland and a client company and it is important to note that data on site visits is not a true measure nor does it reflect the level of FDI activity in a Region or in a county.  Depending on the sector scale and complexity of the investment won by IDA Ireland, there could be a lead period of up to 3 to 5 years before an investment is fully implemented as approved.  The final decision as to where to locate an investment does and always will reside with the client company.  Approximately 70% of all FDI investment won by IDA Ireland comes from its existing client base.  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with all of its client companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and encourage their growth, development and continuing re investment in their sites. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland does not have a property portfolio and, where necessary, IDA Ireland provides property solutions for Enterprise Ireland client companies. </p><p>In Donegal, IDA Ireland has two business parks and an office park in Letterkenny. Additionally IDA is delivering a 23,649.08 ft&sup2; (2,197m&sup2;) Advance Office Building in Letterkenny to facilitate future investment and there is a  9,569ft&sup2;<sup></sup>Advance Technology Unit on Letterkenny Business Park as well as a 26,350ft&sup2;<sup></sup>Advance Technology Building on Letterkenny Business &amp;amp; Technology Park.</p><p>IDA Ireland markets Donegal as part of the North West Region, along with Counties Leitrim and Sligo.  There are 41 multinational companies based in the North West, employing 5,294 across the Region of which, 2,612 - almost 50% - are employed in County Donegal alone.  The Annual Employment Survey shows that employment in IDA Ireland client companies in Donegal rose by over 40% since this Government took office, rising from 1,854 at the end of 2010 to 2,612 in 2014.<font color="#FF0000">  </font>Indeed, the Quarterly Household Survey shows that in the past two years unemployment in the Border area, which includes Donegal, has fallen from 16.5% in Q4 2012 to 10% in Q4 2014.  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for the 5-year period 2015 to 2019 was recently launched.  In that Strategy, the Agency set itself a target of winning 900 investments over the 5-year period and of increasing the level of investments won into in each region by between 30% and 40% during the lifetime of the Strategy.</p></reply>

The Survey also shows that the number of IDA Ireland client companies in Limerick rose from 40 to 48.  The tabular statement gives employment details in respect of each of the years 2010 to 2014 inclusive.  The investment projects that IDA is seeking to attract to Limerick today are much different to those of the past. IDA&rsquo;s strategy is to re-position Limerick as part of the wider mid west Region as a hotspot for knowledge based industry, while focusing on marketing Limerick as a key location for investment by building on the strengths already evident in the county. </p><p>To support this strategy, IDA Ireland works closely with educational institutions in the region to develop the skill sets necessary to attract high value-added employment to the county.  IDA is also working closely with its existing client base to encourage additional investment, particularly in activities such as R&amp;amp;D, customer support and back office functions.  IDA works closely with Shannon Commercial Properties in the provision of suitable property solutions for potential investors to the county.  </p><p>Limerick&rsquo;s FDI base is concentrated for the most part in the city environs of the National Technology Park and Raheen.  During 2014, there were 6 IDA investment announcements in the Limerick area.  Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson - Information Technology Shared Services announced plans in December to create a development centre with 100 new jobs.  Filtertek, based in Newcastlewest, announced its expansion of 35 new manufacturing roles over the next five years.  Optel Vision, as part of its European expansion, will create 140 new jobs.  ViaGoGo already has over 100 staff in Limerick and has announced plans to open a purpose-built international operations centre in Limerick.  In April 2014, another Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson company, Ethicon Biosurgery Ireland, announced the development of an &euro;80 million manufacturing facility in Plassey, which will result in approximately 270 new jobs.  Finally, Kemp Technologies announced the creation of 50 new high-end technology-based positions over the next three years, almost trebling its workforce.</p><p>To date in 2015, there have already been 4 investment announcements by IDA Ireland client-companies in Limerick.  As recently as last week, Dell announced that it is creating 100 new Innovation Technology R&amp;amp;D roles at its Limerick Campus.  Northern Trust announced it is expanding its operation at its second site in Limerick, creating a further 300 jobs, bringing their Limerick operations to over 1,000 staff by 2017.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-28a.444.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015042800067#WRJJ01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 to 164, inclusive, together.</p><p>The Annual Employment Survey provides details on the numbers of jobs created and lost in companies that are supported by the enterprise development agencies.  Information is collected on an annual basis and aggregated at county level only.  Information is provided by the companies on a confidential basis for statistical purposes only so it is not possible to provide information for individual locations.  Details of the numbers employed in IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland client companies in each of the years 2010 to 2014 for the counties of Louth and Meath are set out in the tabular statement.</p><p>I am informed by IDA Ireland that in the two year period 2013 and 2014 there were 14 sites visits by potential investors to County Louth and 3 such visits to County Meath.  The number of site visits to each county in each year is set out in the tabular statement.</p><p>It should be noted that site visits are only one part of a longer negotiation process between IDA Ireland and a client company and it is important to note that data on site visits is not a true measure nor does it reflect the level of FDI activity in a Region or in a County.  Depending on the sector scale and complexity of the investment won by IDA Ireland, there could be a lead period of up to 3 to 5 years before an investment is fully implemented as approved.  The final decision as to where to locate an investment does and always will reside with the client company.  Approximately 70% of all FDI investment won by IDA Ireland comes from its existing client base.  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with all of its client companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and encourage their growth, development and continuing re investment in their sites.</p><p>In respect of property, Enterprise Ireland does not have a property portfolio and, where necessary, IDA Ireland provides property solutions for Enterprise Ireland client companies.  There are IDA Business and Technology Parks located in both Drogheda and Dundalk, while in County Meath there is a Business park located in Navan.  In addition IDA has developed a major land bank at Mullagharlin to the south of the town of Dundalk.  This extends to 150 acres in two parcels of 110 acres and 40 acres respectively.  These lands currently have valid planning permission in place for an Advance Biopharmaceutical and Knowledge Industry Campus which will support biopharmaceutical administration, research and support activities.  The planning permission is valid until 2018.</p><p>In February of this year, as part of its Regional Action Plan for Jobs, the Government announced the provision of additional capital funding of &euro;150 million over 5 years to IDA Ireland to enable it to provides a variety of property solutions designed to win additional projects for the regions outside Dublin and Cork.  These will involve advance buildings, improvements of existing parks, and the acquisition and servicing of suitable sites.  About 30% of the money has been allocated to the construction of nine advance facilities.  One of the new planned advanced building solutions will be in IDA&rsquo;s Dundalk Business and Technology Park.  The design and planning process is due to commence in the fourth quarter of this year.</p><p>IDA regularly monitors the market to maintain an awareness of available land and buildings, in the private sector, suitable to FDI.  Finally, the inclusion of Kells in the national Regional Aid Map will further enhance the prospects of attracting new investment and the expansion of existing enterprises, both foreign and indigenous, in County Meath.  Two US companies opened their offices in Kells in November 2014 as a result of the Succeed in Ireland Initiative, which is implemented by Connect Ireland on behalf of IDA Ireland.  <div><b>Table showing the numbers employed in IDA Ireland client companies in County Louth and County Meath each year from 2010 to 2014</b></div><table><tr><th>-</th><th>County Louth</th><th>County Meath</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>1,322</td><td>1,214</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1,511</td><td>1,270</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1,881</td><td>1,204</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>2,568</td><td>1,229</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>3,029</td><td>1,252</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table showing the numbers employed in Enterprise Ireland client companies in County Louth and Meath in each year from 2010 to 2014</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>County Louth</th><th>County Meath</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>4,885</td><td>4,798</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>5,273</td><td>5,120</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>5,009</td><td>5,368</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>5,032</td><td>6,072</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>5,434</td><td>6,658</td></tr></table><div><b>Table showing number of IDA sponsored site visits by potential investors to County Louth and County Meath in 2013 and 2014</b></div><table><tr><th>-</th><th>County Louth </th><th>County Meath </th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>10</td><td>2</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In 2014, &euro;6.4 million in new grants was paid to EI clients in the City and County through a wide range of supports.</p><p>EI is specifically targeting potential business start-ups through a number of support programmes including:</p><p>- EI on behalf of my Department held a Stakeholder Forum in Limerick on 16 April 2015 as part of the planning process for the Regional Action Plan for Jobs for the Mid-West Region.</p><p>- EI ran a Competitive Regional Feasibility Fund of 250K in the Mid-West Region which closed on 18 November 2014.  There were 17 applications received from the four counties.</p><p>- EI participated in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation &lsquo;Taking Care of Business&rsquo; Information Day for Enterprises in Limerick in March 2014.</p><p>Through the Industrial Development Agency (IDA), State supported FDI employment in Limerick, as per the Annual Employment Survey 2014, comprised 48 companies employing 7,906 people. </p><p>The investment projects that IDA is seeking to attract to Limerick today are much different to those of the past, relying principally on the skills of its people and on a strong business and educational infrastructure to pull investment to the County.  IDA&rsquo;s strategy is to re-position the region as a hotspot for knowledge-based industry, while focusing on marketing Limerick as a key location for investment by building on the strengths already evident in the County.  To support this strategy, IDA Ireland works closely with Educational Institutions in the region to develop the skill sets necessary to attract high value-added employment to the County.  IDA is also working closely with the existing base of employers to encourage additional investment, particularly in activities such as Research &amp;amp; Development, customer support and back office functions.  IDA works closely with Shannon Commercial Properties in the provision of suitable property solutions for potential investors to the County.  </p><p>There were a number of important investment announcements in County Limerick during 2014.  To date in 2015, the following 4 investment announcements were made for Limerick and Shannon.</p><p><b></b>April 2015: Dell announced that it is creating 100 new Innovation Technology R&amp;amp;D roles at its Limerick Campus.

In this regard, the question of pensioner groups having access to the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery in pursuing pension scheme grievances is an issue to which careful consideration has been given. </p>  <p>  In doing so, it was important to keep in mind that the industrial relations system in Ireland is voluntary in nature both as regards access to the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Any change to that principle which would put in place a mandated right to be part of the process would alter fundamentally the conduct of industrial relations. </p>  <p>  As it stands, where changes to pension schemes are negotiated at company level whether as a result of a crisis in the scheme or otherwise, the outcome of that engagement cannot, of itself, change the pension scheme.  Rather, any proposed changes to the scheme are effected through the trust deeds and rules of the scheme and are at the discretion of the parties so designated in the rules/deeds of the scheme.  In my view, it is within this framework, rather than through the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery, that a collective approach would be most effective.</p>  <p>  In terms of changes to pension schemes generally, the Trustees of a particular pension scheme are required by law to act in the best interests of all the members, be they active, deferred, or pensioner members.  Until recently, this has been done on an individual basis.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection has now provided for the recognition by trustees and the Pensions Authority of groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members of a particular pension scheme.  The required revised section 50 guidance has been published by the Pensions Authority.</p>  <p>  From now on, the trustees of a pension scheme are required to notify the groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members where the trustees of a scheme propose to apply to the Pensions Authority to restructure scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act.  This notification affords the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such proposals. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Pensions Authority is now required to notify groups representing the interest of scheme members where the Pensions Authority proposes to either issue a unilateral direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to the trustees of a scheme to restructure scheme benefits or to wind up a pension scheme under section 50B of the Pensions Act.  This notification affords the representative group an opportunity to make representations to the Pensions Authority in relation to such proposals.</p></reply>

For example, disease levels currently in the County, in terms of herd incidence, are less than one-third of the levels recorded in 2008 and, at 2.22%, are in fact currently below the national average level of 2.51%.</p>  <p>  As regards wild deer, the position is that under the wildlife Acts responsibility for this species in the State rests with the Minister for of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I understand that there is an annual open season during which deer can legally be shot under licence. Control of deer on private property is the responsibility of landowners who may apply to the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.  These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands. Permissions are issued by D/AHG where there is evidence of such damage.</p>  <p>  I might also mention that, arising from the contacts between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, a non-statutory Irish Deer Management Forum to look specifically at tackling the range of issues around deer has recently had its inaugural meeting.

Personnel who leave the Defence Forces or who vacate a married quarter property that had been assigned to them are required under regulations to return vacant possession of that property. Where the property is not vacated those remaining in the property are overholding and, as they have no right under military regulations to hold or reside in military accommodation, the Department will in accordance with normal procedures continue to seek to recover possession from them.</p>  <p>  While each case of overholding is dealt with on an individual basis, it is important to remember that the Department does not have a role in the provision of housing accommodation for the general public. The Department does however assist in whatever way it can in order to resolve the cases of overholding without recourse to legal action, as it is preferable not to have to use legal means to obtain vacant possession of the properties concerned. However, any initiative to resolve overholding must support and complement the current policy of withdrawing from the provision of married quarters.</p>  <p>  The majority of properties being overheld at the Curragh Camp are located within barracks and therefore are not for sale to occupants as they are required to be retained for future military use. Those few properties that are located in the vicinity of the camp are offered for sale to the occupants and indeed many such properties have been purchased by those occupants over the years.</p>  <p>  The securing of alternative housing is a matter for the individuals concerned in the first instance. If individuals are not in a position to secure housing in their own right it may be the case that they qualify for social housing or that they qualify for some level of housing assistance and, when requested to do so, the Department provides whatever documentation it can to support such applications.</p>  <p>  The Department initiated discussion with Kildare County Council to determine whether there was a possibility of a joint initiative to provide solutions to the overholding issues in the Curragh. The Council indicated at the time that due to budgetary constraints their policy now is to lease suitable properties in order to provide accommodation for those who meet the criteria for social housing assistance. My Department will however continue to remain open to considering any initiatives that might be put forward by the local authority in this regard.</p></reply>

I am satisfied that it has made substantial improvements to its governance framework in recent years which comply with the standards set by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross, and also the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Committee of Public Accounts report on the Irish Red Cross Society published in 2012.</p>  <p>  All of the recommendations made were carefully examined and noted by my Department and the reforms introduced by the Society were substantially facilitated by the legislative amendments made by this Government in 2012 which represented the most wide ranging and fundamental set of changes to have occurred since the establishment of the Society in 1939.  Furthermore, in accordance with a Programme for Government commitment, my Department is continuing to progress a legal review of the basis, structures and governance of the Irish Red Cross.  In this regard, it is proposed that the existing primary legislation which dates back to 1938 is to be repealed in new primary legislation that will re-define the relationship between Government and the Irish Red Cross Society.  This will further underpin the independence of the Society.  Draft Heads of the Red Cross Bill are currently being finalised.</p>  <p>  Arising from the legislative changes made in 2012, the current legislation provides that Government may nominate up to 10% of the membership of the Society&rsquo;s General Assembly. The three year term of the existing Government nominees will end shortly and accordingly I am planning to bring a Memorandum to Government presently seeking approval for the nomination of up to three people to the General Assembly of the Society.</p>  <p>  The payment of my Department&rsquo;s annual grant to the Society is kept under review on an ongoing basis and currently amounts to &euro;869,000.  This consists of a grant of &euro;739,000 towards the salary and administration costs of running its headquarters and the Government&rsquo;s annual contribution of &euro;130,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross.

This is organised criminal activity in the smuggling of vulnerable people who are regarded by the gangs involved as utterly expendable.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan, TD, and I attended an emergency joint meeting of EU Foreign and Interior Affairs Ministers in Luxemburg on Monday, 20 April 2015 and the Taoiseach attended the Emergency European Council in Brussels on Thursday, 23 April 2015.  The purpose of theses meetings was to discuss what the EU and its Member States can do together to alleviate the situation.  This is an EU crisis requiring an EU solution.</p>  <p>  At the meeting attended by Minister Flanagan and myself, we emphasised the importance of preventing these extremely perilous journeys from taking place and, in particular, the need to tackle the criminal activity that drives this trade.  However, more than anything, people need to be safe in their home countries, and for this reason, political solutions to the many conflicts undermining security in the wider region are essential.  We emphasised, as well, the need for increased humanitarian assistance.  The immediate response to humanitarian crises of this nature have to be primarily grounded in the region where the conflict occurs, tackling the issue at its roots.  If it is a question of funding we in the EU need to find a way to make that happen.    Ireland has indicated already that we will be increasing the funding for our humanitarian assistance.  As the Deputy will be aware, we are already a substantial donor in this regard.</p>  <p>  We highlighted the importance of resettlement, which we will continue to do.  Long term development programmes are critical, in addition to emergency humanitarian assistance.  Ireland also agreed with the importance of integrating internal and external policy when it comes to addressing migration to bring a greater coherence to the EU&rsquo;s response.</p>  <p>  At the Emergency European Council EU leaders discussed the dramatic situation in the Mediterranean and agreed four priority areas for action, as follows:</p>  <p>  -  An immediate expansion of the EU Border Agency, FRONTEX, led Operation Triton in terms of resources and scale in the region.</p>  <p>  -  Stepping up of efforts to disrupt the organised criminal and smuggling groups through greater law enforcement cooperation, the capture and destruction of vessels and possible deployment of a Common Security and Defence Policy operation in the Region.</p>  <p>  -  Increased cooperation with third countries (with a focus on Turkey, Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan, Mali and Niger), renewed political cooperation in regional dialogues with Africa, greater deployment of Immigration Liaison Officers in the Region and the launch of Regional Development and Protection Programmes in North Africa and the Horn of Africa.</p>  <p>  -  Solidarity measures, such as; full implementation of the Common European Asylum System, increased emergency aid and deployment of EASO Teams to the front line Member States and setting up a voluntary pilot programme of resettlement.</p>  <p>  At the European Council the Taoiseach indicated we would provide a vessel and crew to participate in search and rescue and that we were re-examining our resettlement commitments.</p></reply>

Niall Molloy.</p>  <p>  On receipt of the report prepared by Mr McGinn I referred it to the Attorney General for consideration and advice. This was a proper and necessary step in light of the subject matter and having regard to the rights of persons referred to in the report. I appreciate of course the concerns that Father Molloy's family have expressed about the length of time taken to publish the Report, but I had a responsibility to ensure that these matters were properly considered including any legal issues which might arise.  Mr McGinn's report was subsequently published with a number of redactions which were made for legal reasons following consultation with the Attorney General and in agreement with Mr. McGinn.  I can assure the Deputy that the question of the report's publication received active attention at all times and that I published it as soon as it was possible to do so.</p>  <p>  The thrust of Mr. McGinn's report has been to shed light on as many issues as possible in order to minimise the number of unanswered questions regarding the case.  While unanswered questions do remain, the report concludes that the precise events surrounding Father Molloy&rsquo;s death cannot now be ascertained.  It concludes that, given the passage of time, the death of many of the pertinent witnesses, and the reluctance of others to give evidence, that it is unlikely any further inquiry would have a reasonable prospect of establishing the truth.  In these circumstances I have accepted the report's recommendation that examination by a further inquiry would not be warranted.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also recall that the Garda SCRT Review had earlier been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions who advised that there be no further prosecution in relation to the case.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that this is not the outcome that Fr Molloy's family have sought but I hope that putting this amount of information into the public domain regarding the case will be of benefit.  I have indicated to family representatives that I am available to meet with them should they so wish.</p></reply>

The remaining 100 entered the college in early February.  This will bring to 300 the number of recruits in the Garda College and is a measure of the Government's commitment to ensure that recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues seamlessly.

Under section 17(3) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, it is an offence for a licensee, with intent to evade the conditions of the licence, to take intoxicating liquor from the licensed premises for the purpose of its being sold on the account or for the benefit or profit of the licensee, or to permit any other person to do so.</p>  <p>  The Government Alcohol Advisory Group considered specific issues relating to 'distance sales' of intoxicating liquor in its 2008 Report. The Group drew attention to the requirement that payment must be made in such cases as part of the transaction, e.g. on-line shopping, and not later on delivery of the product. The Group noted that sales of intoxicating liquor which had been ordered by telephone or otherwise and which were paid for on delivery were illegal transactions and recommended that the Garda&iacute; should target such delivery services with a view to prosecuting the offending licensees. Any information concerning transactions of this nature which are contrary to the provisions of the Licensing Acts should, therefore, be brought to the attention of the Garda&iacute; for investigation and possible prosecution.  </p>  <p>  Moreover, under section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (as amended), it is an offence for a licensee to sell or deliver, or to permit any other person to sell or deliver, alcohol to any person for consumption off his or her premises by a person under the age of 18 years in any place except with the explicit consent of the person's parent or guardian in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission. </p>  <p>  The Government Legislation Programme provides for future publication of the Sale of Alcohol Bill. The Bill, which will update the Licensing Acts and replace them with provisions more suited to modern conditions, will provide an opportunity to further consider the difficulties arising in relation to the control of distance sales of intoxicating liquor and the enforcement of such controls.</p></reply>

The objective of Operation Obair is to develop a targeted and integrated approach to criminals involved in committing burglaries in the Eastern Region and it provides both a preventative and detection element. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the deployment of Garda resources, including personnel in Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts. I am advised that Garda management keep the distribution of resources under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of Kildare Garda Division as of 28 February 2015, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 300 of which there were 35 and 13 Garda assigned to Leixlip and Celbridge Garda stations, respectively. There are also 40 Garda Reserves and 28 civilians attached to the Kildare Garda Division. </p>  <p>  Since the resumption of Garda recruitment in September last year a total of 300 new recruits have entered the Garda College in Templemore and I was pleased to preside with the Garda Commissioner at the Passing Out ceremony for the first 100 of these new Gardai on 23 April 2015. The Government is committed to ensuring that recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues seamlessly and I have received sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for two further intakes totalling 250 Garda recruits later this year.  On attestation, the new members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be assigned to Garda stations throughout the country by the Garda Commissioner and I am assured that the needs of Kildare Garda Division will be fully considered. In this regard I understand that five probationer Garda&iacute; are being allocated to the Kildare Division in May 2015.</p>  <p>  In conclusion I am advised that local Garda management closely monitors the deployment of resources, patrols and operational strategies in place for the areas referred to by the Deputy and is satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing service is being delivered to those areas.</p></reply>

Section 4(3) of the Courts Service Act 1998 provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which are specified in section 5 and includes the management of the Courts.  Court funds which are held for the benefit of Wards of Court are private funds under the control of the Courts Service which, through its offices in the High, Circuit and District Courts, has responsibility for the management and investment of funds in court.  The Comptroller and Auditor General are not currently empowered to audit Ward of Court funds. The Deputy will aware that there was a proposal to appoint the Comptroller and Auditor General as auditor of the funds included in a draft Bill in 2010.  However it was not subsequently progressed as ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities led to the drafting of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 which proposes to abolish the wards of court system. </p>  <p>  The investment arrangements for all court funds operate under a structured framework.  The Investment Committee of the Courts Service has an advisory role and its main function is to devise investment policy for court funds, oversee the recommendations received from its investment advisors, and to ensure compliance with best practice in the management of court funds. The Committee comprises members of the judiciary, representatives from the Courts Service and independent members.  The Committee is chaired by the President of the High Court and is also supported by external investment advisors.  The Courts Service also produces annual financial statements and is subject to both internal and external audit.  The audited financial statements are published each year in accordance with the Superior Court Rules and published on the Courts Service website at www.courts.ie. The operation of the law in this area is kept under review by my Department.</p></reply>

The Public Service Management <i>(Sick Leave)</i>Regulations 2014, made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, set out the terms of the new Public Service Sick Scheme.</p><p>The rationale for the new scheme is to increase productivity, and lower the cost of sick leave by reducing the periods during which paid sick leave will be available and capping the period during which &ldquo;temporary rehabilitation remuneration&rdquo;, formerly &ldquo;pension rate of pay&rdquo;, may be paid.</p><p>Under the terms of the new Public Service Sick Leave Scheme entitlement to paid sick leave is calculated over a rolling four year period.  This did not previously apply to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Since the introduction of the new Scheme, the number of days lost due to sick leave has decreased significantly. </p><p>The new Public Service Sick Leave Scheme provides for the payment of the following financial support to staff during periods of absence from work due to illness or injury:</p><p>- A maximum of 3 months (92 days) on full pay in a year</p><p>- Followed by a maximum of 3 months (91 days) on half pay</p><p>- Subject to a maximum of 6 months (183 days) paid sick leave in a rolling four year period.</p><p>Temporary Rehabilitation Pay (TRP) was formerly referred to as Pension Rate of Pay and will be calculated and awarded in the same way.  It will only be payable when there is a realistic prospect of an individual returning to work.  The key change in the move from PRP to TRP is that the maximum period for which TRP can be paid is 18 months.</p><p>Additional support for staff who are critically ill has also been agreed. If someone becomes critically ill and is eligible for support under the CIP they may have access to:</p><p>- A maximum of 6 months on full pay in a year</p><p>- Followed by a maximum of 6 months on half pay</p><p>- Subject to a maximum of 12 months paid sick leave in a rolling four year period. </p><p>A person given access to 12 months extended paid sick leave under the CIP, will only be considered for a maximum of 12 months Temporary Rehabilitation Pay. This is because the maximum amount of paid sick leave an individual can get access to in a rolling four year period is two years.</p></reply>

It lists a series of documents to be served on an accused person and furnished to the court.  It is therefore a statutory set of documents.  The book will contain the charges preferred against the accused, a list of proposed prosecution witnesses, together with a statement of their proposed evidence, a list of exhibits and usually a copy of any documentary exhibit.</p><p>If a proposed prosecution witness had access to the book of evidence, it could be prejudicial to the prosecution.  It could in some cases lead to allegations from the defence that the witness was in a position to tailor his or her evidence to accord with what other prosecution witnesses were saying.  It is often the case that victims are witnesses in their own cases.  The witness is of course entitled to a copy of their own statement.</p><p>It is important to emphasise that the book sets out the proposed evidence only.  The actual evidence given at the trial may differ based on how the witness responds to examination in chief and cross examination.  In addition, some of the evidence may be ruled as inadmissible by the trial judge and may never be heard in open court.  Were some inadmissible evidence to inadvertently come into the public domain, this could be prejudicial to fair procedure and due process.</p><p>  For all these reasons it is not the practice for the book of evidence to be disclosed to the victim and I have no plans to amend the relevant legislation in this regard.</p><p>Although a victim will not be given a copy of the book of evidence, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions does offer a pretrial consultation with the legal team at which the court procedures are explained.  In addition, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has prepared a information for victims and witnesses (in user friendly leaflets and on its website) about the Criminal Justice System, the role of the Office and what is involved in being a witness.</p></reply>

"Hatred" is defined as "hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation".  Any person convicted, on indictment, of an offence under the Act is liable to imprisonment for up to 2 years and/or a fine of up to &euro;25,400.  A summary offence attracts a penalty of imprisonment for up to 6 months and/or a class C fine (not exceeding &euro;2,500).  </p>  <p>  A cross-Departmental review of Ireland&rsquo;s Integration Strategy, including measures to address racism, is currently being led by the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration which is part of my Department.  The Cross-Departmental Group has held a number of thematic meetings focussing on key policy areas relevant to the integration of migrants, including education, employment, access to public services and social inclusion, and the promotion of intercultural awareness and combatting racism.  Work on the development of the updated Integration Strategy is ongoing and a draft Strategy will be sent to key stakeholders for their observations before the Summer with a view to the Strategy being published as soon as possible thereafter.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is also doing work on integration, multi-culturalism and combating racism.  The law to combat racism will be considered in the context of the outcome of the review of the Oireachtas Committee and following publication of the Integration Strategy.</p></reply>

Some 30 national and major regional youth services receive funding under the Youth Services Grants Scheme.  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres Scheme. Funding is also provided to L&eacute;argas &ndash; The Exchange Bureau, Gaisce &ndash; the President&rsquo;s Award, the National Youth Health Programme and the National Youth Arts Programme.  The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. It includes support for the National Youth Arts Programme, amounting to &euro;62,000 in 2015 and the National Association for Youth Drama, amounting to &euro;97,053 in 2015. Funding under the schemes is not provided specifically for musical organisations and bands, but some youth services include music in the range of non-formal learning activities for young people.  </p>  <p>  In 2015, an allocation of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department to support the provision of youth services and in recent years, including 2015, capital funding has been allocated by my Department for capital projects in youth services. My Department will not be administering a National Lottery scheme in 2015.</p></reply>

It sets out the duties and obligations of the contracted registered medical practitioner in broad terms.  While the contract would not have envisaged the deployment of 24 hour blood pressure (BP) monitoring technology as a standard feature of the range of services available in the primary care setting, it did become more commonly available in the years subsequent to the introduction of the capitation contract.  Some GPs did not charge for supplying a 24 hour BP monitor to medical card patients whilst others charged a fee of &euro;40-&euro;50.  In comparison, the charge for BP monitoring in one of Dublin's private hospitals is &euro;165.  </p>  <p>  Consultation fees charged by general practitioners outside the terms of the GMS contract are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and the patients.  While I have no role in relation to such fees, I would expect clinicians to have regard to the overall economic situation in setting their fees.</p>  <p>  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in February 2015 commits the Department of Health, the HSE and the IMO to substantive negotiations on a new comprehensive GP contract commencing no later than 31 March with a view to concluding within 12 months.  A priority of these discussions, which have commenced, will be the inclusion of chronic disease management for patients.  The appropriate arrangements in relation to services such as phlebotomy or blood pressure monitoring will also be considered as part of these discussions.</p></reply>

There is no entitlement to a medical card for a person with a particular illness or medical condition or upon attaining a certain age.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has discretion to grant a medical card in circumstances where there is undue hardship in the arranging of medical services. For example, if an applicant's means are above the financial thresholds set out in the national guidelines, discretion will be applied automatically by the HSE during the processing of an application where additional information has been provided by the applicant, including medical reports from his/her GP, which can be considered by staff or a medical officer, where appropriate. </p>  <p>  A person's GP is kept informed of any review notifications of their patients and they also have full electronic visibility of their medical card panel of patients and have the facility to allow temporary extension of eligibility for expiring cards where a sensitive renewal is appropriate. The temporary extension may also be allowed where they are aware that a person is still availing of services but there may be something that prevents them from carrying out a standard review.  All GPs have appropriate electronic access to the medical card eligibility database and they do not have to confirm medical card details by contacting the HSE.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-28a.685.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015042800071#WRN05200"><p>As of 17 April 2015, there are two 24/7 primary percutaneous intervention (PPCI) centres for Dublin, located in the Mater and St James&rsquo;s Hospitals.  These centres accept all ambulance transfers of patients with ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).  The provision of PPCI  from three 24/7 centres in Dublin had proved unsustainable and the decision to consolidate the service into two centres was made following a comprehensive review and reflects the international trend towards the consolidation of such specialised services on smaller number of sites, to allow for the concentration of volume and expertise.    </p>  <p>  In November 2014, the Acute Hospitals Division of the HSE requested the National Clinical Programme for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS Programme) to review the current configuration of PPCI services in Dublin, having regard to the requirement to deliver safe, sustainable services on the designated sites.  The model of care produced by the ACS Programme was informed by advice from the principals involved in centres in the UK and other European countries.  The Programme was also informed by models of care from the US and Australia.  Experience at national and international level highlights the importance of having sustainable rotas of clinical staff to support the 24/7 requirements of this service.</p>  <p>  The review looked at the number of centres that should be delivering PPCI in Dublin, where these centres should be located and the feasibility of maintaining 9 to 5 PPCI services on any cardiology intervention site.  Following consultation with the National Ambulance Service and with all relevant hospitals, the ACS Programme recommended that there should be two 24/7 PPCI centres for Dublin, located in the Mater and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals, which would accept all ambulance transfers of patients with STEMI.  </p>  <p>  The ACS Programme also recommended that there should be a clear definition of the role of the three other cardiology intervention centres in Dublin (Beaumont Hospital, Tallaght Hospital and St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital) in the management of Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI).  NSTEMI forms an increasing proportion of interventional work which will continue and develop in those cardiology intervention centres which will not be designated 24/7 PPCI centres, including St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>  <p>   The designation of PPCI centres outside Dublin is based on the recommendations of the ACS Programme report of 2012 as follows - Cork University hospital (24/7), University Hospital Waterford (9-5) and Galway University hospital (24/7).</p></reply>

The study acknowledged that Ireland's survival rates have improved consistently in recent years.  However, the period under review largely pre-dates the National Cancer Strategy 2006-2015, the establishment of the National Cancer Control Programme in 2007 and full national coverage by the BreastCheck Screening Programme which commenced in 2007 and CervicalCheck screening programmes which started in 2008.  It is expected that future studies will confirm that survival rates have improved further as a result of these initiatives.   The latest available data from the National Cancer Registry indicates that net survival at five years from diagnosis has increased from 45% for Irish patients diagnosed during 1994-1999 to 59% for patients diagnosed during 2006-2011. </p>  <p>  In recent years my Department and the National Cancer Control Programme in the HSE have focused on improving the quality of cancer services through reorganisation and expansion.   We have moved from a fragmented system of care to one that consolidates cancer treatment in larger centres.  Symptomatic Breast Disease Clinics and Rapid Access Clinics for Lung and Prostate Cancer have been set up in eight designated centres, with a satellite breast unit in Letterkenny.  The HSE has developed early detection and cancer prevention programmes, such as the national hereditary cancer programme for patients and families whose cancer may have a hereditary component.  In addition the HSE provides free screening for Breast, Cervical and Bowel cancer, as well as a HPV vaccination programme which provides protection against cervical cancer.</p>  <p>  I am about to establish a Steering Group to provide guidance and advice in the development of the next National Cancer Strategy which will be implemented from 2016.  The Strategy will set out the strategic direction for our cancer services for the next decade and I am sure that it will have a further positive impact on the number of people surviving cancer in Ireland.</p></reply>

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and debilitating.</p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis is a notifiable infectious disease, the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form, Lyme neuroborreliosis. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collects and collates surveillance data on the condition. 20 cases of the condition have been provisionally notified in 2014. This number is likely to fall following validation.</p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis can be asymptomatic or have a range of clinical presentations. Current best advice is that diagnosis should be made only after careful examination of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk evaluation. Exposure to ticks prior to disease manifestations is necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Since an awareness or recollection of a tick-bite is not always present, however, this should not exclude the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Later stages require the use of antibody detection tests (or advanced DNA detection techniques). Testing for Lyme Disease is undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland. In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient. If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Public Health England Porton Down facility which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities. This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test. Because of the general availability of initial screening for Lyme disease in Ireland and the provision of a confirmatory testing service in the UK, there is no need for Irish citizens to travel abroad for testing.</p>  <p>  Common antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  They are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may need to be used. Anyone who suspects they may have contracted Lyme Disease should consult their GP who will arrange appropriate testing and treatment. </p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee. The aim of this Sub-Committee is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland. These strategies will be published in a Final Report. In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health, an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency and an Environmental Health Officer. A representative from the Patients' Association is also being sought. The Terms of Reference of the Sub-Committee are:</p>  <p>  -To raise awareness in Ireland of Lyme Borreliosis amongst clinicians and the general public;</p>  <p>  - To identify and highlight best international practice in raising awareness about Lyme Borreliosis for the General Public;</p>  <p>  -To develop policies of primary prevention of Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland based on best international evidence;</p>  <p>  -To explore ways in which to improve surveillance of neuroborreliosis in Ireland;</p>  <p>  -To develop strategies to raise awareness among the public particularly in areas of higher tick populations;</p>  <p>  -To produce a Final Report covering all the above areas.</p>  <p>   The Sub-Committee will hold its inaugural meeting on May 6.</p>  <p>  Each year the HPSC holds a Lyme Awareness Week. This involves raising awareness for clinicians and the general public as to the risks of infected biting ticks, protection against tick bites and identifying the disease. Much use is made of the media to broadcast these messages in addition to the extensive material provided on the HPSC website. This year's Lyme Awareness Week takes place from April 27 to May 1st.</p></reply>

This was followed by the public sector wide moratorium on recruitment in 2008 given the need to reduce public service numbers and maximise savings in the public service as a result of the downturn in the economy. Notwithstanding this the HSE has had the capacity to recruit where it is necessary to deliver front-line services. It is important to note that in fact nursing numbers have increased by over 850 in the past 15 months. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced in budget 2015 that he intended to delegate greater autonomy to Departments and Agencies to manage their own staffing levels within allocated pay frameworks.  This change allows for further recruitment flexibility, for example where it is determined that offering permanent contracts can achieve more economical service delivery than agency usage. </p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has advised that the HSE and Department of Health are required to submit a 2015 Pay and Numbers Strategy to give effect to this decision. This Strategy is currently being finalised.  </p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on the specific numbers.

Increased emphasis on patient safety in policy reform, legislative changes and development of standards of care driven by quality improvement initiatives underpin the Health Service Executive's (HSE's) Service Planning process and specific measures focused on quality and patient safety including Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) in both the hospital and community setting. </p>  <p>  The HSE has implemented a number of national initiatives in the control and prevention of HCAIs over many years including, SARI 2001-2010 (The Strategy for the Control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland) and the HSE's "Say No to Infection" which focused on both HCAIs and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) launched in 2007.</p>  <p>  The most recent HSE Healthcare Associated Infection (HCAI) and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Clinical Programme was established in 2010.  The Programme, based within the HSE Quality Improvement Division, has targeted three key areas relating to HCAI/AMR.</p>  <p>  1. Hand Hygiene: achievements include provision of online hand hygiene resources (www.hse.ie/go/handhygiene), updating of national hand hygiene guidelines, national specification for alcohol hand gel, and a monthly Key Performance Indicator (KPI) on hand hygiene training for hospital staff.</p>  <p>  2. Prudent use of antibiotics ('Antimicrobial Stewardship'): achievements include development of public website for self-care for common infections (www.undertheweather.ie ), guidelines for antibiotic use in primary care and residential care settings (www.antibioticprescribing.ie), annual promotional and educational activities around European Antibiotic Awareness Day, public information campaigns (www.hse.ie/antibiotics),collaborative project to promote safe use of gentamicin (www.rcpi.ie), and antibiotic care bundles ('Start smart then focus' and 'Right drug, right time, right duration').</p>  <p>  3. Medical device-related infections: achievements include update of 2009 National Guidelines for the prevention of intravascular (IV) catheter-associated infection, and guidelines and care bundles for prevention of urinary catheter-associated infections (www.hpsc.ie).</p>  <p>  Other activities and achievements include the introduction of new monthly indicators (hospital acquired S. aureus bloodstream infection and C. difficile infection), guidelines for prevention and control of multiple drug-resistant organisms (www.hpsc.ie), and development of infection prevention and control guidelines for primary care (www.icgp.ie).</p>  <p>  In addition, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) carries out unannounced inspections in public acute hospitals to monitor compliance with the National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections.  It focuses in particular on Standard 3: Environmental and Facilities Management and Standard 6: Hand Hygiene with the purpose of assessing hygiene as experienced by patients at any given time.  Other Standards may be observed and reported on if concerns arise during the course of an inspection.  The monitoring inspections commenced in November 2012 and over 100 inspections, including some re-inspections have been carried out to date.  Hospitals must revise and amend their Quality Improvement Plans (QIPs) after monitoring to prioritise the improvements necessary to fully comply with the Standards; the Authority continues to monitor the hospital's progress in implementing its recommendations.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that Hospital Groups will continue to achieve full implementation of the local Quality Improvement Plans developed following each HIQA visit which will be managed and monitored to ensure hospitals achieve and sustain high standards of hygiene and improved compliance with infection prevention and control standards.</p>  <p>  To further support patient care HIQA is also monitoring compliance against the National Standards for Safer, Better Healthcare with a particular focus in 2015 on antimicrobial stewardship and nutrition and hydration of patients.</p></reply>

These are provided directly by the HSE or by voluntary service providers funded by the HSE.  At the same time, the HSE has recognised the need to improve the way in which both early intervention services and services for school-aged children are delivered.  It is currently engaged in a major reconfiguration of its existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multi-disciplinary geographically based teams, as part of its National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years).  The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, where these children go to school or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.  </p><p>The Programme is a key priority for the HSE&rsquo;s Social Care Directorate.  An additional &euro;4m was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  Further investment of &euro;4m will be made in 2015 (equating to &euro;6m in a full year).</p><p>  Within this context, I have asked the Executive to provide the Deputy with the detailed operational information that she has requested.

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and debilitating.</p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis is is a notifiable infectious disease, the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form, Lyme neuroborreliosis. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collects and collates surveillance data on the condition. 20 cases of of the condition have been provisionally notified in 2014. This number is likely to fall following validation.</p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis can be asymptomatic or have a range of clinical presentations. Current best advice is that diagnosis should be made only after careful examination of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk evaluation. Exposure to ticks prior to disease manifestations is necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Since an awareness or recollection of a tick-bite is not always present, however, this should not exclude the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Later stages require the use of antibody detection tests (or advanced DNA detection techniques). Testing for Lyme Disease is undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland. In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient. If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Public Health England Porton Down facility which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities. This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test. Because of the general availability of initial screening for Lyme disease in Ireland and the provision of a confirmatory testing service in the UK, there is no need for Irish citizens to travel abroad for testing.</p>  <p>  Common antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  They are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may need to be used. Anyone who suspects they may have contracted Lyme Disease should consult their GP who will arrange appropriate testing and treatment. </p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee. The aim of this Sub-Committee is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland. These strategies will be published in a Final Report. In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency and an Environmental Health Officer. A representative from the Patients' Association is also being sought. The Terms of Reference of the Sub-Committee are:</p>  <p>  - To raise awareness in Ireland of Lyme Borreliosis amongst clinicians and the general public;</p>  <p>  - To identify and highlight best international practice in raising awareness about Lyme Borreliosis for the General Public;</p>  <p>  - To develop policies of primary prevention of Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland based on best international evidence;</p>  <p>  - To explore ways in which to improve surveillance of neuroborreliosis in Ireland;</p>  <p>  - To develop straegies to raise awareness among the public particularly in areas of higher tick populations;</p>  <p>  - To produce a Final Report covering all the above areas.</p>  <p>  The Sub-Committee will hold its inaugural meeting on May 6.</p>  <p>  Each year the HPSC holds a Lyme Awareness Week. This involves raising awareness for clinicians and the general public as to the risks of infected biting ticks, protection against tick bites and identifying the disease. Much use is made of the media to broadcast these messages in addition to the extensive material provided on the HPSC website. This year's Lyme Awareness Week takes place from April 27 - May 1st.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Committee did not publish a report on Lyme Disease after the meeting referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme. The original intention was to start with those on the long-term illness scheme. The view was then taken that this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what would have been only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. </p>  <p>  Having considered this matter the Government announced in Budget 2014 its decision to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service for the entire population by initially providing all children under 6 years with access to a GP service without fees.  An expert group was subsequently appointed to list illnesses or diseases in order, that is, from those which should be counted first and be provided with coverage to those that would be covered later. The group found it would be unjust, unethical and impractical to create a hierarchy of diseases and a list of illnesses in order stating one was more severe than the next. </p>  <p>  The Government chose the under-6s and over-70s as the initial phases for the introduction of a universal GP service simply because they are the youngest and oldest in society and the ones who need to see their GP most often. This service will commence during the summer subject to the passing of the necessary legislation in respect of the over-70s which has now passed Second Stage in this House. These phases are being achieved in parallel with an extension in coverage for chronic disease, starting with asthma among children and diabetes among adults.</p>  <p>  The current operation of the Long Term Illness Scheme remains in place for all eligible persons.</p></reply>

While Future Health sets the broad direction of travel for reforming the system, it was always made clear that an incremental approach to implementation would be taken.  Future Health specifically referred to a &ldquo;reform-learn-reform&rdquo; approach being taken to the process which would enable us to make changes to the proposed approach while simultaneously making progress towards the final structures and delivering tangible improvements as we go.  </p>  <p>  Pending the enactment of legislation, the implementation of Hospital Groups will progress in a phased manner, which will provide for devolved decision-making, fostering flexibility, innovation and local responsiveness, while also adhering to prescribed national service objectives and standards. Phase II of the Health Reform Programme, as set out in Future Health, provides for the dissolution and replacement of the HSE with the introduction of a formal purchaser/provider split, the establishment of a Healthcare Commissioning Agency and a range of provider agencies, including Hospital Trusts.  This is a complex health reform programme and it is essential that the hospital trust legislation is developed as part of the overall process and that the appropriate structures are in place in advance of formal establishment of trusts.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime each Group must develop and produce a strategic plan which will describe how they will provide more efficient and effective patient services; how they will reorganise these services to provide optimal care possible to the populations they serve; and how they will achieve maximum integration and synergy with other Groups and all other health services, particularly primary care/community based services.  </p>  <p>  My Department (with the assistance of the Strategic Advisory Group on the Implementation of Hospital Groups) will progress the significant body of work necessary to facilitate the transition from Hospital Groups to Trusts.  It will set down the high level overarching policy to guide overall hospital services reorganisation from a national standpoint to inform and complement the plans of the Hospital Groups and will provide guidance on the definition of a Hospital Trust in an Irish context.  The Groups and their respective strategic plans will be rigorously reviewed against criteria to test their suitability to proceed to become Hospital Trusts.  The review of Groups should be completed before Trusts are legally established and if changes prove necessary; these will be made with Government approval when Hospital Trusts are being formed.</p></reply>

There are a number of options open to individuals or their families to make a complaint about the health services.  Part 9 of the Health Act 2004 states that a person has the right to complain about any action of the Health Service Executive (HSE) or a service provider that they believe was not fair or had an adverse effect on them.  The HSE has appointed designated Complaints Officers to ensure the effective management of complaints throughout their relevant areas of responsibility.  </p>  <p>  If an individual is unhappy with the way in which his/her complaint was dealt with at the point of care the National Advocacy Unit of the HSE will appoint an independent officer to review the complaint. The Executive also has a National Safety Incident Management Policy which sets out the steps to be taken in an investigation; when independence from the HSE is required, the HSE policy provides for national and international experts to be part of reviews.</p>  <p>  If an individual is still unhappy with the outcome of this process he/she can request an independent review of the complaint from the Office of the Ombudsman. In addition, Healthcomplaints.ie is an on-line information service which was developed by the Office of the Ombudsman in cooperation with a number of organisations including my Department and the HSE. This service provides information on how to make a complaint or give feedback about health and social care services in Ireland. This website has been developed for people who use health and social care services in Ireland, as well as for their families, care-givers and advocates.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore if an individual is unhappy with the level of care provided by a regulated health service professional such as a doctor, nurse or other healthcare professional, he/she may make a complaint to that employee's professional regulatory body.</p></reply>

Given the limited number of surgeons who specialise in transplantation, the filling of any vacancies poses a challenge.  Every effort is currently being made to fill these vacancies. </p>  <p>  Beaumont Hospital is collaborating with St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in relation to a combined approach to kidney/pancreas transplants, as well as the development of an intra-abdominal organ retrieval service. It is proposed that pancreatic transplants, of which 6 were performed in 2014, will move to St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital this year.  While the transfer of such transplants to St Vincent&rsquo;s has been agreed in principle, it will take some time to make the detailed arrangements to facilitate the commencement of this work. Most pancreas transplants are combined with a kidney transplant.  The arrangements being put in place for such cases will involve transplant surgeons from both St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital and Beaumont Hospital working together on the St Vincent&rsquo;s campus.</p>  <p>  The nine patients who are on the waiting list for a pancreas transplant are being contacted to reassure them that the pancreatic transplantation programme will continue. </p></reply>

Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers of a range of statutory criteria  including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available to the HSE.</p>  <p>  The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics. They are not political or Ministerial decisions. </p>  <p>  The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes. The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines. </p>  <p>   In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. </p>  <p>  On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. </p>  <p>  It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of Fampridine on the community drugs schemes incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the drug, by offering a reduced price or both.  A revised application was received by the HSE on 25 July 2014. The HSE has since been engaging with the company seeking an improved commercial offering and these engagements have been completed.  It is not possible to say when a decision on the funding of this medication will be made as the HSE is considering the outcome of those commercial engagements as well as the outcome of discussions which the HSE has had with clinical experts regarding this drug.</p></reply>

This provision was introduced as a method of maintaining a high price level for tobacco products in order to make them less accessible to children. The majority of smokers become addicted in their childhood and teenage years and research has clearly shown that price is an important factor in young people deciding not to smoke. By increasing the minimum number of units which may be bought, the price barrier is raised higher for children at the experimental stage. The maintenance of a high level of prices for tobacco products is an important factor in preventing people, particularly children, from experimenting with tobacco.  </p>  <p>  There is currently no provision in legislation setting a maximum amount of cigarettes which may be sold per packet. However, the Public Health (Tobacco)(Amendment) Act 2013 introduced section 38 (10A), which prohibits certain types of sales promotions, including the sale or promotion of any tobacco product at a reduced price or free of charge.</p></reply>

Additional funding totalling &euro;125 million has been provided primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children and to enhance specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness, those with an intellectual disability and mental illness, and forensic mental health services. </p><p>The Government, in keeping with its commitment in the Programme for Government to increase access to counselling and psychotherapy, has provided funding totalling &euro;7.5 million to develop the Counselling in Primary Care (CIPC) service, which works closely with the HSE Mental Health Service, under whose aegis this funding is provided.</p><p>The Suicide Crisis Assessment Nursing Service (SCAN) provides a skilled mental health nursing service to Primary Care that provides an accessible and quick response to GP requests for a timely assessment of those in suicide/self harm distress.  At present there are 12 nurses working in the service in Wexford, Galway, Waterford, Cork North Lee, Dublin North, Tallaght/Dublin West/South West, Sligo, Donegal, and Laois.  It is envisaged that 8 additional assignments will be made to support the current service.</p><p>As part of the investment in mental health in 2013, 35 posts were identified to provide for the implementation of the Clinical Programme to address self-harm presentations in emergency departments. Currently 23 of these posts are in place and the remainder are in the recruitment process.</p><p>Acute mental health services are delivered on a 24/7 basis.  <i>A Vision for Change</i>recommends that, as part of community secondary care provision, there should be a crisis house available in each catchment area. A number of mental health services have provided crisis houses as part of their community residential provision and, as the mental health services move away from the provision of low and medium support community residences, opportunities to provide the crisis house model will be explored. In other areas, respite arrangements are in place to address the emergency needs of service users.  In the Service Plan this year the HSE Mental Health Division has committed to developing weekend services for existing vulnerable patients attending the mental health services who would benefit from contact over the weekend.</p><p>In relation to details of the specific services which are available in Waterford and the numbers on waiting lists, as these are service issues the question has been referred for the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.  If you have not received a reply within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

Instability and conflict across the Horn of Africa, North Africa and the Middle East have led to unprecedented numbers of people being displaced from their homes in the last five years. Almost 1600 migrants are known to have drowned in the Mediterranean this year while seeking refuge in Europe, thirty times as many as in the same period in 2014.</p><p>On 20 April, together with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald TD, I attended an extraordinary joint meeting of EU Foreign Affairs Ministers and EU Home Affairs Ministers called in response to these recent tragic events. At this joint meeting, a 10-point plan of the immediate actions to be taken in response to the crisis situation in the Mediterranean received the full backing of Ministers.</p><p>On 23 April, the Taoiseach attended a Special Meeting of the European Council on the Mediterranean Crisis, at which EU leaders agreed to triple funding for the EU's Triton search and rescue operation.</p><p>In view of the migration crisis in the Mediterranean, and the ongoing violence and chaos in Libya, the Taoiseach announced additional Irish Aid funding of &euro;1 million to the for its work in Libya. This funding is being provided in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s support to the broader region - including countries affected by the Syria crisis - which will total &euro;41 million by the end of this year.  Through the aid programme, we also provide significant humanitarian funding to other countries affected by conflict and displacement in the Horn of Africa, North Africa and the Middle East, including Somalia, Yemen and Afghanistan. </p><p>The root causes of much illegal migration lie in poverty, underdevelopment and conflict. Long term development programmes are critical, in addition to emergency humanitarian assistance. Ireland&rsquo;s development focus is on Africa, where we direct over 80% of our aid.

The Council also received a presentation from the High Representative on her intention to carry out a Strategic Review of the European Security Strategy.</p>  <p>  The Council provided an important opportunity for Ministers to discuss the fluid situation on the ground in Libya, and consider how the EU can best respond to the evolving crisis. The Council expressed its continued support for the UN brokered talks on Libya, and the efforts of the United Nations Secretary General&rsquo;s Special Representative, Bernardino Le&oacute;n, to reach agreement on a government of national unity and a sustainable ceasefire. Our meeting also discussed what steps the EU could take to support a government of national unity, should the ongoing UN facilitated talks succeed. The issue of migration was dealt with at a separate joint meeting of EU Foreign Affairs and Interior Ministers which took place on 20 April.</p>  <p>  The Council had a strategic discussion on the EU's relationship with Latin America and the Caribbean. I took the opportunity to raise the importance which Ireland places on engaging with Latin America, a region with whom we share close ties. I also noted the importance of evolving EU-Latin America cooperation in line with developments in both continents, and continuing to engage with Latin American countries on global issues such as climate change, disarmament, and the post-2015 development agenda. The Council also discussed the major political changes which are taking place in Latin America. These include the process of modernisation in Cuba. We received a report from the High Representative on her recent visit, and an update on the negotiations towards an EU Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement with Cuba. I noted that such an Agreement, which places human rights at its core, will buttress the reform process in Cuba. The Council also welcomed recent advances in Cuba-US relations. Ministers also discussed the peace process in Colombia, and how we can assist in bringing it to a successful and lasting conclusion. I noted the importance of the peace process for the advancement of human rights in Colombia, which is at the centre of our own policy towards Colombia.</p>  <p>  Ministers discussed recent developments with regard to negotiations on the Iranian nuclear programme. I took the opportunity to welcome the agreement in principle reached between representatives of the international community and the Government of Iran in Lausanne on 2 April, and to urge all responsible parties to support this agreement and the work of their governments to finally bring it to a successful conclusion. I also expressed my appreciation to the High Representative and the Foreign Ministers of the states which participated in the negotiations for the seriousness and intent with which they pursued a diplomatic solution to this difficult issue over a long period, and in particular over the past two years.</p>  <p>  The Council engaged in a useful discussion of the deepening crisis in Yemen and the need for all parties to engage with the United Nations so that the Yemeni transition can get back on track. This is urgently needed so that the humanitarian, economic and security crises in the country can be addressed.</p>  <p>  Finally, the High Representative made a presentation to the Council regarding her intention to prepare an assessment of the changed global environment for consideration at the European Council in June.  This is the first phase in a process to draft a new European Foreign Policy and Security Strategy, in full consultation with the Member States.  Given the changes in the international environment since the previous Strategy was prepared in 2003, including the situation on the EU&rsquo;s borders both to the East and the South, it is appropriate that such a review be undertaken and I expressed my support for this initiative.</p>  <p>  Separately, I participated with my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald TD, in an extraordinary joint meeting of EU Foreign Affairs and Home Affairs Ministers to discuss the issue of migration in the Mediterranean called in response to recent tragic events. Minister Fitzgerald and I joined with our EU colleagues in expressing our horror at the recent events, and in reiterating our determination to take collective action to protect vulnerable migrants. We also noted that Ireland strongly shares the concern of our EU and Southern partners and agrees that solutions must be found jointly to address a humanitarian crisis on this scale. These solutions must address the human safety and organised crime aspects of this crisis. We noted also the importance of addressing the root causes which contribute to the migratory pressures. The EU's response to the current crisis in the Mediterranean was further considered further at a meeting of EU leaders on 23 April 2015.</p></reply>

The main focus of the resolution was the establishment of an ad hoc committee to elaborate a binding debt resolution mechanism.At the time of the vote, the EU explained that it had made extensive efforts and engaged in the process in good faith and reiterated the considerations outlined at the outset of negotiations, as follows: &ldquo;The ad-hoc committee must be limited to the elaboration of a non-binding 'set of principles' which builds upon a market-based voluntary contractual approach to sovereign debt restructuring and aims at furthering its implementation and use. Neither the EU nor Member States will participate in discussions aiming at the establishment of a binding multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes.</p>  <p>  The ad-hoc committee should reflect the recent and ongoing work on sovereign debt restructuring undertaken in the IMF, subject to the previous considerations, and should take place in close coordination with and with technical support from the Fund.  Discussions should also make reference to the work in other fora on these issues, such as the Paris Club, which has a history of discussing sovereign debt restructuring issues.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  In the event, the resolution continued to propose the elaboration of a new legal framework.  In these circumstances, the agreed EU position is that we will not be participating in the work of the committee.</p>  <p>  Ireland together with our EU colleagues and with many other UN member States is actively engaged in ongoing processes to address the issue of sovereign debt restructuring.  We consider that the work being undertaken at other levels, including in the IMF and at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in Addis Ababa in July, offer more appropriate and established means for meaningful dialogue on the matter. Ireland will play our full role in working for the success of the international Financing for Development Conference in Addis, which is central to the ongoing negotiations on a new framework for global development to follow on from the Millennium Development Goals.  These major international negotiations at the UN are being co-chaired by Ireland and Kenya. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to support processes aimed at resolving global debt issues through dialogue, in the most appropriate forum and using the most appropriate and effective mechanisms to support the countries most seriously affected.</p></reply>

I met with victims of the conflict, including a father who had lost a child.  I have also repeatedly condemned the excessive use of military force by Israel in Gaza both during and after the conflict, and also stated clearly that both Israel and Hamas were disregarding the effects of their actions on innocent civilians, including children. As I said to the Seanad in my speech last July, &ldquo;any use of military force in self defence must be in accordance with international humanitarian law, and in particular must be both discriminate and proportionate. In view of the unacceptable casualty figures, it is quite clear this has not been the case&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is responsible for controls on the export of military items from Ireland. Under Irish law, military export licences have to be sought in respect of the goods and technology, and any components thereof, listed in the Annex to the Control of Exports (Goods and Technology) Order, SI.216 of 2012 which reflects the EU Common Military List.</p>  <p>  The EU Common Military List includes military goods and technology, and components for such items that should be licenced for export from the Union. Items which are classified as &ldquo;military goods&rdquo; from an export control perspective and which are exported from Ireland involve components for inclusion in, rather than finished military equipment. Components licensed for export are generally exported to manufacturers and systems integrators before being sent to the final end-users.</p>  <p>  The Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation consults with my Department in respect of all military export licence applications.  All military licence applications are subject to rigorous scrutiny, and are considered in the light of the spirit and objectives of the 1998 EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.  This Code, which was subsequently adopted in 2008 as an EU Common Position, seeks to safeguard, among other concerns, regional stability and human rights.</p>  <p>  Eleven licences for the export of Military List items to Israel have been issued from 2011 to date. No licences for the export of Military List products to Israel have been granted since the end of the first quarter of 2014.</p>  <p>  All applications received for the export of Military List items to Israel are very carefully assessed, on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the end use and the end user and against well-established criteria.</p></reply>

In accordance with these rules each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities. The staffing arrangements for the 2015/16 school year are available on the Department website.

Equally, the strong focus in current policy development on increasing the skills levels of Irish teachers and driving the professionalism of teaching, evident in the work of the Teaching Council, is important.</p>  <p>  We are already moving towards greater autonomy in the area of curriculum and assessment. Work is underway on revised curricula at primary level (the first elements will be introduced in schools in 2015/2016) which will offer opportunities to provide greater curriculum flexibility to schools. Significant developments have been announced at Junior Cycle that will, over time, increase substantially the autonomy of post-primary schools over curriculum and assessment.  Recently introduced changes to teacher education have seen the lengthening of initial teacher education courses and a shift in course content to place a greater emphasis on skills in pedagogy and assessment. Both of these developments are designed to enhance teachers' capacity to adapt curricula and assessment practices in schools to better suit the needs of students. The proposals of the NCSE regarding the creation of a single pot of SEN-related teaching posts in schools may offer further opportunities for school autonomy. These would provide schools with the greater freedom to allocate and manage staff with required flexibility which is envisaged in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The introduction of school self-evaluation in 2012 enables schools themselves to arrive at school-specific information on how well they are doing, which they are expected to use in their planning for improvement. This encourages schools to use their autonomy to prioritise particular learning targets and to make the necessary pedagogical changes to achieve those targets within a broad curriculum and pedagogical framework.</p>  <p>  We know that putting appropriate supports in place is a critical step to realising in a fresh way the curriculum, pedagogical, and assessment autonomy that schools currently have and may be given in the future and that is why this work is already underway.</p></reply>

Schools are expected to complete a school self-evaluation report and a three-year school improvement plan. Schools must focus on one aspect of teaching and learning each year from 2013/14 and they are required to provide a summary of their SSE report and school improvement plan to their school community.</p>  <p>  The Inspectorate has developed comprehensive guidelines and set up a dedicated website to support the SSE process. The Inspectorate is working closely with the Department's support services to embed school self-evaluation in schools and it publishes a newsletter highlighting best practice in SSE. An extensive programme of school support visits has been conducted and national and regional SSE seminars have been held. The SSE website is updated regularly and includes samples of SSE reports and improvement plans.</p></reply>

The terms of reference covered all staff in the Institute comprehended by the unions' parity claim, including those staff who were the subject of a previous Labour Court recommendation (LCR20577). The terms of reference provided for an Oversight Committee comprised of management and union representatives to monitor progress and prevent delays. An appeals process was also agreed between the parties which could be invoked following the conclusion of the evaluation exercise. Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) were appointed to conduct the exercise following a tender process. The selection was made by a joint panel made up of representatives of the employer and both unions.</p><p>  It was also agreed that, following completion of the internal job evaluation exercise, the parties would engage in discussions to seek agreement on the implementation of PwC's recommendations and the outcome of the appeals process. In the event that agreement could not be reached the matter would be referred to the Labour Court and the parties would be bound by the outcome.</p><p>  The PwC job evaluation report was presented to the parties in December 2014. If implemented, the report, which covers 182 employees, would provide for an average annual salary increase of about &euro;9,000 for 115 of the staff concerned. The report found that the remaining 67 staff are on a salary higher than the relevant UCC salary by an average of about &euro;10,000 per annum. Implementation of the report would add in excess of &euro;1,000,000 to the University's annual pay costs.</p><p>  However, in January 2015 management in UCC was informed that union members in Tyndall had rejected the report. A conciliation conference was held in the LRC in February during which the unions sought to set aside the already agreed appeals procedure. Management advised that it was adhering to the agreed appeals process brokered by the LRC. No agreement was reached and at the unions' request the issue of the appeals process was referred to the Labour Court. The Court concluded that no recommendation it might make at this time would advance the resolution of the dispute.</p><p>  In the meantime SIPTU &amp;amp; IFUT had balloted their members for industrial action. The two unions have now formally notified the University that that there will be four days of strike action in May. The unions have confirmed that pickets will be confined to the entrance to Tyndall on the first three days but that the UCC campus will also be picketed on May 13th with the attendant risk of disruption to the conduct of examinations.</p><p>  I am disappointed that SIPTU &amp;amp; IFUT have chosen to take industrial action instead of abiding by the agreed process for dealing with the job evaluation exercise.</p></reply>

The criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts is published annually on the Department website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing arrangements also include an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. The Primary Staffing Appeals Board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final. The staffing arrangements for the 2015/2016 school year are set out in Circular 0005/2015 which is available on the Department website.</p>  <p>  At primary level the staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. The primary staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools. </p>  <p>  My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.). School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.</p>  <p>  The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing economic growth. It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about further improvement in PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers.</p>  <p>  The challenge for all schools is to ensure that they utilise their allocated resources to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.</p></reply>

Since the introduction of a trade licence system for distributors/dealers/garages in 1992, which allows holders of a trade plate to use a vehicle on the road without being taxed, this arrangement is now primarily of benefit to non-trade plate holders as it provides a mechanism for them to bring a vehicle on the road for demonstration purposes, etc. without being added as an owner.  The arrangement was intended to be used as a temporary measure, pending resale of a vehicle.  It was not the intention that the arrangement would be used to tax the same vehicle repeatedly or for a long period of time.  A Circular that issued to motor tax offices in 1989 clarifies that it was not envisaged that a dealer would tax a vehicle for more than three months under the arrangement.</p></reply>

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department. </p>  <p>  Following a review in 2010 of the Community Support for Older People (CSOP), the forerunner for the Seniors Alert Scheme, one of the recommendations was that a centralised procurement process would simplify the scheme. By decreasing the level of administration for groups, this would allow them to spend more time on the key aim of the scheme, which is enhanced interaction with older persons and would also achieve value for money through economies of scale. It is anticipated that the resource efficiencies gained through the procurement and centralised financial management of service suppliers will allow more people to benefit from the scheme and will allow for consideration of funding additional items such as smoke detectors and/or carbon monoxide alarms under the Scheme.      </p>  <p>  My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and arising from this, it was decided that the scheme be managed by Pobal, given that organisation&rsquo;s significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government. </p>  <p>  Pobal&rsquo;s management and administrative services for the Scheme included an invitation to tender for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, which was publicly advertised on eTenders on 20 October 2014.  The tender included a requirement for suppliers to set out their value added services. The tender process, which is being led by Pobal, is almost complete.  Following on from this, a panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas.  The tender was broken down into ten regional lots to ensure that SMEs were not disadvantaged due to excessively large lot sizes. </p>  <p>  A monitoring services panel was also advertised via eTenders on 6 November 2014.  This process will engage a panel of quality checked monitoring suppliers who will outline the costs they charge and the service they provide.  This information will be provided to the community groups and individuals to ensure they can make the best choice in relation to their monitoring services supplier.  The use of this panel is voluntary; monitoring costs are not grant-aided and have always been the responsibility of the beneficiary.  The older person will continue to be responsible for choosing the monitoring supplier of their choice.      </p>  <p>  The transfer of the operation of the scheme to Pobal is scheduled for completion by end July 2015; the strategic policy direction of the Scheme will remain my Department&rsquo;s responsibility.  In the meantime, community and voluntary groups wishing to draw down grant support under the Seniors Alert Scheme should continue to apply to my Department in the usual way.</p></reply>

The Scheme offered an option to purchase up to half of a property with a standard annuity mortgage, with the balance to be rented from the local authority.  The initiative worked well for the majority of borrowers and 16,500 people were facilitated in owning their own home in this way.  The Government&rsquo;s 2011 Housing Policy Statement announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the Shared Ownership Scheme, given the changes in the property and lending markets. </p><p>My Department, with the assistance of the Housing Agency, the Housing Finance Agency and the Local Authority Housing Loans Management Group, is currently reviewing the operation of the Shared Ownership Scheme for existing borrowers. The objective is to seek to address, if and where appropriate, difficulties arising for some shared ownership borrowers.  Pending the outcome of the review, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities setting out some of the options and interim actions that might be explored to alleviate the difficulties of those in shared ownership arrangements, such as allowing use of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and room rental. It is accepted that such proposals are not a complete solution to the issues that arise for such mortgage holders but they are intended as an interim measure pending the outcome of the review referred to above.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s latest guidelines for local authorities in dealing with mortgage arrears within the local authority sector, <i>Dealing with Mortgage Arrears &ndash; A Guide for Local</i><i>Authorities (June 2014),</i>is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:.</p></reply>

No. 9 of 2014 has strengthened the arrangements in place for the control of building activity by empowering competence and professionalism in design and construction and by requiring greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certificates of compliance for design and construction, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspection during construction, and validation and registration of statutory certificates. </p>  <p>  The statutory certificates of compliance must be signed by a competent registered professional.  Registered professionals who fail to adhere to proper standards of professional practice leave themselves open to disciplinary proceedings by their professional body for malpractice or misconduct and ultimately place their own livelihood at risk. </p>  <p>  It is not clear what useful purpose would be served by imposing a requirement for independent certification of design and construction certification along the lines suggested.  The merits of a designer overseeing the implementation of their design cannot be overlooked. Neither is there any intention to constrain the capacity of all-in service delivery models in key sectors of the industry.  Enforcement powers under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2007 continue to be vested in the local building control authorities and it is here that independence is called for and in place. </p>  <p>  Prior to its introduction, a commitment was given that S.I. No. 9 of 2014 would be reviewed after its first twelve months in operation.  This review was formally announced on 2 April 201 5 and is currently open for public consultation. I am confident that the review will inform further steps that may be taken to refine and streamline the regulatory framework so that the building process can work effectively to serve the needs of both consumers and industry, while ensuring the quality of our future building stock.  The closing date for the receipt of submissions under the public consultation process is 15 May 2015.</p></reply>

This represents 92% of the estimated total number of domestic wastewater systems in the county based on Census 2011 data.  The registration fees payable by owners of the domestic waste water treatment systems were collected by the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) on behalf of the local authority in which the systems are located.  The fees are intended to meet the costs incurred by the local authorities in maintaining their individual registers and in carrying out the risk-based inspections.  Distribution of fees to individual local authorities is a matter for the LGMA. </p><p>The Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 assigns responsibility to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to make a National Inspection Plan for domestic wastewater treatment systems.  The <i>National Inspection Plan 2013: Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems</i>was adopted and published by the EPA in February 2013.  Neither I nor my Department have any direct role in monitoring the implementation of the EPA&rsquo;s Plan.  However, the EPA has conducted a review on the implementation of the Plan for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014.  The report contains a breakdown, by county, of inspections that have taken place and includes details relating to non-compliant treatment systems and advisory notices. It is available on the Agency&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>The EPA&rsquo;s review indicates that 99% of inspections targeted in the Plan&rsquo;s first year were completed by the local authorities, with only two authorities not completing the number of inspections allocated to them (though my Department has been advised that the outstanding inspections have since been completed).  Part 4A of the Water Services Act 2007 (as amended), a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, provides appropriate enforcement powers to the EPA , which is the supervisory body for the purposes of implementation of the National Inspection Plan.</p><p>Selection of treatment systems for inspection is carried out by the local authorities using the EPA&rsquo;s IT system which utilises WebGIS information.  The selection system is based on risk criteria such as hydrological and geological conditions, density of one-off housing, proximity to drinking water sources etc.  Householders cannot request inspections of their own treatment systems. </p><p>Section 70 of the Water Services Act 2007 places a duty of care on the owner of a premises to ensure that their waste water treatment systems are kept so as not to cause, or be likely to cause, a risk to human health or the environment, including waters, the atmosphere, land, soil, plants or animals, or create a nuisance through odours.  The duty of care provisions have been augmented by the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 and associated regulations.  Any person whose treatment system fails an inspection or, in the absence of an inspection, considers that their treatment system constitutes, or may constitute, a risk to human health or the environment is responsible for having any necessary remediation works carried out without delay.</p><p>The Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2013, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, brought into operation a grants scheme to assist with the cost of remediation of septic tanks and domestic waste water treatment systems which are deemed, following inspection under the EPA&rsquo;s National Inspection Plan and the subsequent issue of an Advisory Notice by the local authority, to require repair or upgrading.  The qualification criteria are set out in the legislation and full details of the scheme, including eligibility criteria, are set out in the explanatory leaflet and application form published on my Department&rsquo;s website at: </p><p>Responsibility for the administration of my Department&rsquo;s Rural Water Programme, under which funding is provided to recoup local authorities the grants paid by them in respect of the remediation of domestic waste water treatment systems, is devolved to the local authorities.  Details of the grants recouped by my Department to the local authorities up to 24 April 2015 are set out in the table.  The table does not include details of any grant applications currently being processed by the local authorities or amounts already paid but where recoupment applications have not yet been submitted to my Department. </p><p>Householders who do not meet the eligibility criteria included in the Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2013 but wish to remediate or upgrade their on-site treatment systems may qualify for relief under the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) Scheme introduced under Section 5 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013.  The HRI scheme covers main residence repairs, renovations and improvements, including the repair or replacement of septic tanks.  The scheme is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and full details are published on Revenue&rsquo;s website at: .<table><tr><th>County </th><th>Grant Amount <br /><br />Recouped  - &euro; <br /><br /></th><th>Number of grants Recouped </th></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>18,977 </td><td>6 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>3,151 </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>15,300 </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>6,859 </td><td>3 </td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>4,000 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>2,500 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick </td><td>14,500 </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td>4,000 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>4,000 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>7,819 </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>36,563 </td><td>11 </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>8,000 </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td>15,381 </td><td>5 </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>23,161 </td><td>6 </td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary </td><td>9,741 </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>2,896 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td>1,637 </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>Totals </td><td>178,485 </td><td>56 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities. The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment.  HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.</p><p>Further to the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 28 July 2014, the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15 September 2014 in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council.  HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils from 1 October.  Subsequently, on 18 December, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households.  Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities.</p><p>There are now over 1,600 households in receipt of HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme. </p><p>During the legislation&rsquo;s passage through the Oireachtas in July 2014 an undertaking was given that a progress report would be prepared for the relevant Oireachtas Committee.  I can confirm that data from the pilot sites has been gathered and I submitted a report to the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht last week.  Based on the findings of that review, consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of a further cohort of local authorities to commence HAP on an incremental basis this year.  While no implementation date has yet been confirmed, my Department is in contact with Kildare County Council in relation to their inclusion in the next phase of the pilot.</p></reply>

Nevertheless I have urged, and will continue to urge, local authorities in general to continue to use all of the powers currently available to them to address failures to comply with statutory requirements, particularly in relation to fire safety in residential developments within their functional areas.   </p>  <p>  I understand that Kildare County Council in its capacity as Fire Authority has previously been engaged with the Owner Management Company and with owners of some individual apartment units in the development concerned to resolve a number of problems that became apparent on and from 2013.  I also understand that, following a recent incident affecting a number of units in the development concerned, Kildare County Council has engaged the services of a Fire Safety Consultant to assess compliance with fire safety requirements in a number of housing units.  It is not possible at this point to determine what implications this might have for fire safety provision more generally in the development concerned. In the event that further action may be required, however, I would advise all owners concerned to cooperate with the Local Authority in carrying out its statutory role. </p>  <p>  In relation to the recourse available for homeowners, the position is that the Building Control Act 1990 places primary responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations on the owner of the building concerned and on the builder/developer who carries out the works.  The Building Regulations are outlined in twelve parts (classified as parts A to M) and set down the legally enforceable minimum standards which a new building must achieve; fire safety is addressed under Part B.  Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local Building Control Authorities who have strong powers to serve enforcement notices for non-compliance or to institute proceedings for breaches of regulatory requirements within a period of five years from the date the building has been completed. </p>  <p>  Where building defects occur, their remediation is a matter for the parties concerned, namely the building owner, the relevant developer and the builder&rsquo;s insurers, in line with any contractual arrangements agreed between the parties.  Where disputes cannot be resolved through dialogue or mediation, enforcement of contract terms becomes a civil matter.  Professional advice, for instance from the solicitor who advised them in relation to the contract when buying their home or another legal advisor, is recommended for homeowners in this situation. </p>  <p>  It may also be the case that the builder/developer was a member of a structural guarantee warranty/scheme and this should be ascertained and pursued if relevant.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding amendments to take into account revisions to relevant Irish, British and European standards, the principal changes to the Building Regulations since 2006 are set out below:</p><p>- <i>Part A &ndash; Structure</i>was amended in 2012 to ensure consistency with the Eurocodes which are a set of harmonised structural design codes for building and civil engineering works which are now generally in force across EU Member States;</p><p>-<i>Part D &ndash; Materials and Workmanship</i>was revised in 2013 to revise the definition of &ldquo;proper materials&rdquo; to have regard to the relevant provisions of <i>Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products and repealing Council Directive 89/106/EEC</i>;</p><p>- <i>Part E &ndash; Sound</i>was amended in 2014 to establish new performance standards to improve the overall sound insulation performance of dwellings and introduce a completion testing regime on a proportion of all new dwellings in a development to ensure these new minimum standards are achieved in practice;</p><p>- <i>Part F &ndash; Ventilation</i>was revised in 2009 to provide for higher standards of ventilation and support the measures introduced under Part L of the Building Regulations in respect of improved thermal performance;</p><p>-<i>Part G &ndash; Hygiene</i>was amended in 2008 to make dual flush toilets mandatory in new buildings;</p><p>- <i>Part H &ndash; Drainage and Wastewater Disposal</i>was revised in 2010 in order to call up relevant parts of the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s <i>Code of Practice: Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems serving Single Houses</i>(2009);</p><p>- <i>Part J &ndash; Heat Producing Appliances</i>was amended in 2014 and set out new legal requirements for the use and installation of heat producing appliances in buildings, including a requirement for carbon monoxide detectors in all new dwellings, and in existing dwellings, where new or replacement open flue or flueless combustion appliances are being installed;</p><p>- <i>Part K &ndash; Stairways, Ladders, Ramps and Guards</i>was revised in 2014 to provide additional guidance on the prevention of falls from windows in dwellings;</p><p>- <i>Part L &ndash; Conservation of Fuel and Energy</i>was amended in 2007 and 2011 in respect of dwellings to provide for a 60% aggregate improvement (relative to 2005 standards) in both the energy and carbon performance of new dwellings and marked an important step on the road to nearly zero energy buildings which is required by 31 December 2020.  Part L was also revised in 2008 in respect of buildings other than dwellings which introduced the methodology (known as NEAP or the <i>Non-domestic Energy Assessment Procedure</i>) to measure the energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions for new non-domestic buildings;</p><p>- <i>Part M &ndash; Access and Use</i>was revised in 2010 to require that all new buildings other than dwellings should be designed and constructed so that people with a range of disabilities can safely and independently approach and gain access to such buildings, circulate within them, use the relevant facilities, including sanitary conveniences within them. Further amendments were introduced for new dwellings, which already had to be visitable by people with disabilities since 2001, in respect of approaches and widths of internal doors and certain fittings.</p><p>In addition, a comprehensive review to Part B (Fire Safety) of the Building Regulations, which was last reviewed in 2006, is now well advanced and a public consultation is envisaged by mid year.  A review to Part C (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture) is anticipated to commence before the end of 2015.</p><p>Complementary to the Building Regulations, the <i>Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014</i>, which came into effect on 1 March 2014, now require greater accountability for demonstrating compliance with the Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.  I am satisfied that these measures will ensure a greater emphasis on competence, professionalism and quality in our construction industry into the future thereby ensuring that homeowners and construction clients can rely on getting the high quality homes and buildings they expect and deserve.</p></reply>

Changes to, or impacting on, the motor tax system in late 2013, such as the ending of the retrospective system of declaring vehicles off the road, an extension of the facility to pay arrears of motor tax online and revised procedures for the issuing of Certificates of Road Worthiness for commercial vehicles have all facilitated greater uptake of online renewal by vehicle owners.  As a result of these changes, online renewals have increased from a level of around 55% to 62% of all motor tax applications nationally, and it would be expected that the level of online take-up would increase further over time.</p>  <p>  The operation of the motor tax system is, of course, kept under regular review in my Department.

The plan outlined the following main management actions aimed at reducing eel mortality and increasing silver eel escapement to the sea:</p>  <p>- a cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market;</p>  <p>- mitigation of the impact of hydropower installations;</p>  <p>- ensure upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers;</p>  <p>- an improvement of water quality.</p>  <p>  The overall requirement and objective is to provide, with high probability, a long-term 40% escapement to the sea of the biomass of silver eel, relative to pristine conditions (i.e. if the stock had been completely free of man-made influences including commercial fishing).</p>  <p>  The latest advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in 2014 states that &ldquo;The status of eel remains critical and ICES advises that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) affecting production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to &ndash; or kept as close to &ndash; zero as possible.  The annual recruitment to Europe has increased over the last 3 years from 5% to 12% of historic levels, however, recruitment is still well below the reference levels of 1960-1979 and there is no change in the status of the eel as being critically endangered&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s EMP was reviewed in 2012 including a comprehensive scientific assessment of eel stocks nationally.  The 2012 review included a robust public consultation process during which many issues were raised and considered.  Full details of the outputs of the public consultation are available on the Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) web site.  Similar reviews were carried out across EU Member States as the eel stock has radically declined throughout Europe.  The status of the European Eel is defined by the United Nations as critically endangered. </p>  <p>  While I recognize fully the difficulty facing eel fishermen, a further review of Ireland&rsquo;s EMP will commence in the coming weeks and an opportunity for further consultation with, and submissions from, stakeholders will be advanced at that time.</p>  <p>  No funding was provided by the European Union, in the context of EU regulation 1100/2007, for the provision of a hardship scheme and as there are no property right attaching to public eel licences there are no plans to introduce such a scheme at this time.</p></reply>

It aligns with this Government&rsquo;s consistent message that a strong, modern and commercially viable post office network, that is responsive to changing consumer choices, is essential for urban and rural communities alike.</p>  <p>  Taking account of changes in technology and general retail behaviour, there are significant challenges facing the post office network. In that regard, I established the Post Office Network Business Development Group earlier this year, of which the Irish Postmasters Union is a member.  The Terms of Reference for the Group are to:</p>  <p>- examine the potential from existing and new Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the post office network;</p>  <p>- identify the new business opportunities for the post office network, taking account of international experience;</p>  <p>- engage as necessary with the public sector, commercial bodies and other interested parties in pursuit of the above objectives;</p>  <p>- prepare an interim and final report for the Minister in accordance with an agreed timetable.</p>  <p>  The work of the Group will be of strategic importance to the future of the post office network and I look forward to it concluding its deliberations later this year.  I understand that the discussions that have taken place to date have been productive, which is encouraging as it is in everyone&rsquo;s interest that we have a sustainable post office network and one that meets the needs of the consumer first and foremost.  Our collective challenge will be to ensure that the future services offered by An Post and the postmasters place the company on a sound financial footing.</p></reply>

Solar photo-voltaic is not one of the qualifying technologies for this scheme.  Further information is available on my Department's website, .</p><p>The Green Paper on Energy Policy, <i>inter alia</i>, sought feedback on the role that alternative technologies, such as solar, could play in delivering our renewable energy ambitions.

The Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy has been in place since 2001 and is the overall support mechanism for generation designed for security of supply purposes, including peat generation, and for the development of renewable electricity.  It is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers.</p><p>On average, over the operation of the PSO levy, the peat plants have received &euro;51.4 million per annum.  However this should not be taken as indicative of future payments from the PSO levy, the sum of which is dependent on the wholesale price of electricity set in a competitive market.  The amount of the PSO levy varies from year to year as the levy is determined, <i>inter-alia,</i>by the difference between market revenues earned by generators and the returns allowed in their PSO contracts.</p><p>It is the case that having been awarded 15 year contracts to ensure security of supply, the peat plants referred to will be transitioning out of subsidy over the coming years.  In line with Government policy there has been a gradual increase in the proportion of co-firing with biomass at the Edenderry plant.  Market dynamics, regulatory decisions on priority dispatch for hybrid renewables as well as policy decisions on the &quot;REFIT 3&quot; scheme will influence the future of peat in the Irish generation fuel mix once the current peat PSOs have expired.</p><p>More broadly Bord na M&oacute;na is facing significant business challenges in the context of the deregulation of the electricity market and increasingly competitive and challenging environments across all its business areas.  I understand that in order to ensure its continued success, the company is implementing a programme to transform all areas of its operations and structure, the key objective of which is to improve business effectiveness and efficiency.</p></reply>

It has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.</p>  <p>  A report on the &ldquo;State of Broadband&rdquo; published by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in September 2014 on broadband penetration, ranks Ireland 36th of 190 countries for fixed line broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants, 22nd of 138 countries for mobile broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants and 28th of 191 countries with over 78% of the population accessing the internet using a broadband connection.</p>  <p>  Comparisons of available broadband speeds by the OECD and other statistical reporting bodies concentrate on the headline speeds or averages of broadband speeds marketed by the largest operators in each country.  These reports do not measure public access to those higher broadband speeds within countries.  Such comparisons must be interpreted with caution, as the OECD itself advises.</p>  <p>  The most recent OECD report on marketed broadband speeds, up to September 2012, ranks Ireland 11th highest, equal with countries such as Australia, France, Germany, Switzerland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom for the highest marketed download speed available, which was 100Mbps at that time.  These tables do not, however, quantify the proportion of households, located in less densely populated areas, who cannot access the higher speeds.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  The commercial sector will have delivered high speed broadband to 1.6 m of Ireland's 2.3 m premises by the end of 2016 with minimum speeds of 30mbps.  The Government's intervention will be targetted at the remaining 30% of premises.  It is is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.  This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government.  It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In the mobile telephony market, the 4G networks, which network operators are currently completing, provide a substantial level of improvement in performance and capabilities over previous 3G and 2G technologies.  These 4G networks use the same technology as the most modern mobile networks providing public access internationally.  At least one operator now states that it is now providing 4G services to 90% of the population in Ireland.</p></reply>

A well balanced fuel mix that provides reliable energy, minimises costs and protects against supply disruptions and price volatility, is essential to Irish consumers.  Provisional figures (provided by SEAI) for 2014 indicate that 69.6% of electricity was generated from fossil fuels which are likely to remain a key component of the electricity generation fuel mix in the medium term.</p>  <p>  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources.  Good progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our generation portfolio.</p>  <p>  Policies and schemes are in place to incentivise the use of renewable energy.  The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies.  To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity.</p>  <p>  Currently, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid is just under 2,600 MW of which 2,200 MW is wind.  A further 3,700 MW of renewable generation is contracted for connection to the grid, of which almost 3,600 MW is wind generation.  Provisional figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicate that the total contribution from renewable generation to gross electricity consumption last year was 22.6%.  In addition, wave and tidal energy have the potential to contribute to our renewable electricity target, provided the technologies become commercially viable in the medium to longer term.  It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to achieve 40% renewable electricity.</p>  <p>  Looking to the European Union's emerging climate and energy targets for 2030, it is likely that all Member States will be required to expand their renewable electricity generation portfolios beyond their 2020 capacities.</p></reply>

The paper, which reviews, inter alia, the Grid Link, Grid West, and North South Transmission Line projects, confirms that Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy transmission needs may be met with less new infrastructure build than previously anticipated because of new technological developments and updated projections of future electricity demand.</p>  <p>  The discussion paper, which was subject to an independent peer review, confirms the need to reinforce the transmission system in the South East.  It suggests an additional option to the original Grid Link options.  The original options would require either (i) the construction of significant amounts of new overhead lines or (ii) the laying of significant amounts of underground cable.  The additional option contained in the recently published discussion document would involve an underwater cable in the Shannon estuary and upgrading existing transmission lines rather than building new lines.</p>  <p>  The discussion paper also puts forward options for Grid West.  The options include underground cabling, a 400kV overhead line option, and a 220kV overhead line with some of the line placed underground.</p>  <p>  The discussion paper reaffirms the need for the North South Transmission Line project and that the existing proposal for a 400kV overhead line remains the most appropriate solution for the project.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the Independent Expert Panel (IEP) that is overseeing the integrity of the process being undertaken by EirGrid to report on the Grid West and Grid Link projects.  The EirGrid reports are required to be comprehensive, route-specific studies of overhead and underground options for the projects.  They must also be complete, comparable (overhead line comparable against underground cable) and objective and include assessments of potential environmental impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors.  In due course, after consideration of the reports, the IEP will provide an opinion to me on both of them.  Thereafter, EirGrid will publicly consult on each project.  I expect to receive the IEP's opinion on the Grid West project over the coming days and the opinion on the Grid Link project in quarter three, 2015.</p>  <p>  Once these steps have been completed, it will then be a matter for EirGrid, in consultation with the Commission for Energy Regulation, to make a decision on which option to pursue on each of the Grid Link and Grid West projects.</p>  <p>  Each of these 3 major projects will be the subject of a planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in due course.</p></reply>

The draft Policy essentially recognises the importance of the aviation sector to Ireland and to economic recovery and growth.  The Policy is designed to facilitate the expansion of the aviation industry, help make it more competitive, tackle barriers to growth and facilitate the development of new air transport links.  It contains specific provisions for each of the State Airports including Cork.  It restates Government Policy in relation to Cork and recognises Cork Airport's role as a key tourism and business gateway for that region, as well as its strategic importance, serving Ireland's second city and its hinterland, as well as identifying the potential for the airport to stabilise and grow traffic.   </p>  <p>  I am very much of the view that the policies identified in the NAP and the recently published National Tourism Policy will create the conditions necessary to complement and assist the work of Cork Airport as it strives to reverse the decline in recent years in passenger numbers at the Airport.  The NAP will however make it clear, that it is a matter for the daa and Cork Airport management to stabilise and to grow traffic.  Therefore, I expect that the opportunities provided in these Plans will be fully exploited by them.</p></reply>

These Directives aim to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas.  The Directives have been transposed into national law under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 and the Wildlife Acts.  In advance of the designation of a site, my Department writes to all identified land owners with a legal interest in the site, outlining the intention to designate the site, the appeals process and how to get further information.  Public notices in relation to the proposed designation are also placed in local media. </p><p>Landowners may object to the proposed designation of a site as a special area of conservation or special protection area.  Following the completion of a departmental review of an objection to the proposed designation, landowners may opt to take their cases to the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board, an independently chaired Board which makes recommendations to me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, on such cases.  The appeals process includes an oral hearing.</p><p>Since this Government has come into office, huge efforts have been made to solve the issue of the protection of Ireland's raised bog special areas of conservation within the framework of the Habitats Directive.  This has included intense engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission. </p><p>3,076 applications have been received under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme for raised bog special areas of conservation.  Of these, 768 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.  In addition, around 1,500 submissions would have been received from stakeholders, including turf cutters, during the public consultation process on the draft National Peatlands Strategy and the draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan. </p><p>In the context of the finalisation of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, my Department is considering the available options in terms of relocation to non-designated bogs and the provisions of the EU Habitats Directive.  Under article 6.3 of the Directive consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation where it can be shown that such cutting will not have an adverse effect on the site.  Under article 6.4 of the Directive consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation for imperative reasons of overriding public interest. </p><p>Given the clear scientific evidence of the negative impact of turf extraction on raised bogs, it will only be possible to utilise the provisions of article 6.3 in a small number of cases.  Similarly, the flexibility provided for under article 6.4, if required, will only be applicable to a small number of sites.</p><p>Final resolution of all issues in relation to the protection of Ireland's raised bog special areas of conservation will only be brought about by everyone working together, within the law, with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established with the purpose of ensuring the input from all stakeholders.</p><p>The <i>Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network</i>, published in January 2014<i>, </i>provides detail on future arrangements regarding turf cutting on each of the 75 current raised bog natural heritage areas.  The<i>Review </i>has concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network.  This will entail the phasing out of turf-cutting on certain natural heritage areas by 1 January 2017 and the partial or complete de-designation of certain natural heritage areas.</p></reply>

Despite these efforts and those of local landowners, the hare population there has remained at very low levels for the past 20 years.  </p>  <p>  A 1995 estimate put the population at 15-20 animals.  Since then there has been some declines, as well as introductions during the 1990s.  One current estimate of the population put the number as low as 6, with another estimate at 10-15.  Such low numbers are believed to be attributable to a number of potential pressures, particularly disturbance by dogs.  I understand that the main landowner, Dublin City Council, is working proactively to raise awareness and address management issues.</p>  <p>  While it is a matter for the landowners on the island to consider if they wish to translocate hares there, such a proposal would require a licence from my Department under the Wildlife Acts and, in that regard, it would be important that conditions on the island would be suitable for a reintroduction programme.</p></reply>
