It addresses previous principal concerns expressed by the union side while retaining many of the important benefits for learners.  My acceptance of the proposal required further compromise and movement from me, which I considered to be in the best interests of students.</p><p>  I have a mandate to act responsibly on behalf of our junior cycle students, their parents and our wider society.  That is why I have signalled my intention to now proceed with implementation of Junior Cycle reform on the basis of the Travers proposals, and it is my intention to work with all interested partners in advancing that agenda.  </p><p>  I remain open to the two post-primary teacher unions coming on board and working with my Department and the other education partners in implementing the new programme.  This requires an acceptance by them that the Travers proposal provides a basis for agreement and a willingness, therefore, to suspend their current industrial action.</p></reply>

Following the Pre Stage 1 meeting held last November, both Boards of Management and their Design Team are working on finalising the Stage 1 report for submission to my Department.  These reports have not yet been received in my Department. </p><p>  Upon satisfactory completion of Stage 1 and subject to no issues arising, the project will then be authorised to progress to Stage 2(a), which is the developed sketch design stage. </p><p>  It is intended that school building projects in architectural planning, including this project, will be progressed to final planning stages so that they will be well placed for consideration in the context of future construction programmes.</p></reply>

In pursuing these settlements, the State Claims Agency will consider cases where there was a prior complaint about the teacher concerned.</p><p>This is because these are the circumstances on which the Decision was based.</p><p>The cap reflects the total amount paid by the State in the O'Keeffe case.  While the Government will not meet the liabilities of other defendants, where however, there is agreement on the value of the claim, the Agency may seek to initially settle the claim on an equal basis, with the actual apportionment of liability among the co-Defendants being subsequently determined by the Court.</p><p>  I will be reporting to Government shortly to clarify the position of those who had not progressed their claims.  The Government will then consider whether any measures will be taken.</p></reply>

The decision making authority for any amalgamation proposal belongs to the Patron of a school, subject to the approval of the Minister for Education and Skills.  The initiative for an amalgamation may come from a variety of sources, such as parents, staff, Board of Management and Patron. </p><p>  I recognise that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities and will continue to be so.  It is for that reason that I recently announced that a voluntary protocol for amalgamation is being developed for the very smallest schools.  The protocol is still under development.  Under the protocol, it is envisaged that the Department will write to the patrons of all such schools that are located within an 8 km distance of another school of similar patronage and language of instruction.  The letter will invite them to reflect on the benefits that amalgamation opportunities might provide in order to create more sustainable school communities into the future.  Engagement with the protocol will be entirely voluntary.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the improvement in the staffing levels for small schools contained in my Department's Circular 0005/2015, which is available on my Department's website at www.education.gov.ie.  These improvements particularly recognise the challenges faced by very small schools that are more than 8 km from the next nearest school of the same type.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-22a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015042200050#WRA01600"><p>My Department's policy in this area is underpinned by the Action Plan on Bullying.  Guidelines to assist schools in developing an Anti-Bullying Policy were issued to all schools in 2013.  Schools may choose from a number of programmes available to them in order to deal with the particular issues they have identified and my Department does not endorse any one particular programme.  The approach adopted under the Action Plan is for schools to use the programme best suited to address the particular challenges they face.  </p><p>  The Action Plan does not favour addressing identity-based bullying on an issue-by-issue basis, but rather recommends respect for all.  Therefore, I do not think it would be appropriate to fund the roll-out of the Yellow Flag programme on a national basis.  This was costed by the Irish Traveller Movement at &euro;250,000 over three years.</p><p>  I can confirm that there is ongoing liaison between officials of my Department and officials of the Department of Justice and Equality in the context of equality matters generally, including national fora in relation to Travellers.</p></reply>

While my announcement did not include a new school for the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area, it did include a new school in the adjoining area of Goatstown/Stillorgan which is to open in September 2016.  My announcement followed a detailed analysis of demographic data at primary level undertaken by my Department.  Where that analysis identified areas for the expansion of existing schools, it is my intention to address these through the Five Year School Capital Investment Plan. </p><p>  My Department is currently carrying out a nationwide demographic exercise to determine where additional post-primary school accommodation might be needed from 2017 onwards.  This includes an examination of the greater D&uacute;n Laoghaire area.  On foot of this review, arrangements will be made to provide additional post-primary accommodation where this is needed.</p></reply>

According to the Higher Education System Performance Report by the Higher Education Authority (HEA), core expenditure per student by higher education institutions (excluding research expenditure) has declined by 15% in the five years to 2013 with the bulk of this decline accounted for by the growth in student numbers.</p><p>  This report is available on the HEA's website, the link to which I will arrange to have sent to the Deputy, and includes details on student numbers at third level.</p><p>  Details of year-on-year increases in the Student Contribution will also be provided to the Deputy.</p><p>  An Expert Group, chaired by Peter Cassells, is currently examining future funding options for higher education.  The objective is to identify a range of approaches that, combined, will achieve a sustainable funding base to address the continual expansion of the sector while protecting the quality of education.  The report will help inform decision-making as to the future funding of the sector.</p><p><b>HIGHER EDUCATION - &euro;000s</b></p><p><b>EXPENDITURE 2006-2015</b><table><tr><th>- </th><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>Current</td><td>&euro;1,683.4</td><td>&euro;1,755.7</td><td>&euro;1,860.7</td><td>&euro;1,853.7</td><td>&euro;1,771.4</td><td>&euro;1,688.1</td><td>&euro;1,595.0</td><td>&euro;1,537.5</td><td>&euro;1,471.8</td><td>&euro;1,380.0</td></tr><tr><td>Capital</td><td>&euro;116.0</td><td>&euro;159.2</td><td>&euro;163.1</td><td>&euro;201.2</td><td>&euro;164.2</td><td>&euro;79.0</td><td>&euro;56.2</td><td>&euro;69.1</td><td>&euro;79.1</td><td>&euro;83.7</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>&euro;1,799.4</td><td>&euro;1,914.9</td><td>&euro;2,023.8</td><td>&euro;2,054.9</td><td>&euro;1,935.6</td><td>&euro;1,767.1</td><td>&euro;1,651.2</td><td>&euro;1,606.6</td><td>&euro;1,550.9</td><td>&euro;1,463.7</td></tr></table>Note: The current expenditure figures above include recurrent funding (core grant and free fees), funding provided under the Student Grant Scheme, higher education research funding and other higher education funding.</p><p><b>Details of Year on Year Increases in the Student Services Charge/Student Contribution:</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Amount - &euro;</th><th>% Increase in Charge</th></tr><tr><td>1996/97</td><td>190</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>1997/98</td><td>317</td><td>66%</td></tr><tr><td>1998/99</td><td>330</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>1999/20</td><td>353</td><td>7%</td></tr><tr><td>2000/01</td><td>371</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>2001/02</td><td>396</td><td>7%</td></tr><tr><td>2002/03</td><td>670</td><td>69%</td></tr><tr><td>2003/04</td><td>670</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>2004/05</td><td>750</td><td>12%</td></tr><tr><td>2005/06</td><td>775</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>2006/07</td><td>800</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>2007/08</td><td>825</td><td>3.1%</td></tr><tr><td>2008/09</td><td>900</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>2009/10</td><td>Up to 1,500</td><td>Up to 67%</td></tr><tr><td>2010/11</td><td>Up to 1,500</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>2011/12*</td><td>2,000</td><td>33%</td></tr><tr><td>2012/13</td><td>2,250</td><td>12.5%</td></tr><tr><td>2013/14</td><td>2,500</td><td>11.1%</td></tr><tr><td>2014/15</td><td>2,750</td><td>10%</td></tr></table><i>* From 2011/12 the charge is known as the Student Contribution</i></p></reply>

The Government remains committed to the further development of our research ecosystem given the key role that it plays not only in underpinning economic recovery and maintaining Ireland's competitiveness, but also given its centrality to the quality of our higher education system and the broader societal developments that research drives. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the process of developing a successor strategy to the SSTI is under way.  The formulation of the new Strategy provides a clear opportunity for Ireland to develop a new whole-of-Government strategy for research and innovation that can build on the progress made to date and is timely as Ireland moves into a new phase of economic growth and societal development.  An Interdepartmental Committee, under the chairmanship of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which has the lead responsibility for science policy, has been tasked with developing proposals for this new Strategy.  I am represented on this Committee by officials from my Department and they are closely engaged with the process.  An important element of this process is stakeholder and public consultation and some 75 submissions have been received including from the higher education sector.

While work is underway exploring how to optimise resources and governance arrangements to the greatest extent possible, I can also assure the Deputy that there will be no diminution of locally-provided services to the public, no closure of service locations, and no staff redundancies.  In fact, the aim of this exploration is to ensure that any efficiencies and savings achieved in governance arrangements can be used to expand and enhance local service delivery. </p>  <p>  The Citizens Information Board (CIB) is the statutory body responsible for providing information, advice (including money and budgeting advice service) and advocacy services on a wide range of public and social services.  CIB delivers on this remit through a network of delivery partners which includes 51 local Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS) and 42 local Citizens Information Services (CIS).  In 2015 the CIB has been allocated a budget of &euro;46 million of which some &euro;17.9 million is allocated to the MABS network of companies.  </p>  <p>  There are over 600 permanent staff, approximately 200 scheme workers and an estimated 2,000 volunteers working for the 93 independent companies in the network (51 MABS and 42 CISs).  Each of these companies has a separate voluntary Board of Management, comprising an average of over 9 members per Board resulting in a governance structure of over 800 people.  The maintenance of such an unwieldy company and Board structure is no longer sustainable from an organisational or governance perspective and the resource effort required could otherwise be directed towards improved service delivery to citizens.  Therefore, as part of the implementation of its Strategic Plan 2012-2015, CIB commissioned a feasibility study to identify options for dealing with this issue through greater organisational consolidation and/or integration of its delivery partners.  This work was carried out by a company called Pathfinder and overseen by a Steering Group, comprising national representatives from MABS staff and Boards, Citizens Information Services staff and Boards, and staff from the Citizens Information Board.  The work included extensive and comprehensive consultation with all stakeholders, including representatives of CIB's delivery partner services (MABS and CIS) at local level.  It identified a number of options for consideration.  Following on from this, the Board of CIB agreed to the establishment of a Design Group tasked with outlining and recommending possible new structural models.  The Design Group includes members of the voluntary boards and staff of a number of the MABS and CIS services, together with representation from CIB management.  Submissions were sought by CIB from the representatives of Boards and staff of MABS and CIS, to inform the deliberations of the Design Group.</p>  <p>  The Design Group recently furnished a progress report on its deliberations to the CIB executive, which in turn communicated an update to its network of service delivery partners.  The Design Group has identified, as an option for consideration by the Board of CIB in due course, that the 51 Boards of MABS companies and the 42 Boards of CIS services could be consolidated across six (6) regions, resulting in six (6) independent MABS companies and Boards, and six (6) independent CIS companies and Boards, all reporting to the board of CIB.  However, it is important to note that any such consolidation would be at the Board level only.  All existing MABS offices would remain unaffected.  Local service delivery and personnel would not be impacted and would continue as before. It may be possible to take any savings that arise and use them for enhancing local service delivery or indeed offering additional services.  It is also important to note that neither this option nor any alternative has yet been considered by the Board of CIB.  Accordingly, no decisions have been made by the Board and no proposal has been formally made by it to my Department for consideration.  It is expected that the Design Group proposal, when further developed, will be formally submitted to the Board of CIB for its consideration. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the level of engagement in the process to date, involving all the relevant CIB delivery partners, including the Money Advice and Budgeting Service is reflected in the proposal from the Design Group and that a debate in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the matter is not required at this time.</p></reply>

To this end, the Department provides a wide range of supports for people with disabilities, which play an important role in supporting increased participation in the labour force by people with disabilities. These supports include the wage subsidy scheme (WSS), the EmployAbility (supported employment) service, the reasonable accommodation fund for the employment of people with disabilities, the disability awareness training scheme and the partial capacity benefit scheme. In 2014 expenditure on this range of supports amounted to some &euro;31.5 million.</p><p>The range of employment supports for people with disabilities is promoted through the Department&rsquo;s website and through employer engagement opportunities. Furthermore, EmployAbility service staff and the Department&rsquo;s employment support officers regularly disseminate information on the supports available to both people with disabilities and private sector employers. </p><p>In relation to the monitoring of the EmployAbility service, the EmployAbility companies report to the Department on a monthly basis detailing their performance and progress against a number of key performance indicators including:</p><p>- a minimum target of 50% of jobseekers in employment with support from the programme;</p><p>- a minimum target of 50% of jobseekers exiting the programme while in employment; and </p><p>- a ration of job coach to client of 1:25.</p><p>I would also like to point out that an external review of the EmployAbility service is currently underway which will assess the effectiveness of the service, the reporting structures with the Department and present proposals for the future delivery of the service.</p></reply>

The projects commenced at the end of 2012 and will end on 30 April 2015 (the ESF portion of the funding that was provided under the Human Capital Investment Operational Programme 2007- 2013 will terminate at the end of April.) </p>  <p>  I very much welcomed and supported the setting up of these projects as they set out to explore a variety of routes towards ensuring that people with disabilities are enabled to avail of progression, education and development opportunities within the world of work - to help inform future policy on activation/engagement measures for people with disabilities. When the projects were set up, the Department gave a commitment that it would carry out an independent evaluation of the projects to assess the outcomes achieved and to identify &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; in terms of the methodologies and processes used that could, where appropriate, be &ldquo;mainstreamed&rdquo; and delivered by existing services.</p>  <p>  However, I must clarify that the basis on which the projects were awarded funding was that they would terminate at the end of April 2015 - there was never any question that the projects could turn into ongoing service delivery operation in their own right.</p>  <p>  The independent evaluation referenced above &ndash; which is being undertaken on behalf of the Department by Indecon International Consultants &ndash; is underway and, pending its completion, there is no objective basis for identifying how successful any project was and what practices/processes from the projects worked best and so might could be considered for incorporating into existing service delivery structures.  </p>  <p>  When the evaluation is completed at the end of June, the Department will set up and chair a working group, comprising the relevant Departments with responsibilities under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy, to consider the findings.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that there will still be people participating in the WALK PEER project (and a number of others) at the end of April so I have decided that funding for these projects will be made available from the Department for a short period beyond April i.e. to end-July 2015, to facilitate those projects in ensuring that participants finish their involvement in an orderly manner. </p></reply>

Figures in relation to previous tax years are available on the Revenue Commissioners' statistics webpage at . This information can be found under the heading &quot;Income Tax and Corporation Tax - Costs of Credits, Allowances and Reliefs&quot;, at . Updates will be published on Commissioners' website in due course.</p><p>I am advised that a breakdown of the estimated cost of tax relief for dental expenses alone is not available. As the Deputy notes, routine dental treatment such as the extraction, scaling and filling of teeth and the provision and repairing of artificial teeth or dentures is currently excluded from the relief. As a result, information on expenses in relation to routine dental treatment is not required to be returned to Revenue. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as they have no data on the additional potential treatments costs or number of claims for tax relief if the scheme were extended to include routine dental treatment, it is not possible to provide the estimated cost the Deputy requested.</p><p>The State already provides some support to those who require dental treatment through the schemes detailed below:</p><p>(i) <i>Treatment Benefits from the Department of Social Protection</i>. It is my understanding that this scheme is available to insured workers and retired people who have the required number of PRSI contributions. The benefit under this scheme is that the Department of Social Protection pays for an oral examination for a qualifying individual once a calendar year.</p><p>(ii) <i>The Dental Treatment Services Scheme</i>(DTSS) provides access to dental treatment for adult holders (over 16 years of age). A free oral examination every calendar year and free emergency dental treatment for relief of pain and sepsis are available to all eligible patients. This includes 2 fillings per annum and all extractions. </p><p>Most other treatments require prior approval and patients with special needs, high risk patients and those who have greater clinical needs receive priority. The National Oral Health Office issued Standard Operating Procedures to dentists in November 2011 to provide clearer guidance on the application of DTSS prior approval requests (for example, for dentures). </p><p>The DTSS provides treatment for periodontal/gum disease in cases where care is especially warranted. This includes clients who are pregnant, have diabetes or immuno-compromising conditions, or require relevant surgical procedures such as cardiac surgery and joint replacements. Approval for periodontal treatment may be given by the local Principal Dental Surgeon for these and other high risk or special needs groups.</p><p>The restriction of the Treatment Benefit scheme as it relates to dental treatment in 2010 was expected to lead to savings of &euro;37.5 million. To provide tax relief for routine dental treatment would serve to negate some of the savings achieved from that policy change. Given the existing supports available, particularly for those on low incomes through their access via the medical card, I am not predisposed to expanding the tax relief available for health expenses to include expenses associated with routine dental treatment. However, I will have the Deputy's suggestion examined for my consideration as part of my deliberations for the next Budget.</p></reply>

It is important that each lending institution is allowed to assess properly and independently the risks that it is considering when deciding to approve a loan.  I do not interfere with such commercial decisions.</p><p>Mortgage lending decisions must be undertaken on a sustainable and prudential basis by financial institutions and conform fully to the regulatory requirements, both in relation to the financial institution itself, and also with regard to the safeguarding of the borrower's interests.</p><p>While mortgage interest relief is being phased out, it may have relevance to the situation outlined in the details supplied.  In Supplementary Budget 2009, it was limited so that interest payable on a qualifying home loan would only qualify for tax relief for the first seven tax years of the life of that loan (7 year rule).  However, in Finance Act 2010, it was extended up to the end of 2017 for those whose entitlement to relief was due to end in 2010 or after (i.e. those who purchased in 2004 or after).  Accordingly, individuals who took out qualifying loans in the period 2004 to 2012 will continue to be entitled to mortgage interest relief up until the end of 2017.</p><p>It should be noted that, where there is an entitlement to mortgage interest relief, it is available at varying rates and subject to certain ceilings.  For example, individuals who are in the first seven tax years of their qualifying loan are entitled to a higher interest ceiling, on which the rate of relief is applied.  For such individuals, the interest ceilings are &euro;10,000 per annum for a single individual and &euro;20,000 per annum for married couples and civil partnerships.  For individuals who have an entitlement to mortgage interest relief and who are in their eighth or subsequent years of their qualifying loan, a lower interest ceiling applies.  For such individuals, the interest ceilings are &euro;3,000 per annum for a single individual and &euro;6,000 per annum for married couples/civil partnerships.  Therefore, some individuals will experience a reduction in the level of relief they receive as they enter into their eighth and subsequent years of their qualifying loans.  However, they will continue to receive mortgage interest relief up until the end of 2017.</p><p>The system of mortgage interest relief is designed and targeted in such a way that the relief is of greater value in the early years of a qualifying loan where the interest represents a greater proportion of the repayment.  Mortgage interest relief is of lesser value to individuals whose repayments are made up of a higher proportion of principal than interest, as would generally be the case for those who move in to the eighth and subsequent years of their loans.  Furthermore, the relief is proportionate to the amount of mortgage interest paid, up to the relevant ceiling.  Therefore, the greater the amount of interest payable, the greater the relief available, subject to the previously outlined ceilings for relief.</p><p>This Government is very conscious of the significant concerns and difficulties faced by homeowners, not least in relation to their mortgages.  In addition, the Government is committed to helping address the particular problems faced by those that bought homes at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008.  In this regard, in Budget 2012, I announced my intention to fulfil the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period.  A mortgage holder will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 <i>or</i>if they drew down their mortgage in that period.  As the Deputy will be aware, mortgage interest relief has been abolished for mortgages take out since 1 January 2013.</p><p>In the particular case specified, I would have concerns that the introduction of such a credit would merely allow financial institutions to further increase standard variable rates, with the benefit of any tax relief transferring to financial institutions with no net cost reduction for the relevant mortgage holders.  Therefore, I am not predisposed towards the introduction of such a tax credit.</p></reply>

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or, inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance.</p><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, for the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the &quot;Group threshold&quot; below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.</p><p>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.</p><p><b>Group A: tax free threshold &euro;225,000</b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild, and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p><p><b>Group B: tax free threshold &euro;30,150</b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p><p><b>Group C: tax free threshold &euro;15,075</b>applies in all other cases.</p><p>The importance of agriculture in the Irish economy is well recognised.  In this context, a specific relief from CAT is provided for gifts and inheritances of agricultural property once certain conditions are satisfied.  This relief is known as Agricultural Relief.  The aim of the relief is to ensure the active use of agricultural land.  The relief takes the form of a reduction in the market value of the agricultural property by 90% for the purposes of establishing whether or not a CAT liability arises on the gift or inheritance.</p><p>In order to qualify for Agricultural Relief, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance must satisfy the following conditions:</p><p>- 80% of the beneficiary's total overall assets must consist of agricultural property by value after receiving the gift or inheritance.</p><p>- The beneficiary of the gift or inheritance must also either have an agricultural qualification (a qualification of the kind listed in Schedule 2, 2A or 2B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999) or, alternatively, must farm the agricultural property on a commercial basis for not less than 50% of his or her normal working time.</p><p>- The beneficiary must farm the agricultural property for a period of not less than 6 years after receiving the gift or inheritance or lease the agricultural property for a period of not less than 6 years, subject to the lease and the lessee also satisfying the conditions of the relief.</p><p>The income of the beneficiary is not relevant to CAT Agricultural Relief and there is no income threshold to be met by the beneficiary in order to avail of the relief.</p></reply>

I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions setting interest rates.</p>  <p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. Each institution determines the rate it charges its customers, depending on a number of factors such as cost of funds and commercial considerations (such as competition, risk pricing and the impact on deposit rates).</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. However, the Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review and has been the subject of recent correspondence between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. The current position is that the Central Bank does not have new proposals for the additional regulation of interest rates. However, as I have outlined in previous Parliamentary Questions, a former Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November stated that in Ireland, as in most advanced economies, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis. Such control would strongly discourage new entrants when, in fact, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services. In this regard, there have been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may be entering a new and more competitive phase.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act) 2013 introduced changes to Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which regulates fees and charges in order to attract new entrants to the Irish banking sector and there is some evidence of improvements in the banking sector with a number of institutions introducing new products and adapting their business model. In the last 12 months there have been a number of new entrants to the Irish mortgage market bringing additional and welcome competition to this sector.</p>  <p>  I should add that myself and the Governor of the Central Bank meet regularly, the latest of these meetings took place on 2 April. Among the items discussed was the issue of mortgage interest rates. The Governor provided an update on the ongoing work that he and his officials are carrying out on the issue of the standard variable rates charged by the lenders.</p>  <p>  We noted that the SVRs charged in Ireland are higher than other euro area countries and have not fallen in line with ECB wholesale rates. The Central Bank will continue to research why this is the case and will publish results shortly. The Governor will update me on progress in due course.</p></reply>

Its integrity services are provided at licensed racecourses, point to point meetings and in out-of-competition situations.  As part of its remit, the Racing Regulatory Body carries out a drug testing programme and authorised officers from my Department cooperate with the Racing Regulatory   Body in these matters where appropriate. There are no plans to recruit agricultural officers specifically for the purpose of conducting out-of-training testing of race horses.</p>  <p>  Funding for the Racing Regulatory   Body is provided through the integrity services budget which it agrees annually with Horse Racing Ireland. I understand that increased funding of   &euro;7.35m has been provided by HRI to the Racing Regulatory Body in 2015 for integrity services. Within the above budget, a sum of &euro;2.25m has been allocated for doping control which includes a provision for out of competition testing and for new investment in this area.   </p>  <p>  In 2014, 3,085 blood or urine samples taken from horses were tested, 2 of which proved to be positive for a prohibited substance. 84% of these samples were taken at the racecourse, 11% at point to points and 5% at trainers&rsquo; yards. The nature of drug testing in horseracing is changing globally with a greater move towards out of competition/in training testing.   </p>  <p>  In the past two years the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee tested over 430 horses in training.   </p>  <p>  Horse Racing Ireland has established a Drug Testing Task Force comprising representatives of the Racing Regulatory Body, owners, trainers, breeders, sales companies and stud book authorities to recommend future strategies for drug testing within the industry here. The work of the Task Force is ongoing and it is due to report by the middle of this year.</p>  <p>  Separately, Horse Racing Ireland and the Racing Regulatory Body has commissioned a review of the laboratory facilities available to Irish racing by Dr Terence Wan, the head of the laboratory of the Hong Kong Jockey Club which is responsible for doping control in that jurisdiction, and I expect that this exercise will also contribute to ensuring that such controls are operated as effectively as possible into the future.   </p></reply>

Currently, there are over 4,400 residents in 34 centres across the State under contract to RIA. Details of all of these centres and the companies or persons RIA has contracted to provide accommodation services are published in RIA's Annual Reports available on its website - .</p><p>In relation to costs, expenditure on the Direct Provision system on the Vote of the Department of Justice and Equality since 2008 has decreased from &euro;91.5m to &euro;53.22m in 2014.  RIA's Annual Reports provide a breakdown of this yearly expenditure.  Notwithstanding these significant costs the Deputy should be aware that a Value For Money review of spending by RIA published in 2010 found that an alternative system to Direct Provision would cost <i>twice</i>as much &ndash; not including the costs that would arise from a &ldquo;pull factor&rdquo; which would follow from a full welfare based system with rent supplements and so forth.</p><p>In relation to reform, last year the Government set up an independent working group to report to it on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers.  It is chaired by former High Court judge, Dr. Bryan McMahon, and comprises senior officials from all relevant Departments, the UNHCR, representatives of academia and various NGOs who have a long-standing interest in this area and other representatives of civil society.  The working group developed a work programme early on and established three sub-groups to deal with the following themes.  The first deals with conditions in centres, the second deals with supports for asylum seekers and the third deals with improving the processing of protection claims.  Over 40 meetings at plenary and sub-group level have taken place since the first meeting of the working group on 11 November 2014.</p><p>The working group has taken evidence directly from residents in the direct provision system both in writing and orally, visited centres around the country and spoken directly to residents.  It has engaged with particular groups of applicants including children, victims of torture, victims of trafficking and sexual violence, members of the LGBTI community and has taken oral and written submissions from a number of experts in this field, including the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon.  The Government recognises that the issues to be examined by the working group are complex and require thorough consideration to ensure that any recommendations are practical and sustainable from a budgetary perspective and do not undermine existing border controls and immigration policies.</p><p>The Chairman has indicated that the Working Group will be in a position to finalise its report before the end of May 2015 after which the Government will then consider the recommendations made therein.</p><p>The reference to the NGO Forum on Direct Provision is not understood. There is no such forum.  There is a forum whereby NGO's meet with officials of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) where matters relating to immigration and asylum matters generally are discussed.  If the reference is to the independent Working Group as described above, I do not attend its meetings.</p></reply>

The Deputy is advised that those in the Direct Provision system, whilst including applicants awaiting decisions for extended durations at various stages of the protection process, also includes recent applicants who have spent relatively short periods in the process, those who have taken judicial reviews in the courts against negative decisions on their applications, those subject to deportation orders following negative decisions, and an increasing number of persons who have elected to remain in the Direct Provision system following the granting of refugee status or leave to remain due to difficulties in sourcing suitable accommodation elsewhere.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to introduce a one-off scheme to clear all protection applications currently on hand.  The Deputy may be aware that there is a political commitment among EU Member States against any form of process that would grant residence status to persons present in the State without first examining the merits of their individual cases.  Broad regularisation programmes are problematic, in particular as they could give rise to unpredictable and very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.</p>  <p>  I have previously acknowledged however that the length of time that many applicants spend in the protection process is a matter that needs to be addressed particularly in light of the sharp increase in asylum application volumes in 2014 and so far in 2015.  The Deputy may be aware that  an independent Working Group was set up by Government in October 2014 to recommend to the Government what improvements should be made to the protection process, including direct provision and supports to asylum seekers.  One of the tasks of the Working Group is to identify improvements to existing arrangements for the processing of protection applications taking account of the Government's intention to legislate for a single application procedure.</p>  <p>  The Group began its work in November last under the Chairmanship of retired High Court Judge, Bryan McMahon and its membership is drawn from a range of interests in the international protection area including UNHCR, non-governmental organisations, protection applicants, academia, and relevant Government Departments and Offices.  The Working Group is due to report to Government with its recommendations by May 2015.</p>  <p>  I have also committed to introducing legislative change in the Protection area to provide for a single application procedure with a view to reducing the length of time applicants spend in the protection process.  On 25 March 2015 I published the General Scheme of the International Protection Bill, which has been approved by Government.  This is the first step in delivering the Government's undertaking in the Statement of Priorities 2014-2016 to legislate to reduce the length of time protection applicants spend in the system.  My objective is to reform the current multi-layered and sequential system which can result in applicants being accommodated in the State's system of direct provision for indeterminate periods of time.  The single procedure will identify at a much earlier stage those who are in need of international protection and should be granted status and those with no entitlement to stay in the State and who can safely return to their country of origin.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Government decision I have forwarded the General Scheme of the Bill to the Attorney General for the detailed drafting of the legislation which, subject to the approval of the Government at a future time, will be presented to the Oireachtas for enactment into law. My aim is for the legislation to be enacted by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the deliberations of the Working Group on the Protection process and the future publication of the International Protection Bill, a number of measures have already been taken to address the number of cases on hand in the protection system which are yielding significant results.  Various strategies are being utilised to deal with cases on hand including the scheduling of interviews of applicants on Saturdays.  The transfer of subsidiary protection application processing to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner in late 2013 has resulted in the production of decisions in some 1,000 cases at first instance.  In addition, a further 1,300 subsidiary protection applications have either been withdrawn or deemed withdrawn.  The processing of these cases has been greatly aided by the establishment of a legal panel set up to assist the Commissioner with this work.  Based on the success of the use of the panel it is now planned to expand it and extend its remit to include the processing of asylum applications.</p>  <p>  To assist with processing at the appeals stage of the process I have recently appointed nine additional members to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  These members have been selected from those who were considered suitable for appointment following a competitive process involving the Public Appointments Service.  My Department is also actively considering what other measures can be taken to reduce the number of cases on hand at the leave to remain stage of the process in advance of the introduction of a single application procedure.</p></reply>

Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of information on the courts system. I am informed that statistical data on orders for possession is available on the Courts Service website, www.courts.ie.</p><p>However, in order to be of assistance, I have had inquires made and the Courts Service has informed me that the information sought by the Deputy for the months of April and May can only be retrieved by way of a manual examination of each County Registrar's court list for both months. As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, this would require the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources which cannot be justified.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>Statistical data in respect of the 1st quarter of 2015 is currently being compiled. It is important to note that the number of civil bills issued does not reflect either the number of orders for possession granted or necessarily equate with repossessions as it is up to the person or company who obtained the order for possession to pursue its execution.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>Therefore, relative to the number of civil bills issued, a small portion end up as repossessions since in many cases the civil bill gives rise to engagement of the borrower with the bank resulting in either an informal deal or a Personal Insolvency Agreement.</p><p>The Expert Group on Repossessions in their report drew attention to the fact that any substantial and sustained increase in future demand for possession orders would require consideration of the court systems capacity to operate effectively and recommended that the capacity of the court system should be kept under review. The Courts Service are currently undertaking a review and assessment of the capacity of the court system to continue to operate effectively having regard to the sustained increased in the number of civil bills issued during the course of 2014. I am informed that this assessment should be complete by mid May 2015.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that this Government has put in place a number of legislative provisions regarding protection of the family home in cases where repossession of the property is being sought, most recently in section 2 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013. In addition, this Government has put in place a broad strategy to address the problem of mortgage arrears and family home repossessions. This has included an extensive suite of interventions designed to address the problem including:</p><p>-  specific Central Bank targets for the banks through the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART);</p><p>-  the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears produced by the Central Bank sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears;</p><p>-  extensive recasting of the personal insolvency legislation;</p><p>-  the provision of advice through Department of Social Protection-led initiatives; and</p><p>-  the mortgage-to-rent scheme which is designed to assist borrowers in an unsustainable mortgage position to remain in their homes through the involvement of social housing agencies.</p><p>The effective management of the mortgage arrears issue is, however, an area that remains under continuous review. More and concerted action can be undertaken by the banks to assist customers in arrears and, as the Taoiseach has previously announced, the Government is considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions. I think that it is also proper to reiterate that the Government's advice has always been that borrowers who find themselves in arrears should engage with their lending institution with a view to reaching a solution to their difficulties and I would encourage people to avail of the available services, where appropriate.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. There has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which was a key priority for youth organisations. My Department has notified youth organisations and projects, including Donnycarney Community and Youth Centre, of their 2015 allocations in respect of their youth services. An allocation of &euro;150,407 has been allocated to this project for 2015, unchanged from the previous year.</p>  <p>  As in recent years, grant administering agencies that administer youth funding, on behalf of my Department, were invited where it was appropriate, to submit proposals to my Department for the reconfiguration of the funding allocations notified to them across projects and funding schemes to better meet local needs.

Orthodontic services, also delivered by salaried dental staff of the HSE, are provided to eligible patients  based on the level of clinical need.  The budgets for the PDS and orthodontic services have been maintained at approximately &euro;60 million and approximately &euro;16 million respectively.  Oral health care is provided to medical card holders by dental practitioners contracted by the HSE under the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS).  Since 2011, when expenditure was &euro;53 million, there has been a significant increase in expenditure on the DTSS.  &euro;63 million was spent in 2012, &euro;70 million in 2013 and 2014 and the budget for 2015 is &euro;76 million.</p>  <p>  At present a new oral health policy is being developed by the Department of Health.  This three-year project commenced in 2014 and is being led by the Chief Dental Officer.  The project has three key parts.  The first is a needs assessment, which will inform how new services should be provided.  The second part will be a review of resources.  Thirdly, there will be consultation on new ways of delivering oral health services.  On 6 May there will be a consultation day involving key stakeholders, including dental professionals. I look forward to continued collaboration with and input from the dental profession as this project progresses.</p></reply>

When the assessment has been completed and a recommendation has been made, I review each application and prioritise them according to their merits before awarding National Lottery funding. Application forms can be found on the Department of Health's website www.health.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  Funding in 2015 amounts to &euro;3.286 million, all of which will be allocated before year end.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy and proves useful.</p></reply>

There are now interventions that can limit the damage to the heart such as thrombolysis (clot busting drugs) and Primary PCI (a type of heart procedure to remove the blockage in the arteries). </p>  <p>  Primary PCI is done on STEMI heart attacks (that&rsquo;s about 20% of heart attacks) and is done in a specialist centre by an experienced cardiologist.  To be a specialist centre doing PPCI you need a critical mass of population with a large volume of cases (approx. 200 cases per year) and enough experienced cardiologists to cover a 24/7 rota (6 or more).  Up to now 3 centres in Dublin have been covering Dublin and surrounding counties.</p>  <p>  The provision of Primary percutaneous intervention (PPCI) from three 24/7 centres in Dublin had proved unsustainable.  In November 2014, the Acute Hospitals Division of the HSE requested the National Clinical Programme for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS Programme) to review the current configuration of PPCI services in Dublin, having regard to the requirement to deliver safe, sustainable services on the designated sites.  The review looked at the number of centres that should be delivering PPCI in Dublin, where these centres should be located and the feasibility of maintaining 9 to 5 PPCI services on any cardiology intervention site.  </p>  <p>  The review was informed by advice from the principals involved in PPCI centres in the UK and other European countries and by models of care from the US and Australia.  Experience at national and international level highlights the importance of having sustainable rotas of clinical staff to support the 24/7 requirements of this service.  Following a consultation exercise with all relevant hospitals and the National Ambulance Service, the final report recommended that there should be two 24/7 PPCI centres for Dublin to be located in the Mater and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals, which would accept all ambulance transfers of patients with ST elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). </p>  <p>  The rationale for two 24/7 centres for the delivery of PPCI in the greater Dublin area reflects the international trend towards the consolidation of such specialised services on smaller numbers of sites to allow for the concentration of volume and a larger critical mass of trained operators, working within a 24/7 team that is less dependent on individual personnel and is, therefore, more robust.  This is about starting treatment the moment the paramedic arrives and getting patients to the right hospital in an emergency - rather than just the nearest one only to be transferred later after a delay.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that, in relation to the treatment of STEMI patients from Wicklow and South Dublin, the requirement for travel time from First Medical Contact to PPCI centre to be within 90 minutes was considered as part of the review, and the report notes that 90 minute travel time for St Vincent's Hospital and St James&rsquo;s Hospital are similar.</p>  <p>  The report also recommended that there should be a clear definition of the role of the three other cardiology intervention centres in Dublin (Beaumont Hospital, Tallaght Hospital and St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital (SVUH)) in the management of Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI).  NSTEMI forms an increasing proportion of interventional work which will continue and develop in those cardiology intervention centres which will not be designated 24/7 PPCI centres including St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that, in advance of the implementation of the change to the delivery of the PPCI service in the Dublin area, extensive consultations took place with stakeholders including the Chairs and CEOs of the two Hospital Groups concerned (Ireland East Hospital Group and Dublin Midlands Hospital Group); the CEOs of the relevant hospitals and the National Ambulance Service and I am pleased to note that all are fully supportive of the new arrangements, which were implemented on April 17.</p></reply>

The ETC, which also includes representation from the private sector, also oversees the implementation of the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy. A Review of the Strategy was published by my Department in February last year.  </p>  <p>  The members of the ETC include: the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Chair); the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport; the Minister for Agriculture, Food, the Marine and Defence; and Minister of State for Development, Trade Promotion and North-South Co-operation. The Minister for Education and Skills has now also joined the ETC, in recognition of the growing contribution the international education sector makes to foreign earnings. Other relevant Departments are represented at senior official level, while the chief executives of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia, Science Foundation Ireland and Tourism Ireland are also members.</p>  <p>  The private sector also plays an important role on the ETC and is represented by IBEC and the Irish Exporters Association.

The current private sector membership includes representatives from the food, tourism, construction and IT sectors, amongst others.</p>  <p>  The ETC has met in plenary twice annually since it was established in late 2011 and I will be chairing the 9th meeting in the autumn of 2015. ETC-related work, both at home and abroad, continues between these high-level plenary sessions. </p>  <p>  I invite members to participate in the ETC in consultation with the relevant Departments and State agencies.

This was formally adopted at the first meeting of the Foreign Trade Council, now the Export Trade Council (ETC), on 27 October 2010. Local Market Teams were established in each priority market, headed by the Ambassador and also comprising representatives of the Embassy and relevant State agencies. Each Local Market Team is responsible for drawing up annual Local Market Plans, ensuring that there is a coordinated approach in these priority markets. The implementation of the plans is reviewed by the ETC, which has responsibility for overseeing the overall implementation of the Strategy and issuing guidance to Local Market Teams as necessary.In a review of the Strategy, led by my Department and published in February 2014, a new market approach was introduced in order to reflect the opportunities available in dynamic, rapidly developing economies not currently listed as priorities in the Strategy. The outcome of the new market approach was the creation of a new category of &lsquo;Exploratory and High Potential Markets&rsquo;.  </p><p>While the Local Market Team structure is not at this time operating in the seven markets designated as Exploratory and High Potential Markets*, reports have been submitted to the ETC identifying trade, tourism, investment, and education opportunities. This approach reflects the different stage of development in the markets involved, as well as the scale of State agency representation on the ground. Depending on developments in relation to State agency representation in these markets, it may be appropriate to establish additional Local Markets Teams in the future.</p><p>In all instances, the Embassy network, in both priority and other markets, working in close cooperation with the State agencies, continues to play a crucial role in supporting Irish businesses seeking to grow overseas, including through the organisation and conduct of Ministerial-led Trade Missions. </p><p>* Turkey, Indonesia, Nigeria, Chile, Mexico, Vietnam and Thailand</p></reply>

The fourth Global Irish Economic Forum will take place from 19 &ndash; 21 November, 2015.  The first Forum in 2009 was convened by the previous Government in response to the economic crisis that the country was facing.  This Forum developed a new and more strategic level of engagement with the most influential members of the Irish diaspora.  One of the most significant recommendations to come from this was the establishment in 2010 of the Global Irish Network.  The Global Irish Network is a group of approximately 350 of the most influential Irish or Irish-connected individuals based in almost 40 countries worldwide.  This Network is an invaluable resource to the Government and works closely with our embassies, consulates and state agencies around the world.The Global Irish Network has been convened twice since it was established at the Global Irish Economic Forum in 2011 and 2013.  In addition a number of regional meetings of the Network have also taken place.</p><p>The Forum themes and outcomes have been closely aligned with the Action Plan for Jobs process.  The Forums held in 2009 and 2011 were focused primarily on recovery, reputation building and job creation and a number of the initiatives that came out of these are still helping to create jobs in Ireland today including:</p><p>- Over 120 members of the Global Irish Network take part in the Global Irish Contacts Programme managed by Enterprise Ireland.  This Programme directly links the diaspora with Irish companies looking to achieve international growth.</p><p>- Greater involvement of local Network members in the planning and organisation of trade missions in their respective regions.  Network members were involved in the <i>Invest in Ireland </i>roundtable hosted by President Clinton in New York in 2012, and they are involved in the planning of high level visits abroad and Enterprise Ireland organised trade missions.</p><p>- The launch of ConnectIreland, which aims to create 5,000 jobs in five years, the first 1,000 of which have already been created.</p><p>In addition a number of other initiatives were established to recognise and celebrate the contributions of the Irish diaspora:</p><p>- The establishment of the Presidential Distinguished Service Award for the Irish Abroad.</p><p>- The establishment of the Certificate of Irish Heritage.</p><p>- The launch of the Gathering held in 2013 which saw over 5,000 gatherings held across Ireland, bringing 250 &ndash; 275,000 additional overseas visitors worth approximately &euro;170m in revenue to the economy.</p><p>The 2013 Forum took place in a different context to its two predecessors, looking to the future in the context of a country that has come through crisis with a restored reputation.  Among the recommendations from the 2013 Forum that are complete or have been significantly advanced are:</p><p>- Irish Design 2015, which is showcasing the best of Irish design both at home and internationally throughout 2015;</p><p>- Considering whether Ireland can have a competitive advantage in the area of Smart Ageing;</p><p>- The launch of an agency to market Irish agri-business expertise globally;</p><p>- Inviting Global Irish Network members to bring conferences to Ireland; and</p><p>- The placement of Origin Green ambassadors in international businesses.</p><p>While most of the initiatives recommended at previous Forum have been advanced by Government, some of the ideas generated have been led by members of the Global Irish Network.  Once such initiative which came from the first Forum in 2009 is Uversity - a Recognised College of the National University of Ireland.  Uversity offers a Master of Arts in Creative Process and has been founded by twenty four higher education institutions across the island of Ireland.  </p><p>The above is a flavour of the achievements of previous Forums and full details and reports of these can be found at </p></reply>

O<i>ne of the commitments we made at Stormont House last December was to agree a report on new priorities for North-South co-operation.  At the North South Ministerial Council Institutional Meeting that took place in Belfast on 25 February, I, along with Minister of State Sherlock, agreed that report with First Minister Robinson and deputy First Minister McGuinness.  The report reflected discussions which have </i>focused on areas of mutual benefit including economic recovery, job creation and improving service delivery and will be discussed further at the next North South Plenary meeting taking place in Dublin in June. While more work needs to be done, the additional areas of co-operation that I would wish to see prioritised on a North South basis would be those<i>that deliver tangible benefits to the people of this island </i>such as higher level education, agri-food, energy, climate change, creative industries, sport and other joint initiatives ensuring the most effective use of scarce public funds on both sides of the border. </p><p>Other possible areas include the benefits that could result from cooperation between F&aacute;ilte Ireland and their colleagues in Northern Ireland in areas of cultural and heritage tourism.  Enhanced cooperation on Research and Development and Innovation is another area that is ripe for further collaboration for our mutual benefit. </p><p>On a final point, I would note that another commitment that was made as part of the Stormont House Agreement was to hold a meeting of Ministers in the North West.  I look forward to this meeting taking place as soon as is practically possible and I believe it will provide an additional opportunity to drive forward additional North South cooperation.</p></reply>

The terms of the sick leave scheme are contained in Department Circular 0059/2014 Sick Leave Scheme for Registered Teachers in Recognised Primary and Post-Primary Schools.  </p><p>  Department Circular 40/97,  Assaults on Teachers/School Employees, outlines the policy to be adopted in primary schools where incidents of assault arise. This includes compliance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act as regards identifying hazards, assessing risks and putting in place appropriate safeguards and preventative measures. The Circular also provides for an application for assault leave to be made to my Department. Where Assault Leave is granted, such leave is paid in full and does not form part of the teacher's sick leave record. As responsibility for dealing with cases of assaults against teachers rests with the Board of Management, such cases may not come to the attention of my Department, except where an application is received for assault leave. Figures relating to the number of primary teachers who have availed of assault leave each year for the past four years are being collated and will be forwarded to the Deputy separately.</p></reply>

Data in relation to the 2014/15 school year will be published later in the current school year.My focus in Budget 2015 was on obtaining the additional funding that was necessary to provide for demographic growth. The last Budget included an increase in spending on education for the first time in recent years, amounting to additional funding of &euro;60m during 2015.</p><p>  This funding will be used to provide 1,700 additional teachers and SNAs for our schools, as well as to fund prioritised reforms, such as implementation of the literacy and numeracy strategy, reform of junior cycle, and the introduction of education focussed preschool inspections. The improvements in the Primary Staffing Schedule for small schools which I announced in February last are the only changes that I will be making to the staffing arrangements for schools for the 2015/16 school year.</p><p>  The staffing arrangements for schools currently include the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds. Such posts are provisionally approved pending confirmation of actual enrolment on the following 30 September.</p><p>  The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing economic growth. It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about further improvement in PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers.</p><p>  The challenge for all schools is to ensure that they utilise their allocated resources to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.</p></reply>

Over &euro;1.5 billion of this is being allocated for the funding of major school building projects across the country, including Co. Kildare.  The balance is being used for programmes such as the additional accommodation scheme, the prefab replacement initiative, the Emergency Works Scheme and the acquisition of sites. </p><p>  The primary focus of the Plan is on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers. In addition, my Department considers applications on an ongoing basis from individual schools for funding to meet an immediate accommodation requirement because of increased enrolments and where an additional teacher is being appointed.</p><p>  My Department continues to review the most up to date demographic information to ensure that any emerging school accommodation shortfall, at both primary and post primary level, is identified and met in a timely manner. </p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that I recently announced a &euro;36 million investment programme for the upgrade of 559 schools throughout the country, including schools in Kildare, under the current Summer Works Scheme (SWS). The 559 projects recently approved, will bring the total number of school projects being funded under the SWS to over 1,300, involving a total expenditure of almost &euro;108 million.  A list of these schools is available on my Department's website.

Applications for a new round of funding, which commenced on 1 July 2014, were subject to an appraisal process. 55 applications were approved for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. A number of previously funded organisations were not approved for funding on this occasion.  Pobal were asked to undertake the management of the scheme and, in that context, put in place a dedicated team to deal with any inquiries from applicants and to provide detailed feedback. Furthermore, an appeals process was put in place, on foot of which Pobal submitted a report, which is currently being considered.</p><p>On 18 July 2014, it was announced that bridging funding of &euro;1.4million would be allocated for a twelve month period to a number of previously funded health, disability and other organisations that were not approved for funding under the new scheme, pending the carrying out of a review of the public funding of national organisations in the health and disability sector. This bridging funding in 2014/2015 will enable organisations to plan for their future, whether with or without State support, such as that provided under the SSNO. Details of the bridging funding provided are set out in the table below. </p><p>The review process is well underway and is being advanced in consultation with the Department of Health. The review is designed to rationalise the funding of these organisations to ensure efficiency in the use of public money and avoidance of duplication, while providing appropriate support to organisations working in the sector. The Health Service Executive and Pobal are also participating in the review. All organisations in receipt of bridging funding have been contacted to make submissions as part of the review process. A number of meetings have also taken place with representative organisations, including the Disability Federation of Ireland. I intend to complete and publish the outcome of the review in the coming weeks.</p><p><font color="#333333">Bridging Funding Provided 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015</font><table><tr><th>Body</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Arthritis Ireland </td><td>53,882 </td></tr><tr><td>Asperger Syndrome Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Asthma Society of Ireland </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Breaking Through Limited </td><td>58,028 </td></tr><tr><td>Chronic Pain Ireland Limited </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>Dyslexia Association of Ireland </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>Genetic and Inherited Disorders Organisation Ltd </td><td>16,580 </td></tr><tr><td>GROW in Ireland </td><td>16,580 </td></tr><tr><td>Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland Limited </td><td>19,066 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Deaf Society The National Association of the Deaf Limited </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Heart Foundation </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Mountain Rescue Association </td><td>58,028 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish National Council of Attention Deficit Disorder Support (INCADDS) </td><td>33,158 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Stammering Association </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>Migraine Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>Motor Neuron disease Association </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>MOVE Ireland </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Muintir na T&iacute;re </td><td>70,462 </td></tr><tr><td>Muscular Dystrophy Ireland </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Ireland Limited </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Youth Drama Ltd </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>New Communities Partnership (NCP) Ltd </td><td>74,606 </td></tr><tr><td>Peter Bradley Foundation Limited </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Post Polio Support Group Limited </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>Safe Ireland </td><td>74,606 </td></tr><tr><td>Show Racism The Red Card Limited </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>Suas Educational Development </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>The Carers Association Limited </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland </td><td>49,738 </td></tr><tr><td>The Neurological Alliance of Ireland </td><td>49,738 </td></tr><tr><td>The Union of Voluntary Organisations of People with Disabilities </td><td>45,592 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

However, with the substantial fall off in private construction, very little social housing is currently being provided under Part V.  Informed by a recent review of the Part V provisions, which included a public consultation process, my Department has incorporated the required legislative changes into the General Scheme of the Planning and Development (No 1) Bill which was published in November 2014 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: .</p><p>The General Scheme of the Bill was the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht. The Bill is currently being drafted in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to publication in the coming weeks and enactment before the summer recess.</p><p>The General Scheme provides that, in future, the focus of Part V will be on the delivery of social housing, with a requirement for up to 10% social housing in developments in excess of 9 units.  In the operation of these revised Part V arrangements, the priority will be to secure social housing units on-site; the making of cash payments in lieu of social housing is to be discontinued.</p><p>The changes to the Part V provisions that are proposed are an important component of the range of delivery mechanisms that will help to achieve the targets set out in the Government&rsquo;s Social Housing Strategy 2020 &ndash; Support, Supply and Reform. It is estimated that in the region of 4,000 additional social housing units will be delivered by 2020 under the revised Part V provisions, using a range of delivery options including leasing mechanisms. My Department has written to local authorities highlighting the importance of ensuring that Part V agreements are discharged in ways that maximise the potential for the immediate delivery of social housing units. I am committed to the principle of a social housing gain from private development and I believe that the Part V mechanism has the potential to be a significant contributor to social housing in the context of a recovering housing market.</p><p>It is not possible to estimate either the precise number of units that may become available under Part V or their cost.  In targeting the supply of 35,000 additional social housing units under the Social Housing Strategy 2020 over the next 6 years, including units under Part V, the Government has estimated the total cost to the Exchequer at &euro;3.8 billion. The substantial additional funding provided through Budget 2015 will provide the required kick start to the delivery of the targets in the Strategy and I am confident that my recent announcement of over &euro;1.5 billion for the delivery of the targets out to 2017 will meet the full delivery cost of these units. The scale of ambition represented in these targets and the accompanying funding allocations illustrate that housing is of the highest priority for this Government.</p><p>My Department monitors build and acquisition costs of housing on an ongoing basis and data on house prices is amongst the range of housing statistics which are available on my Department &rsquo;s website at the following link: </p></reply>

The occupier will also be able to check this as it will usually manifest itself as a high meter read or a continuous flow of water through the meter.  If the leak is on the public side of the infrastructure it is the responsibility of Irish Water to locate and fix the leak. If the leak is on the private side of the supply pipe it is the responsibility of the owner to locate and fix the leak, as set out in the Water Services Act 2007.</p><p>However, the Government has agreed to provide additional funding to Irish Water for their capital investment to include a free first fix scheme which will cover leaks between the boundary of the property and the dwelling (but will not include leaks internal to the dwelling). Irish Water has submitted a draft first fix scheme to the CER. On 15 April the CER launched a public consultation in relation to the draft scheme.

This will require an overhaul of existing structures, but I believe that this can be achieved without distorting the tyres market in Ireland, without encouraging customers to buy tyres outside of the jurisdiction and without widespread job losses. Moreover, I believe that such a scheme could be provided for without introducing any new costs, but rather by effectively formalising the existing charge that is already applied to almost all tyre purchases.</p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to work with industry to agree on the finer details of how the Producer Responsibility Initiative for Tyres will work. In order to bring additional focus to this work and the concerns which industry have raised, the Tyres Working Group, the industry stakeholder group working with my Department, recently decided to establish five sub-groups to examine and develop an approach and solutions on certain key issues. It is the intention of the Tyres Working Group to keep the wider tyre sector informed of both the progress and decisions made on an on-going basis.</p></reply>

A surface resistance value of 0.25 is only used in very specific situations as outlined in section 4.4 of the EN ISO 13788 standard which is of rather limited relevance in this context and, for that reason, it has not been referenced at Appendix D of TGD L 2011 or referred to in the reply to Question No. 788 of 15 April 2015.  I.S.

There is free entry into the market and it is Government policy to encourage price competition and consumer choice. I have no function in the setting of petrol and diesel prices. The Consumer and Competition Commission (under the aegis of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation) has a role in ensuring that the market is functioning correctly and that consumers are not being disadvantaged. Previous investigations and surveys into oil prices, have been undertaken by the National Consumer Agency (now the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission), and these are available at . The research indicates that the price paid by consumers is largely determined by taxation levels, the internationally traded price of crude oil and the consequent price at which refined product is traded in Europe, along with the level of competition in the retail market. As oil is traded in US dollars the recent weakness of the euro has also impacted on oil prices in the euro area.</p><p>The European Commission maintains a Statistics and Market Observatory, which presents consumer prices and net prices (excluding duties and taxes) of petroleum products in EU Member States (known as the Oil Bulletin) on a weekly basis. The Oil Bulletin is designed to improve the transparency of oil prices and to strengthen the internal market. The relevant link is:</p><p>. The latest bulletin from 19 April 2015 shows that petrol prices (including taxes) in Ireland were &euro;1.39 per litre while diesel prices (including taxes) were &euro;1.29 per litre. The average petrol price in the EU in the same period is &euro;1.43 while the average diesel price is &euro;1.27. It is worth noting that Ireland is around mid point on the table. At the same time last year petrol prices in Ireland were &euro;1.53 and diesel prices were &euro;1.47 so Irish consumers are getting the benefit of falling prices at the pumps.</p></reply>

The design for the System was approved by Government in April, 2014 and the &lsquo;Eircode&rsquo; brand was also launched at that stage. The project is currently in the implementation phase and due to go live this summer. The Eircode website, , was launched in April 2014. This website has information on Eircodes for both residents and businesses. The Eircode team has briefed businesses through a series of seminars and are continuing to work with them to prepare for Eircodes. In order to support dissemination of Eircodes, the databases of key public sector bodies are being encoded with eircodes. </p><p>A national information campaign will commence shortly to inform the public about Eircodes and promote their usage. The campaign will include a community outreach programme to provide information and assistance to the vulnerable and hard to reach groups within the community.</p><p>The dissemination phase will commence in the next few months with the delivery by post of a unique postcode to every address in Ireland. </p><p>The introduction of Eircodes will help to solve two significant problems associated with addressing in Ireland. The first is that the address for any given premises can have a number of different forms. The second and more significant problem is that over 35% of the addresses in Ireland are non-unique. This is where a property has the same address as at least one other property in the area. Applying a unique eircode to every address will be of particular benefit to the residents of rural Ireland as the majority of non-unique addresses are found in rural communities. It will make addresses easier to locate and make it easier and more efficient for rural dwellers to receive deliveries and obtain other services including access to the emergency services whenever required.</p></reply>

The schemes operate by guaranteeing a minimum price for renewable energy generation over a 15 year period. The technologies supported include onshore wind energy, hydroelectricity, landfill gas, waste-to-energy and biomass technologies, including anaerobic digestion. Solar PV is not one of the qualifying technologies for this scheme. Further information is available on my Department's website, .I am aware of recent reports in the media concerning the development of solar farms. The development of a solar farm requires planning permission from the local planning authority and is therefore a matter between the developer and the relevant planning authority. </p><p>The Green Paper on Energy Policy, <i>inter alia</i>, sought feedback on the role that alternative technologies, such as solar, could play in delivering our renewable energy ambitions.

These are national targets and are not disaggregated on a county basis.</p><p>The total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid at the start of March this year was 2,600 MW approximately; a further 3,700 MW has been contracted for connection to the grid. Detailed information in relation to the amount of renewable electricity generation capacity connected to the electricity grid, including capacity that is contracted for connection, is available on EirGrid&rsquo;s and ESB Networks&rsquo; websites at and respectively.</p><p>Policies and schemes are in place to incentivise the use of renewable energy. The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies, including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind. To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity. It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 MW and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target.</p></reply>
