This is what is termed the &ldquo;triple-lock&rdquo;.    The United Nations Security Council has the primary role in relation to the maintenance of international peace and security, and in authorising peacekeeping operations to this end.  However, neither the UN nor the UN Security Council have any role in mandating what or how States develop or procure military capability and equipment. As such, the &ldquo;Triple- Lock&rdquo; does not and cannot apply to Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PESCO projects.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs was consulted and fully engaged in all aspects of the PESCO decision. The Attorney General confirmed that there was no legal or constitutional impediment to Ireland participating in PESCO once Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approval were obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009. </p>  <p>  Pursuant to Section 3 (1) of the 2009 Act, both the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approved Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PESCO. There is no specific requirement to seek further approval for any joint capability development or procurement initiatives which Ireland may pursue under PESCO. That said, I will of course update the House on continuing developments on CSDP in the normal course which will include our participation in PESCO projects.</p>  <p>  Expenditure allocations for all Departments, both current (2018-2020) and capital (2018-2021), were published as part of the Budget documentation.  It is expected that any investment or expenditure on defence, including that arising from Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PESCO, will be met from within these allocations.  As such, PESCO will not result in a requirement for additional expenditure beyond the approved allocations nor is it expected to impact on any other areas of public expenditure.  </p>  <p>  I have already arranged for the key PESCO documents and Ireland's notification to be lodged in the D&aacute;il Library.  In relation to Ireland's National Implementation Plans (NIP), this is currently in draft form and finalisation depends on further Council Decisions on PESCO Projects and governance expected in the coming months.  Once finalised, probably in mid-2018, consideration can then be given to its publication.   </p></reply>

As of the 31st of December 2017, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force stood at 9,173 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) personnel.</p>  <p>  In 2018, similar recruitment will take place and plans for this are currently being finalised. At this point it is not possible to predict precise numbers that will be recruited but it is anticipated that this will be in the region of 800 personnel.  </p>  <p>  Certain specialist posts such as Pilots and Air Traffic Controllers and certain Technicians are presenting challenges for recruitment and retention. I have previously acknowledged this fact, which is reflective of the current economic circumstances and attractive job opportunities in the private and commercial semi-state sectors.  The extensive professional training that such specialists receive within the Defence Forces makes such personnel very attractive within these sectors.  This is not a unique challenge for the Defence forces and is also faced by military forces elsewhere.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission is further examining the issue of the recruitment and retention of specialist personnel within the Defence Forces, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 &ndash; 2020.

I was delighted that both PDFORRA and RACO have also signed up to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 which is an extension of the Lansdowne Road agreement. This provides for further pay increase of between 6.2% and 7.4% over its lifetime. </p>  <p>  I remain committed to maximising recruitment of capable personnel, developing serving personnel, and so achieving the best personnel and skills combination to ensure the Defence Forces retain the capacity to operate effectively across all roles. </p></reply>

Cooperation across both organisations also ensures maximum synergy where both are deployed in the same theatre, for example in the Balkans, the Mediterranean, the Horn of Africa and Afghanistan.  In the face of new and emerging security challenges, in particular cyber, transnational crime, international terrorism, cooperation is essential in developing an effective and comprehensive response to these more complex security challenges.</p>  <p>  In 2017, work continued on a Common Set of Proposals for the implementation of the Joint Declaration on EU-NATO Cooperation.  This declaration was made on 8th July 2016 by the Presidents of the European Council and European Commission, together with the NATO Secretary General. The declaration highlights areas where the EU and NATO can further strengthen cooperation. These focus on cooperation in the key areas of Countering Hybrid Threats, Operational Cooperation including maritime issues, Cyber security and defence, Defence capabilities, Defence Industry and Research, Exercises and capacity building. </p>  <p>  On 14 June 2017, the EU and NATO issued a joint progress report on the progress of implementation on the Common Set of Proposals. A further set of new additional proposals building on the key areas set out above were agreed on 05 December 2017, including new topics, such as counter-terrorism, military mobility and women, peace and security. In conclusions from 14 December 2017 the European Council requested that work proceed on implementing the full set of proposals on EU-NATO cooperation, including the additional ones agreed in December 2017.</p>  <p>  Ireland welcomes greater EU-NATO co-operation where it contributes to international peace and security and is focused on avoiding duplication of structures, systems and interoperability standards.  This ensures better coherence and effectiveness on the ground in peace support and crisis management operations.</p>  <p>  NATO and the EU currently have twenty two member countries in common but yet it is important to note that the 2016 declaration confirms that EU-NATO cooperation will fully respect the decision making autonomy of both organisations, and will not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of any Member States. This is a strong acknowledgement that Ireland&rsquo;s policy of neutrality and non-NATO membership will in no way be affected by enhanced cooperation.  </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-24a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018012400068#WRA02200"><p>I take it the Deputy is referring to the absence of the concept of &ldquo;supplementary pensions&rdquo; from the provisions of the single public service pension scheme. </p>  <p>  As I indicated in my response to recent Questions, the occupational pension scheme terms of post-1 January 2013 new entrants to the public service, including the Permanent Defence Force, are governed by the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012.  All first-time new entrants to pensionable public service employment on or after that date are members of the Single Scheme.  Under the 2012 Act, overall statutory responsibility for the Single Scheme pension terms and rules rests with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p>  <p>  The Single Scheme is a key structural fiscal reform introduced to help significantly reduce the cost of public service pensions in the long term through far-reaching transformation of the public service pension system. Given that financial imperative, the terms and rules of the Single Scheme, which are fundamentally different to previous superannuation public service arrangements, make no provision for the concept or award of supplementary pensions for any new entrants joining any public service group from that date onwards.  </p>  <p>  Some years before the introduction of the new Single Scheme, the Department of Defence and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had put sectoral pension agreements in place with PDFORRA and RACO in respect of PDF personnel serving at the time.  These pre-2013 sectoral agreements include specific provision for supplementary pensions for officers who joined the PDF from 6 April 1995, as well as enlisted personnel who joined from 1 April 2004. The Single Scheme does not impact on those pre-2013 sectoral agreements.

In the Defence Forces these are decisions for highly qualified Medical Officers, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a Working Group was re-convened to review developments arising in relation to malaria chemoprophylaxis and the use of Lariam, particularly in the context of the current and potential litigation. The Working Group has produced its Second Report which has been provided to me. As previously advised, the Working Group was convened in the context of current and potential litigation and is therefore legally privileged. It has made a total of twelve recommendations, which are intended to ensure that the Defence Forces medical policies and practices continually develop in light of best practice. I have accepted these recommendations in principle whilst recognising that certain of these recommendations will need to be further developed to allow for their implementation.</p>  <p>  Whilst acknowledging that the Report is legally privileged in the context of litigation, I can confirm that many of its recommendations focus on areas including planning, training and education/information sharing as well as the establishment of a Medical Advisory Group. As I already indicated, proposals will be developed further in relation to the establishment of this new Medical Advisory Group. This will formalise the provision of on-going expert advice, including external expert medical advice, to the Defence Forces in relation to a range of medical matters including malaria chemoprophylaxis. </p>  <p>  There are three anti-malarial drugs , namely Lariam (mefloquine), Malarone and Doxycycline which continue to be used by the Defence Forces. The selection by a Medical Officer of the most appropriate drug for use is a complex one and dependant on a number of factors. All of these anti-malaria drugs have contraindications and side effects. Significant precautions are taken by the Defence Forces Medical Officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of the Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications. It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the State Claims Agency manages Personal Injury claims on behalf of the Department of Defence. The Lariam case referred to by the Deputy was settled on 30th November 2017 without admission of liability. The Plaintiff withdrew any part of his claim in relation to the choice by the Defendants of Lariam as a chemoprophylactic. All other matters are settled and the case was struck out. You will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any individual cases, either ongoing or finalised.  There are no plans to introduce a compensation scheme in relation to this matter.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that the health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces is a key priority for me and the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

This is underlined by a commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the level of female participation in the Defence Forces. </p><p>One impediment in achieving greater numbers of women serving in the Defence Forces is the lack of women recruitment applicants relative to men which may be as a result of societal perception and attitudes to female soldiers and officers. </p><p>A number of specific initiatives have been implemented to increase the level of female participation such as the targeting of female websites as part of recruitment campaigns and visits to female schools by Defence Forces personnel to promote a career in the Defence Forces to women. Other initiatives include:</p><p>- The introduction of best practices in recruitment, such as the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants,</p><p>- Special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment,</p><p>- A balanced composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards,</p><p>- All promotions and career courses are open to both sexes on merit,</p><p>- A Gender Advisor has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces.</p><p>The White Paper on Defence recognised a requirement to develop a Diversity and Inclusion Strategy and this, along with the associated Action Plan, has been achieved. </p><p>Notwithstanding the recent proactive initiatives, over the lifetime of the White Paper further projects will be progressed to ensure that the development and promotion of strategies that support increased female participation in the Defence Forces is continued.  Such projects include:</p><p>- Developing further initiatives to encourage more women to apply for the Defence Forces and to increase female participation at all ranks.</p><p>- Conducting a survey to identify any impediments to the advancement of women in the PDF. </p><p>With the support of the Chief of Staff, I remain committed to maximising recruitment of both men and women to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government, both at home and abroad.</p></reply>

The work on elaborating the details of these project proposals and potential participants is currently ongoing at EU level and Ireland is playing a full part in those deliberations.

The contingent operates in the role of a Quick Reaction Force.

The full return to the area of separation during 2018 is being considered in the light of the security assessments and other required assurances. </p><p>Pending the full return of UNDOF to the area of separation, UNDOF has continued to maintain credible presence in the Golan in line with its mandate.  Both Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic have stated their continued commitment to the Disengagement of Forces Agreement and both support the continued presence of UNDOF in the area of separation.  The UNDOF mission remains an important element in ensuring the continuing ceasefire between Israel and Syria and in the wider Middle East Region.</p><p>As with all missions, developments in the UNDOF area of operation are kept under ongoing review. However, given the views of the parties and the UN in relation to the importance of this observer mission is supporting stability and the continuing ceasefire between the parties and the disengagement agreement, the continued presence of UNDOF, and Ireland's support to it, remains an important element in the response of the international community through the UN. We will continue to support the mission in this regard. </p></reply>

A total of 73 Focus Groups were conducted throughout the Defence Forces. There were 603 participants in total. The focus group report further explored the issues raised in the original survey. The comments quoted therein cover a wide range of issues relating to human resources management. These include pay and conditions (particularly pay for the lowest paid members of the Defence Forces), vacancies, recruitment and retention, promotion systems, performance management, leadership, culture, morale, stress and work-life balance. I was briefed on the Report at the end of June and I met with the Representative Associations on the 13th July 2017, ahead of its official publication a week later. It is important to note that the focus groups were conducted in advance of the pay increases that were implemented in 2017. These increases particularly targeted the lowest paid across the public service. The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 also provides a mechanism for further pay increases and this Agreement has been accepted by both PDFORRA and RACO. This is a further step along the path of restoration of pay scales.</p>  <p>  While work to progress many of the other issues raised was already underway as part of the implementation of the White Paper on Defence, I have directed that certain White Paper projects be brought forward and that work commence on these. </p>  <p>  In addition, there is on-going recruitment to the Defence Forces and a range of initiatives are being developed including commissioning from the ranks, criteria for the re-entry of former Permanent Defence Force personnel with specific skills and consideration of increased use of direct entry for specialist posts. The Public Service Pay Commission will also examine recruitment and retention issues in its next tranche of work.</p>  <p>  There are extensive support systems in place for members of the Defence Forces who may be experiencing stress. Members of the Defence Forces can avail of Personnel Support Services (PSS) which provides information, assistance and counselling on a range of matters including interpersonal problems. These supports will be kept under review.</p></reply>

Like other areas within the Public Service, the pay of the Permanent Defence Force was reduced during the financial crisis. The reductions in pay and the introduction of a Pension Related Deduction was on a graduated basis with increased rates of deductions for those on higher earnings. </p>  <p>  The Government appreciate the contribution made by all public servants, including members of the Permanent Defence Force, during the economic crisis and have taken measures to improve public sector pay. The focus of the increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. </p>  <p>  PDFORRA signed up to the Lansdowne Road Agreement in March 2017. The finalisation of negotiations under the agreement allowed for the commencement of the process for the implementation of pay increases and arrears, which have now been applied to the Permanent Defence Force. An increase of 2.5% from 1 January 2016, for annualised salaries up to &euro;24,000 and 1% for annualised salaries between &euro;24,001 and &euro;31,000 was included in the weekly payroll of 5 July 2017. An increase of &euro;1,000 from 1 April 2017, on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000 per annum was paid on 19 July 2017. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, as a result of successful negotiations with PDFORRA, the pay of general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, was increased further These improved payscales, were backdated to 1 July 2016 and the payments were made with backmoney due in August 2017. The starting pay for a newly qualified three star private, and their Naval Service equivalent, saw an increase from &euro;21,800 to &euro;27,000 (inclusive of military service allowance) gross annual earnings, with scope for further income from duties.</p>  <p>  Going forward, there are further increases arising from the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.

The balance of the additional funding is to go towards the Pension Vote, taking account of the increasing number of Defence Forces pensioners and adjustments to pensions for current pensioners due under the agreement.</p></reply>

At this point I anticipate that approximately 800 personnel will be inducted in 2018.</p>  <p>  Family Income Supplement provides a means to supplement a family&rsquo;s income, be they employed in the public or private sector. Eligibility is assessed having regard to combined family income and the number of dependent children. Pay levels in the Public Service, including the Defence Forces, are determined on an individual basis and are not weighted in accordance with family circumstances.</p>  <p>  There have been significant improvements in pay for members of the Defence Forces under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, which PDFORRA signed up to in March 2017. The finalisation of negotiations under the agreement allowed for the commencement of the process for the implementation of pay increases and arrears, which have now been applied to the Permanent Defence Force. </p>  <p>  Following these revisions of pay, the  first point on the payscale for a Corporal, including Military Service Allowance, is around &euro;37,000. The first point on the payscale for a Sergeant, including Military Service Allowance, is just under &euro;40,000 per annum. A newly qualified non-graduate entry 2nd   Lieutenant can expect a minimum of &euro;35,000 per annum after 15 months of training, while a graduate entry Lieutenant can expect a minimum of &euro;39,860 per annum after 15 months of training.</p>  <p>  In addition, improved payscales for general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were agreed in separate negotiations with PDFORRA. The revised payscales were backdated to 1 July 2016 and paid in August 2017. Gross annual earnings for this cohort is &euro;27,000 (inclusive of military service allowance). This is a significant increase in pay which was approximately &euro;21,800 per annum prior to this agreement. </p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for further increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement. The agreement was accepted by the members of the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations in December 2017. Arrangements are being made to process the first 1% increase in annualised salaries due from 1 January 2018, for all Permanent Defence Force personnel. This builds upon the previous pay increases and further increases will take place over the lifetime of the agreement.</p>  <p>  I have previously outlined particular challenges with vacancies in certain specialist posts such as Pilots, Air Traffic Controllers and certain Technicians. These specialists can prove difficult to retain where, as in the current economic circumstances, there are ongoing private sector and commercial semi-state sector job opportunities. In accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the Public Service Pay Commission will further examine the issue of recruitment and the retention of specialist personnel and I understand that both PDFORRA and RACO have been invited to make submissions. The Department of Defence is also preparing a submission.</p>  <p>  I remain committed to ensuring that the Defence Forces retain the capacity to fulfil all roles assigned, both at home and overseas.</p></reply>

It notes that the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have primary responsibility for protecting the internal security of the State. The Defence Forces provide, on request, supports in aid to the civil power (ATCP) of an ongoing and contingent nature. </p>  <p>  In this context, the security environment is kept under constant review. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can request a broad range of supports from the Defence Forces including Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams and the Army Ranger Wing. On-going coordination and liaison meetings take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, based on on-going threat assessments, the Garda&iacute; and the Defence Forces liaise with regard to possible Defence Forces supports required for a range of contingencies.  In this context, I can confirm that there is very active cooperation between an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Defence Forces including exercises. For example, in December 2017, the Defence Forces, in cooperation with An Garda Siochana, conducted a large scale exercise in the Dublin area based on a terrorism-related scenario.</p>  <p>  Defence Forces contingency plans and operational orders are continuously reviewed,  amended and reissued as required. Military skills, which are integral elements of the Defence Forces training, are regularly exercised and tested in responding to terrorist threats. </p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence set the defence capability agenda for the next decade. In recognising the dynamic nature of the security environment, the Government decided that the Defence Forces would continue to retain a range of flexible conventional military capabilities, in order to meet the roles assigned and as a hedge to future uncertainty. </p>  <p>  There are a broad range of White Paper projects currently being implemented which are intended to identify, and develop and maintain such capabilities. It remains a top priority for me and my Department to implement the White Paper projects and ensure that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible.   </p></reply>

The military authorities have informed me that the HSA has formally noted the considerable progress made to date by the Defence Forces towards implementation of a safety management system for the control of hazardous substances. Subject to completion of the improvement plan, the HSA investigation is closed.

As such, the military authorities have advised that it would be difficult to draw a direct comparison between the Irish Air Corps and that of the Australian Air Force. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the State Claims Agency is currently managing 7 claims taken against the Minister for Defence, for personal injuries alleging exposure to chemical and toxic substance whilst working in the Air Corps in the period 1991 to 2006.

The conduct of two recruitment campaigns in 2017 for general service recruits yielded just over 8,000 applicants.</p>  <p>  In terms of pay, following PDFORRA&rsquo;S acceptance of the terms of the Lansdowne Road Agreement last year, adjustments have been applied to salary scales with the focus on the lower paid. On completion of recruit and three star training newly qualified 3 star Privates and their Naval Service equivalent can expect minimum gross annual earnings of &euro;27,000 (inclusive of military service allowance) an increase of over &euro;5,000 on the previous total of &euro;21,828.   </p>  <p>  The terms of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 have been accepted by PDFORRA and RACO. This Agreement also provides for further pay increases ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement. </p>  <p>  I have announced a number of initiatives ranging from a review of the C&amp;A Scheme, a review of the criteria governing Contracts for enlisted personnel and a comprehensive skills gap analysis across the Defence Forces. These directly address issues raised in the Climate Study. In addition, the Chief of Staff is actively addressing matters relating to military management of work practices in the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that membership of the Defence Forces is an attractive career prospect for men and women who wish to serve their country in a military context. </p></reply>

It was attended by representatives of the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Kildare County Council, Curragh Racecourse Ltd, the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association and Horse Racing Ireland. The issues discussed included legislation, traffic, signage and parking issues, illegal encampments, sheep grazing rights, and the ongoing land management and maintenance of the Curragh Plains.  It was agreed that progress in all of these areas requires Forum members to take ownership and work collaboratively in identifying and working towards implementing solutions. </p>  <p>  A number of key actions were agreed by the members of the Forum to assist in addressing some of these issues. A work-programme was established for 2018 that will build on the progress made in the areas under discussion and will be supplemented by new issues arising. In addition, Kildare Co. Council has agreed that in conjunction with Kildare F&aacute;&iacute;lte, it will produce a Vision document for the Curragh that will be presented to the Forum for discussion.</p>  <p>  On the work-programme, work has been undertaken in identifying suitable locations for the construction of car parking spaces on the Curragh, thus reducing damage to grasslands. The design and associated costings will be progressed in 2018.  A new lands management team will be put in place in 2018 to oversee all activities on the ground including, but not limited to, litter, sheep branding, patrolling, monitoring users of lands, inspection of property boundaries, engagement with the public, and a proposed new role of engaging in education and outreach. A new environmental maintenance contract will also be sent to tender shortly. </p>  <p>  A review of the legislation governing the Curragh has highlighted that changes to it will be complex and protracted.  It was agreed to advance this in parallel with the use of other legislation that can more immediately address relevant issues.</p>  <p>  It was also agreed that more regular meetings of the Forum should take place in order to progress these matters. </p></reply>

In September 2016, I appointed an independent third party to review allegations made in a number of protected disclosures relating to health and safety issues in the Air Corps which were received in late 2015 and early 2016.</p>  <p>  The report of the independent third party was received by the Department in June 2017.  Although the report found that the regime in the Defence Forces appears to be capable of meeting statutory requirements, the report makes a number of observations; including in relation to documentation, health surveillance, and exposure monitoring.  It also notes that the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is the appropriate statutory body to deal with such matters.  I sent the report to those who had made disclosures for their views and I am considering the next steps in the process having received those views and in the context of ongoing litigation.</p>  <p>  Separately and in parallel to the independent review, following an inspection in 2016, the Air Corps has continued to work with the HSA to improve its health and safety regime. The military authorities have informed me that the HSA has formally noted the considerable progress made to-date by the Defence Forces towards implementation of a safety management system for the control of hazardous substances. Subject to completion of the improvement plan, the HSA investigation is closed. However, it must be noted that in the Air Corps health and safety is a matter of ongoing monitoring, supervision and adjustment.</p></reply>

It comprehends the Government&rsquo;s policy on defence of the State from armed aggression, the defence contribution to domestic security, the defence contribution to international peace and security and a broad range of other &ldquo;non-security&rdquo; roles which the Government require the Defence Forces and Civil Defence to undertake. It considers the defence capabilities required so that the Defence Forces can successfully deliver on the roles assigned by Government. Finally, the White Paper also considers implementation and the actions required to ensure that defence planning and provision processes are further developed.</p>  <p>  During scoping of the White Paper implementation programme 88 actions or projects were specifically identified. These actions represent a subset of the totality of the work being carried out as part of the implementation programme for the White Paper.  While it is currently intended to have all 88 projects initiated or completed by the end of the ten year implementation programme, work in certain areas will continue beyond 2025 in order to ensure that changes, improvements and actions envisaged in the White Paper are fully implemented and to assure that positive outcomes endure and are embedded in the day to day business of the Defence Organisation. </p>  <p>  Implementation of the specific actions identified in the White Paper is being carried out on a phased basis over a ten year period out to 2025. Implementation on a phased basis is necessary in order to reflect Programme for Partnership Government and Strategy Statement commitments, the related nature of some projects and resourcing implications.  This process is being kept under review and will be subject to change as issues arise and other business dictates.</p>  <p>  Progress on implementation will be reported on as part of the Annual Report and be comprehended within the development of the planned fixed cycle of defence reviews. </p></reply>

The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve, is underpinned by an analysis of training needed to meet operational output requirements and capability development needs. A long term strategy is adopted with current planning horizons out to 2021. In addition the White Paper on Defence sets out a developmental path for the Reserve and confirms that the primary role of the Reserve is to augment the PDF in crisis situations. </p>  <p>  For the current year, Subhead A.5 provides for a budget of &euro;2.15 million of which &euro;2.068 million is allocated for Paid Training Mandays for members of the Reserve. This allocation will provide seven days annual paid training for all effective members of the Reserve, fourteen days paid training for all additional personnel recruited to the Reserve in 2018 and provide for career and specialist courses for selected members of the Reserve in line with Reserve priorities. This provision is sufficient having regard to the existing strength of the RDF and the voluntary nature of Reserve training.</p>  <p>  The type of training undertaken varies between the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve. </p>  <p>  In the Army Reserve, recruits undergo varied training in areas such as combat first aid, military law and tactical training. A major part of Recruit training is training in the use of the Steyr 5.56mm Assault Rifle. After recruit training is complete, personnel are then trained in the operation of basic radio communications, map reading, Nuclear, Biological &amp;amp; Chemical warfare defence and the Light Machine Gun. Each Corps also carries out specialist training in its particular field. For example, the Infantry and Cavalry Corps train in weapons and tactics and the Corps of Engineers train in engineering tasks, such as demolition, construction and mine warfare.</p>  <p>  In the Naval Service Reserve, the two main courses undertaken as a recruit are Sea Survival and Damage Control &amp;amp; Fire Fighting. Naval Service Reserve personnel also undergo training in the operation of various crafts operated by the Naval Service, such as Motor Training Launches and Rigid Inflatable Boats. As in the Army Reserve, Naval Service Reserve personnel are trained in the use of the Steyr 5.56mm Assault Rifle. Naval Service Reserve personnel also receive full training in VHF Radios, including voice procedure at sea and operation of the VHF systems. Courses are also run for personnel on the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System. </p>  <p>  Members of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve are volunteers who undertake training in their spare time. In order to facilitate the voluntary nature of Reserve Service and to maximise attendance of Reserve personnel, training continues to be organised both in and out of normal working hours, at weekends and during academic and traditional holiday periods. There are no plans to introduce legislation to compel employers to allow members of the Reserve to attend training.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the extensive and professional training provided to the Reserve is a major motivating factor in encouraging people to join it as well as encouraging retention of existing members.</p></reply>

As of the 31st of December 2017, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force was 9,173 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) personnel, broken down as follows:</p>  <p>  - Army: 7,386 personnel</p>  <p>  - Air Corps: 724 personnel</p>  <p>  - Naval Service: 1,063 personnel</p>  <p>  In 2018, similar recruitment will take place and plans for this are currently being finalised between civil and military management.  At this point it is not possible to predict precise numbers that will be recruited but it is anticipated that this will be in the region of 800 personnel.  </p>  <p>  Certain specialist posts such as Pilots and Air Traffic Controllers and certain Technicians are presenting challenges for recruitment and retention.  I have previously acknowledged this fact which is reflective of the current economic circumstances and attractive job opportunities in the private and commercial semi-state sectors.  The extensive professional training that such specialists receive within the Defence Forces makes such personnel very attractive within these sectors.  This is not a unique challenge for the Defence Forces and is also faced by military forces elsewhere.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission is further examining the issue of the recruitment and retention of specialist personnel within the Defence Forces, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 &ndash; 2020.  The Department of Defence is currently preparing a submission on this issue.</p>  <p>  I am addressing the issue of specialist vacancies throughout the Permanent Defence Force with a range of recruitment methods including direct entry competitions for specialist positions.  The scope to further expand direct entry is being considered.  I have also directed civil and military management to develop proposals to facilitate former PDF personnel with appropriate skill-sets to re-enter the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Following acceptance by the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, the pay increases available under the Lansdowne Road agreement were applied to the Defence Forces.  I was delighted that both PDFORRA and RACO have also signed up to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 which is an extension of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  This provides for further pay increase of between 6.2% and 7.4% over its lifetime. </p>  <p>  I remain committed to maximising recruitment of capable personnel, developing serving personnel, and so achieving the best personnel and skills combination to ensure the Defence Forces retain the capacity to operate effectively across all roles.</p></reply>

However, this is not new and the Defence Forces have always had a level of turnover that far exceeds other areas of the public service. </p>  <p>  I remain committed to ensuring ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces and that, where possible, the terms and conditions of service are as favourable as they can be within the current budgetary parameters. </p>  <p>  In order to balance personnel turnover there is significant ongoing recruitment at both enlisted and officer level.  This includes general service recruits, apprentices, cadets and direct entry officers. </p>  <p>  A range of recruitment methods are being employed including direct entry competitions for specialist positions and the scope to further expand direct entry is being considered.  The conduct of two recruitment campaigns in 2017 for general service recruits yielded just over 8,000 applicants.</p>  <p>  In terms of pay, following PDFORRA&rsquo;S acceptance of the terms of the Lansdowne Road Agreement last year, adjustments have been applied to salary scales with the focus on the lower paid.  On completion of recruit and three star training newly qualified 3 star Privates and their Naval Service equivalent can expect minimum gross annual earnings of &euro;27,000 (inclusive of military service allowance) an increase of over &euro;5,000 on the previous total of &euro;21,828.  </p>  <p>  The terms of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 have been accepted by PDFORRA and RACO.  This Agreement also provides for further pay increases ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement. </p>  <p>  I have announced a number of initiatives ranging from a review of the C&amp;A Scheme, a review of the criteria governing Contracts for enlisted personnel and a comprehensive skills gap analysis across the Defence Forces.  These directly address issues raised in the Climate Study.  In addition, the Chief of Staff is actively addressing matters relating to military management of work practices in the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that membership of the Defence Forces is an attractive career prospect for men and women who wish to serve their country in a military context. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-24a.133.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018012400070#WRC03500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 57 and 60 to 62, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  My priority as Minister with Responsibility for Defence is to ensure that the operational capability of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible so as to enable the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service to carry out their roles as assigned by Government. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PESCO will not result in a requirement for additional investment or expenditure on Defence.  It provides a means of enhancing interoperability with project partners and ensuring that our troops are equipped with the latest and best equipment and training.</p>  <p>  The acquisition of new equipment and equipment upgrades for the Defence Forces remains a clear focus for me, and the White Paper on Defence recognises that there are several new and or enhanced platforms to be procured.  Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning priorities planning process. </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 includes an increased provision of &euro;25 million for Defence for 2018, and an additional &euro;98 million for capital expenditure out to 2021.  This allocation will facilitate the investment necessary to ensure that the Defence Forces have the equipment and infrastructure to deliver on all their roles as set out in the White Paper.</p>  <p>  The White Paper provides that the Army will continue to retain all-arms conventional military capabilities, and the principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas. </p>  <p>  There is focus on the essential force protection provided by armoured vehicles, and in this regard a maintenance and upgrade programme has commenced for the current fleet of 80 Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) which will seek to ensure viability of the fleet out to 2030.   24 armoured utility vehicles have recently been procured for force protection, and a small number of armoured logistical vehicles are also being procured. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Air Corps, the White Paper sets out that the Cessna fleet will be replaced with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks.  In December 2017, following an open tender competition  advertised on the eTenders website and on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) in accordance with national and EU procurement regulations, a contract was placed with Pilatus Aircraft Ltd at a cost of some &euro;32m for the provision of three PC-12 fixed wing utility aircraft suitably equipped for ISTAR tasks which will replace the Cessna fleet.</p>  <p>  The White Paper also provides for the replacement of two CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft with consideration of their replacement with larger more capable aircraft to enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks.  The planning process for the replacement of the CASA aircraft has recently commenced in my Department.</p>  <p>  With regard to rescue aircraft, as the Deputy will be aware, since 2004 the Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of Search and Rescue services within the Irish search and rescue region, and while the Air Corps and the Naval Service provide support to the Irish Coast Guard in maritime Search and Rescue operations this is on an &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis in line with a Service Level Agreement which sets out their roles and responsibilities in this regard.  The Air Corps does not operate any dedicated search and rescue aircraft.</p>  <p>  The White Paper underpins the ongoing replacement of the Naval Service fleet.  A significant investment over recent years has been on the procurement of new Off-Shore Patrol Vessels for the Naval Service.  The third ship in the programme, L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats, was commissioned in to service in October 2016.  A contract for an additional sister ship was placed with Babcock International, a British company, in June 2016 bringing investment in the new ships programme to over &euro;250 million since 2010.  The fourth ship, to be named L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw is scheduled for delivery in mid 2018. </p>  <p>  Future Naval Service capabilities are being planned as part of the White Paper project planning process which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements.  The White Paper provides for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel which will be enabled for helicopter operations and will also have a freight carrying capacity.  It is the intention to hold a public tender competition in due course to cover the supply of the MRV subject to the availability of funding within the overall Defence capital funding envelope.  The cost of the MRV will only be known once the tender competition is concluded. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current provisions, together with the courses of action in the White Paper, will continue to ensure that the Defence Forces is suitably equipped, in line with international best practice, to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.</p></reply>

This is underlined by a commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the level of female participation in the Defence Forces.  In each of the two general service recruitment campaigns conducted in 2017, approximately 13% of the Applicants were female.  The figure for cadet Applicants was approximately 15%.</p><p>One impediment in achieving greater numbers of women serving in the Defence Forces is the lack of women recruitment applicants relative to men which may be as a result of societal perception and attitudes to female soldiers and officers. </p><p>A number of specific initiatives have been implemented to increase the level of female participation such as the targeting of female websites as part of recruitment campaigns and visits to female schools by Defence Forces personnel to promote a career in the Defence Forces to women.  Other initiatives include:</p><p>- The introduction of best practices in recruitment, such as the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants,</p><p>- Special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment,</p><p>- A balanced composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards,</p><p>- All promotions and career courses are open to both sexes on merit,</p><p>- A Gender Advisor has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces.</p><p>The White Paper on Defence recognised a requirement to develop a Diversity and Inclusion Strategy and this, along with the associated Action Plan, has been achieved. </p><p>Notwithstanding the recent proactive initiatives, over the lifetime of the White Paper further projects will be progressed to ensure that the development and promotion of strategies that support increased female participation in the Defence Forces is continued.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-24a.151.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018012400070#WRC05500"><p>Based on the additional Guidelines on the Article 50 negotiations adopted by the European Council on 15 December 2017, work during phase 2 of the negotiations will focus on three distinct areas: completing work on the withdrawal issues and on drafting the Withdrawal Agreement; transitional arrangements and; preparatory work for discussions on the future EU-UK relationship.Ireland has clear positions across all three of these areas and I will continue to articulate these at the General Affairs Council (Art. 50) as well as during my bilateral contacts with EU counterparts and with the EU Chief Negotiator, Michel Barnier, in the coming weeks and months.  Through the Permanent Representation in Brussels, Irish officials are engaging on a daily basis with the Commission Taskforce and with the relevant Article 50 preparatory bodies.  Their work is being informed and prepared by the cross-Governmental coordination structures convened by my Department.    As concerns the withdrawal issues, I welcome that the Guidelines agreed in December underline that negotiations in phase two can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken regarding citizens&rsquo; rights, the financial settlement and the Irish-specific issues during the first phase are respected in full and translated faithfully into legal terms as quickly as possible.  A key focus in the coming weeks and months will therefore be on completing work on the withdrawal issues and on drafting the relevant parts of the Withdrawal Agreement.  </p>  <p>  It will also be important to maintain a clear focus on the unique challenges faced by Ireland and I welcome that all aspects of the Irish specific issues will continue to be worked on in a distinct stream of work in phase 2. </p>  <p>  As concerns transitional arrangements, I welcome that these have been identified as an early priority in phase 2 and that the European Commission Taskforce proposed additional negotiating Directives on transitional arrangements on 20 December.  These draft Directives, which propose a &lsquo;status-quo&rsquo; transitional arrangement, are currently being discussed by the EU27 Member States with a view to their agreement at the General Affairs Council (Art. 50) on 29 January which I will attend. Once these additional negotiating directives are agreed by the Council, the Commission will be in a position to begin negotiations with the UK on this issue.</p>  <p>  In the Guidelines of 15 December, the European Council also invited the Commission and the Council to continue preparations for the negotiations on the framework for the EU-UK future relationship with a view to agreeing additional Guidelines at the European Council on 22-23 March 2018.  In this regard, I welcome that the Guidelines reaffirm the EU&rsquo;s desire to establish a close partnership with the UK.  This is in line with Ireland&rsquo;s objective of having the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, including on trade. It is now important for the UK to provide further clarity on what it wants for the future relationship with the EU.  The EU remains open to all options, in line with the principles agreed by the European Council.</p>  <p>  In the coming weeks and months, Ireland will continue to work closely with its EU partners and the European Commission Task Force, and with the UK, to ensure the commitments made in phase one are delivered in full and that Ireland&rsquo;s wider interests are protected and advanced in the EU&rsquo;s approach to the negotiations on transitional arrangements and the future relationship. In the course of these engagements, as has been the case to date, Ireland will continue, in contacts with the Commission, the European Parliament and other member States, and in the structures of the Council of Ministers, to seek to deliver on our objectives and priorities for the Brexit negotiations.  At the same time, I would stress that it is the Commission which is the Union&rsquo;s negotiator, operating within the scope of the guidelines adopted by the European Council and the more detailed negotiating directives adopted by the General Affairs Council.</p></reply>

For example the Legal Division, the Trade Division and the Policy Planning Unit. Further information on some of these positions are provided in the table below.</p><p>Overseas, additional posts have been assigned to our Embassies in London, Berlin, and Paris as well as the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels (PRB).

Ireland consistently raises the issues of racism and intolerance and advocates for inclusive societies at the UN Human Rights Council, as well as in other multilateral fora.  Furthermore, Ireland is unequivocal in its stance on the death penalty. We oppose and condemn its use in all circumstances, and in particular in cases where there are allegations of unfair trials preceding its implementation.  The abolition of the death penalty is one of Ireland&rsquo;s international priorities, and my Department regularly conveys our stance on this issue to all countries where the death penalty is still in use. </p>  <p>  The conflict in Yemen, now in its third year, has led to grave concerns about human rights and Ireland has worked in the UN system to address these.  At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland joined the small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption of a Resolution on Yemen, which established a group of international experts to investigate the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground.  This group will report back to the Human Rights Council, as an important step towards accountability in Yemen.</p>  <p>  Among other pressing issues, this resolution expressed concern at the severe restrictions on freedom of religion or belief in Yemen, including for members of the Baha&rsquo;i faith.  Ireland calls on all parties to immediately release all Baha&rsquo;i detained in Yemen due to their religious belief, to cease the issuance of arrest warrants against them and to cease the harassment to which they are subjected. </p>  <p>  Officials from this Department also remain in contact with representatives of the Baha&rsquo;i community in Ireland, with whom they have discussed the situation in Yemen, and will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>  <p>  My Department necessarily prioritises its efforts to promote improvements in the general human rights situation, as it does not have the capacity to actively pursue at EU and international level all of the individual cases that arise.  Accordingly, my Department will continue to monitor the human rights situation in Yemen, as well as the issues of freedom of religion and the death penalty, and will take every appropriate opportunity to advocate for them. </p>  <p>  As regards cooperation with international agencies on Yemen, Ireland has provided almost &euro;11.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen since 2015, in response to the escalating crisis. Ireland provided &euro;5.3 million in support to Yemen in 2017 alone, the majority of which was channelled through the UN Humanitarian Fund for Yemen, which makes funding available for UN agencies which have the best capacity to deliver services on the ground. Ireland also contributes to global funds that allocate funding to the Yemen crisis, including the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), which makes emergency funding readily available for UN agencies. Ireland contributed &euro;22 million to the CERF in 2017.</p>  <p>  Finally, a real improvement in the human rights situation in Yemen will require an end to conflict.  I would like to assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to support all efforts towards a negotiated settlement to the conflict in that country.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-24a.161.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018012400071#WRD01000"><p>The situation with regard to the Brexit negotiations has evolved significantly since the publication of the Government&rsquo;s comprehensive approach last May and the Government&rsquo;s preparations have adjusted accordingly.  Contingency planning at both a domestic and an EU level is focused on three areas: preparing for a no-deal scenario or so-called &ldquo;disorderly Brexit&rdquo;; preparing for a transition period based on the &ldquo;status quo&rdquo;; and preparing for the future EU-UK relationship. While the outcome of the December European Council and the move on to Phase 2 has lessened the likelihood of a no-deal scenario, contingency planning for a disorderly Brexit remains a key priority for my Department and for the Government as a whole, because it would have the most serious impact and would occur within a tighter timeframe.  This work takes account of the detailed sectoral work carried out by individual Departments and continues to be progressed through cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by my Department. It is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement.It is also important to emphasise the value of this work in providing a baseline, worst-case scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations. </p><p>As concerns transitional arrangements, I welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force. </p><p>The expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at the European Council on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  In this context, the European Council has stressed that it will be important for the UK to provide further clarity on what it wants for the future relationship with the EU.</p><p>These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position &ndash; will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations.  This will provide a basis on which the Government will, following on from the comprehensive document published last May, further develop our approach to the negotiations and our latest assessment of the economic and sectoral challenges posed by Brexit and how to address them. </p><p>This work will, of course, be firmly grounded in the extensive research and preparatory work that has already been undertaken across Government.  As the Deputies are aware, a considerable volume of this research and analysis, including on individual sectors, is available in the public domain.  I would note in particular the detailed response plan published by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation last November - <i>&ldquo;Building Stronger Business &ndash; Responding to Brexit by competing, innovation and trading&rdquo;. </i>A number of further important studies across a range of sectors and issues are underway with a view to publication in the coming weeks and months. </p><p>The Government is already acting in order to get Ireland Brexit ready. Dedicated measures were announced in Budget 2018, including a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme for Business and a &euro;25m Brexit Response Loan Scheme for the agri-food sector as well as additional supports for capital investment in the food industry and Bord Bia marketing and promotion activities, amounting to over &euro;50m in total.  Additional capital expenditure allocation of &euro;4.3bn over four years will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects while ensuring that communities and businesses can plan ahead.  There was also increased funding provided to my Department for the opening of six new diplomatic missions as part of Global Footprint 2025, which will contribute to helping our exporters find new markets.  Our Government&rsquo;s enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams.  Brexit will also be a critical factor in our longer-term economic strategy &ndash; a new 10-year Capital Plan is in preparation, we&rsquo;re revising our Enterprise 2025 policy and we are in active discussions with the European Investment Bank for a potential increase in investment in the country. </p></reply>

I firmly believe that such an approach is counter-productive, and that it will not help to increase ordinary Israelis' understanding of the sound basis for international concern about the impact of occupation.In relation to the decision taken by Israel to exclude members of certain groups, I believe that this action also does not help to build a better mutual understanding or to move the situation forward.   Israel is of course entitled to decide who it allows into its territory, as is any other state.  However, I believe that excluding people simply for critical opinions they hold is not the usual practice of a democracy.  Moreover, such exclusions also have the effect of denying people access to the occupied Palestinian territory which Israel controls.  While the Government does not support a policy of &ldquo;Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions&rdquo;, it is a legitimate and non-violent political viewpoint, albeit one regarded in Israel as hostile.</p>  <p>  During my visit to the Middle East last week, I raised this issue directly with Prime Minister Netanyahu.  I told him that I believe it is counterproductive and mistaken to exclude, from Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, individuals belonging to groups which have a deep interest in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  I hope that Israel will reconsider this decision.</p></reply>

Ministers also held an informal lunch meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.  I participated actively in these discussions.  On post-Cotonou, I noted that Ireland is a strong supporter of the partnership with the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of countries, and that we look forward to contributing to the discussions on the negotiating mandate.

There has understandably been a strong reaction among Palestinians and across the region to the US decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  The EU and its Member States have reaffirmed our belief in a two state solution to the conflict, including the future of Jerusalem as a capital for two states, both Israel and Palestine, and I have made clear that I believe the US announcement was premature and unhelpful.</p>  <p>  At the meeting of the PLO Central Council on 14-15 January there was evidently deep frustration not just at the recent US announcement, but also at the lack of progress over the last two decades in building on the Oslo Accords, and making a reality of the two state solution.  Some of the statements made at the Central Council included inflammatory rhetoric.  The Central Council also produced a set of resolutions, including a decision to assign the Executive Committee of the PLO to suspend recognition of Israel, pending reciprocal recognition of a State of Palestine. </p>  <p>  However, this decision has not yet been implemented. It will be for the Chairman of the PLO and President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, to decide whether to act on this recommendation, and so far, he has not done so.  I believe that the international community should focus on actions, not rhetoric.  I note that President Abbas has reaffirmed his opposition to terrorism in all forms, in the course of the Council. </p>  <p>  I very strongly urge President Abbas to maintain Palestinian recognition of Israel, something which the mainstream Palestinian movement represented in the PLO and the Palestinian Authority has accepted since 1993. </p>  <p>  During my visit to the Middle East earlier this month, when I met I Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and Foreign Minister Malki, I discussed with them the challenges facing the Palestinian people, but also urged them to keep an open mind on any US initiative to reinvigorate the Middle East Peace Process. </p>  <p>  My EU colleagues and I met again with President Abbas at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday, and the EU conviction that it would be a major step back to withdraw recognition of Israel was clear.  We also reiterated our strong support for the two state solution and for Palestinian aspirations for statehood, as an outcome of an agreement between the Parties.</p></reply>

The conflict, which is now in its seventh year, has cost an estimated half a million lives.  Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, and over 5.5 million have fled to neighboring countries and the wider region.  An end to the violence is urgently needed in order to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people.The UN is leading political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254, which calls for an end to violence; release of political prisoners; formation of a transitional governing body with executive powers and a constitutional reform process.  Ireland fully supports this process and the work of UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura.   The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.  The EU Syria Peace Process Support Initiative aims to facilitate the peace process, build the capacity of opposition parties and contribute to dialogue with civil society in support of the efforts of the UN Special Envoy for Syria. Ireland and the EU also provide support, including financial support, to a broad range of mechanisms to ensure legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria. </p>  <p>  Since 2012 Ireland has contributed over &euro;90 million to the international humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, including &euro;25 million in 2017.  Through our annual contributions to the EU institutions Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the crisis.  The EU and its Member States have together mobilised more than &euro;9.5 billion for humanitarian and resilience assistance to support Syrians inside the country and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-24a.176.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018012400071#WRD02500"><p>The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that any building or structure which is used as, or is suitable for use as a dwelling is liable to LPT.  For LPT purposes, the state of dereliction of a property is not relevant where it (the property) is actually occupied as a dwelling house. However, a property that is uninhabitable to such an extent that it is not suitable for occupation (and not actually occupied) is not taxable.</p>  <p>  The Act also provides for a number of exemptions from LPT where certain qualifying criteria are met. Specifically, Section 5(2) of the Act sets out the qualifying criteria in respect of property owners who are in long term care in a nursing home.  The particular qualifying criteria requires that the property must have been occupied as the person&rsquo;s sole or main residence and vacated due to his or her inability to continue living there because of infirmity.  The nature and duration of the infirmity must also be independently verified and certified by a doctor. </p>  <p>  Any property that qualified for the exemption on 1 May 2013 remains exempt for the duration of the current &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo; (to 31 October 2019) provided that it is not occupied by any other person.  A property that becomes eligible for the exemption on a date after 1 May 2013 only qualifies from the next &lsquo;liability date&rsquo; (1 November) for the remainder of the &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo;, for example 1 November 2017 in respect of 2018 and 2019. </p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed to me that no LPT has been paid in respect of the property in question for the years 2012 (Household Charge) to 2018 and has been deferred.  As a consequence of the deferral the liability has attached as a charge on the property and is accumulating interest at a rate of 4% per annum.  From the information available to Revenue, the property has only relatively recently become vacant which means that the exemption can only apply with effect from 1 November 2017 in respect of 2018 and 2019 and the liabilities for the previous years (2012 to 2017) remain due.  The deferred liabilities in respect of 2012 to 2017 would be paid when the property is sold or disposed of.</p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that it will engage directly with a nominated representative of the person in question, including the Deputy&rsquo;s office as appropriate, to clarify the person&rsquo;s  entitlement to the exemption and to agree a position in regard to any payable arrears.  This could include a continuation of the deferral in respect of the relevant years i.e. 2012 to 2017 or a suitable payment arrangement that takes account of the person&rsquo;s personal circumstances.</p></reply>

As it was a Maltese incorporated company, the liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.</p>  <p>  As you are aware, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment on 25 May 2017 and overturned the previous decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal that the Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) was liable in respect of third party motor insurance claims made against the policyholders of Setanta Insurance.  The consequence of this is that the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) has been deemed responsible for the payment of such third party claims subject to a limit of 65% (or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser) due to relevant claimants. </p>  <p>  As I have previously indicated, there is a legal concern that any Government intervention to compensate third party claimants over and above the 65% limit, and then &ldquo;step into the shoes&rdquo; of these claimants to recover directly any balance due from the Setanta liquidation could result in the Government having a lower status in the creditor hierarchy, and thus significantly reduce the amount it could recoup from the liquidator. </p>  <p>  In this respect, my Department initially sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General on 20 July 2017 and received a reply on 4 August 2017.  Subsequent to this a procurement process was commenced to obtain the services of a Maltese law firm to provide advice in relation to this concern.  Following the receipt of advices from the successful tenderer on 17 November 2017 and 5 December 2017, a further request for advice was sent to the Office of the Attorney General on 7 December 2017.  The Office of the Attorney General provided this advice to my Department on 15 December 2017. </p>  <p>  Subsequently, officials from my Department met with the Liquidator on 9 January and received an update on the current status of the liquidation process as well as the issues he is encountering in settling claims.  Based on this up to date information and the legal advices, the various courses of action open to the Government in relation to this issue are actively being considered. </p></reply>

The installation of a floor or other fixture qualifies for the reduced rate where the floor becomes an integral part of the property and cannot be removed without substantial damage being caused to the floor itself or to the property.</p>  <p>  Where a service constitutes the installation of a floor or other goods that can be removed without causing any damage to the floor or other goods or to the property then that service is the installation of a fitting, which is liable to the standard rate of 23%.  The service provider should determine on a case by case basis whether the service provided is the installation of fixtures liable at the 13.5% rate or the installation of fittings liable at the 23% rate. </p>  <p>  Where a supply includes the supply and installation of fixtures in a property, the supply is subject to the two-thirds rule, which requires that to benefit from the 13.5% rate the value of the goods cannot exceed two thirds of the total amount of the supply. </p>  <p>  Where a service provider is providing a service of installation of fixtures to certain Principal Contractors, it is the Principal Contractor who is liable to VAT at 13.5% rather than the service provider.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>The stations referred to by the Deputy are located in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Division, I am advised by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the DMR North Division on 31 December 2017 was 670 of whom 47 were community Garda&iacute;. There are 45 Garda Reserves and 39 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on reaching this goal.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 123 of whom have been assigned to the DMR North Division. Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - an increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.</p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, which will see Garda numbers reach more than 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the DMR North Division.</p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs. Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies. Community policing is not, of course, confined to dedicated Community Garda&iacute;, all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.  </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  </p><p>Undoubtedly, the on-going recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance Garda visibility within our communities and the provision of effective community policing across all Garda Divisions including the DMR North Division. </p><p>The information provided by the Commissioner in relation to the Deputy's request is set out in the tables.</p><p><table><tr><th colspan="4">Community Garda by Station 31 December 2015</th></tr><tr><td>STATION</td><td>SERGEANT</td><td>GARDA</td><td>TOTAL</td></tr><tr><td>Coolock</td><td>2</td><td>14</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Raheny</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Clontarf</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Howth</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th colspan="4">Community Garda by Station 31 December 2016</th></tr><tr><td>STATION</td><td>SERGEANT</td><td>GARDA</td><td>TOTAL</td></tr><tr><td>Coolock</td><td>2</td><td>12</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Raheny</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Clontarf</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Howth</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th colspan="4">Community Garda by Station 31 December 2017</th></tr><tr><td>STATION</td><td>SERGEANT</td><td>GARDA</td><td>TOTAL</td></tr><tr><td>Coolock</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Raheny</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Clontarf</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Howth</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr></table></p></reply>

However, new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission, a body under the Department of Health, must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced.  A high-level Steering Group is overseeing the establishment of the DSS.  </p>  <p>  Pending the establishment of the DSS, my officials have been encouraging the use of other options to allow payments to be made and they continue to examine what other options may be available.

When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 123 have been assigned to the DMR North Division. I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - an increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the DMR North Division. </p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information I have set out in the table below, the number of Garda&iacute; attached to Coolock, Raheny, Santry and Howth Garda Stations in each of the years 2011 to 2017.<table><tr><th colspan="8">Garda Strength by Station 2011-2017</th></tr><tr><td>STATION</td><td>2011</td><td>2012</td><td>2013</td><td>2014</td><td>2015</td><td>2016</td><td>2017</td></tr><tr><td>Coolock</td><td>117</td><td>114</td><td>112</td><td>109</td><td>103</td><td>105</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>Raheny</td><td>68</td><td>64</td><td>62</td><td>62</td><td>67</td><td>66</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>Santry</td><td>81</td><td>102</td><td>95</td><td>90</td><td>82</td><td>81</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>Howth</td><td>39</td><td>42</td><td>38</td><td>31</td><td>27</td><td>27</td><td>26</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that Garda Drug Unit personnel are assigned on a Divisional basis and that the Garda District referred to by the Deputy is part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (D.M.R.) North Division. I am informed that the total number of Divisional Drug Unit personnel as of 31 December 2017, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 236 of whom 19 were allocated to the D.M.R. North Division. The number of Garda&iacute; allocated to the Drugs Unit of the DMR North Division for the other years sought by the Deputy is as set out in the table below.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences, crime or otherwise.  I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in this jurisdiction. </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, which was established in 2015, continues to lead out the policing strategy for tackling drugs by demand reduction and supply reduction strategies. In this regard the Bureau continues its policy of working with Garda Divisional Drug Units nationwide in tackling supply reduction at local level. </p><p>This work is further supported by other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs. This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide. Multi-disciplinary approaches are also utilised to ensure that those involved in illicit activity are effectively targeted including through the use of the proceeds of crime legislation, money laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau. I am informed that this approach adopts good practice in implementing a co-ordinated use of Garda resources and in utilising available criminal law to its fullest extent in tackling all forms of organised crime, including drug trafficking.</p><p>We have also seen unprecedented international cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing services in other jurisdictions leading to important arrests and drug seizures. </p><p>Underpinning all these measures is this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 123 of whom were assigned to the DMR North Division. I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - an increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.

This decision was taken on the basis that such a body would be best placed to conduct the complex range of licensing, regulating, monitoring, inspecting and enforcement tasks, etc. of the growing gambling industry in all of its facets. This independent approach would also mirror the approach taken in most EU Member States and beyond.    </p>  <p>  The proposed independent regulator involves a change of approach from the 2013 General Scheme which proposed that the regulatory function, etc., would be discharged by the Minister for Justice and Equality, acting through the Office for Gambling Control Ireland, an Executive Office within the Department of Justice and Equality, but not a statutorily independent agency.   </p>  <p>  In the context of reviewing and updating the General Scheme in all necessary aspects, I received Government approval to establish a Working Group, chaired by myself, comprising all stakeholder Departments, relevant Offices and the Office of the Attorney General. The Working Group will have its first meeting on 2 February 2018. I hope that the Group can submit a final report to Government in mid to late 2018.   </p>  <p>  I expect that this Group will, amongst its other tasks, contribute to developing the structure of the proposed regulatory authority, including the staffing numbers, skills and expertise required and other issues. I will be engaging with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the recruitment of such staff at the appropriate time.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that the General Scheme of the Civil Law and Courts (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 received Government approval in July 2017.  This Bill will, inter alia, provide for a number of specific changes to the current antiquated Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956. These changes are limited in nature and primarily address the better regulation of fund raising activities at local level for charitable and philanthropic purposes. </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>The Garda strength of the Cavan/Monaghan Division on 31 December 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, was 329 with 11 Garda Reserves and 38 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 40 have been assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Division. I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - an increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Cavan/Monaghan Division. </p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information I have set out below in tabular form the number of Garda&iacute; attached to the Cavan/Monaghan Garda Division on 31 December 2015, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017.<table><tr><th colspan="2"><div>Personnel Strength of Cavan/Monaghan Division</div></th></tr><tr><td>Date</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>December 2015</td><td>318</td></tr><tr><td>December 2016</td><td>318</td></tr><tr><td>December 2017</td><td>329</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively. This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults. It was reimbursed in the community drugs schemes from 2010. The projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017. This process supports the appropriate use of Versatis, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster for three months. No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>These patients were identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and continued to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017. However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer received this item under the community drugs schemes. The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. </p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications. GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system. The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.</p><p><i>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at </i>.</p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

Its main aim is to demonstrate the positive effects that making homes warmer and more energy efficient can have on the health and wellbeing of people in energy poverty who are living with a chronic respiratory condition.  The Warmth and Wellbeing scheme is a joint policy initiative between my Department and the Department of Health.  The pilot began in 2016 and has now entered the final year of its 3 year operational period. I have allocated &euro;20m to the pilot scheme under the Government&rsquo;s Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and the Health Service Executive (HSE) are working together to deliver the scheme.</p>  <p>  As it is a pilot scheme, the resources available to the scheme are limited and consequently I have had to limit eligibility for the scheme. The operational area for the scheme was selected as Community Health Area (CHO) 7, following consultation with the Department of Health and the HSE.  This CHO encompasses Kildare/West Wicklow, Dublin West, Dublin South City and Dublin South West.

These are matters for Gas Networks Ireland, a commercial State-sponsored body under the aegis of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, the statutorily independent Regulator.     </p>  <p>  I have, however, also stated that, in my view, the possibility of whether network extensions should, where economically feasible and in line with our energy policy goals in the White Paper, provide for future connections in order to contribute to regional and rural development, needs to be addressed.  My long-standing position on the gas network is that it should be developed generally in rural Ireland to provide natural gas to as many areas as possible.  Accordingly, I commissioned a study last year on the wider costs and benefits of gas network extensions, to include possible climate and decarbonisation aspects, as well as regional and rural development benefits. My Department appointed external consultants to undertake this work last October and a seminar on the matter was held on 15 January. The study will be completed by the end of February and I will consider the findings at that stage. </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

With the Green Line now extended to Broombridge, and providing interchange with the Red Line and greater connectivity to rail services, those numbers are likely to grow substantially again in 2018.   While it is welcomed that so many new customers are using the extended Green Line, it has meant that some trams are operating at capacity. </p>  <p>  As part of the Luas Cross City project seven new 55 metre-long trams have been ordered by TII to increase capacity on the Green Line.  The first of these new trams is expected to be in service next month and the remainder will be delivered and become operational over the next few months.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Green Line Capacity Enhancement project was recently approved by Government.  The purpose of the project is to address current capacity limits at peak hours on the Luas Green Line and to cater for future demands along the line. The project is proposed in the National Transport Authority's (NTA) Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035.  </p>  <p>  The project, being managed by TII and NTA, will cost approximately &euro;90 million and it includes the lengthening of the 26 existing Green line trams from 43 metres to 55 metres and the purchase of a further 8 new 55 metre-long trams which will greatly increase the passenger capacity of the fleet now and to meet future passenger demand. The capacity increases at peak periods provided by the project will assist in reducing crowding on the Green Line and enhance accessibility for mobility and sensory impaired users during these periods.  </p>  <p>  The project also includes modifications to Sandyford Depot to accommodate the maintenance of the longer trams. Construction work has already begun at the depot and the order for the tram extensions was placed in November last year.</p>  <p>  Additionally the Green Line Infrastructure Upgrade, an investment project to lengthen the platforms at the Green Line stations was also completed by TII towards the end of last year.  </p></reply>

Its goal is to support pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience.  AIM is a child-centred and evidence-based model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs and strengths of the child and the pre-school setting.  Where a pre-school provider, in conjunction with a parent, considers that some additional support is needed in order to meet the needs of a child with a disability in an inclusive way, an application can be made for a suite of targeted supports, namely:</p><p>Level 4: Expert Early Years Educational Advice and Support</p><p>This level provides access to mentoring for pre-school practitioners from a team of dedicated Early Years Specialists. To avail of this support, pre-school providers and parents are requested to complete an online Access and Inclusion Profile. This looks at the strengths, abilities and needs of the child, as well as the strengths and needs of the pre-school setting.  </p><p>Level 5: Equipment, Appliances and Minor Alterations Capital Grants</p><p>This level provides for access to specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or minor alterations capital grants for pre-school settings to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme. A short report from a designated professional is required confirming that the specialised equipment or minor building alterations are necessary.</p><p>Level 6: Therapeutic Intervention</p><p>This level provides access to therapeutic services where they are critical to enable the child to be enrolled and to fully participate in the ECCE Programme.  To avail of this support, pre-school providers and parents are requested to complete the online Access and Inclusion Profile. The Early Years Specialist will review the profile and, where therapeutic input is likely to be required; the Specialist will initiate contact with the HSE.  The HSE decides on the appropriate level of therapeutic intervention.</p><p>Level 7: Additional Assistance in the Pre-School Room</p><p>This level provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE Programme.  It is estimated that pre-school providers may need Level 7 in the case of approximately 1% to 1.5% of all children. In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs).  Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room.  Accordingly, Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pre-school setting. </p><p>AIM was launched in June 2016. The total funding allocated and outturn in 2017 to levels 4, 5 and 7 of AIM by my Department is set out below. Funding for AIM Level 6 comes from the Department of Health Vote.</p><p>The Inter-Department Group, which developed AIM recognised that it would take approximately three years to fully develop and implement the Model. It is expected that demand for all levels of support under AIM will increase in years 2 and 3 and the budget available for AIM makes provision for this. <table><tr><th>Level </th><th>Element of Model </th><th>2017Allocation<br /><br />(m*) </th><th>2017 Outturn (m*)</th></tr><tr><td>4 </td><td>Expert Early Years Educational Advice and Support </td><td>10.1 </td><td>4.417 </td></tr><tr><td>5 </td><td>Equipment, Appliances and Minor   Alterations Grants and application process</td><td>2.5 </td><td>2.967 </td></tr><tr><td>6 </td><td>Therapeutic Intervention </td><td>- </td><td>- </td></tr><tr><td>7 </td><td>Additional Assistance in the Pre-School Room and Application Process </td><td>14.1 </td><td>8.202 </td></tr></table></p><p>*Figures rounded to the nearest thousand.</p><p>The number of children in each county who have benefitted from supports under AIM Levels 4, 5 and 7 in 2016 and 2017 is shown in the tables below.

This funding is intended to ensure the emergence, promotion, growth and development of youth organisations with distinctive philosophies and programmes aimed at the social education of young people. </p>  <p>  Scouting Ireland receives grant aid on an annual basis under the Youth Service Grant Scheme. In 2017, &euro;876,337 was allocated to the organisation under the Scheme, a 5% increase over the 2016 allocation.</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 provided an additional &euro;1.5m in current funding to my Department to support the provision of youth services, bringing the total allocation to &euro;58.9m. This additional funding will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people. My Department has commenced a process with national organisations and local services to identify service development needs for 2018 and to finalise the 2018 allocations.  Organisations, including Scouting Ireland, will be advised of their 2018 allocation as soon as possible. It is not envisaged at this point that there will be any reduction in the 2018 Youth Service Grant Scheme grant scheme allocation to Scouting Ireland.</p>  <p>  Over the past few years, Scouting Ireland has received significant other funding through my Department, outside of the Youth Service Grant Scheme. The organisation was allocated &euro;150,000 in current funding in 2015 and a further &euro;200,000  in Dormant Accounts  funding in 2016 to support the Operation Lelievlet youth employment initiative. It received &euro;49,630 under the Youth Capital Funding Scheme 2016 / 2017 to fund capital works. In 2015 &euro;30,000 was also provided to the organisation to assist it with its budget sustainability to the year end.</p>  <p>  In addition to the grant funding above, additional funding is being provided to Scouting Ireland for its AcadaMoot Programme. Up to &euro;200,000 will be made available to the organisation over a five year period in this regard. </p>  <p>  I was pleased to approve the establishment the Local Youth Club Equipment Scheme in 2017. The primary focus of this scheme was to assist volunteer led clubs and groups that work with young people in communities throughout the country.  The scheme allowed for the purchase of equipment for sport, arts, adventure and other much needed items. Some &euro;6.35m has been made available nationally. I am advised that scouting groups across Ireland received in excess of &euro;1.5m under the scheme in late 2017.</p></reply>

This is the third year in succession that Tusla has received a significant increase in its funding, which now amounts to over &euro;753m.</p>  <p>  I strongly support the work of Tusla, and I am committed to supporting the Agency in meeting the growing needs of children and families. </p>  <p>  The additional resources secured for Tusla in 2018 will assist in meeting key priorities.  The additional investment will allow Tusla to recruit a range of additional staff to respond to areas of identified risk, and to meet increased demand for services, including an anticipated increase in referrals following the introduction of mandatory reporting.  This increase in funding is also enabling the further management of unallocated cases.  Tusla is also in the process of recruiting more administrative staff to support social workers in their child protection duties. </p>  <p>  In 2018, funding is also being used to establish a single national out-of-hours social work service, building on significant progress made in recent years in strengthening this service, enhanced collaboration with An Garda Sioch&aacute;na, additional on-call social work capacity and a new out-of-hours support service for foster carers.  </p>  <p>  I have requested that Tusla develop a robust workforce plan which addresses succession planning, retention, career pathways, training and development, future workforce needs, priority gaps and a strategy for tackling the priority gaps, dealing with a rise in referrals due to mandatory reporting and reducing unallocated cases. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I am confident that the Exchequer funding of over &euro;753m in 2018 provides Tusla with significantly increased capacity to respond to areas of identified risk and anticipated demand, including the introduction of mandated reporting, and to progress a number of key service developments which will ensure better outcomes for vulnerable children, and families, who need our services and support.</p></reply>

I am progressing a number of initiatives in this regard to facilitate an appropriate way forward in our response to what are hugely complex and sensitive matters. </p>  <p>  In June and October of last year two facilitated meetings were held with former residents of Mother and Baby Homes. A key ask that emerged from these meetings was  that of &ldquo;nothing about us without us&rdquo;. My recent announcement of the establishment of a Collaborative Forum for former residents is a direct response to this wish by former residents.</p>  <p>  The Forum will enable former residents to identify, discuss and prioritise the issues of concern to them, and facilitate them to make recommendations for actions and solutions. I published a Charter for the Collaborative Forum which describes its structure, scope and working methodology. </p>  <p>  The Forum will examine specific themes on a modular basis to facilitate it in making recommendations to me. The Forum will explore a wide number of practical issues including: issues dealing with respectful and inclusive terminology and language; strategies to undo stigma and raise public awareness; identifying and sharing good practice in peer to peer support activities; access to professional counselling services and other specific health and personal social services; memorialisation which acknowledges and recognise past events; and documenting and presenting personal narratives of former residents and their relatives to ensure an archive of material is created and preserved.  I will be making an announcement with further details on this Forum shortly.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has agreed to invite Mr. Pablo de Greiff, UN Special Rapporteur, to assist Ireland in our response to issues related to former Mother and Baby homes and I am working with my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to arrange this invitation.</p>  <p>  Improving communication with former residents continues to be a priority of mine as I believe that open and consistent communication on the matters of concern is essential while the Commission continues with the work that it was established to do. My Department has increased its focus on communication by establishing an e-zine update which is posted on the Mother and Babies Homes section of my Department's website on the first Friday of every month. In this way everyone has access to the same information at the same time.</p>  <p>  My department has also established a dedicated phone line and email address to facilitate direct communications with my Department by interested parties.</p></reply>

This method by which this is regulated is set out in the Funding Standard.</p>  <p>  The Funding Standard provides a benchmark against which the &lsquo;health&rsquo; of a scheme can be tested.  A scheme failing the Funding Standard means that, unless some action is taken, the scheme will not be able to pay the benefits promised.  The existence of the Funding Standard itself is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded.  Rather the responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed.  However, the Funding Standard does provide the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a scheme can provide a level of the pension benefits promised.</p>  <p>  The funding standard is a wind-up standard, and is intended to approximate the monies needed to secure the benefits if the scheme was wound up and the accrued benefits bought out. </p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority is the independent body responsible for regulating the funding standard.  If a scheme does not meet the funding standard, a funding proposal must be submitted to the Authority in accordance with the time limits detailed in the Pensions Act.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority requires that, in setting investment policy, the trustees of a DB scheme must have regard to the need to satisfy at regular intervals the minimum funding standard set down in the Pensions Act.  However a number of steps have been taken to reduce the risks to pension scheme members caused by market volatility.</p>  <p>  In order to provide increased investment options for pension schemes the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010 and 2011 introduced the option for trustees to purchase sovereign annuities.  Pension schemes that purchase sovereign annuities or the underlying bonds benefit from a reduction in their liabilities under the funding standard.  Buying sovereign annuities for the pensioners has the effect of reducing pensioner liabilities under the funding standard and provides additional funds for the other members of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012 requires a DB scheme to hold additional funding in the form of a &lsquo;risk reserve&rsquo; by 2023.  This function of this &lsquo;risk reserve&rsquo; is to provide some protection and long term stability for scheme members against future volatility in financial markets.  Additionally, and in appropriate circumstances, the regulator may now approve scheme funding proposals that provide for the recovery of their schemes funding over longer periods that was previously the case.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Irish funding standard is less demanding in comparison to almost all other European countries.  I believe that the minimum funding standard is appropriate and my Department, in conjunction with the Pensions Authority, monitors the operation of the minimum funding standard for DB pension schemes.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Activation measures include the requirement to attend group or individual meetings, and/or avail of suitable education, training or development opportunities, or specified employment programmes, which are considered appropriate to a person&rsquo;s circumstances.</p><p>Legislation provides that sanctions/penalties in the form of reduced payments may be imposed by a Deciding Officer where recipients of jobseeker payments fail, without good cause, to comply with activation measures.  Reduced rates are only applied where a jobseeker fails to engage as requested, and following at least two warnings, with the Department&rsquo;s employment services.</p><p>Instructions in the application of penalty rates state that after a minimum of 21 calendar days (3 weeks) on a Penalty Rate, where the client continues to refuse, without good cause, to attend after further notice has been given, the activation 9-week disqualification from Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit/Allowance will be applied. </p><p>Where an activation 9-week disqualification has been applied, and the client continues to fail to engage, without good cause, in the activation process, the question as to whether the person satisfies the basic conditions for entitlement to JA or JB arises, and their Jobseeker claim may be reviewed.  During the 9 weeks, the disqualification may be lifted at any time if the person engages in the activation process.</p><p>If at the end of the 9-week disqualification period the client continues to fail to re-engage, the Penalty Rate must be reapplied for a further 21 calendar days (3 weeks) before a further 9-week disqualification can be applied.  In all circumstances, advance written notice must be given.  Legislation does not allow for any one period of disqualification to exceed 9 weeks <i>or</i>consecutive 9-week disqualifications.  </p><p>The Jobseeker can appeal the Deciding Officer&rsquo;s decision for reduced rate penalties and for a 9 week disqualification, through the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).  </p><p>JobPath providers do not apply or recommend the application of a penalty rate of payment.  They simply advise the Department if a jobseeker is failing to attend activation meetings.  Officials in the Department then contact the Jobseeker and seek to arrange a meeting to discuss the matter directly with them.  The application of penalty rates for all clients is entirely a matter for the Department and officials involved will take all relevant factors into account.</p></reply>

It provides that the Housing Agency, in consultation with the relevant housing authority, may make a written proposal to the Minister that an identified area be prescribed as a Rent Pressure Zone.  Within 1 week of receipt of such a proposal, the Minister shall request the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to furnish him, within 2 weeks, with a rent zone report on whether the proposed area  satisfies the criteria specified in subsection 24A(4) for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p><p>The criteria to be satisfied by an area under section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Acts for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone are as follows:</p><p>(a) the information relating to the area, as determined by reference to the information used to compile  each RTB Rent Index quarterly report, shows that the annual rate of increase in the average amount of rent for that area is more than 7% in each of at least 4 of the 6 quarters preceding the period immediately prior to the date of the Housing Agency's proposal. </p><p>(b) the average rent for the area in the last quarter, as determined by reference to the information used to compile each the RTB Rent Index quarterly report, is above the average national rent (commonly referred to as the Rent Index national standardised rent) in the last quarter.</p><p>Therefore, the annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and the average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the Rent Index national standardised rent in the last quarter.</p><p>A Rent Pressure Zone calculator is available on the Residential Tenancies Board website at , to assist landlords and tenants in determining if their dwelling is in a Rent Pressure Zone and to calculate the maximum rent amount permitted for their dwelling.</p><p>The Housing Agency will continue to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation. Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones.  </p><p>The RTB's news page on its Rent Index at the following link - https://onestopshop.rtb.ie/news/latest-data-from-rtb-quarterly-rent-index-q3-2017/ - provides access to the most recent RTB Rent Index quarterly report (for Q3 2017) and summarises its key findings. Information is also provided as part of the RTB's education and awareness campaign relating to Rent Pressure Zones. </p><p>Table 9 in the RTB Rent Index Quarterly Index Report illustrates the recent rent changes at Local Electoral Area (LEA) level.  The Table outlines for each LEA the number of quarters within the last 6 Quarters where the annualised rent increases have been greater than or equal to 7% and how rent levels in each LEA compares to the Rent Index national standardised rent.</p></reply>

In this scenario, the Board is required to indicate in its decision its main reasons for doing so. </p>  <p>  In this regard, it should be noted that, in making determinations on planning appeals or applications, the Board is required to have regard to not only the local development plan, but also to planning guidelines issued by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, as well as to other relevant Government policies. Development plans are generally drafted and adopted in accordance with national policies and planning guidelines which are current at the time of their adoption. However, there can be instances where new Government policies are adopted after the adoption of a development plan, thereby superseding specific local policies in the development plan, and which consequently the Board is required to have regard to in the determination of planning appeals or applications before it. This can result in the Board attaching greater significance to new and updated Government policy than to a development plan objective that may have been adopted a number of years ago, thereby resulting in the contravening of the development plan in making its determination on a planning appeal or an application by the Board.</p>  <p>  In the circumstances, I have no proposals to amend the existing relevant provisions of the Planning Act.</p></reply>

This includes operational issues such as ensuring that contracted services are delivered in a professional manner, that inspections take place and that homeless families/individuals can report issues to the relevant authority.  In this regard, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) has been overseeing the development of a quality standards framework.  </p>  <p>  The DRHE has been coordinating the development of these standards in consultation with an advisory group which includes representation from various housing authorities, service providers, Tusla, clients and other stakeholders, with a view to having the finalised standards adopted on a national basis by individual housing authorities. The draft standards have been piloted in a number of selected services across the country and positive feedback has been received. I understand that the DRHE are preparing a final draft quality standards framework for formal submission to my Department.  Upon receipt, along with any recommendations with regard to implementation from the DRHE and the advisory group, I will give consideration to how such standards could be applied on a national basis by housing authorities.</p></reply>

Further facilities will become operational during the course of 2018.  These hubs offer a greater level of stability than is possible in hotels, while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured. </p>  <p>  The specific data sought in the Question is not available in my Department, and is a matter for the relevant housing authorities.

The purpose of the voids programme is to ensure that vacant units are actively targeted and returned to productive use as quickly as possible.  Without substantial refurbishment under construction contracts, social homes would have been left vacant and not part of the active social housing stock.  Therefore funding the refurbishment and bringing units back into active use means that households who would otherwise not have been housed, can actually be accommodated.</p><p>Voids are not classified by the length of time they are vacant.  The programme is also designed to support the bringing back into use of units that would likely remain vacant for a significant period of time because the cost of the scale of  works required could not be met by the local authority.  It is a matter for each local authority to determine suitable properties for inclusion in the programmes.</p><p>Under the voids programme, local authorities can claim a maximum of &euro;30,000 funding per unit.  However, should they wish to do so, local authorities may also contribute funding from their own resources to complete these works.  The derelicts and 2 into 1 programmes require greater levels of remediation with associated higher costs, in excess of the limits as set out in the voids programme.  Some 96% of the units refurbished cost &euro;30,000 or less. </p><p>Under Rebuilding Ireland, the target under the voids programmes for 2016 to 2021 is 3,459.  The number of units that require significant refurbishment is reducing with the target for 2021 set at 170.  It is envisaged that these programmes will diminish over time with the local authorities addressing future vacant units that arise through their own planned maintenance programmes.  However, it is expected that there will always be some need for voids funding and it is important that it is continued to meet demand to avoid the situation where pre 2014, there was a build up of vacant units awaiting repair.</p><p>Voids Data 2014 to 2017: incorporating Voids, Derelicts and 2 into 1 Programmes</p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th><b>Units Returned in 2014</b></th><th><b>Funding 2014</b></th><th><b>Units

A contract notice for this bundle was published on 12th May 2017 in the Official Journal of the European Union and expressions of interest were submitted by five candidates.  Based on a detailed evaluation of these submissions, the following three candidates have been shortlisted to tender-  </p><p>- BAM PPP PGGM Cooperative U.A.; </p><p>- Comhar; and </p><p>- Torc Housing Partnership.</p><p>Details regarding these tenderers are available on the National Development Finance Agency website at <i>.</i></p><p>Each individual bundle of PPP sites takes an estimated 37-48 months to deliver in total, including planning, procurement and construction.  It is expected that construction on the first bundle of sites will commence later this year, with units becoming available from 2019.</p><p>The Social Housing PPP Programme is being delivered through the &lsquo;availability&rsquo; based PPP model. Under this type of contract, as the private partner, the PPP project company designs, builds, finances and maintains public buildings on sites provided by the State, in this case through the local authority.  Payment is made by the State only once construction of the buildings is complete and the units are ready to house tenants. The payment comprises a monthly &lsquo;availability&rsquo; and performance-based payment (or unitary charge) made over the term of the 25-year contract.</p><p>The amount of the availability payment is a bid item in the selection of the preferred tender. This means that, when a bidder tenders for the PPP project, the level of monthly payment is considered in assessing the competing tenders. As the Deputy will understand, given that the tender process is currently underway, and in order to ensure that the State receives value for money, these costings are of a commercially sensitive nature.</p></reply>

This was followed by the publication for consultation by Dublin City Council of a detailed planning scheme for the area.  The Council prepared a draft planning scheme which was considered by the elected Council members in May 2017.  As a statutory consultee for that process, my Department highlighted the importance of the planning scheme addressing a variety of housing needs.</p>  <p>  The Council proposed a material amendment to the Planning Scheme in relation to the tenure mix. As a statutory consultee, my Department made further observations in this regard. The final Planning Scheme was approved by Dublin City Council on 2 October 2017.</p>  <p>  Of the 3,500 homes planned to be delivered on these lands, it is intended that 350 units (or 10%) will be delivered as social units under Part V.  In addition, a further 550 (or over 15%) will be delivered under a commercial agreement, with the majority earmarked for affordable homes but with potential for additional social housing, particularly designed for older people. </p>  <p>  While the progression of the Planning Scheme is ultimately a matter for Dublin City Council, I am committed to working with the Council to deliver these mixed-tenure units on what is a key site for the sustainable development of Dublin City.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that there is currently an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to the Poolbeg SDZ planning scheme.  The decision of the Board is awaited.</p></reply>
