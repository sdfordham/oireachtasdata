There is a very wide ranging and broad spectrum of activities on offer to clients with mental illness, from mild episodes to more severe and enduring ill-health. The Mental Health Service in Ballyfermot has adopted a holistic approach to the type of services offered and fosters a sense of empowerment of clients to take control of their mental health status.</p><p>The services provided by Ballyfermot Primary Care and Mental Health Centre are in line with <i>A Vision for Change</i>and include the following: </p><p>-  Core services are provided by three Consultant-led teams that also include a number of non-Consultant hospital doctors. </p><p>-  A dedicated Rehabilitation Consultant.</p><p>-  Patients requiring emergency or in-patient care are referred to the Acute In-patient Unit at Tallaght Hospital. </p><p>-  Daily Occupational Therapy input with functional assessments available including Social Work and Psychology Services input. </p><p>-  A Home-Based Treatment Team with a case load of between 10-12 clients per staff member, including Community Mental Health Nurses. </p><p>-  Day Hospital and Day Services, which are open 7 days per week, which provide a wide range of therapeutic activities, e.g Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), men&rsquo;s group, mental health groups providing peer support, monthly carers' group, social outings, music/drama groups facilitated by staff or clients, art therapy and FETAC level courses. </p><p>-  The Day Hospital has forged strong working relationships with local pharmacy services and GPs, in addition to Public Health Nurses. </p><p>-  The First Episode Psychosis service, dealing with 18-35 year age group, includes baseline health screening and physical health screening,  monitoring clients along with their families, providing them with support and education regarding their illness. </p><p>-  Speech and Language Therapy Services are available for clients with swallow difficulties and speech issues requiring assessment and intervention.</p><p>-  Service Users are facilitated to become involved as Advocates for other service users. </p><p>-  Ongoing training for staff as part of their continuous professional development.</p><p>The significant investment provided by this Government since 2012 is enabling the HSE Mental Health Division to put in place a range of quality, person-centred, evidence based services to ensure that people with mental health difficulties are supported to achieve their optimal  mental health. Some &euro;125 million in additional funding has been provided by this Government to, in particular, strengthen community based mental health services across the country.</p></reply>

All hospitals, including Beaumont, have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care. </p>  <p>  I am informed that Beaumont Hospital has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve the patient pathway both through the ED and the hospital, in addition to working closely with the community. All available bed capacity is open and off-site capacity is also being utilised.</p>  <p>  Three ED-experienced nurses are to join the Emergency Department at Beaumont in the next six weeks and a feasibility study in relation to the redevelopment and potential relocation of its Emergency Department is currently out to tender. </p>  <p>  On 2 April I announced additional funding of &euro;74m to tackle delayed discharges and provide additional community beds this freeing up hospital beds for other patients and reducing ED overcrowding. This is on top of measures already taken in Budget 2015 when the Government provided &euro;25m to support services to provide alternatives to and relieve pressures on acute hospitals. This funding should enable the HSE to deliver my stated objective of reducing the number of delayed discharges by one third to less than 500 and the number of patients on trolleys in EDs waiting for admission for over nine hours to fewer than an average of 70. As a hospital with significant numbers of patients who require additional supports or long term care in order to facilitate their safe discharge from acute care, Beaumont will benefit significantly from this funding.</p></reply>

Additional funding of &euro;7 million was allocated for this purpose.  As a result, almost 1,400 young people with disabilities who finished school or rehabilitative training received placements which fully met their needs.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive is committed to providing services for school-leavers again this year and is working with schools, service providers, young people and their families to identify training needs and explore suitable options for those graduating in 2015. </p>  <p>  Planning has commenced in respect of all school-leavers and rehabilitative training graduates to ensure that needs are identified and appropriate services are provided to young people with disabilities. The HSE has confirmed that all young people and their families will be notified by the end of June of the placement that will be available to them from September. Additional funding of &euro;6 million (at a full year cost of &euro;12 million) has been allocated in the Social Care Operational Plan 2015 to meet the needs of over 1,400 young people who will require continuing health-funded supports.</p>  <p>  In line with the National Disability Strategy and the Government's mainstreaming policy, responsibility for education and training for people with disabilities is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills. Many young people with disabilities will progress to further education or vocational training funded by that Department and some young people may continue to receive health-funded supports depending on their individual needs and abilities. The Department of Health is in regular contact with the Department of Education and Skills on childrens' disability issues through the cross sectoral team arrangements that are in place.</p></reply>

The purpose underpinning the loan is to ensure than an applicant does not have to sell their house during their lifetime. </p>  <p>  The loan can be repaid at any time but will ultimately fall due for repayment upon the applicant&rsquo;s death. </p>  <p>  Under Section 26(2)(b) of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 the Revenue Commissioners are the appointed agents for the State in the collection of the repayable monies under the loan element of the Scheme. The Revenue Commissioners and the HSE work together in the calculation of amounts due to be repaid to the State.</p>  <p>  Since the Scheme commenced in 2009 and until the end of 2014 almost 10% of applicants who received support under the Scheme have availed of the loan. The HSE have advised Revenue that at the end of February 2015 &euro;37.3m fell to be recouped from loans due for repayment, of which Revenue have recouped &euro;22.1m.</p></reply>

This Agreement remains in place until 31st October this year.</p>  <p>  As the end of the current Agreement approaches consideration is being given to a range of options available to the State in seeking to deliver further savings on the cost of drugs.  Such options include entering into a new Agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association as well as the possibility of using the legislative powers afforded to the HSE under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 to review and alter prices.</p>  <p>  An important objective in any new arrangement will be to secure significant savings on the projected cost of drugs, as well as continued access to cost effective treatments.

The Government currently provides funding of approximately &euro;1.5 billion to the Disability Services Programme through the Health Service Executive's National Service Plan for 2015. </p><p>The HSE works with voluntary disability service providers to ensure that available resources are used in order to be responsive to the health and personal social services needs of people with a disability. </p><p>In 2015, the HSE is seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources and to maintaining a consistent level to that provided in 2014, by providing the following specialist disability services:</p><p>-  residential services to around 9,000 people with a disability; </p><p>-  day services to over 22,000 people with intellectual and physical disabilities; </p><p>-  respite residential support of 190,000 overnights for people with intellectual and physical disabilities; </p><p>-  3.9 million hours of Personal Assistant / Home Support Hours.</p><p>Additional funding of &euro;6 million has been allocated in the HSE National Service Plan in 2015 to provide day places for an estimated 1,400 young people finishing school and rehabilitative (life-skills) training.  &euro;4m in additional funding has also been allocated in the Plan to deliver an increase in the services for children with disabilities and reduce waiting lists under the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18s) Programme.</p><p>A total of 150 people will be facilitated to move from institutions to homes in the community in line the recommendations of  the  HSE's report &quot;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings -A strategy for Community Inclusion' (2011). This report proposes a new model of support in the community by moving people from institutional settings to the community, over a seven year time frame.</p><p>In order to maintain current service levels while supporting people with disabilities to achieve their full potential, including living as independently as possible, a significant change programme involving a realignment and reconfiguration of existing resources is being undertaken by the HSE. The reconfiguration will be in line with the recommendations in the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services and will see new and sustainable models of service being implemented to meet the changing needs of service users, increased demographic pressures and individuals wish for more choice and control.</p></reply>

In particular, a key priority is to progress integrated, evidence-based and recovery focussed models of care for mental heath services.</p><p>The Executive supports timely access to appropriate services to address the mental health needs of all children from a preventative care model and early intervention perspective.It should be noted, however, that mental health problems are not the sole remit of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).Like adults with mental health problems, most children and adolescents will have these problems responded to at primary care level. </p><p>The <i>Vision for Change</i>policy recommends a consultation/liaison model between primary care and mental health services to improve communication and coordination between the two.The Mental Health Division of the HSE has actively progressed communication and integration between primary and secondary mental health services through the use of a &ldquo;Stepped Care&rdquo; approach. Psychological and other relevant supports are accessed in primary care in the first instance, with CAMHS providing a secondary care service to those referred to it.</p><p>A number of other  important service improvements are also being progressed by the HSE Mental Health Division with a view to promoting, encouraging and fostering the development of robust preventative initiatives and quality mental health services for all children and adolescents, including;</p><p>-  A proposal to support and enhance further access to psychological therapies (psychology and counselling) in primary care for young people who would  otherwise be referred to CAMHS.</p><p>-  In  partnership with T&uacute;sla,  co-sponsoring research with NUI Maynooth which is aimed at developing innovative research, building capacity, promoting inter-agency integration, with a view to developing family-focused mental health services.</p><p>It should also be noted that the provision of health and personal social services by the HSE are, by their nature, holistic to varying degrees and the concept of a holistic approach across many services is well embedded in HSE provision. In this context, the issues raised by the Deputy would also be a matter for consideration by the health professionals involved at operational level, taking account of matters such as quality and safety, the assessed need of individuals or other relevant therapeutic requirements.  Such consideration is undertaken on an individual basis as part of an overall approach tailored to the affective care and treatment of an individual.</p></reply>

The meeting was a positive engagement, with preliminary discussions on future service needs.</p>  <p>  It was acknowledged that the population of adults with Cystic Fibrosis served by Beaumont Hospital has more than doubled since service provision commenced. A dedicated CF Outpatient facility allows for the provision of a comprehensive range of multi-disciplinary services for approximately 150 patients. The consultation and treatment rooms have specialist air filtration to assist with infection control. Seven single in-patient rooms are reserved for  elective CF admissions for prophylactic antibiotic therapy (or other treatment as required). This ensures that adults with CF are rarely admitted as in-patients via the Emergency Department. However in the longer term, demographic factors, coupled with the increase in patient longevity resulting from improved treatment and pharmaceuticals, will increase service provision requirements further. As a result, it is estimated that a future requirement will arise for up to 20 in-patient beds.</p>  <p>  Beaumont Hospital and the HSE are engaging in relation to the overall infrastructural requirements to best meet growing service demands. An initial business case for the future development of additional CF services at Beaumont Hospital has been submitted by the CEO of the hospital to the RCSI Hospital Group Chief Executive and is under review. The views and ideas exchanged between my officials, hospital staff and patient advocates will inform the further development of this business case in the run up to the 2016 Service Plan.</p></reply>

Counselling is provided across the health service including primary care, social care and within mental health.  This type of service can be provided by a range of trained health professionals and delivered to meet a clinical need at either primary or secondary care level. The Government, in keeping with its commitment in the Programme for Government to increase access to counselling and psychotherapy, has provided funding totalling &euro;7.5 million to develop the Counselling in Primary Care (CIPC) service, which works closely with the HSE Mental Health Service, under whose aegis this funding is provided.</p><p>I wish to confirm that there are mental health therapy services available for people in Co. Clare, and they are not confined only to those with a new diagnosis.  I understand that the Deputy may be referring to the availability of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) services, which are designed to help reduce self harm and self destructive behaviours, using a combination of group skills training, individual therapy and phone coaching.  Unfortunately there is no DBT service available as yet in Co Clare or in the Mid West, however consideration is being given to the training of staff in this regard.</p></reply>

Anyone ordinarily resident in the country is entitled, subject to certain charges, to receive public in-patient and out-patient hospital services. People who do not take out health insurance continue to have the same entitlement to services in the public hospital system</p>  <p>  Community rating, reflecting the principle of intergenerational solidarity, is a fundamental cornerstone of the health insurance system. This means that people who are old or sick do not have to pay more than the young and well.  Under community rating, the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid. Premiums for younger or healthier lives are typically higher than their expected claims would require, whereas for older or less healthy lives, premiums are typically lower than the expected claims would require. </p>  <p>  For Community Rating to work we depend on adequate numbers of younger people taking out health insurance to help keep premium prices down for everybody. Lifetime Community Rating is being introduced to encourage people to take out health insurance at a younger age, thereby helping to spread the costs of older and less healthy people across society, to support affordable community-rated premiums for everyone who wishes to purchase insurance. It is a necessary measure to help support the viability of community rating within our system of health insurance. I have no intention of reconsidering the introduction of Lifetime Community Rating, as without it there will be a continued deterioration in the age profile of the insured population, which in turn will contribute to claims inflation and higher insurance premiums for all.</p>  <p>  It is worth clarifying that those who do not wish to avail of private health insurance will not face a financial penalty. They retain their full entitlement to use of public hospital services. Under Lifetime Community Rating, those who decide to take out  health insurance later in life will face an added premium compared to those who have subscribed over a longer period. I am satisfied that this measure is fully justified for the purposes of maintaining a stable insurance market which provides equity of treatment between young and old.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Government has provided an additional &euro;125 million and some 1,150 posts since 2012, of which around 260 posts have been allocated specifically to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health area.

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need, i.e. Grade 5 or some with a Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE. </p>  <p>  The HSE has established a pilot scheme in Dublin North East which will involve the use of orthodontic therapists in the treatment of a number of eligible children. Consideration will be given to expanding this Scheme to other HSE areas in the future.  In addition to the services provided by HSE staff, orthodontic treatment for certain categories of misalignment will be provided by a panel of independent practitioners under contract to the HSE over the next three years. A national procurement process is being finalised. This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for 4 years or longer. It is expected that this initiative will commence later this year and will have a positive impact on waiting times.</p></reply>

The Oversight Forum on Drugs, which I chair, is responsible for the high-level monitoring of the Strategy, and solid progress is being made in delivering on its objectives.    </p>  <p>  The Strategy aims to create a safer society through the reduction of the supply and availability of drugs for illicit use.  Drug seizures valued at approximately &euro;62m were made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na last year. This does not include a joint operation involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Revenue Customs Service and the Naval Service which led to the interception of a yacht off Ireland's south-west coast in September 2014 containing cocaine with an estimated street value at that time of over &euro;70m.  </p>  <p>  Prevention and awareness programmes constitute a significant part of the Government's response to the drug problem. In addition to substance-use education in schools, young people at risk of drug misuse can access diversionary programmes, facilities and services and family support.     </p>  <p>  The provision of appropriate and timely treatment services is a key goal of the Strategy.  At the end of December, 97% of clients over the age of 18 accessed treatment within one calendar month of assessment, and 100% of those under 18 received treatment within one week of assessment. There is much wider coverage of needle exchange services outside the Dublin area, with more than 130 community pharmacies recruited and trained. In a major effort to reduce drug-related deaths, the HSE is undertaking a pilot project to make the life-saving drug naloxone more widely available to treat overdoses. Naloxone reverses the effects of drugs like heroin, morphine and methadone if someone overdoses. </p>  <p>  The budget of Drug and Alcohol Task Forces has also been protected, with &euro;29m provided for local drugs initiatives this year. An additional &euro;2.1m has been provided in the HSE budget this year for measures targeting vulnerable problem drug users, including the provision of more residential detoxification and rehabilitation places.</p>  <p>  My Department is beginning work on the development of a new Strategy for the period after 2016. The process will include a comprehensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public on the current national drugs policy and future priorities. It will also take account of evidence-based research, information and data sources on the extent and nature of problem drug use in Ireland. As Minister with lead responsibility for drugs policy, I will play an active role in the development of the new Strategy and I look forward to engaging with all interested parties in this work.</p></reply>

The 95% target indicated in the Plan allows for some flexibility surrounding emergency placements in Adult Units. The corresponding target set in the 2014 Service Plan was 75% or above. </p><p>It is generally accepted that it will be most challenging for the HSE to meet the ambitious target for 2015, relative to the 2014 outturn position of around 70% for age appropriate placements. However, progress in this area has been significant over recent years, as evidenced by the fact that the number of such admissions to adult units in 2008 was 247, and that the trend has been declining annually since then to the most recent draft figure of 89 admissions for 2014.  Clearly, there remains room for improvement and this issue has therefore been flagged as a Key Priority in this year's Service Plan.</p><p>At present, there are 58<b></b>in-patient beds for children and adolescents<b></b>in the HSE.  Overall, the HSE are targeting an operational capacity of 74 public Child and Adolescent beds nationally by the end of 2015. It should be noted that difficulties with re-opening some existing beds at local level, already resourced in the system, primarily relates to securing or retaining staff rather than the non-availability of funding.</p></reply>

The Chief Nursing Office in the Department has been engaged with, the nursing home sector in promoting nursing in the older adult as a career choice.

Taking into account current pressures on acute hospital services, I have put in place a target that by mid-year nobody will wait more than 18 months for in-patient, day case treatment or an out-patient appointment, with a further reduction to a wait time of no more than 15 months by year end.  The HSE is currently working on an implementation plan to achieve these targets and this will be monitored throughout the year.  </p><p>I have been assured by the Saolta University Health Care Group that the waiting list for spinal surgery is a priority for the Saolta University Health Care Group.  I understand that a number of arrangements are being put in place in order to facilitate the level of complexity involved in relation to this type of surgery.  The Group is currently reviewing a number of resources in the context of bed availability, access to diagnostics, purchase of specialist spinal equipment and access to theatre.  Plans in this regard are progressing and every effort is being made to facilitate potential surgery dates for this cohort of patients.</p><p>In addition, the National Waiting List Management Policy, <i>A standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, January 2014,</i>has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.  This policy, which has been adopted by the Health Service Executive, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p></reply>

Under community rating, the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid.  Premiums for younger or healthier lives are typically higher than their expected claims would require, whereas for older or less healthy lives, premiums are typically lower than the expected claims would require. </p>  <p>  Community-rated insurance markets depend on a continuing entry of younger people, to help keep premium prices down for everybody.  Lifetime Community Rating (LCR) is being introduced to encourage people to take out private health insurance at a younger age, thereby helping to spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market, to support affordable community-rated premiums for everyone who wishes to purchase insurance.  It is a necessary measure to help support the viability of community rating within our system of private health insurance, as without it there will be a continued deterioration in the age profile of the insured population, which in turn will contribute to claims inflation and higher insurance premiums for all.</p>  <p>  There are a number of weeks remaining before the introduction of Lifetime Community Rating.  All residents in this State during the grace period, who choose to wait until after 30 April 2015 to purchase private health insurance, will be subject to the provisions of the LCR regulations.  I would encourage anybody who is considering purchasing health insurance to do so in advance of the new rules coming into force.  Any increase in the number of younger insured persons will have a positive impact on the market as a whole as it will help to make health insurance more affordable for all.</p></reply>

The aim is to commence the GP service for under 6s and over 70s in the summer, with the Diabetes Cycle of Care commencing in Quarter 4 of this year.</p>  <p>  Under the new arrangements, an additional 270,000 children under 6 will benefit from GP care free at the point of service.  All children under 6 will benefit from the new enhanced service under the proposed GP contract.  This will involve age-based preventive checks focused on health and wellbeing and the prevention of disease.  These assessments will be carried out when a child is aged 2 and again at age 5, in accordance with an agreed protocol.  </p>  <p>  The contract will also include an agreed cycle of care for children diagnosed with asthma, under which GPs will carry out an annual review of each child where the doctor has diagnosed asthma.  The asthma cycle of care will provide the key elements of best practice in the care of asthma with structured visits including education of child and parents, medicine and inhaler technique review and an individualised asthma plan for parents.  It will result in better quality of life for children, with resulting better health and wellbeing and less need to visit hospital.  The new expanded GP service will apply to all children aged under 6, including those who already have a medical card.</p>  <p>  The extension of GP care free at the point of service to everyone aged 70 or over and who does not currently qualify for this benefit will take effect at the same time as the under-6 service, subject to the enactment of the necessary legislation.  This service will benefit about 36,000 new patients.</p>  <p>  The Diabetes Cycle of Care will enable patients with a medical card or GP visit card and who have Type 2 Diabetes to avail of two annual visits to their GP practice for a structured review of their condition.  This initiative will help to integrate care across the continuum of care, will improve clinical outcomes for patients and reduce complications often experienced with this condition.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, the HSE's 2015 National Service Plan has committed to a number of Chronic Disease Management initiatives as follows:</p>  <p>- It is planning to align the existing 10 primary care diabetes initiatives to the Diabetes Model of Care with the support of the Clinical Programme and augment existing podiatry services to deliver the model of care.</p>  <p>- It is also planning to undertake Chronic Disease Integration and Self Care Demonstrator Projects to provide proof of concept of integrating chronic disease services for Asthma, COPD and heart failure between Primary and Secondary Care, with particular focus on the education of practice nurses and local GPs.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a Memorandum of Understanding signed in February 2015 committed the Department of Health, the HSE and the IMO to substantive negotiations on a new comprehensive GP contract.  A priority of these discussions, which have commenced, will be the inclusion of chronic disease management for patients over and above initiatives outlined above.</p></reply>

A further &euro;9 million of the deficit relates to the demand led areas of PCRS &amp;amp; Local Schemes.</p>  <p>  The early indications from Income &amp;amp; Expenditure data confirm the key financial risks are in demand led areas and acute hospitals.  Acute hospitals, in particular, will require very close management using the measures specified in the Accountability Framework as set out in the NSP.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, pressures in the Acute Sector and rising waiting times for placements under "Fair Deal" have been a cause for concern, and the Government has recently provided a further &euro;74 million to help alleviate ED overcrowding and pressures on the 'Fair Deal' scheme.  That being said, it is too early to give a view on the Supplementary Estimate requirement for Vote 38 in 2015.  The HSE is pro-actively engaged in internal efforts to maximise savings and cost containment plans and to ensure that additional measures are identified and safely implemented to mitigate any projected deficits which are within HSE direct control, while engaging on an ongoing basis with the Department of Health.</p></reply>

Harm reduction interventions, such as needle exchange services and methadone maintenance treatment, are an important component of the response to problem substance use as such interventions encourage problem substance users to engage with, and avail of, drug treatment services.</p>  <p>  The importance of promoting the recovery of people in treatment is recognised in the National Drugs Strategy.  Problem drug users have complex needs and may require multiple interventions from a range of agencies to assist them in their recovery.  The National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee, chaired by the HSE, is overseeing the roll out of a National Drugs Rehabilitation Framework.  The aim of the Framework is to provide a 'continuum of care' for the recovering drug user through promoting a more integrated and client-centred approach to rehabilitation, based on shared care planning.  The roll out of the Framework is currently being advanced through the HSE's Addiction Services and the Drug and Alcohol Task Forces. </p>  <p>  My Department is commencing work on the development of a new National Drugs Strategy for the period after 2016.  The process will involve a comprehensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public on the current national drugs policy and future priorities.  This will provide an opportunity to ensure that our strategic approach into the future continues to be firmly focused on recovery.  I have also asked my Department to examine the feasibility of utilising Social Impact Bonds as a funding model to improve both treatment and rehabilitation service outcomes.  The outcome of this work will inform decisions as to the viability of this approach to maximising the social benefits which the National Drugs Strategy seeks to achieve.</p></reply>

Nonetheless, surrogacy is being practiced here and Irish citizens are also availing of international surrogacy arrangements abroad. Assigning parentage to these children requires court involvement in the vast majority of cases.</p><p>On 17<sup>th</sup>February this year I received Government approval to draft a General Scheme of a comprehensive Bill, which will regulate all aspects of assisted human reproduction, including surrogacy. Surrogacy will be regulated for the first time, commercial surrogacy will be prohibited, however, the reimbursement of reasonable expenses will be permitted.</p><p>Numerous concerns have been raised in relation to commercial surrogacy, namely:</p><p>- the commodification of the surrogate&rsquo;s body and the resulting children; </p><p>- the welfare of the children; </p><p>- the potential for financial coercion and the risk of the exploitation of financially vulnerable women. </p><p>There are concerns that financially vulnerable women would not be fully informed of the possible physical and psychological health risks involved or that they might be willing to undergo risks that they would not otherwise for financial gain.</p><p>Following the completion of the draft General Scheme, I intend to submit the Scheme to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for pre-legislative scrutiny. In addition, my Department will conduct a widespread consultation on the draft General Scheme during which stakeholders and members of the public will be invited to share their views.</p><p>It is my intention that any legislation in this area protects, promotes and ensures the health and safety of parents, others involved in the process (such as donors and surrogate mothers) and, most importantly, the children who will be born as a result of assisted human reproduction. Given the concerns that I have outlined above, permitting commercial surrogacy would not be in keeping with these underlying principles.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 70,000 rent supplement recipients, for which Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015.</p><p>The Department recently published a review of the maximum rent limits, &quot;Maximum Rent Limit Analysis and Findings&quot; and it is available on <i>www.welfare.ie</i>.  The review finds that increasing rent limits at this time could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not alone rent supplement recipients, but lower-income workers and students.  Between the rent supplement scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market.  The State is therefore a very significant player in the sector which has a responsibility not alone to rent supplement recipients but also to the market as a whole, including all those in private accommodation.</p><p>In light of the review&rsquo;s findings, the Department will instead continue to allow for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework.  Under this approach, each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents can be increased above prescribed limits if deemed appropriate.  In excess of 1,000 rent supplement recipients have received support through increased rent limits to date in order to retain their rented accommodation.</p><p>In addition, the Department in conjunction with Threshold operates a Tenancy Sustainment Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply is most acute.  The primary objective of the Protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance. </p><p>The review clearly points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting or seeking to rent at this time is the much reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation.  The issue of supply is being addressed by Government through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy. </p><p>I am keeping this matter under close review to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided for rent supplement recipients.</p></reply>

With effect from April 2012, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State Pension (contributory) increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions. This provision was provided for a number of years earlier in the Social Welfare Act, 1997.  </p>  <p>  The rate at which a State Pension (Contributory) is paid at is determined by the average number of contributions paid or credited per year, with tiered rates applying in respect of bands of contributions.  For example, to qualify for the maximum personal rate, a person requires a yearly average of 48 or more contributions per year.  From September 2012, new rate bands for State Pension (Contributory) were introduced.  This resulted in one of bands (in respect of those with a yearly average of 20-47 contributions), being replaced with three bands (in respect of yearly averages of 40-47, 30-39, and 20-29 respectively).  These additional bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.</p>  <p>  Those with lower earnings and those with lesser contribution histories continue to obtain the best value for money from the Social Insurance Fund.  Even for those with an average of only 20 contributions per year (i.e. 38% of the maximum), the reduced rate State Pension (Contributory) of &euro;196 now paid is 85% of the maximum rate, and is higher than the full rate that applied in 2007.</p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a full rate State Pension (Contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State Pension (Non-Contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;219, or just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, if a person&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State Pension (Contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just less than 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State Pension (Contributory).</p></reply>

It will give financial support to people with children who were getting jobseeker and one-parent family payments and who take up employment, increase their hours of employment or become self-employed.</p>  <p>  The BTWFD provides support for up to two years after a person moves from social welfare into employment. If a person qualifies for the dividend they will get a weekly payment equivalent of any increases for qualified children that were being paid on their jobseeker or one-parent family payment, up to a maximum of four children, for the first year in employment.  Half that amount will be paid weekly for their second year in employment.  Where payable the dividend will be additional to any entitlement the family may have under the family income supplement (FIS) scheme.</p>  <p>  The BTWFD scheme will commence when the necessary legislation, to be advanced under the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015, is in place.  However applications are currently being accepted.  These will be processed following the progression of the legislation and all eligible claims will be backdated to their date of application.  This means that eligible applicants from the 5th of January, 2015 to the date of commencement of the scheme will receive arrears of BTWFD and their 2 year period of entitlement, subject to scheme criteria, will run from their date of application.</p>  <p>  While it was originally envisaged that the Bill would be enacted during April, 2015, it is now due to be enacted in early May, 2015.  Eligible applicants, who will be in employment or self-employment, will still get their full entitlement under the scheme.</p></reply>

Employers may also be eligible for the incentive if they recruit former recipients of the one parent family payment whose youngest child is 14 years of age or over who are currently in receipt of a jobseekers' payment and those transitioning into employment.  The incentive provides employers with two levels of payment - &euro;7,500 or &euro;10,000 over two years - paid in monthly instalments provided the employment is maintained.</p>  <p>  In line with the policy objectives set out in Pathways to Work and the Action Plan for Jobs, the objective of JobsPlus is to encourage employers to focus their recruitment on those that are longer term unemployed.  A person in receipt of a one parent family payment is not considered eligible.  There are no proposals to extend the criteria further.</p></reply>

Moreover, Permanent TSB will operate &quot;market opening measures&quot; to facilitate the market entry of competitors, comprising a &quot;services package&quot; and a &quot;customer mobility package&quot;.</p><p>Permanent TSB has published details of the key elements of the plan on it's website at .</p><p>The European Commission will publish their full decsision on their website in due course and my officials will advise you when this has occurred.</p><p>While the Restructuring Plan requires that Permanent TSB's cost to income ratio and annual operating expenses should not exceed pre-determined limits it should be noted that compliance with these commitments, and any actions required to meet them, is a matter for the Board and Management of Permanent TSB, who are responsible for the day to day management of the Group.</p><p>In relation to Irish mortgage loans, Permanent TSB has committed to reduce the value of defaulted Irish Tracker mortgages through a combination of measures, including cures and asset sales by a pre-determined date and according to a pre-determined schedule. I am advised by Permanent TSB that it is their clear preference that such a reduction would be achieved by way of completed treatments in order to cure the defaulted loans rather than other means.  Such an objective provides the best outcome for affected customers.  If the target cannot be met through such an approach or by other means, then Permanent TSB would be required by the Restructuring Plan to sell such loans within the pre-determined timelines.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2015 was published in January and second stage of the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il on 4 February. Since then, my officials have been in contact with the Central Bank and with the Office of the Attorney General to further progress the legislation.</p><p>It remains my intention to ensure that borrowers whose loans are sold by a regulated entity to a currently unregulated entity maintain the same protections as they had prior to the sale. The Bill will continue its progress through the legislative process and I look forward to further discussion of the Bill at Committee Stage.</p><p>The legislation is not retrospective. However, it will apply to all loans as defined, regardless of when they were acquired, thus capturing loan books that have already been sold. A similar approach was used in 2013 in relation to debt management firms.</p></reply>

The proportionate limits mean that lenders will be able to make decisions based on an individual borrower's circumstances up to a specific limit.

The reason for the delay in the initiative coming into effect was related to EU State Aid approval. A number of amendments were made to the Living City Initiative in Finance Act 2014. In particular, the Act incorporated new limits on the amount of qualifying expenditure on which relief can be claimed in relation to the conversion or refurbishment of certain commercial premises. The purpose of the amendments was to bring the LCI within the de minimis levels of State Aid. As such, we are now in the advanced stage of discussions with Limerick, Waterford, Dublin, Galway, Kilkenny and Cork City Councils and the Revenue Commissioners in order to finalise the eligible areas for relief under the Living City Initiative ("Special Regeneration Area" as defined in Section 372AAA Taxes Consolidation Act ("TCA") 1997) and to operationalise the relief. An order will be made to designate the Special Regeneration Areas and a Commencement Order will need to be made to bring the relief into operation. Work on this Initiative is at a very advanced stage and we intend to launch the Initiative soon.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to make any changes to the criteria to qualify for the Living City Initiative but of course, the Initiative will remain subject to review following its implementation.</p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or to the mortgage interest rates charged.  It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.  It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed mortgage position of mortgage holders.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review and has been the subject of recent correspondence between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. The current position is that the Central Bank does not have new proposals for the additional regulation of interest rates.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. </p>  <p>  As I have stated in previous Parliamentary Questions, a former Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November stated that in Ireland, as in most advanced economies, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis. Such control would strongly discourage new entrants when, in fact, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services. In this regard, there have been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may be entering a new and more competitive phase. </p>  <p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. Each institution determines the rate it charges its customers, depending on a number of factors such as cost of funds and commercial considerations (such as competition, risk pricing and the impact on deposit rates).</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act) 2013 introduced changes to Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which regulates fees and charges in order to attract new entrants to the Irish banking sector. There is some evidence of improvements in the banking sector with a number of institutions introducing new products and adapting their business model.  In the last 12 months there have been a number of new entrants to the Irish mortgage market bringing additional and welcome competition to this sector.</p>  <p>  I should add that myself and the Governor of the Central Bank meet regularly, the latest of these meetings took place on 2 April. Among the items discussed was the issue of mortgage interest rates.  The Governor provided an update on the ongoing work that he and his officials are carrying out on the issue of the standard variable rates charged by the lenders.</p>  <p>  We noted that the SVRs charged in Ireland are higher than other euro area countries and have not fallen in line with ECB wholesale rates. The Central Bank will continue to research why this is the case and will publish results shortly.  The Governor will update me on progress in due course.</p></reply>

The regime provides for new powers to be exercised by the Central Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has published non-statutory guidance to assist regulated financial service providers in complying with their obligations under Section 21 of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 in relation to the Fitness and Probity Standards.  The guidance outlines the steps which the Central Bank expects regulated financial service providers to take in order to satisfy themselves on reasonable grounds that individuals performing controlled functions, including pre-approval controlled functions, are in compliance with the Fitness and Probity Standards. </p>  <p>  The operation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism now provides that the task of assessing the fitness and probity of key individuals is shared with the European Central Bank in respect of all significant credit institutions including all of our main banks.  </p>  <p>  There are no current proposals from the Central Bank or the SSM for a Presumption of Responsibility provision.  However, taking account of the conclusions that emerge from the Banking Inquiry my Department will review any issues arising in respect of the overall regulatory framework.  </p>  <p>  For the Deputy's information, the UK Banking Reform Act 2013 replaced the Approved Persons Regime for banks, building societies and credit unions with a new regulatory framework for individuals.  The new framework comprises two regimes, a 'Senior Managers Regime' and a 'Certification Regime', which aim to encourage individuals to take greater responsibility for their actions and make it easier for both firms and the regulators to hold individuals to account.</p>  <p>  The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has also announced that it is consulting on further, more detailed guidance on how the FCA will apply the Presumption of Responsibility.  Under the Presumption of Responsibility, when a relevant/authorised firm contravenes a relevant requirement then the Senior Manager with responsibility for the management of any of the firm's activities in relation to which the contravention occurred is guilty of misconduct, unless they satisfy the relevant regulator that they took such steps as a person in their position could reasonably be expected to take to avoid the contravention occurring or continuing. The proposed guidance sets out the circumstances in which the FCA would seek to apply the presumption of responsibility; how the FCA would apply it and the steps that a Senior Manager should take in order to rebut the presumption of responsibility.</p></reply>

The operational framework for the DRI, approved on the same date, includes a specific provision in relation to the retroactive application of the instrument.  The guideline states that the potential application of the instrument for this purpose should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.  </p>  <p>  However, unlike back in 2012, the ESM is no longer the only option open to us to recover the money provided to recapitalise our banks.  Investors are now willing to support Irish banks again and the market value of our investments has improved accordingly. My overall objective in relation to the State's investment in the banks is to maximise the return to the Irish taxpayer over time. </p>  <p>  In line with this objective my Department is working with AIB, the institution where &euro;20.8 billion has been invested, on reconfiguring the capital structure.  I have also appointed Goldman Sachs International to provide financial advice. The focus will be on ensuring that the best decisions are made regarding potential capital restructuring options and sequencing in order to maximise the return of cash to the State from our AIB investments over time. While this is just the start of the process, it is an essential first step on the road to recovering value for the taxpayer.

Given the banking experience of the person referred to in the question it was decided that he would be seconded to IBRC to explore opportunities for deleveraging with a view to maximising the recovery for the taxpayer. This had the additional benefit of providing greater oversight while supporting the management team. </p>  <p>  The responsibilities of the person referred to in the question included:</p>  <p>  - Membership of the Bank's Group Executive Committee (GEXCO);</p>  <p>  - Membership of the Transaction Review Committee;</p>  <p>  - Contribute to the strategic leadership of the Bank;</p>  <p>  - Analyse existing investments within the portfolio, critically assess business plans, operations, management, processes, risks, and opportunities;</p>  <p>  - Structure/restructure loans/investments from an optimal financial perspective, negotiate the structure and preferred terms;</p>  <p>  - Identifying and developing deal opportunities with external investors and financiers that meet the various strategic and financial objectives of the Bank in wind down;</p>  <p>  - Build and maintain dialogue with potential investors and counter-parties to establish market opportunities and viable transaction options that assist the Bank meeting its wind down objectives;</p>  <p>  - Engagement will be across private equity funds, credit opportunity funds, real estate funds and sovereign wealth funds as well as banks and other providers of credit in the European markets;</p>  <p>  - Work with asset recovery teams;</p>  <p>  - Appoint brokers/advisors in accordance with the Bank's procurement and compliance policy;</p>  <p>  - Team management, and;</p>  <p>  - Lead the execution of transactions and engage with counter parties while involving internal group functional groups as well as external service providers.</p>  <p>  In relation to the transaction involving the sale of the company referred to in the question, as the deputy is aware, it was after officials in my Department received critical representations following the transaction involving the sale of the company referred to in the question that it was decided that Department of Finance officials would review the transaction in greater detail to better understand the decisions taken and the impact these decisions had on the process and the final recovery for the bank. </p>  <p>  At a meeting which I attended along with officials from my Department on 25 July 2012, senior management of IBRC assured me that the transaction involving the sale of the company referred to in the question had been thoroughly assessed by the IBRC Board and that the transaction was managed in the best manner possible to achieve the best result for the State. </p>  <p>  Neither I nor officials from my Department reviewed all of the transactions undertaken at IBRC; as the Deputy is aware, a Relationship Framework dated 8 July 2009 was in place at the time the Board of IBRC approved the sale of the company referred to in the question. Under this Relationship Framework, the Board of IBRC were required to engage with the Minister for Finance on certain key issues which included "any material acquisitions, disposals, investments, realisations or other transactions, other than in the ordinary course of Anglo Irish Bank's banking business." It should be noted that this Relationship Framework did not include any specific monetary thresholds which would trigger mandatory consultation with the Minister for Finance. It should also be noted, that at that time, the ordinary course of the Bank's business was to conduct an orderly run-down and ultimate liquidation of the Bank. </p>  <p>  The revised Relationship Framework and Operational Protocol which was put in place on 29 March 2012 contained specific financial thresholds which would, from that date on, trigger mandatory consultation with the Minister for Finance for qualifying transactions. Again, any transactions outside these financial thresholds were deemed within the ordinary course of the Bank's business and it was not required that I or officials in my Department were made aware of them.</p></reply>

Action against this illegal activity is, therefore, a priority for them, and they are implementing a wide-ranging programme of measures to tackle the problem. Key elements of this programme include the following.</p>  <p>  - A strengthened licensing regime for auto fuel traders was introduced with effect from September 2011, to limit the ability of fuel criminals to place laundered fuel on the market.</p>  <p>  - A new licensing regime for marked fuel traders was introduced in October 2012, to limit the scope for criminals to source marked fuel for laundering.</p>  <p>  - New requirements for the keeping by fuel traders of records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were brought in to ensure that data would be available to support supply chain analysis.</p>  <p>  - Following a significant investment in the necessary IT systems, new supply chain controls were initiated from January 2013. These require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns of their fuel transactions to Revenue, providing data that can be used to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions or patterns of fuel distribution. </p>  <p>  - Close cooperation, in the framework of the Cross Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, with other enforcement authorities in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland, in combating the fuel fraud problem on an all-island basis.</p>  <p>  - The introduction from the start of this month of a new and more effective product for marking rebated fuels that was identified as a result of a joint process conducted with HM Revenue and Customs in the UK.  In addition, I have introduced a range of legislative measures in recent years to support Revenue in their work against fuel fraud, including reckless trading provisions that ensure that a mineral oil trader is liable for the mineral oil tax evaded where that trader knew, or was reckless as to whether or not, in making the supply or delivery of fuel, he or she was participating in a transaction or series of transactions connected to the evasion of that tax. In the Finance Act 2014, I introduced measures to further strengthen Revenue's ability to refuse or revoke a mineral oil trader's licence where the trader does nor comply with excise law, does not maintain adequate stock management systems and records, or provides false or misleading information.  Revenue's ongoing action against fuel fraud has yielded significant results. Since mid-2011, 136 filling stations were closed for breaches of licensing conditions or for unlicensed trading, over 3 million litres of fuel have been seized and 31 oil laundries were detected and closed down. Industry sources report a much-reduced incidence of laundered fuel on the market and increased road diesel consumption. Obviously other economic factors have contributed to this growth but reduced fraud is also an important factor.  I am advised also that the Revenue Commissioners have, since last summer, received reports from around the country of problems relating to petrol quality, and suggestions that these problems are attributable to petrol stretching. Petrol stretching involves the illegal addition of a low-tax commodity to petrol, and the motive of the criminals who engage in this activity is to profit from the sale of the adulterated petrol, thereby defrauding motorists and the State.  Every filling station about which a complaint was made has been visited by Revenue enforcement officers and fuel samples taken from them have been sent to the State Laboratory for analysis. The scientific analysis required is complex and time-consuming, and the State laboratory has conducted an extensive series of tests and re-tests on the samples. Despite this extensive testing, evidence of the presence of prohibited stretching agents has been found in only two samples, both from one location. The conclusive results received from those tests led to the seizure of the product, and files are being prepared with a view to prosecution.  Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results were received which indicated the presence of road diesel in several samples from a variety of locations. This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time. If the problems that have come to light were caused by unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed with petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved. However, the Revenue Commissioners are investigating the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems. In any instance where the analysis of samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take swift and robust action and pursue prosecutions against alleged offenders where possible.  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners  are undertaking a wide-ranging and effective programme of action against all forms of fuel fraud and am assured that combating this illegal activity will continue to be a key priority for them. </p></reply>

Given the significant yield each year, PRD is a critical component of the public service pay and pension measures adopted as part of our national fiscal consolidation.  However it should be noted that a start has already been made on ameliorating the impact of PRD on public servants. As legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, and as provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement, the rate of PRD on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 band of pay received in a year fell from 5% to 2.5% on 1 January 2014. This cut is worth &euro;125 annually in gross terms to most public servants, with those taxed at the standard rate enjoying the greater gain in terms of take-home pay boost.</p></reply>

The 9th round is scheduled to take place in Washington from 20th-24th April 2015.  It is hoped that there will be substantial progress in the TTIP negotiations in 2015.   </p>  <p>  According to assessments made by the EU Commission and other European bodies, a comprehensive TTIP could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum bringing significant economic gains as a whole for the EU.  This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU.  </p>  <p>  A study commissioned by my Department estimates that the benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  It suggests growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1% and increase in real wages of 1.5%.  It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs.  It also suggests that Irish small and medium enterprises (SMEs) will be particular beneficiaries.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s interests in these negotiations will be guided by the indications from the study.  Our priorities include advancing in regulatory cooperation and common rules which aim to make trade and investment easier especially for SMEs, and protecting our interests in any sensitive areas, including beef.  </p>  <p>  Ireland supports the Commission in these negotiations which aim to achieve an ambitious and comprehensive agreement contributing to growth and jobs in Ireland and the EU.  We will seek to maximise any potential benefits for our economy and our citizens throughout the negotiation period.</p></reply>

A key element in military life is the need for personnel to maintain a level of fitness for combat readiness. This requirement must be balanced with the need to retain experience and expertise, particularly at managerial level in the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  The upper age limit for enlistment in the Army and Air Corps is under 25 years of age on the closing date for receipt of applications for enlistment, and for the Naval Service it is under 27 years of age on the closing date for receipt of applications for enlistment. The upper age limit for all Cadetships is under 28 years of age on the closing date for receipt of applications. These limits are determined on the basis that the essential functions of the Permanent Defence Force requires that its members be composed of able-bodied personnel of an age which is commensurate with the functional requirements of the organisation as a whole. </p>  <p>  The Military Authorities have advised that these upper age limits have proven suitable for the requirem ents for a modern Defence Force which is actively involved in operations at home and on Peace Support Operations overseas.    Other countries pursue a Defence policy that reflects their particular requirements and structure their Defence Forces accordingly. Some forces also operate different age profiles depending on particular roles involved. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the existing upper age requirements for recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force are appropriate and  I do not propose to comment on the recruitment policies of other States who may operate different requirements.</p></reply>

The qualifying service for officers and members of the Chaplaincy Service and Army Nursing Service is 5,475 days satisfactory and continuous service. The qualifying service for NCOs and Privates is 3,650 days satisfactory and continuous service.&ldquo;The Service Medal (Reserve Defence Force)&rdquo; (formerly known as The Service Medal FCA and An Slua Muir&iacute;) was introduced in 1961 for members and former members of the Reserve and is awarded after 7 years of service. </p><p>The award of either of these medals to qualifying personnel reflects the service given by those personnel to either the Permanent Defence Force or the Reserve Defence Force as the case may be, and by extension the wider public, during the periods for which they served.

As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland has a dualist legal system and therefore does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by them, including the amendment of domestic law as necessary.</p>  <p>  A team has been charged with examining all outstanding obstacles to ratification, and has nearly completed the first phase of its work, which includes identifying all areas which will need attention to make ratification possible. An Interdepartmental Committee is in place to review issues and the actions and timeframe required to tackle them. Many of these issues involve amending unsuitable and outmoded language and in some cases, archaic legal provisions, in existing legislation. Another key task which is underway involves examining how the important issue of Reasonable Accommodation can be achieved in a meaningful way within our Constitutional framework as interpreted by the Supreme Court. </p>  <p>  Progress towards ratification therefore continues to be made. One of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed is the enactment of capacity legislation. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, published on 17 July 2013, provides a series of options to support people with impaired capacity to make decisions and exercise their basic rights in line with the principles of the UN Convention. It undertakes a comprehensive reform of existing legislation governing capacity. The Bill is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il. </p>  <p>  In relation to the advice of the  the National Disability Authority, I should explain that the Authority was asked by the the Interdepartmental Committee to commission an analysis of Irish domestic law in the context of the requirements of the Convention. This report was not intended for publication, but rather as a resource to inform and assist the work of the Interdepartmental Committee and I do not intend to publish it at this time.  As the Deputy will be aware, as a matter of course the legal advice of the Attorney General is not published.</p>  <p>  However, when the Government has approved the roadmap, outlining the measures to be taken to overcome the legislative barriers to ratification, the roadmap - which will contain a definitive statement of the legislative amendments required to allow ratification - will be published by my Department.</p></reply>

The meeting was a positive engagement, with preliminary discussions on future service needs.</p>  <p>  It was acknowledged that the population of adults with Cystic Fibrosis served by Beaumont Hospital has more than doubled since service provision commenced.  A dedicated CF Outpatient facility facilitates a comprehensive range of multidisciplinary services for approximately 150 patients.  The consultation and treatment rooms have specialist air filtration rooms to assist with infection control.  Seven single in-patient rooms are reserved for  elective CF admissions for prophylactic antibiotic therapy (or other treatment as required), thus ensuring that adults with CF are rarely admitted as in-patients via the Emergency Department.  However in the longer term, demographic factors, coupled with the increase in patient longevity resulting from improved treatment and pharmaceuticals, will increase service provision requirements further.  As a result, it is estimated that a future requirement will arise for up to 20 in-patient beds.</p>  <p>  Beaumont Hospital and the HSE are engaging in relation to the overall infrastructural requirements to best meet growing service demands.  An initial business case for the future development of additional CF services at Beaumont Hospital has been submitted by the CEO of the hospital to the RCSI Hospital Group Chief Executive and is under review.  The views and ideas exchanged between my officials, hospital staff and patient advocates will inform the further development of this business case.</p></reply>

Under the Scheme, nursing home residents contribute towards the cost of their nursing home care based on their means, and the HSE pays the balance. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2015 &euro;948.8m was provided for the NHSS which included an additional &euro;10m which formed part of the Delayed Discharges Initiative. However, throughout this year hospitals have experienced increased overcrowding in Emergency Departments and increased numbers of patients whose discharge from hospital has been delayed.  At the beginning of April 2015 it was announced that an additional &euro;74m has been allocated to address the issue that has arisen. The &euro;74m now provided will consolidate and build on what has already been achieved. &euro;44m of this &euro;74m was provided to the NHSS to fund 1,600 more places under the Scheme. This brings the total budget for the NHSS for 2015 to &euro;993m. </p>  <p>  The additional &euro;44m has helped to reduce the number of people on the national placement list awaiting funding from 1,426 at the end of March 2015 to 503 people as of the 9 of April 2015 (latest figures available). The length of time spent on the national placement list has also reduced significantly from 11 weeks to 4 weeks currently. At the end of February 2015 (latest figures available), 22,231 people were supported under the Scheme.</p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years. This exercise is broader than was first envisaged but work on the Review is in its final stages and is expected to be completed shortly. No decisions have been taken nor plans in places regarding changes to the contributions required from residents.</p></reply>

It reported that none of the Public Access Defibrillation programmes evaluated would be considered cost-effective using conventional willingness to pay thresholds.</p>  <p>  One of the means to help improve health outcomes in this area is through the expansion of the National First Response Network.  Community first responder groups comprise this national network.  These are people from local communities who are trained in basic life support and the use of defibrillators that attend a potentially life threatening emergency in their area.  They are then able to provide an early intervention in situations such as heart attack or cardiac arrest by providing, among other things, resuscitation and defibrillation.</p>  <p>  Cardiac First Responders (CFR) Ireland, which I recently launched, is the national umbrella organisation for Community First Responders Groups. CFR Ireland is supported by the National Ambulance Service, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council and the Centre for Emergency Medical Science UCD.  Each group is linked to the National Ambulance Service control and despatch system, and so if there is a cardiac 999 call in an area, the on-duty CFR member gets a text from the National Ambulance Service at the same time that an ambulance is despatched with location, call details.  The First Responder then goes straight to the site and administers initial care (defibrillation if required) until the National Ambulance Service and Rapid Response vehicles arrives.</p>  <p>  This national initiative provides an opportunity to extend care for cardiac events.  The prospect for a pilot on defibrillator availability in a small local area will also be explored.</p></reply>

The first phase will be for all children aged under 6 years.  This service will commence during the summer. In parallel with this, the second phase will extend universal GP care without fees to all persons aged 70 years and over, subject to the passing of the necessary legislation.  These measures represent a major step on the way to universal health care.  By this summer, approximately 800,000 people in Ireland will benefit from universal access to GP services.</p>  <p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme.  The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population.  The principles of universality and equity of access mean that all residents in Ireland should be entitled to access a GP service.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy has indicated, children under 6 will benefit from a new enhanced service under the proposed GP contract.  This will involve age-based preventive checks focused on health and wellbeing and the prevention of disease.  The contract will also cover an agreed cycle of care for children diagnosed with asthma.  The costs of the enhanced GP service for all children under 6 years of age will be approximately &euro;67 million.</p>  <p>  The additional cost of providing a universal GP service to the entire population was previously estimated on the basis of the existing scope of the service, rates of payments to GPs and eligibility.  In the absence of specific changes to the scope and content of the GP service, the relevant fee structure or the eligibility rates, it would not be possible for an additional exercise to yield a more valid estimate in respect of the remainder of the population at this point in time.</p></reply>

Persons over 70 can be assessed under the over-70s gross income arrangements.  In addition, persons aged over 70 years can be assessed under the standard medical card means test which is open to persons irrespective of their age.  Furthermore, persons, including those aged over 70 years, may be eligible for a medical card where discretion is exercised where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.</p>  <p>  However, in parallel with the introduction of the under-6 GP service without fees which will commence during the summer, a GP service without fees will be provided for all persons aged 70 years and over.  The Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill 2015, which was published on 25 March 2015, will provide the statutory basis for the over-70s universal GP service.  The new over-70s GP service will benefit approximately 36,000 people who currently pay to attend a GP as they are not covered by a medical card or a GP visit card.</p></reply>

As a result, draft Misuse of Drugs amendment Regulations were prepared and made available for further consultation on my Department's website in August 2013.  Over 90 submissions from a wide range of organisations were received, some proposing legislative reform of a technical and complex nature.  </p><p>Issues raised included whether criminalising persons for the possession of small amounts of benzodiazepines is an effective response to the problem of abuse; striking a balance between proper oversight and minimising the disruption for patients; agreeing changes to the proforma prescription to be used for schedule 2, 3 and 4 part 1 controlled drugs; and addressing differences of opinion regarding the maximum duration of a benzodiazepine prescription and the total treatment period/total quantity which may be dispensed.</p><p>Amendments to the Regulations were introduced in July and December 2014 to make provision for a number of issues which had been part of the consultation, including enabling authorised cannabis-based medicinal products to be used in Ireland. </p><p>While work continued on the remaining issues, including stricter controls on benzodiazepines, from the end of 2013 onwards, Departmental resources had to be reallocated to defending a constitutional challenge to section 2 (2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 under which Government may declare substances to be controlled, as well as making preparations for the introduction of emergency legislation in case this provision should be struck down.  Following a Court of Appeal decision on 10 March which found section 2(2) unconstitutional, the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015 was urgently enacted to recontrol all substances which had previously been declared controlled by Government order, thereby restoring the <i>status quo ante</i>.</p><p>On foot of advice from the Attorney General, the 2015 Act also reconfirmed existing Ministerial regulations and orders made under the 1977 Act.  These regulations and orders may now only be amended by primary legislation.  Work is underway on drafting a second Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill to amend section 2(2) and other sections of the 1977 Act.  I expect to publish this legislation in the coming months with the intention of having it enacted later this year.  I intend to bring forward appropriate controls on benzodiazepines and z-drugs after this second Bill is enacted. These regulations will be subject to the 3-month EU notification period under the Technical Standards Directive.</p></reply>

A continuum of more efficient care might serve to reduce the number of people requiring nursing home care and limit the projected increase in the cost of the Scheme.

'Future Health' commits to a move away from the current hospital-centric model of care towards a new model of integrated care which treats patients at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient, and as close to home as possible.  This will help to reduce costs, improve access and move from the existing emphasis on episodic reactive care towards preventative, planned and well co-ordinated care.  This is particularly important for the growing numbers of people with chronic conditions and those with two or more diseases and disorders.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

In exercise of its functions, the independent regulator monitors the health insurance market including compliance by the health insurers with the legislative rules and regulations governing the market, particularly in relation to community rating.  In doing so, the Authority ensures that the market is regulated appropriately and that insurers are discouraged from engaging in practices, or offering health insurance contracts, which undermine community rating or the principal objective of the Health Insurance Acts.     </p>  <p>  With regard to the specific issue of costs, I introduced a suite of measures to address rising health insurance premiums and stabilise the private health insurance market in the interests of consumers.  These include a reduction in the Risk Equalisation Stamp Duty Levy, special lower premiums for young adults, the introduction of Lifetime Community Rating, and a reduction in the Health Insurance Authority Levy.  The package also includes key recommendations set out in the two Pat McLoughlin reports on Private Health Insurance costs, and builds on Budget 2015 which included a freeze on hospital bed charges and no decrease in the relievable amount on health insurance premiums for tax relief purposes. </p>  <p>  Taken together, these measures are intended to create a sustainable market where health insurance is as affordable for as many people as possible and to create the best possible environment within which more people, particularly young people, will want to obtain and retain private health insurance, thereby reducing the necessity for premium inflation across the market.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable.  It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need.  Patients with the greatest level of need, i.e. Grade 5 or some with a Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE. </p>  <p>  The HSE has established a pilot scheme in Dublin North East which will involve the use of orthodontic therapists in the treatment of a number of eligible children.  Consideration will be given to expanding this Scheme to other HSE areas in the future.  In addition to the services provided by HSE staff, orthodontic treatment for certain categories of misalignment will be provided by a panel of independent practitioners under contract to the HSE over the next three years.  A national procurement process is being finalised. This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for 4 years or longer.  It is expected that this initiative will commence later this year and will have a positive impact on waiting times.</p></reply>

These data are used by the HPO to set prices for the Activity Based Funding (ABF) system which is in the process of being implemented in public hospitals.  </p>  <p>  ABF represents a major change in the way hospitals are funded and will result in a new level of focus on hospital costs.  The new funding model involves moving away from inefficient block grant budgets to a new system where hospitals are paid for the actual level of activity undertaken.  Under ABF, the prices to be paid to hospitals will be set by reference to the average cost of treatment across all public hospitals.  By setting prices based on average costs, hospitals will be incentivised to better understand their cost-base and improve efficiency.</p>  <p>  Patient Level Costing and Business Intelligence systems are also being rolled out across the hospital system to support implementation of ABF.  The introduction of these systems will allow hospitals to interrogate their cost data in greater detail than was possible in the past and will also allow hospitals to compare their costs with peer hospitals. This will facilitate greater engagement by doctors with their own data, support improvements in the quality of patient care and help to drive efficiency.   </p>  <p>  Data relating to the cost of private hospitals are not collected or verified by my Department or the HSE/HPO.

The first phase will be for all children aged under 6 years. This service will commence during the summer.  In parallel with this, the second phase will extend universal GP care without fees to all persons aged 70 years and over, subject to the passing of the necessary legislation.  These measures represent a major step on the way to universal health care.  By this summer, approximately 800,000 people in Ireland will benefit from universal access to GP services.  </p>  <p>  Agreement has been reached between the Department of Health, the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation on terms for the delivery of GP care without fees for all children aged under 6.  This agreement represents the first step in the phased introduction of a universal GP service without fees.  Under the new arrangements, an additional 270,000 children under 6 will benefit from GP care free at the point of service.  This service will commence during the summer.  This will be preceded by a public information campaign and simple on-line arrangements for parents or guardians to register their children for the service.</p>  <p>  All children under 6 will benefit from the new enhanced service under the proposed GP contract.  This will involve age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and the prevention of disease.  These assessments will be carried out when a child is aged 2 and again at age 5.  The contract will also cover an agreed cycle of care for children diagnosed with asthma, under which GPs will carry out an annual review of each child where the doctor has diagnosed asthma.</p>  <p>  In parallel with this, GP care without fees will be extended to all persons aged 70 years and over, subject to the passing of the necessary legislation.  The Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill 2015, which was published on 25 March 2015, will provide the statutory basis for the over-70s universal GP service.  This service will benefit about 36,000 people and will be provided under the existing GMS contract.</p></reply>

In this context, the implementation of the recommendations of the 2014 Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structure is a priority for me as Minister for Health. </p>  <p>  The Strategic Review, chaired by Prof. Brian MacCraith, President, DCU, made 25 recommendations addressing a range of barriers and issues relating to the recruitment and retention of doctors in the Irish health system, including medical career opportunities, working conditions, and flexible working for trainees and specialists alike.  The Review also addressed the need to improve career planning and enhance mentoring/training supports for trainee doctors.</p>  <p>  I recently received the first progress report on the implementation of the recommendations, and am pleased to note that there has been a range of developments which will, I believe, help us recruit and retain doctors &ndash; including newly qualified doctors &ndash; in our health system. </p>  <p>  On foot of the Strategic Review Group&rsquo;s recommendations regarding consultant career structures, associated LRC proposals for increased pay for new Consultants were recently supported by IMO members and are being implemented by the HSE.  </p>  <p>  To support implementation of the recommendations of the Strategic Review Group, my Department has established a Monitoring Group, comprising key stakeholders including trainee doctors.

As the Deputy is aware, there are serious grounds for concern regarding the human rights situation in Colombia, including in the context of labour disputes, land rights, and the ongoing state of armed conflict in that country. </p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Bogota on a non-residential basis, is in regular contact on human rights issues with the Colombian authorities, with civil society, and with the EU delegation there.</p>  <p>  The promotion and protection of human rights is a core principle of Ireland's foreign policy and we have prioritised the protection of trade unionists, human rights defenders, and others who are in immediate danger.  Ireland engages on human rights issues with the Colombian Government in our direct contacts with them, by means of the EU-Colombia Human Rights Dialogue, and through United Nations processes.  Human rights are also an essential part of the EU Free Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru which, in addition, contains important provisions in the area of labour rights and protection of the environment.</p>  <p>  As the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia has pointed out, an end to the longstanding armed conflict - now under negotiation between the government and the guerrillas in the context of the peace talks in Havana - has the potential to transform Colombia in terms of its level of respect for and enjoyment of human rights.  In so far as the role of the Colombian Government is concerned, I continue to believe that our policy of engagement and dialogue is the best means for advancing human rights.</p></reply>

The recent meeting between the Presidents at the Summit of the Americas has been described as positive, and the White House has since announced President Obama&rsquo;s intention to remove Cuba from the US list of States that sponsor terrorism.  Ireland's concerns about the US economic, commercial and financial measures against Cuba are long-standing and clear.  Ireland and the other member states of the European Union are firmly of the view that the lifting of the embargo would facilitate an opening of the island's economy to the benefit of its people.  In addition, we and our EU partners do not believe that the continued embargo contributes in a positive way to the democratic transition in Cuba.  We have expressed this position in our support for the relevant resolutions at the UN General Assembly, most recently on 28 October last year.  We have recorded also our strong opposition to the extraterritorial application of the legislation giving effect to the embargo.   The US embargo against Cuba is codified in legislation passed by Congress.  President Obama has indicated his willingness to engage with Congress in an honest and serious debate about lifting the embargo, which we welcome.</p>  <p>  The recent UN debate recorded continued concerns and criticisms regarding governance and human rights in Cuba.  It was noted that while the US embargo has a damaging effect on the Cuban economy, domestic Cuban economic policy seriously hampers its own economic development.  Together with our EU partners we have urged that the package of economic and social reforms adopted by the Cuban Parliament in August 2011 be extended and implemented in a manner that will address the key concerns of the Cuban population.</p></reply>

His case is currently before the Courts in Egypt &ndash; as matters stand he has not been convicted of any crime.  I, and officials in my Department including our Embassy in Cairo, have raised this case with the Egyptian authorities on many occasions.  The individual's trial has started, with the next hearing scheduled for 26 April.  The Irish Government has formally supported applications by this individual&rsquo;s lawyers for his release.  I have spoken personally to my Egyptian counterpart on a number of occasions, including as recently as 2 April, to underline our support for this citizen&rsquo;s release and to highlight key humanitarian concerns.</p>  <p>  In advance of the last hearing, reports were circulated that this individual was being tortured and was being kept in a &lsquo;death penalty cell&rsquo;.  As soon as possible after these reports were received, our Ambassador in Cairo herself undertook a consular visit.  Following discussions with the individual, during which he could speak freely, the Ambassador established that the citizen was neither being tortured nor housed in a death penalty cell, nor was he sharing a cell with prisoners who had been sentenced to death.  In addition to being inaccurate, such reports were unlikely to have been helpful to this citizen&rsquo;s best interests.</p>  <p>  We keep all aspects of this case, including the Department&rsquo;s own approach, under review.  However, at all times, the key consideration for me and my Department has been, and will continue to be, to ensure that any action that is taken is in this citizen&rsquo;s best interests.  However, I would like to assure the deputy that officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both in Dublin and in Cairo, remain in ongoing contact with this individual and his family, and will continue to offer full consular support.  We will continue to engage appropriately with the Egyptian authorities, will remain resolute in seeking to protect the interests of the citizen concerned and will do all possible to achieve a positive outcome.</p></reply>

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we continue to work closely with high level Government contacts and with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond.  All of this work is aimed at achieving relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the United States and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.  Throughout his recent visit to the US and in a series of high level contacts with the US Administration, with Congress and at State level, the Taoiseach raised the issue of immigration reform and the plight of the undocumented Irish, stressing that almost every family in Ireland is related to or knows somebody who is caught up in this deeply distressing situation.  During his meeting with President Obama on 17 March the Taoiseach commended him on his executive action announced late last year.  The Deputy would be aware that this action is currently the subject of legal proceedings in the US federal courts.  The Taoiseach emphasised the need to allow the undocumented to come out of the shadows and be free to travel home for family events.  He also highlighted the issue of those amongst the Irish undocumented who might be eligible for<b></b>visas, but who would be required to return to Ireland for their issuance and hence would require waivers for their prior period of undocumented residence.  The Taoiseach also pointed to the need for a legal pathway to allow for future Irish immigration to the US for those who wish to make a contribution there, expressing the hope that a political way forward could be found on this issue which would encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress.  President Obama spoke of his executive actions on immigration reform and acknowledged the contribution of Irish immigrants to America&rsquo;s development.  He considered that one of the great strengths of the United States had always been its willingness to welcome new immigrants to its shores.</p><p>I also raised immigration reform issues, including the possibility of immigration reform legislation, when I met with Vice President Biden in Boston on 30 March.  I have also had the opportunity to discuss these matters on a number of occasions with US Ambassador O&rsquo;Malley.  The Government as a whole, including my Department in Dublin and our Embassy in Washington, will continue to actively follow up on all of the issues raised in recent contacts with the US Administration, with Congress and with the US Embassy in Ireland.</p></reply>

We have repeatedly stressed that only a political solution can achieve a sustainable peace in Syria.  We will also continue to address the humanitarian consequences of the conflict and provide urgent assistance and support to the civilian populations within Syria and neighbouring countries who have been displaced or suffered violations of their rights.  Syria has been discussed regularly at meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council.  At present, it is not on the agenda for the meeting on 20 April.  However, at the most recent meeting, in March, a strategy was adopted outlining how the EU and its Member States can counter the threat posed by ISIS and help restore peace and security in Syria and Iraq.  At the December meeting of the Council, the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan di Mistura, discussed measures to address the acute security and humanitarian situation, as well as possible steps to move towards a political process.  The protracted crisis in Syria and the region has resulted in immense humanitarian need.  More than 200,000 people have lost their lives, and there are now over 12.2 million people in need of immediate life-saving support within Syria.  Due to the violence and the lack of access to aid, 3.8 million people have left Syria for neighbouring countries.  The crisis has had a particularly devastating impact on civilians, as recent events in Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus show.  Ireland is particularly mindful of the impact of the crisis on neighbouring countries which are supporting large populations of vulnerable Syrian refugees.  We also remain gravely concerned about barriers to humanitarian access in Syria and have consistently advocated for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access and respect by all parties for International Humanitarian Law.</p>  <p>  The EU is the main donor in response to the humanitarian crisis in Syria, providing a total of &euro;3.6 billion since the outset of the conflict.  Ireland has played its part as one of the most generous international contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis, and has provided over &euro;32 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria since 2011, through UN partners, NGOs and the Red Cross.  At the recent UN Pledging Conference for Syria, which took place in Kuwait on 31 March, my colleague, Minister of State Sherlock, announced an additional pledge of &euro;12 million on behalf of the Irish government which will be used to provide lifesaving assistance to those in need in Syria and in neighbouring countries over the course of 2015.  This pledge will bring Ireland&rsquo;s total contribution to the Syria crisis to &euro;41 million.</p></reply>

This letter explained that the submitted application did not demonstrate their son&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship under section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 as amended (the 1956 Act); the 1956 Act was amended in 2004 to stipulate that a person, born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding that<font color="#004080"> </font>person&rsquo;s birth; and (iii) the submitted evidence of the mother&rsquo;s lawful residence in the State covered the period 12 April, 2006 to 4 January, 2009.  This fell short of the three year period as required by Section 6A of the 1956 Act.  On this basis, the applicant was not considered to be an Irish citizen and thus had no entitlement to a passport.</p><p>In a reply, dated 11 December, 2014, the parents referred to the fact that their three older children were all issued with Irish passports.  They accepted, however, that their son did not qualify for citizenship under section 6A of the 1956 Act.  Nonetheless, they were of the view that he was an Irish citizen by virtue of his birth and length of residence in the State.</p><p>These points, however, failed to demonstrate his entitlement to Irish citizenship for the following reasons:</p><p>the applicant&rsquo;s siblings were all born in Ireland before 1 January, 2005.  The 2004 amendment of the 1956 Act did not, therefore, apply to them.  Accordingly, they were all Irish citizens from birth; and (b) the lawful residence of the applicant in Ireland is relevant to an application for naturalisation.  No evidence has been presented to the Department to show that he is a naturalised citizen.</p><p>As the correspondence from the applicant&rsquo;s parents failed to establish his entitlement to Irish citizenship, the Department wrote to them on 29 December, 2014 to inform them that a passport had been refused to him.</p><p>It should be noted that this decision was taken on the basis that entitlement to Irish citizenship had not been proven under section 6A of the 1956 Act.  It may well be the case that such entitlement may exist under the naturalisation provisions of that Act.  The applicant&rsquo;s parents may, therefore, wish to pursue this matter with the Department of Justice and Equality which processes applications for this category of citizenship.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provided for a range of matters consequent upon the transfer of functions in relation to public water services from local authorities to Irish Water.  This includes the mechanisms for the transfer of assets and liabilities from local authorities to Irish Water.  In particular, Section 12(8) provides for the transfer of development levies received by local authorities for the purpose of investment in water services to be transferred to Irish Water and provides that such levies can only be expended by Irish Water in the functional area of the local authority concerned.</p>  <p>  On 30 March 2015, I signed an order under section 12 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 providing for the transfer from the local authorities to Irish Water of moneys received or due to be received, in accordance with section 48 or 49 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.   </p>  <p>  While this gives legal power for the transfer of the resources, the financial transaction which subsequently arises is dependent on the completion of work which has been underway for some time between Irish Water and the local authorities in relation to the identification and quantification of water-related financial assets, liabilities and debtors which will result in a net amount to be reflected in a balancing statement resulting in payments to be made by Irish Water to local authorities or vice versa.  The work involved is now at an advanced stage and I anticipate that it will be completed shortly.  This work is focussed on identification of the liabilities with precision and accuracy, but as it has evolved it has been possible to estimate the likely aggregate liability for the purpose of the financial planning by Irish Water and the submission of forecast expenditure and liabilities to the Commission for Energy Regulation.</p></reply>

An additional &euro;30 will be added on every anniversary of the original add on date while the bill remains unpaid or a payment plan has not been entered into with Irish Water.  In the case of a Two Adult Household (capped at &euro;260), &euro;60 will be added and again at each anniversary. </p>  <p>  The late payment charges will only apply where someone is in arrears for more than 12 months and has not entered into a payment plan with Irish Water.  Payment plans will be developed based on an ability to pay and it is important to note that the late payment charges are focused on those who &ldquo;will not pay&rdquo;, rather than those who cannot pay.  </p>  <p>  A range of flexible payment options will be available.  Irish Water will facilitate bill payment through direct debit, electronic funds transfer, payment by cash at any retail outlet with a Paypoint or Payzone sign, or a post office where a bill can be paid in full or part payments of a minimum of &euro;5 can be made.  The overall net cost for those who register is either &euro;1.15 a week for single adult households or &euro;3 a week for all others.  Water supply will not be reduced under any circumstance.   </p>  <p>  Any customers who have unpaid water charges can be pursued through the Courts by Irish Water for the sums due and a debt judgment may be obtained against the customer.  </p>  <p>  The Government intends to bring forward legislation to enhance the collectability of domestic water charges, building on the approach set out in the Water Services Act 2014.  Further details on the modalities involved will be available on publication of the draft legislation following Government approval.</p></reply>
