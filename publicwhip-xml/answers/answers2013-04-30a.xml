    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-30a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013043000053#WRA00800"><p>I propose to take Question Nos. 95 and 109 together.</p><p>  Responsibility for the regulation of the retail electricity market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Since 4 April 2011 prices in the electricity retail market have been fully deregulated.  Business customers can therefore avail of competitive offerings from electricity suppliers.  Prices are set by electricity suppliers and are commercial and operational matters for them.  I have no statutory function in the setting of electricity prices.</p><p>  Electricity and gas costs in Ireland are influenced by various drivers, including global gas and oil prices, the costs of capital, exchange rate fluctuations, the small size of the Irish market, geographical location and low population density. Global gas and oil prices are by far the most significant factor in the case of Ireland. Prices have risen sharply since the start of 2011 driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan and demand from China and India.  Ireland is at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices which dictate the retail price of electricity.</p><p>  At a national level, the competitive energy market in place helps put downward pressure on prices.  In addition, we must focus on all possible additional actions to mitigate costs for business and domestic customers, including rigorous regulatory scrutiny of the network costs component of retail prices.</p><p>  I am committed to working with enterprise and with the energy sector to ensure that the costs of energy are as competitive as possible. In this context, promotion of energy efficiency measures is an area within our control where action can be taken to reduce energy costs.</p><p>  Energy efficiency represents an opportunity for businesses to reduce their energy costs and improve their competitiveness.  There are energy efficiency measures in place for SMEs.  The Energy Efficiency Fund, which I announced in February, will assist energy efficiency projects in the public and commercial sectors, including SMEs. Another support is the SME programme administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), under the Better Energy in Business programme.  It helps 2,000 businesses improve their energy efficiency and competitiveness.</p><p>  Promotion of indigenous sustainable sources of energy will help offset the impact of volatile fossil fuel prices. The Government has a target of 40% of electricity being generated from renewable sources envisaged by 2020. Good progress has been made in meeting this target and its realisation will introduce more certainty in the energy fuel mix as well as boosting security of supply.</p><p>  The latest analysis of Eurostat data on electricity and gas prices is presented in SEAI&rsquo;s published report on electricity and gas prices in the period January to June 2012 and publicly available.  The price statistics are presented for different business consumers, differentiated by consumption level.</p><p>The report shows that VAT exclusive electricity prices increased for small business by 3.1%, and for medium business by 1.8% over the previous six months.  In contrast, the very smallest business users saw a price decrease of 6.7%.  Prices for the three categories of business consumers range from 4th to   9th most expensive in the EU and these rankings have not changed significantly since the previous six months.  The effects of the price drivers outlined earlier in this response tend to place Irish electricity and gas prices towards the more expensive position in the EU rankings.</p></reply>

It was titled 'Media Pluralism and Freedom in a Connected Europe', and provided an opportunity to discuss some important trends that are emerging across Europe in relation to media. Other speakers included C<b><font color="#2F2F2F">ommissioner Neelie Kroes, who is </font></b><font color="#2F2F2F">Vice-President of the European Commission and Commissioner for the Digital Agenda and Lord David Puttnam, our Digital Ambassador. Professor Herta D&auml;ubler-Gmelin, who was one of the members of EU High Level Group on Media Freedom and Pluralism, and a former German Minister for Justice was also present.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">My address focused on the central role of media in society</font>  , and particularly around the deeper structural trends emerging from the impact of technological change and the consequent shifts in the economics of media across Europe, and indeed the world. In short, this has involved the rise of a large and diverse online media, a trend which has already posed a profound challenge to print media, a process which is likely to progressively extend into television and audio-visual media over the coming years.</p><p>  Online media has some very positive aspects and is genuinely important in terms of extending media plurality and as a commercial development. However, it may also fracture and disaggregate audiences and may even ensure that the scale and degree of editorial competence that traditionally existed in newspapers cannot be easily replicated. Conversely, it may well facilitate the rise of multi-national converged media operators, something which may prove a challenge in terms of assuring media plurality in years to come. </p><p>The event was an extremely interesting and worthwhile one, and raised a great many issues that will undoubtedly be the subject of discussions in years to come. If the Deputy is looking for further information, the text of my address in on my Department's website, and I gather that videos of all the presentations are available on the IIEA's website.  </p></reply>

I wish to reiterate the strong commitment of the Government to introducing a national postcode system.</p><p>  A national postcode system is in my view a vital part of the national infrastructure. Apart from providing efficiencies for postal delivery it will significantly impact deliveries of public and private services.</p><p>  The procurement process for a national postcode system has proven to be more complex and protracted than originally envisaged. As the Deputy will appreciate it is crucial that the postcode system to be put in place delivers the optimal level of service whilst providing full value for money for the tax payer. </p><p>  Since the procurement process commenced in 2011 intensive work has taken place on what is an extremely complex national project with many different inter-dependent aspects to it.  Consequently the procurement process is still ongoing.  It is expected that the final tender will be issued to all qualified bidders in mid-May. </p><p>  The proposals in response to that tender will, in turn, be evaluated, by the postcode evaluation team, a preferred option will be chosen and a recommendation will be made to Government.  </p><p>  The final decision to proceed with implementation of a national postcode will be one for Government and will be based on appropriate financial, technical and operational considerations. I cannot give a precise date on when this decision will be made but I intend that it will be no later than the third quarter of this year.</p></reply>

I welcome the progress by the commercial sector since the publication of the Plan and note that investments in high speed services are progressing apace particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department will appoint, in the next few days, a team of experts to assist it in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>  Progress is also being made on the additional actions in the Plan concerning demand stimulation, spectrum policy, the removal of barriers to infrastructure rollout and maximising the use of State assets.  Implementation of the Plan is being overseen by a High Level Group, which is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives from Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, OPW, NewERA, ComReg and Forf&aacute;s.</p></reply>

To achieve the 16% target we will have to ensure that renewable energy contributes 40% to our electricity consumption, 12% to our heating consumption and 10% of our transport.</p><p>  To assist us meeting the electricity targets, the primary supports put in place are schemes of feed-in tariffs. Additionally, the qualifying period for tax relief for corporate investment in certain renewable energy projects was extended from 31 December 2011 to 31 December 2014 in Budget 2012.</p><p>  The purpose of the schemes and tax relief is to encourage investment in renewable energy projects and to facilitate the growth of electricity generation capacity using these sources.</p><p>  In terms of benefits, a central objective of the Directive is to ensure that the deployment of renewable energy contributes to environmental and climate change objectives.</p><p>  Increased renewable energy also improves security of supply and also has the benefit of displacing the imports of fossil fuel.  In 2011, it is estimated that &euro;300 million in fossil fuel imports and 3.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions were avoided &ndash; equivalent to the annual energy needs of almost 350,000 homes.  The bulk of the &euro;300 million was due to the displacement of gas by electricity generation from wind.</p><p>  In terms of the cost to the public, two major studies have been published on the impact of increased wind generation on the Single Electricity Market in Ireland.  Both studies found that the market is capable of operating successfully with increasing amounts of wind and that the cost to consumers in PSO terms tends to be cancelled out by the cost savings in the wholesale market.</p></reply>

Any such proposed project would be subject to the Planning Acts, including the requirements for public consultation. Additionally, proposed projects would require appropriate consideration and approval by the Commission for Energy Regulation and appropriate provision for connection to the transmission system by Eirgrid.  I am not aware of any plans to erect wind turbines in locations in Dublin mid-West such as Newcastle, Rathcoole and Athgoe.</p><p>More generally, a technical review of the Wind Energy Guidelines is being overseen by officials from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  This review will examine the manner in which the guidelines address key issues of community concern such as noise (including separation distance) and shadow flicker.  The review will be completed later this year.</p><p><bu>BRIEFING</bu></p><p><b>Wind and EU targets</b></p><p>The Government has set a target of 40% electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2020. In the last 5 years in particular, Ireland has made huge strides in accelerating renewable generation. In the 2001 European RES-E Directive, Ireland was set a target of moving from 3.6% RES-E to 13.2% RES-E by 2010. Ireland achieved 14.8% RES-E in 2010 and exceeded the EU target of 13.2% in 2010.</p><p>Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources was published in June 2009. The Directive aims to ensure that by 2020, 20% of all energy consumed in the EU is from renewable sources covering heat, electricity and transport.</p><p>The target addressed to Ireland is 16% of all energy consumed to be sourced from renewable energy by 2020. The electricity market is approximately 33% of the energy target. Ireland&rsquo;s national target for 2020 has been set as 40% of electricity must come from renewable sources (RES-E).  Also, this converts to 10% of energy in the transport and 12% of energy in the heat sector must come from renewable sources.</p><p><b>Electricity </b></p><p>The electricity market is the most mature of the national support programmes. Support commenced in the mid-1990s based on competitive tendering under the Alternative Energy Requirement (AER) programme.  The more successful feed in tariff support mechanism (REFIT) replaced AER from September 2007.</p><p>The primary support mechanism for renewable electricity is REFIT (Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff), which is designed to provide certainty to renewable electricity generators by providing them with a minimum floor price for each unit of electricity exported to the grid over a 15 year period.  This certainty afforded by a guaranteed minimum price gives them sufficient certainty to be able to get loans to finance the renewable developments.  REFIT 2, launched last year, is designed around interacting with the market price.</p><p>The increasing contribution from renewable energy technologies to the electricity market are summarised in the following table energy</p><p><table><tr><th>'04</th><th>'05</th><th>'06</th><th>'07 </th><th>'08 </th><th>'09</th><th>'10</th><th>'11</th></tr><tr><td>5.2%</td><td>6.8%</td><td>8.6%</td><td>9.5%</td><td>11.9%</td><td>14.1%</td><td>14.8%</td><td>17.6%</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Technologies employed </b></p><p>There are 2000 megawatts (MW), approx., of installed generating plant harnessing renewable energy technologies.  The dominant technology developed in recent times is onshore wind power ca 1696 MW with a lesser amount of biomass, mainly landfill gas. Hydropower contributes approximately 238 MW of installed capacity.  On an electricity system of the order of 6000 MWs of installed capacity, wind now represents approximately 30% of the total installed capacity.</p><p>It was estimated a total of 1650 MW of installed renewable capacity was required to achieve the 15% renewable electricity target.  There were sufficient projects with both planning permission and a connection offer to deliver this target with onshore wind remaining dominant.  The latest figures from EirGrid show that there is a further 1,582 MW with signed connection agreements or in the final stages of agreeing one.</p><p><b>Microgeneration</b></p><p>Should a microgeneration scheme be introduced, if this to be funded from the PSO levy, increased electricity costs would have to be borne by all customers to fund it.  This Department and SEAI are finalising analysis, which will be completed shortly, on the most cost effective options which could be considered for supporting the microgeneration sector, having regard to the costs and benefits for all energy consumers.</p><p><b>Future capacity</b></p><p>The recent Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) decision on the &lsquo;Gate 3&rsquo; process provides for connection offers for 3900 MWs of additional renewable electricity capacity in the short term. Connection offers for Gate 3 were due to issue between December 2009 and Q3, 2011 and have all been issued.  Major infrastructure developments are required to deliver this. EirGrid (the transmission system operator) has developed a plan for these necessary infrastructure developments (see: <i>www.eirgrid.com/media/Grid%2025.pdf</i>  ).  As a consequence, these projects will be building out over the decade</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-30a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013043000053#WRA02100"><p>I propose to take Question Nos. 101 and 377 together.</p><p>  Responsibility for the regulation of the retail electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body. Prices in the electricity retail market are fully deregulated and similarly for gas, except in the case of BGE tariffs for domestic consumers.  Customers can therefore avail of competitive offerings from electricity and gas suppliers.  Prices are set by suppliers and are commercial and operational matters for them. I have no statutory function in the setting of electricity or gas prices.</p><p>  Electricity and gas costs in Ireland are influenced by various drivers, including global gas and oil prices, the costs of capital, exchange rate fluctuations, the small size of the Irish market, geographical location and low population density. Global gas and oil prices are by far the most significant factor in the case of Ireland. Prices have risen sharply since the start of 2011 driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan and demand from China and India.  Ireland is at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices which dictate the retail price of electricity.</p><p>  At a national level, the competitive energy market in place helps put downward pressure on prices.  In addition, we must focus on all possible additional actions to mitigate costs for business and domestic customers, including rigorous regulatory scrutiny of the network costs component of retail prices.</p><p>  I am committed to working with enterprise and with the energy sector to ensure that the costs of energy are as competitive as possible. In this context, promotion of energy efficiency measures is an area within our control where action can be taken to reduce energy costs.</p><p>  Energy efficiency represents a significant opportunity for both businesses and households to reduce their energy costs.  There are energy efficiency measures in place to assist both business and domestic energy consumers, with significant funding allocated to them.  The Energy Efficiency Fund, which I announced in February and which will commence funding specific measures in the near future, will assist energy efficiency projects in the public and commercial sectors.</p><p>  Promotion of indigenous sustainable sources of energy will help offset the impact of volatile fossil fuel prices. The Government has a target of 40% of electricity being generated from renewable sources envisaged by 2020. Good progress has been made in meeting this target and its realisation will introduce more certainty in the energy fuel mix as well as boosting security of supply. </p><p>  The latest analysis of Eurostat data on electricity and gas prices is presented in the most recent report of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland on electricity and gas prices report, covering the period January to June 2012.  The price statistics are presented in the usual format, that is for a number of different business and domestic consumers differentiated by consumption level, as set out by Eurostat.  This report is publicly available.</p><p>Most household electricity consumers saw increases of between 1.9% and 2.8% in price for the first half of 2012, compared to the previous 6 months, with Ireland&rsquo;s position in the EU rankings varying from 5th most expensive for those consuming small amounts to 9th for the larger consumers.  In broad terms, for 89% of the residential electricity market, there was little change in the EU rankings from the previous six month period, except for the very largest household consumers comprising 9% of the market whose position dis-improved three places to 9th   most expensive.</p><p>  In the first half of 2012 most business users saw price increases ranging from just under 2% to 8.4%.  Only very small users saw a price decrease of 6.7%.  This meant that in the various business user categories, depending on the level of consumption, prices ranged from around 99% to 115 % of the EU average.</p></reply>

The overarching objectives will be to increase digital skills and consequent employment opportunities, assist in overall economic growth and job creation and facilitate the objective of delivering a wide range of public services in a more cost-effective way. The Digital Strategy will be implemented as an iterative process.  Phase 1 will focus on the key areas of enterprise, e-Learning, citizen adoption and fostering an indigenous digital industry.</p><p>  On more specific terms, the focus of the Strategy will be:  To support traditional enterprises to realise the full opportunities of online transactions and trade; To achieve the full benefits of digital in the classroom, through the completion of the rollout of 100Mbps to all second level schools in Ireland (by end 2013 we will be two thirds the way through that programme); To provide continued support for Ireland's digital enterprises and entrepreneurs; and To empower citizens by encouraging and assisting them to achieve more of the benefits of Internet engagement. The Strategy will focus on the key areas of <b>connectivity</b>, <b>capability</b>, <b>content</b> and <b>community</b>   and it is my objective that with continued private and public investment in broadband infrastructure combined with increased skills and knowledge and the rapid development of more applications we can create significantly increased levels of digital participation among all sectors of society.</p><p>  The NDS should be seen as a further element of the Government's overall approach to fostering increased access to and use of digital services, complementing as it does the existing National Broadband Plan, last year's e-Government Strategy and the recent National Payments Plan.</p><p>  The trading on-line element of the Strategy will also complement the disruptive reform initiative in this area which is included in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs.</p><p>  To help drive and deliver these ambitious objectives, last December I appointed David Puttnam as our first national Digital Champion.  We are lucky to have such a passionate, articulate and influential advocate for the possibilities of digital, particularly in the education sector.  Working with the Department, he will be engaging with the various sectors over the coming months, with a view to driving the digital agenda and specifically pursuing some key goals that will be set out in the National Digital Strategy.</p></reply>

I have no statutory function in the matter of disconnections of electricity or gas customers regardless of the supply company involved.</p><p>  The CER provides quarterly and annual updates on the electricity and gas retail markets, including on disconnections, and further information may be found at:</p><p>  Nevertheless, the number of disconnections is a matter of concern to me as it is for the Government, the CER, voluntary organisations and suppliers.  The rise in numbers in recent years has coincided with the economic recession which has caused customer arrears and debt levels to rise.</p><p>  In line with the CER's Code of Practice on disconnection, electricity and gas suppliers must facilitate payment options/plans for domestic customers experiencing genuine hardship and, where appropriate, engage with a money advisor acting on behalf of the customer or a recognised charity.  This must include offering the customer a prepayment meter.  According to CER's published report on its website on Electricity and Gas Retail Markets, concerning the period to the end of September 2012, over 11,000 Pay as You Go electricity meters have been installed.  That report also states that there are approximately 19,500 token meters in operation.  In addition, disconnections may not be initiated where a customer has entered into a payment plan with the supplier and is honouring that arrangement.</p><p>  I welcome the fact that CER is working with energy suppliers to ensure that they take all reasonable steps to assist customers through this difficult period and that disconnections resulting from genuine inability to pay are minimised, and only occur as a very last resort.</p><p>  Implementation of the measures set out in the Government's Affordable Energy Strategy, published last November, is pivotal to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers and improving energy affordability.</p><p>In addition, the Government will continue to support the delivery of energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households in 2013.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme has been allocated Exchequer funding of &euro;18 million for 2013, which is expected to result in upgrades in over 10,000 homes.  </p></reply>

The levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers, including the three peat stations.  Peat-fired electricity plants are supported as they contribute to security of supply through the use of indigenous fuels.</p><p>  The particular PSO scheme for peat generation was approved by the European Commission in 2001 and was designed to enable the accelerated closing down by ESB of the then existing six old peat fired plants and the building of two new more environmentally friendly and efficient plants with a 15-year operational lifetime.  The PSO also applied to the peat fired plan in Edenderry which is now owned by Bord na M&oacute;na.</p><p>The peat PSO for Edenderry expires in 2015 and Bord na M&oacute;na is incrementally increasing the co-firing of biomass with peat.  The PSO for the two ESB peat stations expires in 2019.  REFIT 3, opened last year, aims to support co-firing of biomass at all three peat stations. I have no plans to end the PSO for peat in advance of the dates for their expiry under the European Commission approvals.  </p></reply>

There is potential for maximising synergies while addressing the possible trade-offs between competitiveness, security of supply and sustainability.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Commissioner Oettinger attended the Informal Meeting.  He highlighted how any new framework should take into account current economic difficulties whilst remaining ambitious on the long-term low carbon objective.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The Council of Energy Ministers also discussed the effects of unconventional oil and gas on energy supply, competitiveness and prices.  In relation to the work currently underway by the European Commission on unconventional hydrocarbon extraction, the Irish Presidency requested that the Commission would reflect on the debate among Ministers in Dublin, particularly on the global competitiveness and security of supply aspects, and to take those views into consideration in their work on the matter, having regard to legitimate environmental and safety considerations.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The two days of discussions were informed by the goal of full implementation of the internal energy market. Ministers agreed that this is not an end in itself, but rather, it must bring tangible benefits to all energy consumers.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">On the issue of the links between smart technology, innovation and energy policy, I concluded that the ultimate objective in rolling out standardised smart meters and smart grids across Europe must be value and benefit driven, with a specific consumer focus. In so doing, we must recognise the energy needs, circumstances and IT capabilities of all categories of consumers.  Data protection concerns should also be considered and addressed.  The need for public awareness campaigns on the potential advantages was acknowledged and the benefits must be clear to all individual energy customers and management of energy consumption. Product and price analysis must be simple and straightforward.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The financing of energy efficiency measures was also discussed. Realising the energy efficiency potential of buildings is central to the EU's energy efficiency policy.  Nearly 40% of final energy is consumed in homes, offices and shops. The challenge that Energy Ministers face is to find the necessary finance to underpin the energy retrofit renovation that is required as part of our 2020 energy and climate goals.  This is particularly important given the potential for jobs and growth that a sustained campaign of energy efficiency in buildings would realise.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The integration of variable renewable energy sources, in particular wind and solar energy, was also discussed and the Ministers agreed that the proper development of energy policy must adequately recognise the numerous challenges, including cost considerations, in the incremental transition to a low carbon economy.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">I concluded the two day session by stating that in relation to all the energy matters considered by the Ministers, our level of ambition must be underpinned by a rigorous analysis of the costs and benefits associated with the different possible approaches to new and existing policies, especially in exploiting new opportunities.  National energy circumstances are also important, as we strive to reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">I will, during the remainder of our Presidency, be facilitating continued discussions at the Energy Working Party on identifying a robust 2030 framework which will facilitate long term European competitiveness and security of supply.  Europe must maintain its leadership position in the transition to a low carbon future, particularly with regard to energy efficient and clean technology, products and services.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">I should also highlight also that the Council of Ministers agreed that I would write to President Van Rompuy to update him on our deliberations which the Ministers wish to see inputted to the forthcoming Council of Europe meeting in May.</font></p></reply>

The target is set at 16% of all energy consumed to be from renewable sources.  Ireland has set out that we intend to meet the target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heating by 2020, which together amounts to 16% of all energy consumed.  At the end of 2012, 6.4% of all energy consumed was from renewable sources, hence a significant increase is required in the period to 2020. </p><p>  Wave and tidal energy has the potential to contribute to our renewable electricity target by 2020, provided the technologies become commercially viable in the period to 2020.  Our National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) includes 75MW of ocean energy contributing to our 2020 target out of an estimated total of 4000MW required to deliver 40% renewable electricity.  This is based on the assumption that by 2020 some early pre-commercial wave and tidal devices will be connected and exporting power to the electricity grid. </p><p>  A range of supports have been deployed since 2009 in support of wave and tidal development.  The Ocean Energy Development Unit in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has been taking forward the development of the sector through administration of a Prototype Development Fund of grants for industry.  The purpose of the Prototype Development Fund is to fund research, development and deployment.  SEAI has also been progressing the development of a full scale grid connected wave test site off County Mayo, which would complement existing wave testing facilities i.e. the wave tank in Cork and the quarter scale wave testing site in Galway Bay.  It should also be noted that the cumulative amount of expenditure on Ocean Energy in the period 2009 &ndash; 2013, including the estimated 2013 allocation, is &euro;19.159m.</p><p>  Given the nature of research, development and deployment activity, especially in non-commercially viable areas such as wave and tidal energy, it is a reality that such activity is a high risk business for companies who engage in it.  In this context I am aware of the closure of the company referred to by the Deputy.  I understand that SEAI provided Prototype Funding to this company in the past but having engaged in due diligence of the company, and taking account of available resources, were unable to offer any further grant aid.</p><p>  Other supports for the sector include the development of the Beaufort Laboratory as part of the IMERC facility in Cork, which will see a re-housing of the wave tank facility and will bring together researchers in the area currently based in the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre (HMRC) and the Coastal and Marine Research Centre (CMRC), as part of a broader campus approach with the Naval College, UCC and Cork Institute of Technology, aimed at maximising on marine industrial opportunities. </p><p>  Research in the ocean energy area is ongoing in most universities across the country and ocean energy was recently identified as of 1 of 14 priority research areas by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in their Research Prioritisation Exercise.  SEAI has been allocated funding for ocean energy by my Department this year and will be continuing to offer grants under the Prototype Development Fund in 2013 and to progress development of the grid connected wave test site off County Mayo.</p></reply>

This policy was updated in 2011.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.  The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.</p><p>  In December 2012 Gaslink announced a decision to extend the gas network to Wexford town.  This followed an earlier decision by the CER to connect the Great Island power station to the gas network. </p><p>  As regards the connection of enterprises to the gas network, such connections are subject to charges and usage commitments, in line with the CER approved Connections Policy.

Energy is consumed across the transport, heating and electricity sectors.  At end 2012, we had reached 6.4% of overall energy consumption from renewable sources.  Our intention is to reach our overall target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heating, which together amount to 16% of all energy consumption.</p><p>Under the Directive, Ireland was required to set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) the trajectory towards meeting its legally binding target.  The NREAP and the First Progress Report on the NREAP, which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, show the sectoral and technology breakdown that we anticipate in the achievement of our target.  Wind generated electricity is expected to play a major role.  At end 2012, 19.5% approximately of our electricity consumption was from renewable sources.  The following table provides a breakdown of renewables consumption over the period 2007 to 2012.</p><p><table><tr><th>Normalised</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012(P)</th></tr><tr><td>Renewables % of Gross Electricity</td><td>9.9%</td><td>11.1%</td><td>13.7%</td><td>14.9%</td><td>17.6%</td><td>19.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Hydro (normalised)</td><td>2.5%</td><td>2.5%</td><td>2.6%</td><td>2.6%</td><td>2.7%</td><td>2.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Wind (normalised)</td><td>6.8%</td><td>7.9%</td><td>10.2%</td><td>11.2%</td><td>13.7%</td><td>15.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Biomass</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.1%</td><td>0.2%</td><td>0.4%</td><td>0.5%</td><td>0.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Landfill Gas</td><td>0.5%</td><td>0.5%</td><td>0.6%</td><td>0.6%</td><td>0.6%</td><td>0.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Biogas</td><td>0.1%</td><td>0.1%</td><td>0.1%</td><td>0.1%</td><td>0.1%</td><td>0.1%</td></tr></table></p><p>Feed-in tariffs are the primary support mechanism for wind energy in Ireland. <i> </i>  REFIT 2 which was launched last year is designed to incentivise the addition of up to 4,000MW of new renewable electricity capacity to the Irish grid from onshore wind, hydro and biomass landfill gas technologies.  Plants must be new plants in all cases, neither built nor under construction on 1 January 2010. Projects must be operational by the end of 2017.  The support for any particular project cannot exceed 15 years and may not extend beyond 31 December 2032.</p><p>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) published a report entitled &ldquo;Energy in Ireland&rdquo; in November 2012.  That report gives an estimated figure of approximately &euro;300 million in avoided national gas imports from the use of all renewable energies in the generation of electricity in 2011.  Wind generation alone would account for an estimated &euro;240 million of the &euro;300 million in avoided gas imports.</p><p>The Memorandum of Understanding on energy cooperation that UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Edward Davey and I signed on 24 January will result in completion of consideration of how Irish renewable energy resources, onshore and offshore, might be developed to the mutual benefit of Ireland and the United Kingdom.  This will determine whether it is beneficial for both countries to enter into an Inter-Governmental Agreement under the Renewable Energy Directive to provide for renewable energy trading.</p><p>If an Inter-Governmental Agreement is entered into, there are potential significant employment opportunities.  As an example, employment creation arising from a 3,000MW project would be expected to be in the order of 3,000 to 6,000 job years in the construction phase, with the actual number dependent on the construction schedule to 2020.  There would also be additional jobs created in the ongoing maintenance of turbines over a 20-year operating life.  Further employment opportunities could arise if turbines or components were to be manufactured in Ireland.  All relevant State agencies, particularly in the enterprise area, would have to coordinate their activities early in the process to ensure employment potential of export projects is maximised.  This opportunity has already been identified by the Industrial Development Authority and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technology growth strategies.</p></reply>

This will determine whether it is beneficial for both countries to enter into an Inter-Governmental Agreement under the Renewable Energy Directive to provide for renewable energy trading.</p><p>  The amount of energy to be procured by the United Kingdom and the mechanisms for sharing the resultant economic benefits, including an appropriate return to the Exchequer, are matters to be addressed in the coming year, and ahead of signing a potential Inter-Governmental Agreement, which would have to consider, and provide appropriately for, any risk to the Irish State or consumer.</p><p>  Since taking up my position as Minister for Communications, Energy, and Natural Resources, I have been meeting with companies and individuals involved in the development of renewable energy on an on-going basis.  That includes several developers who have made presentations and discussed their ideas for the development of renewable energy projects for export.  In terms of Ireland&rsquo;s negotiations with the UK, we have not yet determined or agreed the selection process for any potential joint projects, which will be a further matter to be discussed and negotiated in the coming year.  Any such selection process would, of course, be open and transparent.</p><p>  Any new wind turbines that may be built will be subject to the Planning Acts, including the requirements for public consultation.</p></reply>

There have been three such EU Regulations since the first regulation commenced in July 2007, which have successively reduced the maximum permitted retail roaming charges as well as introducing consumer protection measures to inform users of the roaming charges they may incur and to avoid bill shocks.</p><p>  The overall objective of these Regulations is to bring about common tariffs for national and roaming services across the EU over time.  A number of mobile service providers in Ireland already offer options for users roaming in Northern Ireland which charge for such services at or below their national unit rates.  The available options when roaming in Northern Ireland include roaming calls billed at national rates, calls included within bundled minutes and calls billed at out of bundle rates, where users opt for a related network operator when roaming.  The offers differ from service provider to service provider.</p><p>  The current EU Regulation, No. 531/2012, which commenced in July 2012, imposes two further reductions in retail roaming charges to be implemented by 1 July 2013 in the first instance, followed by a further reduction by I July 2014.  The regulated maximum per minute price, exclusive of VAT, will then have reduced from &euro;0.49 in 2007 to &euro;0.19 for making a call and from &euro;0.24 in 2007 to &euro;0.05 for receiving a call.  In addition the retail price for data services when roaming, will reduce from &euro;0.70 to &euro;0.20 per megabyte, exclusive of VAT, between July 2012 and July 2014.</p><p>  The current EU Regulation also requires the EU Commission to review the effectiveness of these measures, including a review of the availability of offers providing a common tariff for national and roaming.  The review mechanism is designed to ensure that the impact of the current EU Regulation, is closely monitored and that new measures can be introduced if necessary.  My Department will participate actively in this review and the Commission is to make a final report to the European Parliament and Council by 30 June 2016.</p></reply>

I have no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.</p><p>  The CER, in 2006, approved a network connections policy which enabled reassessment of the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.</p><p>  This policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Uneconomic projects would increase costs for all energy consumers.</p><p>Under the CER's policy framework, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and latterly Gaslink, carried out a comprehensive review of towns not connected to the national gas network.  Gaslink published its New Towns Analysis Phase 3<i></i>report in 2010.</p><p>  The study included a review of the feasibility of connecting 11 towns in the West and North West region which are the focus of the Western Development Commission paper, &#8220;Why Invest in Gas&#8221;.  However, the Gaslink review found that none of the towns qualified for connection on economic grounds.  </p><p>Gaslink will continue to review the towns which did not qualify for connection under the 2010 Study as well as other towns.  The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually as a result of the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.</p></reply>

Since 1 January 2013, the obligation rate stands at 6% by volume.</p><p>  The main types of biofuels being used in Ireland are ethanol which is blended with petrol and biodiesel which is blended with diesel.  Blends of up to 5% ethanol can be used in any petrol powered vehicle with blends of up to 7% biodiesel suitable for use in all diesel vehicles.</p><p>  How each Member State meets its 10% target is a matter for that Member State.  However, I understand that most Member States use quota systems similar to ours, though some define their obligation in energy terms rather than by volume and there is a wide range of obligation rates across Member States.  For example, Germany has a 6.5% by volume obligation and Portugal has a 5.5% obligation in energy terms.  The UK rate for 2013 and 2014 is 4.75% by volume.  Other countries also use gaseous biofuels such as biogas and biomethane in gas powered vehicles and the use of higher blend liquid fuels such as E85 is more commonplace in Europe than in Ireland.</p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme has successfully delivered increased amounts of biofuel in Ireland resulting in 145 million litres being placed on the Irish market in 2011.  Of this, approximately 18.5 million litres was produced indigenously from waste material such as used cooking oil.  For the purpose of the Biofuel Obligation Scheme, a litre of biofuel produced from wastes and residues counts as two litres which means the use of such biofuel is incentivised under the scheme.  Though figures for 2012 are not yet available, I understand that the amount of indigenous biofuel on the market increased last year.  The recent increase in the obligation rate along with future increases will see the biofuel market grow to an estimated 500 million litres by 2020.  This will continue to create opportunities for indigenous industry to produce biofuels here in Ireland.</p></reply>

To this end, the National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to ensure that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses.</p><p>  Specifically, the Plan commits to: 70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population, and  A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.</p><p>  During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector operators are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department will appoint, in the next few days, a team of experts to assist it in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p></reply>

Our merchandise exports to Canada increased by 11% in 2012 to over &euro;780 million and early indications are that this positive trend has continued into 2013, with merchandise exports up by 12% in the first 2 months of this year.  Ultimately, the contracts won and contacts made during trade missions lead to job creation and long-term economic benefits for Ireland.    As the Deputy will be aware, I visited Canada over the St. Patrick's Day period last year.  During this visit, I held meetings with political and business leaders and took part in a range of trade and investment promotion events organised in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. </p><p>  My Colleague, Minister of State Costello will lead an Enterprise Ireland trade mission to Canada from 11 to 13 June this year. This trade mission will provide the opportunity to develop the excellent bilateral relations that exist between our two countries and support Irish companies to win business in the market. The programme for the visit is currently being developed by Enterprise Ireland in close consultation with my Department's Trade and Promotion Division and our Embassy in Ottawa. </p></reply>

It does not have an economic or trade remit.  Officers serving in EEAS missions serve overall EU interests and are not permitted to represent the interest of individual Member States, including their own.   While Irish officials serving in an EEAS mission can, and frequently do, contribute to the furtherance of good relations between the EU and her/his country of accreditation, thereby helping create a positive climate for trade between EU Member states and that third country, there is no basis for the appointment of an Irish official to an EEAS mission for the specific purpose of promoting Irish trade interests.   I would also note that our Embassy network continues to be strongly focussed on supporting opportunities for trade, investment and tourism in all their countries of accreditation, including where they are not resident, assisted in many cases by our Honorary Consuls and local Irish business networks and organisations.  </p><p>  These activities include identifying specific export and investment opportunities, helping companies build contact networks, organising trade-focussed visits in coordination with the state agencies, lobbying for market access and addressing regulatory obstacles, helping to negotiate international agreements on tax and in other key sectors, promoting Ireland as a destination for tourism and for study, and presenting clear information to key opinion-formers on Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for economic recovery.</p><p>  Although such activity is naturally limited in countries where we do not have resident missions, we are committed to assisting Irish exporters in these markets as far as possible.  This was demonstrated most recently over the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day period, when high-level promotional visits to Indonesia, the Philippines and New Zealand were organised by the Embassies in Singapore and Canberra respectively, in coordination with the state agencies. </p></reply>

In a situation of mortgage repayment difficulty, one of the recommendations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt was that &ldquo;a standard financial statement (SFS) should be developed for use by all lenders and MABS, to assess a borrower&rsquo;s financial position and to identify a best course of action&rdquo; in respect of a borrower experiencing difficulty in meeting mortgage repayments.  A standard format for the SFS was developed by the IBF and MABS and approved by the Central Bank in 2011 and all lenders are required to use this SFS when dealing with consumers under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) as set out in the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.    The SFS is a key component to the effectiveness of the MARP as it requires borrowers to objectively assess their incomings and outgoings, assets and liabilities and it also provides the lender with valuable information regarding the financial position of the borrower in mortgage arrears or pre arrears and will allow the lender to make its assessment of a possible alternative repayment arrangement based on the full financial circumstances of the cooperating borrower.  If the borrower is dissatisfied with a proposed alternative repayment arrangement, the MARP appeals process will be available.</p><p>  Outside of this bilateral framework, the Personal Insolvency Act provides for new statutory processes to deal with unsustainable mortgage and personal debt.  In these processes, the rights and obligations of both debtors and creditors, in the context of any arrangement to address a position of insolvency, will be more formalised.  However, in any such arrangement, the debtor will not be required to make payments at a level that would reduce his/her income below that necessary to maintain a reasonable standard of living.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland has now published guidelines on what would constitute a reasonable standard of living for certain household types having regard to household composition and other relevant characteristics. </p></reply>

The decision to provide any specific form of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter based on the assessment an insurer will make of the risks involved.   I understand that insurance companies as a matter of course carry out reviews of the risks that they are prepared to insure against and sometimes make a decision to discontinue certain types of cover which they consider high risk such as homes close to a river which has previously flooded. These types of decisions are made sometimes on the basis of their broad past experience rather than looking at the individual circumstances of householders. </p><p>  In this regard it should be noted that the OPW has advised me that Bray and its environs has a history of flooding having flooded four times seriously in the last 100 years as well as two other significant events. The last serious flood occurred in August 1986 during &ldquo;Hurricane Charlie&rdquo; when over 500 properties were subjected to flooding. They have also indicated that in the severe event which hit the east coast in October 2011, it is understood that areas of Bray were close to evacuation when flood levels in the river began to fall.  These may be factors in the withdrawal of cover by insurance companies.</p><p>  OPW  has also advised me that following the Government&rsquo;s Capital expenditure review for flood relief activities the Bray Scheme was given the go-ahead and a contractor was appointed in February 2012 with works commencing in May 2012. It is understood they are due for completion in late 2014 and that approximately 650 houses along with eight commercial properties are to be protected by the Scheme to a 1:100 year standard. This is a major investment by the State in addressing the flood problems affecting Bray and its residents and businesses. When completed the Scheme will afford a very high level of protection and details of this will be available to the insurance industry.   </p><p>  I am also informed that the OPW and the Irish Insurance Federation have been engaged in discussions to agree a system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes and works undertaken by the OPW or, in certain instances, by local authorities with OPW funding, and where the standard of protection afforded by these works could be verified.</p><p>  These discussions are  aimed at putting in place a process which will provide the necessary reassurance to insurance companies that remedial works have been carried out to a sufficiently high level to enable them re-commence the provision of flood cover in areas which previously have been vulnerable to flooding. </p></reply>

Throughout the period of the discussions between the Irish Authorities and the ECB the confidentiality of matters discussed was emphasised between the parties. However, the ECB has not been approached in relation to documentation requested under specific FOI requests relating to the liquidation of IBRC nor has the ECB requested the Department not to release any such documentation. The ECB has informed my Department that they will not be releasing any information in relation to these discussions.    In normal course my Department will examine all requests received for information under the FOI Acts and assess whether specific information can be released. While the overall aim is to release the information requested the FOI Acts do list specific provisions under which records can be deemed to be &ldquo;exempt records&rdquo; for the purposes of the Acts. The decisions of the Department/public body, in this regard, are subject to a right of appeal by the requester. One such exemption [section 24(2)(e) 1997Act] refers specifically to information communicated in confidence from, to, or within an international organisation, including an organisation or an institution or body of the European Union. Other exemptions provided in the legislation include; meetings of Government; information received in confidence; commercially sensitive information; deliberations of  public bodies; functions and negotiations of public bodies; financial and economic interests of the State; etc. </p><p>  As part of this process My Department will communicate with third parties if consideration is being given to releasing information/documentation received from those parties. In the event that third parties object to information being released the Department will take a view on the nature of the information, the basis on which the information was received or acquired and the views of the third party etc.  The Department will then decide whether the information should be released under the FOI Acts having regard to particular circumstances and the requirements of the public interest. Any decision, therefore as to whether information is released or not by Irish authorities under Freedom of Information legislation enacted in this jurisdiction is a matter for the Irish authorities. While the ECB or other third parties may have a view on the release of particular information the ECB has not and would not seek to influence the proper operation of national legislation.  </p><p>  My Department is committed to the spirit and proper operation of the Freedom of Information Acts 1997-2003.</p></reply>

In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes. These include long-term payments such as Disablement Benefit, the State Pension, Widows, Invalidity and Blind Pensions, Carers Allowance and the One Parent Family Payment, as well as short term benefits such as Job Seekers Benefit. Treating these payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  </p><p>  As a result of maternity benefit payments becoming liable to income tax for all claimants, from 1 July 2013, a number of possible tax outcomes could arise:</p><p>  1. An individual may pay no income tax on their maternity benefit payment as their tax credits will be sufficient to reduce their tax liability to zero.</p><p>  2. An individual may pay income tax on some or all of their maternity benefit payment solely at the standard rate.</p><p>  3. An individual may pay income tax at the standard rate on a portion of the maternity benefit and the higher rate on the balance of the maternity benefit payment.</p><p>  4. An individual may pay income tax on all of their maternity benefit payment at the higher rate.</p><p>  I am fully aware that some employers do not pay a top up payment to their employees whilst on maternity leave. However, in such circumstances many mothers will not be subject to income tax on their maternity benefit payments as their personal credits will ensure that no tax arises on the social welfare income itself. Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case, depends on the total level of income that the individual or couple concerned has in the relevant tax year or years.  </p><p>  I would point out that maternity benefit payments will remain exempt from Universal Social Charge and PRSI. </p><p>  Given the current budgetary constraints I have no plans to introduce a tax exemption along the lines proposed.  </p></reply>

This should not be confused with the comments made by the former Chairman of IBRC which reflected the assumption that IBRC was to continue as originally planned which included the continued payments of interest and capital on the Promissory Notes which will not now be paid.    It is far too early to predict the outcome of the valuation process, the comments made to the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 7th March reflect the already heavily discounted nature of the loan book which had provisions of almost 40% as at the end of June 2012. It will not be possible to conclude for certain whether the value of the assets to be sold by the Special Liquidators is sufficient to compensate NAMA for the amount paid for the net IBRC debt that it has acquired until after the valuation of those assets has been concluded.</p><p>  As part of the role of the liquidators, the assets of IBRC will be valued independently before being sold.  Any assets not sold to third parties at or above the valuation price will be sold to NAMA at the independent valuation.  This ensures a &lsquo;floor&rsquo; price on the assets of IBRC and that where required, assets with limited sale potential now, can be worked through in the medium term by NAMA rather than sold to the best available third party at any price. This approach ensures a fire sale of assets will not occur. This Government&rsquo;s approach is consistent and focused on the best outcome for the Irish State and its people. 	</p></reply>

While the matter was not formally discussed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it was not considered appropriate for the same protocol which is in place for semi-State assets to apply to the disposal of the IBRC assets as the Special Liquidator will only be holding the assets for a short period of time, the sale of those assets is guided in a specified manner and the State is a creditor of IBRC in the context of the liquidation as opposed to an owner of the assets. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Special Liquidators are in the process of devising and implementing a valuation and sales process in respect of the assets of IBRC.

Under these repurchase agreements the 2025 Government Bonds were pledged as collateral by IBRC to Bank of Ireland (under the IBRC repo), and further by Bank of Ireland to the CBI (under the normal Eurosystem refinancing operations) in return for cash which was provided from the Eurosystem to Bank of Ireland and further from Bank of Ireland to IBRC (under the IBRC repo).  As a result, at the time of the IBRC liquidation, the CBI held the 2025 Irish Government Bonds as collateral on behalf of the Eurosystem and IBRC held the cash proceeds of the repurchase agreement between it and BOI.  The Bank of Ireland held neither bonds nor cash, but rather obligations for payment of cash and receipt of bonds with IBRC and offsetting obligations with the CBI.   The liquidation of IBRC constituted an event of default under the IBRC repo with BOI.  As a result, IBRC was obligated to repurchase the bonds from the Bank of Ireland at a repurchase price governed by the IBRC repo.  As IBRC was unable to repurchase these bonds from Bank of Ireland with cash, Bank of Ireland retained the 2025 Irish Government Bonds in fulfilment of IBRC&rsquo;s obligations under IBRC repo. In effect, the 2025 Irish Government Bonds, held as collateral by the Bank of Ireland under IBRC repo, were retained by Bank of Ireland in lieu of IBRC repurchasing these bonds with cash.  </p><p>  After the 2025 Government bond repo agreement between IBRC and Bank of Ireland terminated, the CBI purchased the bond.  This bond was placed in the trading portfolio of the Central Bank, along with the bonds acquired in exchange for the Promissory Notes, and these bonds will be sold as soon as possible, provided conditions of financial stability permit. </p><p>  To specifically respond to the points raised in your question, I am informed by the Bank of Ireland that, as a consequence of the termination of the IBRC repo and subsequent sale of the bonds to the CBI, the Bank of Ireland did not incur a gain or loss on these transactions. </p><p>  In addition, the funding provided to Bank of Ireland by the Eurosystem through the repo with CBI was further provided by Bank of Ireland to IBRC under the IBRC repo.  IBRC&rsquo;s non-payment of that funding back to Bank of Ireland upon default on the IBRC repo did not result in financing being retained by Bank of Ireland, as this financing had been passed to IBRC under the IBRC repo and was not repaid to Bank of Ireland upon the termination of the IBRC repo.</p><p>  Finally, the financing provided to Bank of Ireland by the Eurosystem under the repo through the CBI was provided under ordinary open market operations.  </p></reply>

This email address is published on the Revenue website www.revenue.ie.  Individuals with queries on submission of the 2013 LPT return are advised to use the telephone helpline on 1890 200 255.    Revenue strives to respond to all correspondence including email as quickly as possible and that, in general all queries are answered within normal Revenue customer service standards i.e. 30 days. However, in circumstances where Revenue experiences extremely high volumes of correspondence, priority will be given to the more important issues impacting on the ability of customers to meet their obligations, and as a consequence there may be exceptional instances where some queries are answered outside of the normal standards. </p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the introduction of the LPT, amounting as it does to the largest extension of the self-assessment system in the history of the State, represents a very great administrative challenge for Revenue. As a new service that will have exceptional temporary pressures at particular stages of its initial implementation it is difficult for Revenue to predict the level of contact that can arise during its introduction and, consequently, the resources required to meet customer service demands.</p></reply>

Transparency is one of the guiding principles as set out in our revised Statement of Strategy. With this in mind, the Department has already published the Secretary General&rsquo;s diary on a monthly basis from March 2012 and we intend to continue with this initiative. Details of the diary are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.   The Department also recognises the need for a strong governance framework in order to support and monitor our performance objectives.  During 2012, a number of changes to the governance structures was introduced which I continue to review and improve.</p><p>  For example, the Department modernised the Management Advisory Committee (MAC) process with one in-depth monthly management meeting and three shorter focused meetings on the week&rsquo;s events. In addition, four new subcommittees of the MAC were established.  The Risk, Policy, Transformation and People and Culture subcommittee meetings allow for great in-depth analysis than could occur during MAC meetings.  These are chaired by senior MAC members and report to the MAC and all provide a greater level of internal challenge and debate in relation to the Department&rsquo;s policies.</p></reply>

The debt purchased by NAMA from the Central Bank is a claim debt secured by a floating charge over the assets of IBRC.   The sales proceeds received through the sale of the Company&rsquo;s assets will be used to repay the creditors of the Company subject to the normal legal priorities, as set out in the Companies Act&rsquo;s. Once the costs of the liquidation have been paid payments will be made to those creditors who are classified as preferential creditors. Section 285(7) of the Companies Act, 1936 (as amended) (&ldquo;the Act&rdquo;) provides that preferential debts shall &ldquo;have priority over the claims of holders of debentures under any floating charge created by the company, and be paid accordingly out of any property comprised in or subject to that charge&rdquo;.</p><p>  If, after an independent valuation exercise, the value of the assets sold by the Special Liquidators is not sufficient to compensate NAMA for the amount it paid for the net IBRC debt owed to the Central Bank, then that shortfall will be compensated by the Exchequer which would impact the national accounts. It will not be possible to conclude whether the value of the assets to be sold by the Special Liquidator is sufficient to compensate NAMA until after the valuation has been concluded. If the value of the assets is greater than &euro;12.928bn bonds issued by NAMA then the surplus will go to the liquidation for the benefit of other creditors of IBRC.</p></reply>

In assessing any loan purchase offer, NAMA&rsquo;s key criterion is whether the proposed transaction makes financial sense for the taxpayer. If so, and if NAMA believes that those making the offer have the financial capacity to deliver on it, NAMA then appoints loan sales brokers to market the loans and to deal with offers from the original bidder and other interested parties.  The timing of a sales transaction will be geared towards ensuring that the Agency maximises the value of the loans and therefore the return to the taxpayer. I am advised that NAMA has, to date, sold loans with par balances of &euro;2.5 billion and that parties interested in making serious and realistic bids for loan portfolios are welcome to submit offers to it. If the Deputy is aware of any serious and realistic loan purchase bid made by a credible investor which has been submitted to NAMA but not evaluated by the Agency, I would suggest that he brings it to the attention of the Head of Asset Recovery, NAMA.  </p></reply>

These figures include results arising from a very specific focus on cash businesses including: Construction: 1,306 audits yielding &euro;39.3m; Retailers: 848 audits yielding &euro;22.4m; Landlords/Rental properties: 733 audits yielding &euro;22.4m; Bars and Restaurants: 563 audits yielding &euro;42m; Professionals: 466 audits yielding &euro;13.4m; and Wholesalers: 387 audits yielding &euro;18.4m.</p><p>  These results are included in the Annual Report of the Revenue Commissioners published on Wednesday, April 24th. The report contains detailed statistics on all Revenue activities in 2012, including compliance activities in all its forms.</p><p>  I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that its shadow economy /black market activity includes tackling the evasion of excise duties, such as those on oil, tobacco and alcohol. The Revenue Commissioners put a particular focus in 2012 on the risks associated with fuel laundering, with considerable success. Revenue have informed me that they detected and dismantled 11 oil laundries, and between 2011 and 2012 closed down 89 retail outlets trading in fuel in breach of licensing requirements. There has been large scale compliance with the new licensing provisions and the new monthly return.  Revenue is actively pursuing the minority of traders who are trading while unlicensed and those who have not submitted a return.  In addition, Revenue is now able to track product movements through the distribution chain and is in the process of identifying traders who pose tax risks for priority compliance / audit / enforcement intervention. </p><p>  Revenue is also very active in relation to countering tobacco smuggling, and they have advised me that they had 8,105 seizures, amounting to 95.6 million cigarettes. While the latest survey results suggest that the penetration of the cigarette market by illicit products is being contained, Revenue have advised me that combatting this illegal activity will continue to be a high priority in 2013.</p><p>  Revenue is responsible also for acting against the importation into the country of counterfeit goods, and works closely with right holders in this area. Revenue has advised me that during 2012, there were 5,580 seizures of counterfeit goods with an estimated value of &euro;5,437,334. In the first quarter of 2013, there were 1,540 seizures of IPR infringing goods amounting to 13,685 items with a value of &euro;819,684.</p><p>  Revenue tackles the problem of the shadow economy through a range of compliance and audit interventions including targeted special projects and this work will continue in 2013. Finally, I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they hold regular meetings with trade and representative bodies through The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group where the risks posed by shadow economy activities are discussed.  This engagement will continue in 2013.</p><p>  It is difficult to quantify the expected yield from all of Revenue&rsquo;s compliance activities in 2013.  Revenue, like all public sector bodies, is subject to Government policy on civil service numbers and public expenditure control.  In this context, I am satisfied that the Commissioners are pursuing programmes to maximise voluntary compliance, to redesign processes in order to mitigate risk, and to optimise the impact their compliance interventions by using sophisticated risk analysis.</p></reply>

Work is ongoing to update the costs to 2010 terms but this is not yet complete. Data is not yet available for 2011 as the tax returns for that year are currently being processed for statistical purposes . Tax returns from self-employed for 2012 are not due until the latter part of 2013.</p><p>  It should be noted that there have been changes since this period, i.e. some schemes have been abolished or modified and others have been introduced. For instance, as the Deputy will be aware, virtually all of the area-based and property tax incentive schemes have ended and Finance Act 2012 provided for a cap on property-based Accelerated Capital Allowance Schemes (in line with the tax life of the particular scheme) to be introduced from 1 January 2015. Relevant notes relating to items in the tables are also included.</p><p>Tax reliefs available exclusively for business reasons such as Stock Relief, Exempt Rental Income from Leasing of Farm Land, Capital Allowances,  Rate of 10% for Manufacturing and Certain Other Activities, Group Relief and Research &amp;amp; Development are <i>included in the tables.</i>    A number of tax reliefs, credits and deductions (for example, personal credits, pension contributions, BES, Film relief and property based tax incentives), which are included in the tables are also available to self-employed and PAYE taxpayers, but are not exclusively available for business reasons.</p><p><b>Index of Tables and Notes</b></p><p>  a) Note on the Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009 </p><p>b) Table IT 6 showing Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009. Figures of cost in relation to corporation tax are included in the &#8220;<b>Income Tax and/or Corporation Tax</b>  &#8221; section of this table.</p><p>  c) Notes on Table IT 6</p><p>  d) Note on Green Paper on Pensions</p><p>  e) Estimate of cost of certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax for 2008 and 2009.</p><p>  f) Note on reliefs in respect of which costs are not currently quantifiable or are negligible or are not identifiable within total aggregates.</p><p><b>a) Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009</b></p><p>  The following table IT 6 shows the estimated cost in terms of revenue forgone of the personal tax credits and the main reliefs and deductions allowable under the income tax system. A number of reliefs which apply both to individuals and companies is also included and the cost shown in relation to these reliefs covers income tax and corporation tax. An adjustment is included in the cost figures applying to income tax to compensate for incomplete numbers of tax returns on record at the time of compiling the estimates.</p><p>  The tax credits and reliefs listed in the table serve varying purposes. Many are essentially structural reliefs through which individual tax liabilities are adjusted to reflect relative taxable capacity. The main personal tax credits are a good example of this since they may be regarded as part of the progressive income tax structure representing a band of income chargeable at a zero rate. Others, such as relief for interest paid in full or investment in corporate trades, are tax-based incentives in favour of specific groups or activities which are designed to promote certain aspects of public policy.</p><p>  In computing taxable profits, account needs to be taken in some way of the depreciation of capital assets incurred in earning those profits. To this extent, the figures in the table of the &#8220;costs&#8221; of capital allowances should not be regarded as measuring a &#8220;loss of tax revenue&#8221; on profits. To compute such &#8220;loss&#8221;, regard would have to be had to the excess of the amount of the capital allowances at current rates over the amount of the normal allowances.</p><p>  The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds. The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits.</p><p>  The figures of cost are for 2008 and 2009 and all figures are based on tax due in respect of assessments for each year and not on tax receipts within that year.</p><p>  The figure against each credit or allowance represents the additional tax which would become payable if the tax credit or allowance were withdrawn assuming no consequent change in the behaviour of taxpayers (for example, in relation to the reliefs for savings), or the amounts of payments (for example, interest payable on certain savings schemes might need adjustment to take account of the new tax liability).</p><p>  The numbers of claimants of each credit or relief are shown for both years to the extent that they are available. The numbers included are the taxpayers who would be adversely affected by the withdrawal of the respective credit or relief.</p><p>  In the calculations, each tax credit or allowance has been dealt with separately and on the assumption that the rest of the tax system remained unchanged. It would be therefore inaccurate to calculate the effect of withdrawing all the credits, reliefs and allowances by simply totalling the figures. For example, the costs shown for capital allowances and stock relief are also calculated on the basis of separate withdrawal of these reliefs. Their combined cost would be greater than the sum of the separate costs because allowances are not always fully set off against available profits. For instance, a person with &euro;1,000 gross trading profits, &euro;1,000 capital allowances and &euro;1,000 stock relief would pay no tax if either of the reliefs were withdrawn but would pay tax on &euro;1,000 profits if both reliefs were withdrawn. In this case, the cost of each relief separately is nil but the combined cost is tax on &euro;1,000. Basic data is not available to enable an estimate of the combined cost of these reliefs to be made.</p><p>  The figures for estimates based on tax returns have been grossed up to an overall expected level to adjust for incompleteness in the numbers of returns on record at the time the data was extracted for analytical purposes.</p><p>  Apart from the artists exemption, these figures do not take account of the application of the restriction of reliefs originally provided for in section 17 of Finance Act 2006, which took effect from 1 January 2007.

The review examined, among other things, the current reliefs and incentives for investment in supplementary pensions and the data available on which to base reliable estimates of the costs in revenue foregone to the Exchequer.</p><p>The review drew on newly available 2006 aggregate data on contributions to pension schemes by employers and employees arising from a P35 initiative introduced on foot of provisions that were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality.

This means the figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax. However, the actual Exchequer cost could be lower, particularly in relation to the exempt income items, as the income could be subject to deductions for allowable expenses and other costs thereby reducing the level of income that would be actually subject to tax.</p><p>- Some of the costs shown above are included in the costs shown for capital allowances and section 23 relief in Table IT6.

However based on personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers for the year 2010, the latest year for which this information is available, and making certain assumptions about the data it is estimated that the revenue that would be raised from reducing the level at which individuals can claim interest repayments against tax for residential rental properties from 75% to 40% could be in the region of &euro;157m.  Rental income of companies is returned as net of interest on borrowings the figures for interest are not separately distinguished in corporate tax returns.  There is, therefore, no basis on which an estimate of the cost of reducing the tax relief involved could be provided.  The estimated cost of 2010 residential interest relief is based on assuming that tax relief was allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% and the figure provided could therefore be regarded as the maximum Exchequer cost in respect of those taxpayers.  This figure is subject to adjustment in the event of late returns being filed or where returns already filed are subsequently amended.</p><p>  It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return form 12 is not captured in the Revenue computer system.  However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than &euro;3,174 is required to complete an income tax return form 11.  This return is the source of the figure provided in this reply in respect of individuals.  The level at which interest repayments can be claimed against tax for residential rental properties was reduced from 100% to 75% in section 5 of the Finance Act 2009.  There is no specific proposal in the Programme for Government to decrease the amount of interest on borrowings that can be offset against rental income for tax purposes, however, as a matter of course all such taxation measures and reliefs are considered in the context of the budgetary process.</p></reply>

Universal Social Charge (USC) is payable on an individual's pay and income after allowing for losses incurred in, or capital expenditure incurred for the purposes of a trade.  In relation to both PRSI and USC, pension contributions are not deducted in arriving at the amounts payable.  However, social welfare payments are not liable to either PRSI or USC.   In relation to extending PRSI and USC to other forms of income not already subject to the charge, the position is that, in Budget 2013, I announced that the Minister for Social Protection, Ms. Joan Burton, T.D., would be bringing forward legislation to change PRSI contributions as follows:</p><p>- Where modified PRSI rate payers have income from a trade or profession, such income and any unearned income they have will be made subject to PRSI with effect from the <i>1st of January 2013</i>; and</p><p>- Unearned income for everyone else will become subject to PRSI in <i>2014</i>.  This means that PRSI will be payable on income generated from wealth such as rental income, investment income, dividends and interest on deposits and savings.</p><p>This means that from this year, modified rate contributors who have income from a profession or trade and who were previously not liable to PRSI on that income, are now liable to PRSI at 4% on such income. From next year, all assessed taxpayers, that is, taxpayers who are in the self-assessment system, will be liable to PRSI on their full incomes including rental income, investment income, dividends and interest on deposits and savings.</p><p>  In relation to USC, the position is that this tax, like all other taxes, is reviewed annually in the context of the Budget and Finance Bill cycle.  The Minister for Social Protection has published a booklet entitled &#8220;PRSI contribution rates and user guide from 1 January 2013&#8221; which gives more information and is available at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-30a.288.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013043000057#WRF00800"><p>An annual imputed distribution rate of 5% applies to approved retirement funds (ARFs) with asset values of &euro;2 million or less and also to &lsquo;vested&rsquo; Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs where benefits have commenced) on the same basis.  A higher imputed distribution rate of 6% applies to ARFs and/or &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs with asset values of more than &euro;2 million.  I assume the Deputy is suggesting an increase in the imputed distribution from 6% to 7% for ARFs and/or &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs of more than &euro;2 million in value and an increase from 5% to 6% where the asset values are less than &euro;2 million.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information provided to them in the context of the tax paid on these deemed or imputed distributions does not include information on the value of the ARFs and/or &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs out of which the distributions are deemed to arise.  There is therefore no basis on which a definitive estimate of the impact on the Exchequer of the change mentioned in the question could be compiled.</p><p>  As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the additional tax yield involved, some historical data made available to my Department from private sector sources provides a breakdown of ARFs by value in respect of a number of providers representing an estimated 40% of the ARF market.  There is no similar data available in relation to &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs.  Out of a total value of some &euro;2.4 billion in ARFs under management by these providers where the average ARF value was just over &euro;127,000, the total value of those ARFs representing individual funds under &euro;2 million was &euro;2.3 billion.  The total value of those ARFs representing individual funds of over &euro;2m was &euro;137 million.  Based on a very rough extrapolation of these figures to arrive at a broad potential estimate for the total value of ARFs with assets in these value ranges, the estimated additional income tax yield from applying increased imputed distribution rates to such ARFs as set out above would be about &euro;25 million in a full year.</p><p>  It is important to note that the deemed or imputed distribution measure is designed to encourage draw downs from ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs so that they are used, as intended, to fund a stream of income in retirement in the same way as a retirement annuity, for which ARFs are supposed to operate as a more flexible alternative.  The measure, in itself, does not give rise to significant tax revenues as it does not apply to actual draw-downs from ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs, which are taxed in the normal way.  Moreover, increasing the annual percentage notional distribution for ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs as suggested in the question would further increase the risk that the retirement income derived by the owners from such funds could be depleted before death.</p></reply>

The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on pension contributions.  A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level.  An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans - Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) - by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers.  There is, therefore, only a limited statistical basis for providing definitive figures.  However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that the combined estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from reducing the current annual earnings cap of &euro;115,000 to &euro;70,000 in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be about &euro;130 million.</p></reply>

The change has resulted in significant cost savings in terms of postage, stationery and staff resources.  This arrangement now applies to Local Property Tax (LPT) and customers who file online receive an online acknowledgement and have ongoing access to their return and payment details.  Customers who file and pay using the paper LPT return will not receive a paper receipt.  They will of course have evidence of LPT payments through their own financial institution records.  However, in circumstances where a payment fails for whatever reason, then Revenue will make direct contact with the customer.

Where the consideration exceeds &euro;750,000, any capital gains tax that may be payable is limited so that it cannot exceed 50% of the difference between the amount of the consideration and &euro;750,000.<br /><br /><br />  With effect from 1 January 2014, where an individual aged 66 or over disposes of a business or farm, the threshold by reference to which relief is granted is reduced to &euro;500,000, again with a limit on any capital gains tax payable, where the consideration exceeds &euro;500,000, so that it cannot exceed 50% of the difference between the amount of the consideration and &euro;500,000.<br /><br /><br />  As an interim measure, to facilitate any individual who wants to avail of the relief before the age and threshold changes take effect, an individual aged 66 or over who disposes of a business or farm in the year to 31 December 2013 will qualify for full relief by reference to the &euro;750,000 limit.</blockquote>  Under Section 599, which provides for relief for an individual who passes on his business or farm to his or her child, the relief operates on a similar basis to Section 598, except that the consideration limit is &euro;3 million (introduced in Finance Act 2012) and there is no marginal relief.  Therefore, any farmer aged 55 or over who passes on a farm to a child of his or hers which has a value of up to &euro;3 million will be entitled to full relief from capital gains tax.</p><p>  As I mentioned in my Budget Speech of 2012, the intention of modifying the retirement relief from Capital Gains Tax is to better incentivise the timely transfers of farms and businesses before the current owners reach the age of 66. This approach is in keeping with the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine of encouraging timely transfer of farm assets and improving the age profile of farming. Both the Commission on Taxation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine made recommendations regarding the capping of the Section 599 relief at &euro;3 million and these recommendations were considered in the context of the amendments made to the reliefs.  The intention of the more favourable reliefs for individuals who dispose of their businesses or farms between the ages of 55 and 66, relative to those who do so from 66 onwards is to encourage the passing on of those businesses or farms to a younger generation, thereby encouraging entrepreneurship and the increased productive use of business assets and farms.</p><p>  In your question you state that an 85 year old person could incur a capital gains tax liability of &euro;125,000. Based on the current rate of capital gains tax, this would mean that the person would have made a chargeable gain of in the region of &euro;380,000 and where the business or farm was sold, would have realised a significant consideration on the disposal.  In such circumstances, a contribution in the form of capital gains tax is considered appropriate. In the case of a farmer transferring his or her farm to a child, the threshold of &euro;3 million is considered to be sufficiently high to ensure that in all but the exceptionally large farms this threshold will ensure that no capital gains tax charge will arise.  If a capital gains tax charge should arise on the exceptionally large farms, it is considered appropriate that capital gains tax should be paid on any gain arising.  The changes to these reliefs will apply to disposals arising on or after 1 January 2014.  Accordingly, it is too soon to comment definitively on their impact at this stage.  However, the reliefs will be kept under review.</p></reply>

Local Property Tax (LPT) is a self-assessed tax and is chargeable in respect of a building or a part of a building that is in use or that is suitable for use as a residence.  However, it is not chargeable on the part of a building in respect of which commercial rates are payable.  If the adjoining living quarters are not included for the purpose of commercial rates, the amount of LPT will be based on the &ldquo;chargeable value&rdquo; of the living quarters.</p><p>  According to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) the chargeable value of a residential property is defined as the price that the unencumbered fee simple of the property or the residential part of a property, might be expected to fetch on a sale on the open market were the property to be sold on the valuation date in a particular year in a manner that would secure the best possible price for the property and with the benefit of any access to the property that would have existed prior to the sale.  This type of hypothetical open market valuation applies to all types of residential property including residential property that is adjoined to or is contained within commercial property, where commercial rates are not payable on the residential element of the property.  The open market value is based on a hypothetical sale; therefore it is not relevant that there may be difficulties in selling a property or that there may be a limited market for a particular type of property.</p><p>  The owner of the business will be required to establish the chargeable value of the adjoining living quarters on 1 May 2013.  If the chargeable value is less than &euro;1m, the LPT liability will depend on the chargeable band into which this chargeable value falls. The rate of LPT on properties valued up to &euro;1 million is 0.18%.  As there is a banding system for properties the owner will not be required to provide a precise value for the adjoining living quarters if they are valued under &euro;1 million.  Properties valued over &euro;1m are liable at 0.18% on the first &euro;1 million in value and 0.25% on any balance over that amount.</p></reply>

The Report reflects the impact and importance of key actions and activities by Revenue in securing the critically important tax receipts for the Exchequer, in maintaining and building on high levels of timely compliance, in responding to non compliance through its range of audit and compliance intervention programmes, in addressing shadow economy activity and serious fraud and criminality in relation, for example, to tobacco smuggling, fuel laundering and illicit drugs importation. The Report also reflects excellent work done by Revenue in reducing the administrative burden on businesses saving over &euro;85 million per year for businesses and in reducing its own administrative costs.</p><p>  In the context of Revenue's broad and multifaceted strategic and operational role, I am concerned, inter alia, with collection of the tax that is due to the State but in a way that recognises the challenge for business in meeting their on-going tax compliance and payment obligations, given the difficult environment for business and cashflow constraints at present, the impact on compliant businesses and tax receipts of those who engage in tax evasion and avoidance and the impact of smuggling and associated illegal activity. I am also concerned that Ireland's economic and financial development is supported by a tax and customs regime that supports enterprise and business and contributes to our economic recovery and social development and ultimately helps restore the sustainability of the public finances. Revenue&rsquo;s work and performance is, therefore, of considerable significance and importance. I acknowledge the innovative and professional approach by Revenue to discharging its role. I reiterate my strong personal support and that of the Government for the work of Revenue and commend them for the performance and results delivered in 2012.</p></reply>

Finance Act 2013 was passed into law on 27th March and section 17 of the Act, which makes provision for the pre-retirement access to AVCs announced in the Budget, has effect from that date. Section 17 introduces a new section 782A into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides members of occupational pension schemes with a three-year window of opportunity to draw down, on a once-off basis, up to 30% of the accumulated value of certain AVCs made by them, including additional voluntary PRSA contributions made to AVC PRSAs. Where AVCs are subject to a pension adjustment order, both parties to the order may exercise the option independently in respect of their respective "share" of the AVCs.</p><p>  The procedures set out in the legislation for exercising the AVC access option are straight forward and I have outlined these hereunder. However, in addition to these procedures, I am aware from discussions which my Department and the Revenue Commissioners have had with various pension industry representative bodies, that the administrators of AVC funds will also be putting administrative procedures and systems in place to facilitate the access option at an operational level. I understand that these administrative and systems procedures are in the process of being finalised.</p><p>  The likelihood is, of course, that an individual contemplating availing of the option will firstly contact his pension fund administrator by phone or email to establish what he or she needs to do. In that regard, the legislation requires the individual to give an irrevocable written instruction to the administrator of the fund that he or she wishes to avail of the option. Provided the individual qualifies for the encashment option, the administrator acts on the instruction by determining the value of the AVC fund and paying an amount, not exceeding 30% of the value, to the individual subject to deduction of the appropriate amount of tax. The amount paid is treated as emoluments to which Schedule E applies and tax is collected at source under the PAYE system. The legislation requires the administrator to deduct tax at the higher rate of 41%, unless the administrator has received from Revenue a tax credit certificate in respect of the individual. The payments are specifically exempt from USC and PRSI.</p><p>   I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in advance of any payment of AVCs being made, the individual exercising the option should contact his or her Revenue Office for a Certificate of Tax Credits and Standard Rate Cut-off point in respect of the AVC payment. It may be the case that the pension fund administrator will contact Revenue on behalf of the individual, but where the individual is applying directly to Revenue he or she would need to advise Revenue of the pension fund administrator's registered number (i.e. employer number) so that Revenue can forward the Certificate to the correct administrator. The Certificate will indicate the Standard Rate Cut-off Point and tax credits, if any, appropriate to the AVC access payment and facilitate the deduction of the correct amount of tax by the administrator.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware the Relationship Framework with AIB provides that the State will not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the bank or their management decisions. This framework is published on the Department of Finance website. I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF. Neither the Central Bank nor the Department of Finance has a statutory function in relation to interest rate decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time.   While this decision by AIB is regrettable it is strictly a commercial decision by the board of AIB and I understand that this increase now brings AIB in line with the market average. The standard variable rates charged by the Irish banks are significantly below the equivalent rates by banks in the rest of the euro area, even though many of these banks have far lower funding costs.</p><p>  It must be remembered that in order to fund mortgages the bank must borrow at current wholesale and deposit rates which are currently higher than the ECB base rate and the bank must ensure that the rate it lends at is economically sustainable and provides a return for the bank and ultimately the State as its shareholder. It would not be fair for 2.1 million taxpayers to subsidise 138,000 owner occupier mortgages, especially when the vast majority of these mortgage holders can afford to pay their mortgages.</p><p>  I understand that the Central Bank of Ireland pays attention to the effect of any increases in the standard variable rate, on mortgage arrears and would no doubt be concerned if banks were exacerbating their arrears problem and as such impairing their on-going viability, from such actions.</p></reply>

While there are no specific exemptions or financial concessions from LPT for householders in flood prone areas, the following information would be of relevance in these cases.  As LPT is a self-assessed tax, it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  For the purposes of LPT, properties valued under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands - an initial band from &euro;0 to &euro;100,000 and between &euro;100,001 and &euro;1 million a range of &euro;50,000 in each band - and property owners will not be required to provide a precise value for their property.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners have prepared valuation guidance which, together with the owner's own knowledge of her/his property, will assist in assessing its value.  The guidance includes an on-line guide that will provide indicative property valuation bands depending on the property type, age and location.  If a property has certain unique features, is smaller or larger than the average for the area, is in a significantly poor state of repair or has exceptional features, the owner will have to factor this into her/his assessment of the valuation of the property.  In this context, location and the risk of flooding are factors which are likely to impact on the market value of a property and which a property owner would generally take into account in valuing the property.  Where a property owner feels that the Revenue guidance is not indicating a reasonable valuation for their property, s/he should make her/his own assessment.  I am advised by Revenue that further information on this issue has been published by way of Frequent Asked Questions, which can be found at on their website at<i></i><i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i><font color="#104160">.</font></p><p>  As I have previously advised the House, where the Revenue guidance is used in an honest manner, the property valuation made by a property owner will not be challenged by Revenue in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter.</p></reply>

The Review recognised that "many internationally orientated Irish companies preferred option is to raise capital overseas". These companies may be able to exploit the funding opportunities offered by the JOBS Act.  The Government has taken a number of significant initiatives aimed at providing equity support for SMEs. The NPRF has announced two funds which will invest in SMEs. The SME Equity Fund (total fund size &euro;300 million - &euro;350 million / NPRF commitment &euro;125 million) will focus on investing in healthy businesses seeking to grow, including those with overleveraged balance sheets. The fund, which has received commitments from other-third party investors, is operational and is managed by Carlyle Cardinal Ireland.</p><p>  The SME Turnaround Fund (total effective fund size &euro;100 million / NPRF commitment &euro;50 million) will invest in underperforming businesses which are at or close to the point of insolvency but have the potential for financial and operational restructuring. Typically 40 per cent of the capital invested by the fund will be used to buy the business and 60 per cent will be used to finance the turnaround in order to place it on a sustainable long-term footing. The fund is also operational and is managed by Better Capital.</p><p>  In addition, the NPRF is also currently reviewing additional SME fund opportunities that would complement these funds, with the objective that the eventual suite of funds would have the capacity to invest across the full spectrum of SME financing needs.</p><p>  The 10 point Tax reform plan to help small business announced in the 2013 budget is another initiative which is aimed at assisting SMEs gain access to funding. These measures complement measures already being undertaken by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and bodies under its aegis. In particular, Innovation Fund Ireland and Development Capital Fund Ireland provide equity for SMEs.</p><p>  The Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee scheme addresses the situation where the SME is outside the risk appetite of the banks. This can arise because the SME's lack of collateral or the banks' lack of understanding of the business model, the market, the sector or the technology. The three main SME lenders are all participating in the Guarantee scheme.</p><p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme will provide loans of up to &euro;25k to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, who have commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.</p><p>  The SME State Bodies Group was established in 2012 to both develop key policy initiatives to support SME access to credit and other forms of finance, and to ensure their implementation. It will continue in 2013 to engage intensively in proactively addressing issues associated with SME funding and financing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders through the SME Funding Consultation Committee. My officials also meet frequently with additional stakeholders who wish to contribute to policy development in relation to access to finance.</p><p>  One of the actions assigned to the State Bodies Group under the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 is to "Investigate the potential for alternative funding mechanisms including peer to peer lending, supply chain finance and crowdfunding."</p><p>  A matrix on SME funding has been completed and published on Department of Finance website and smallbusinessfinance.ie website. This matrix outlines various sources of funding available to SME and provides contact information for them.</p><p>  Crowd funding is in its infancy in Ireland. I am aware of a peer to peer credit website which was recently launched in Ireland. Irish entities, particularly in the creative fields, have accessed other crowd funding sites. However, the issue of crowdsourcing equity and securities regulations is not an issue which has been raised with my Department. Company Law comes under the aegis of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

For individuals on low incomes the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a system of deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers where there is an inability to pay the tax and certain specified conditions are met.  A person who qualifies for full deferral can opt to defer 100% of the LPT liability.  A person who qualifies for part deferral can opt to defer 50% of the liability and must pay the balance of LPT.  On 25 April I provided details on the option of deferring payment of LPT based on income threshold in my reply to PQ 19691.  I am advised by the Commissioners that information on all deferral options are outlined in the Guidelines on Deferral or Part Deferral of Local Property Tax, which are available on Revenue's website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>.</p><p>  For LPT purposes, a residential property is defined as any building or structure (or part of a building) which is used as, or is suitable for use as, a dwelling and includes any shed, outhouse, garage or other building or structure and includes grounds of up to one acre.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that a liability for LPT will arise where a person owns a residential property on the liability date which will be 1 May 2013 for the year 2013.  LPT is a self-assessed tax and I am advised that if a property is not suitable for use as a dwelling, the liable person is obliged to notify the Revenue Commissioners as soon as possible after they receive their LPT Return, outlining why they consider a charge to LPT does not arise on the property and they must include relevant supporting documentation - for example, an engineer's report.</p></reply>

Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional resource teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours, which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</p><p>  Resource teaching hours may therefore be provided for children with Down syndrome either under the General Allocation Model, or through low incidence allocation.</p><p>  I have asked the National Council for Special Education to provide me with policy advice on the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability. This advice will be included in the NCSE's comprehensive policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs which is currently in preparation and which is expected in the coming months.</p></reply>

As amendments were introduced in the Seanad it will be necessary to return to the Dail after conclusion in the Seanad.  The Bill is scheduled to be taken in the D&aacute;il to report back on the Seanad amendments on Thursday, 2 May.  Following enactment of the Bill, I will determine a date for commencement of the Act and the establishment of all of the Education and Training Boards, including the Dublin and Dun Laoghaire Education and Training Board.</p><p>  In October 2011, my officials concluded an agreement with SIPTU, the trade union representing the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of VECs, on a redeployment scheme for CEOs in the context of the Croke Park agreement. Arising from the implementation of the redeployment scheme, Mr Paddy Lavelle has been assigned as CEO Designate to the Dublin and Dun Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  His appointment as CEO of that Education and Training Board will commence in accordance with Section 14(5) of the Bill on the day which is appointed by Order pursuant to Section 8 of the Bill, once enacted.</p><p>  Also, in October 2011, I announced the headquarter locations where VECs are being merged as a result of the Government decision to reduce the number of VECs to 16.  In relation to the specific merger of Co. Dublin VEC and Dun Laoghaire VEC, I have decided that the headquarters of the Education and Training Board will be in Tallaght.  I expect that headquarters staff of Dun Laoghaire VEC will move to the designated headquarters location in Tallaght as soon as feasible.  While the detail of the arrangements of the move will be a matter for the CEO of the new Education and Training Board to work through and judge what the best approach is to ensure the optimum approach to service delivery, I expect that the office in Dun Laoghaire will remain open for some time and that the approach to redeployment will be measured and considered.  The establishment of SOLAS is also likely to have a bearing on the precise arrangements to be made.</p></reply>

Since then all major school building projects, where site conditions and circumstances allow and where economically viable to do so, can incorporate a rainwater harvesting system into their accommodation brief.

It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students.  I have already acknowledged that bringing guidance within quota is challenging for schools.  However the alternative was to adjust the PTR staffing allocations.  The budget decision sheltered the impact for all DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations.</p><p>  Initial findings of a recent comprehensive survey by the National Centre for Guidance in Education on schools provision for guidance would suggest that even though there has been a cut in the allocation schools continue to prioritise the guidance programme and within it have increased group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle.  This approach maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support.</p></reply>

Most recently, in March 2013, the previously pre-qualified Contractors were asked to confirm that nothing had changed since the previous pre-qualification of Contractors which would affect their ability to fulfil the requirements to tender.  Some of the pre-qualified Contractors were unable to provide the necessary confirmation and therefore a new pre-qualification process was necessary.

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a Vocational Educational Committee (VEC) school to the VEC in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld. </p></reply>

The redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers is key to the Department's ability to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers. Thereafter, schools are required under the panel arrangements to fill permanent vacancies from supplementary panels comprised of eligible fixed-term (temporary/substitute) and part-time teachers.</p><p>  Following a review of the operation of the subsidiary and supplementary panel arrangements in the 2012/13 school year and in order to enable the redeployment process to operate in a more efficient manner a number of changes are being introduced with effect from the 2013/14 school year.  All eligible applicants who meet the eligibility criteria will be placed on the relevant supplementary panels. There will no longer be separate subsidiary panels.</p><p>  The Subsidiary and Supplementary Special National Panels are being phased out and no new applications are being accepted. This decision by the Department reflects the wider availability of primary teachers who are qualified to work in all settings which was not the case when this panel was originally set up. Access to the Supplementary Special National Panel for the 2013/14 school year will be confined to those teachers who were on the Subsidiary or Supplementary Special National Panels in the 2012/13 school year and who did not secure a permanent teaching post. My Department has contacted these teachers directly. A further change is that the Supplementary Special National Panel for the 2013/14 school year will be used only for filling permanent teaching posts in special schools that are not otherwise required for the redeployment of surplus permanent teachers. The arrangements for panel access for fixed term (temporary), substitute and part-time teachers for the 2013/14 school year are set out in Circular 0038/2012 which is available on the Department website.</p></reply>

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for. Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability. There is not presently a distinct disability category of Down syndrome for resource allocation purposes. As such, it is not possible to advise of the number of children with Down syndrome who are attending mainstream primary education or who have moved from the mild to moderate general learning difficulty category. I have asked the National Council for Special Education to provide me with policy advice on the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability. This advice will be included in the NCSE's comprehensive policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs which is currently in preparation and which is expected in the coming months. </p></reply>

The applicant should in the first instance contact the relevant awarding body and notify them of the change in circumstances. Where a grant application is refused, the reason for the refusal is given by the grant awarding authority. An applicant may appeal the decision to the relevant awarding authority. Where the appeals officer decides to reject the appeal, the applicant may appeal this decision to my Department or the independent appeals board, as appropriate. </p></reply>

The Department of Education and Skills Circular on seniority (DES Circular No. 59/06), which was agreed with both IMPACT and SIPTU, the 2 Unions representing SNAs is clear in that it states that "Seniority is important in determining which SNAs should be offered reduced hours or have their employment terminated when the allocation of the school is reduced." DES Circular No. 59/06 is entirely silent on the allocation of sanctioned additional SNA support hours.  Accordingly, it is entirely a matter for the school/VEC as the employer to determine the most appropriate method of allocating any sanctioned additional SNA support hours granted by the NCSE with a view to effectively meeting the care needs of the pupil/pupils in the school/VEC.  </p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  Another function of the Council is to carry out research and provide expert advice to me, as Minister for Education and Skills, on the educational needs of children with disabilities and the provision of related services.</p><p>  The NCSE has developed a comprehensive programme of research and to date has published 14 completed reports from commissioned studies.  The published reports are all available to download from the NCSE website (www.ncse.ie). In 2009 the NCSE commissioned a three year longitudinal research study specifically to track the experiences and educational outcomes of a cohort of primary, post primary and special school students in a number of case study schools around the country. In total the study followed 140 students in 24 schools.  The researchers gathered evidence from multiple perspectives, including those of students, parents, school-based staff, allied professionals and disability groups in order to fully understand the impact of current provision to support children and young people with special educational needs in both mainstream and special schools. The report from this study is currently being finalised.  It is expected that it will be completed late in 2013 for publication in 2014.  The study has been carried out by researchers at the University of Northampton, UK; Trinity College, Dublin; and the Irish based, Institute of Child Education and Psychology Europe.</p><p>  I also wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has requested the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to provide policy advice to my Department, in accordance with its role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, on the appropriate nature and configuration of educational supports which should be provided to schools to support children with special educational needs. It is intended that the significant resources to support children with Special Educational Needs are deployed to ensure the best possible outcomes for students. The advice will be a key input into achieving this goal. The advice from the National Council for Special Education is expected in the coming months. </p></reply>

Public procurement in Ireland is governed by legal requirements, rules and guidelines set both at national and EU level. The general requirements for goods and general services are set out in the Public Procurement Guidelines - Competitive Process 2004 (revised), whilst those for works and works-related contracts are set out in the Capital Works Management Framework. This guidance incorporates key elements of EU legislation that have been transposed into Irish law and is complemented by circulars and guidance issued by my Department and the National Procurement Service.</p><p>  The most important of the guidance published by my Department includes:</p><p><i>- Public Procurement Guidelines - Competitive Process 2004</i>  , in respect of the procurement of services and supplies - highlighting the need for a competitive process in respect of contracts below the EU threshold values;</p><p><i>- Circular 10/10</i>   - require public bodies to promote participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts;</p><p><i>- the Capital Works Management Framework</i>   - provides a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts and generic template documents are available to download for all contracting authorities to provide a consistent approach to the management of public works projects; and</p><p><i>- Standardisation and simplification of tender documentation (for supplies and services)</i>   - In order to reduce the costs involved in participating or conducting the procurement function, the National Procurement Service has published a suite of model tendering and contract documents which help businesses and buyers to reduce costs. </p><p>All regulations, circulars, guidelines and standard forms are available on the Government's eTenders website at: <i><i>www.eTenders.gov.ie </i></i>for goods and general services and at <i><i>www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie   </i></i>for construction works and related services.</p><p>Under EU Directive on public procurement contracts above certain thresholds must be advertised on the Official Journal of the EU and awarded on the basis of objective and non-restrictive criteria. For works contracts the threshold is &euro;5 million; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments the threshold is &euro;130,000 and for the remainder of public bodies the threshold is &euro;200,000. The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;400,000. For contracts below these thresholds, the general requirement is that they be advertised on the national public procurement website <i><i>www.etenders.gov.ie  </i></i> or, depending on value, awarded on the basis of a competitive process of direct invitation to an adequate number of suitable suppliers.</p><p>  The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. </p><p>  My Department is currently participating at EU level in the review of EU Directives: 2004/17/EC (procurement in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors) and 2004/18/EC (public works, supply and service contracts). Whilst discussions on the revision of these Directives are currently underway, it is clear that one of the key reforms will be the introduction of an EU wide eProcurement procedure which will facilitate shorter procurement procedures.</p><p>  The management of the tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.  In relation to delays being experienced by some local authorities in public procurement processes, these are matters for my colleague Deputy Phil Hogan, Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

This assessment will identify, in the first instance, if other State Bodies, including government departments and the wider public sector have a use for the property.  If there is no other State use for a property the OPW will then consider disposing of the property on the open market, if and when conditions prevail, in order to generate much needed revenue for the Exchequer.  If no State requirement is identified or if a decision is taken not to dispose of a particular property the OPW would consider, community involvement subject to the receipt of an appropriate business case which would indicate that the community/voluntary group has the means to insure, maintain and manage the property.</p></reply>

The Valuation Office operates within the employment control framework set by Government for the public service which imposes an overall staffing ceiling for the Office on an annual basis. In line with this policy, the current staffing complement of the Valuation Office is 135, representing 132.40 whole time equivalent posts. The appointment of officers to carry out the valuation of properties is the function of the Commissioner which he exercises under his powers of delegation set out in section 11 of the Act.  There are two provisions in the legislation governing the assessment of valuations, i.e. revision and revaluation.</p><p>  Revision of valuation is the mechanism used to maintain existing local authority valuation lists. It is used to add new properties to the list, to amend the valuations of altered properties and to remove demolished or defunct properties from the list. The valuations of commercial properties at revision are determined by reference to the net annual values of comparable properties on the same valuation list. That is to say that they are compared with similar type properties in the same local authority area to ensure, in so far as it is possible, that they are all treated equally. While there are some arrears of casework in this area, it is not significant and in any event, revision applications received from the public are disposed of without undue delay. While there has been a marked decrease in the number of applications for revision of valuation in recent years, mainly due to the economic downturn, the vast majority of applications are from the local authorities with whom the Valuation Office is in close liaison, to ensure that priority cases are dealt with as expeditiously as possible and to agree timelines for the delivery of revisions generally.</p><p>  In a revaluation the entire commercial valuation list for a local authority is brought up-to-date by reference to values at a specific valuation date and the entire list is published on one date (usually 31 December) and comes into effect for rating purposes on 1 January the following year.  To-date, revaluations of the commercial list have been completed in South Dublin, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire County Council areas and the revaluation programme for the Dublin City Council area is currently underway and is expected to be completed by 31st December, 2013. Additionally, the revaluation of properties in all the local authority areas of Waterford and Limerick will be completed in 2013 and 2014 respectively.</p><p>  The Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2012 which had its second stage reading in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 11th October, 2012 provides for a number of initiatives  to accelerate the overall revaluation programme, such as the piloting of a self-assessment scheme of valuation in one local authority area, which if it proves successful could be extended to other areas. There is also provision in the Bill to allow for the assessment of valuations by contract valuers under an external delivery scheme which is also being initiated as a pilot project. The Bill also contains provisions to streamline the overall process of revaluation and the appeal mechanisms available to ratepayers subsequent to the revaluation.</p></reply>

For this reason it is only possible to provide an estimate for the amount spent on lighting. The OPW is responsible for buildings occupied by central Government Departments and some state agencies. The total annual energy expenditure in these buildings is estimated at &euro;32M. Approximately 65% of this is on electricity. It is estimated that lighting accounts for 40%-50% of electricity in office and similar type buildings.  Based on these assumptions, the estimated expenditure on lighting in OPW buildings is &euro;8.3M - &euro;10.4M.  There are no figures available for the cost of lighting in the wider public sector.</p></reply>

As part of this, Government has agreed an end-2014 serving numbers target of 282,500 (whole time equivalent).  At end-2012 there were just over 290,500 (whole time equivalent) public servants.  Therefore, over these two years a further reduction of some 8,000 staff is required, across the system.</p><p>  This reduction will be facilitated by the introduction of improved service delivery models, shared services among civil and public service bodies and other innovations which will allow service levels to be maintained with fewer staff.  The required reduction of staff will be managed over the course of the period, taking account of natural retirements and some limited, priority recruitment. The Government has decided that Voluntary Redundancy will be introduced in certain targeted sections of the Public Service where staff surpluses are identified by management and where redeployment is not suitable.  The Government is committed to making fundamental changes to the way the public service operates to safeguard the delivery of essential frontline services in a way that is in keeping with the needs of a modern society while driving value for money for the citizen.</p></reply>

In relation to measures to make senior civil servants more accountable I am committed to bringing forward the necessary legislative changes or other reforms to meet the objective of ensuring greater clarity and certainty regarding the legal relationship between Ministers and their civil servants and the appropriate accountabilities that apply in each case.  I have asked the Government Reform Unit in my Department to carry out a review of the current accountability framework for ministers and civil servants set out in the Ministers and Secretaries Acts and the Public Service Management Act, 1997.</p><p>  Work is now at a very advanced stage in my Department in finalising a consultation paper based on the outcome of that review.  The paper examines the current legislative framework underpinning civil service accountability in these statutes, as well as the current administrative and organisational accountability arrangements in place.  It also explores the international practice and developments in this area. The development of the consultation paper was also informed by discussions held in 2012 with a number of international and national experts as well as by discussions with senior officials at a small number of round table meetings.  I expect to bring this paper to Government shortly to seek approval for the publication of the consultation paper.  It is intended that the paper should act as a basis for a process of wider consultation on the proposed reform options.  I look forward to hearing the views of the Deputy and other members of this House in the course of this consultation.</p></reply>

The last Budget specifically contained a ten point tax reform plan to support small businesses. The measures contained in the Budget are intended to assist small businesses in a number of ways, including:</p><p>Helping their cash flow position;</p><p>Helping them access funding more easily;</p><p>Reducing the costs associated with the administrative burden of tax compliance;</p><p>Boosting demand for their products in new markets abroad;</p><p>Incentivising firms to create jobs.</p><p>  As regards labour costs for small and medium enterprises, the economy has in recent years achieved very significant improvements. The European Commission, in its most recent forecast, projected that Irish unit labour costs will improve by 23 per cent relative to the euro area average over the period 2009 to 2014.  In this regard, I have been engaged in a continuous process of reform to improve Ireland's competitiveness by enhancing wage flexibility while also ensuring protection for vulnerable workers. Last year, I reduced the overall number of Joint Labour Committees (JLCs). I asked the Labour Court to undertake a review of remaining JLC's in line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act which I introduced last year. Last week, the Labour Court submitted to me its Review on the Reform of the remaining JLC's. I view this report very much within the context of the continuous process of reform in the area that is designed to improve Ireland's competitiveness by enhancing wage flexibility while also ensuring protection for vulnerable workers. Specifically, the Report suggests a template on how many Committees will continue in existence, and the format within which they will operate over the next five years. </p><p>  The Government is determined to maintain a focus on competitiveness and, to that end, Forf&aacute;s, in conjunction with my Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Protection has been tasked under the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 to assess the potential for further actions to support improvements in labour market competitiveness.</p><p>  Finally, my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, recently announced details of a new initiative, the JobsPlus scheme, which will incentivise businesses to hire additional employees from the Live Register.  This innovative job creation scheme is focused on the long-term unemployed, providing a cash-flow benefit to businesses which hire jobseekers who have been on the Live Register for 12 months or more.</p></reply>

These site visits were from new companies visiting the location for the first time and from senior executives of existing companies.   </p><p>As Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial. Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.   </p><p>  The d West Region, which includes Clare, has been particularly successful in recent years in terms of attracting inward investment from FDI companies. There are 59 IDA client companies in the d-West Region employing 7,885 people. IDA Ireland has strong relationships with these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites. </p><p>  I am mindful that, in order to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for FDI projects, it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014. This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development. </p><p>  In the meantime, IDA Ireland has assured me that it will in 2013, in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s recently announced 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, seek to target more than 130 new investments, secure &euro;500 million of R&amp;D expenditure and create 13,000 new jobs in its client companies. </p></reply>

Work is now advancing on the next stage to allow for ratification of the Agreement.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, a Referendum is required to be carried to allow for the transfer of limited jurisdictional powers to the Unified Patent Court relating solely to patent disputes.  In advance of ratification, significant preparatory work is necessary which is expected to take up to eighteen months to complete.  This work includes setting the Rules of Procedure of the Court, selection and training of Judges, setting up an ICT system to provide for case management at the Court etc.  </p><p>  The UPC will not impact on substantive patent law in Ireland or on the operation of the Courts in Ireland which will continue to play a role in the determination of patent- related disputes that come before the Irish Courts.</p><p>  When operational, the UPC will provide a system of arbitration for patent-related disputes.  This will be in relation to European patents that are granted as at present by the European Patent Office in Munich and, patents that will be granted under the new unitary patent regime.  The unitary patent will provide a new option for Irish business to protect their patents in a cost effective manner by filing a single application and thereby obtain patent protection in the territories of the 25 participating States (with the exception, thus far, of Spain and Italy).   The unitary patent and the UPC are interlinked in that both will enter into effect simultaneously.  </p><p>  The Agreement on the UPC provides that it will comprise of a Court of First Instance and a Court of Appeal.  The Court of First Instance will be made up of three divisions namely: the central division, local divisions and possible regional divisions.  The Court of Appeal is to be located in Luxembourg and will also serve as the Court Registry.</p><p>  1) Central division: The Central Division of the Patent Court will be located in Paris. Two specialist sub-divisional courts will be established, one in London for cases involving &lsquo;chemistry patents&rsquo; (including pharmaceutical products) and the other in Munich for mechanical engineering cases.</p><p>  2) Local division: It is possible under the Agreement for each contracting State to set up a local division.  </p><p>  3) Regional division: The option also exists under the Agreement to form a regional division i.e. where two or more contracting states would join together to function as a local division for participating countries.  </p><p>  Thus, Contracting States will have the option to set up a local division of the Court, join a possible regional division or, confer jurisdiction on the central division of the Court alone.  All States intending to ratify the UPC Agreement will need to decide, in advance of ratification, on the particular Court structure that it proposes to adopt.  As Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the UPC arrangement raises issues that fall within the remit of jurisdictional arrangements in the Courts area generally and thus are of interest to my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, my Department is in contact with that Department on this issue.  </p><p>  In relation to arbitration and mediation under the UPC Agreement, Lisbon and Ljubljana will host Patent Arbitration and Mediation Centres.</p></reply>

These requirements are largely reflected in the Companies Act, 1963, the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 and the European Communities (Companies: Group Accounts) Regulations 1992, as amended.  The EU Eleventh Company Law Directive, implemented as the European Communities (Branch Disclosures) Regulations, 1993, addresses the requirements applicable to branches of EEA companies.  Irish subsidiaries of EEA companies can submit the audited group accounts of their parent to the Registrar of Companies instead of their own individual accounts provided certain conditions are met.  EEA companies that have an Irish branch are required to submit only the company accounts to the Registrar of Companies. Irish companies that are subsidiaries of EEA companies and which are themselves parent companies need not produce consolidated accounts provided certain conditions are met.  </p><p>  There are similar provisions for subsidiaries of non-EEA companies.  In such cases the consolidated accounts of the EEA or non-EEA group must be submitted to the Registrar of Companies.  </p><p>  I have no plans to amend this disclosure regime in relation to specific sectors in the economy, as this would be open to accusations of discrimination and, were it to be required generally in the economy, it could have implications in terms of business costs and attracting foreign direct investment.</p></reply>

The definition of a &quot;stillborn child&quot; is contained in section 2(1) of that Act and provides that a stillborn child means a child who, at birth, weighs not less than 500 grammes or has a gestational age of not less than 24 weeks.  In addition to either of these two criteria the child must show no sign of life.</p><p>  Registration of stillbirths was first provided for in the Stillbirths Registration Act 1994. The definition of a stillbirth contained in that Act was carried forward to the 2004 Act. When the 1994 Act was passed by the Oireachtas, detailed consideration was given as to what the most appropriate definition of a stillbirth should be. The position varies from country to country. Some countries use gestational age only, while others use weight, or a combination of both. The preferred criterion of the World Health Organisation is weight, as it is more objectively determined than gestational age. At the time, it was considered that the definition of a stillbirth should be as wide as possible, consistent with accepted medical norms, and it is on this basis that the criteria described above were decided upon.</p><p>  It is very distressing for families trying to deal with tragic circumstances such as these.  Should clarification be required in relation to the registration of births, deaths or still births the local registrar should be contacted.</p></reply>

Included in the &lsquo;other scheme&rsquo; category, there were two rent supplement overpayments recorded in 2011 as a result of a person being in prison.</p><p>  In order to ensure that payments do not continue when a person is imprisoned, data-matching between the Irish Prison Service (IPS) and this Department is undertaken.  This data is currently exchanged on a weekly basis and any social welfare claims in payment are stopped as soon as possible after the person is imprisoned.  In this manner, overpayments are minimised and the opportunity to continue to receive a payment while in prison is virtually eliminated.  </p><p>  The data provided by the IPS relates to the date a person actually goes into prison, as opposed to a sentence date given in court, which may not always correspond to the date of entry into prison.

The first two elements involve the enhancement of the website www.keepingyourhome.ie and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears.</p><p>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders.  This advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.  This panel is available on a county by county basis on the website www.keepingyourhome.ie.</p><p>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender advises the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &euro;250 to an accountant of the borrower&rsquo;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  </p><p>  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.</p><p>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as required by borrowers.  The advisory framework is being monitored on an on-going basis and a full review of the service will be undertaken in June 2013.  The review will be undertaken to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and will encompass all aspects of the service including if participation is extended to other interested parties, the criteria that would be required in terms of relevant qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc.  I have had no meetings on this issue with the Professional Insurance Brokers Association to date. However, all interested organisations will have an opportunity to input to the review of the service in due course.</p></reply>

The Intreo model involves an enhanced engagement process involving individual profiling, group interviews and early one-to-one sessions between care managers and unemployed clients. The process also involves an accelerated claim decision process. All of these elements are being rolled out progressively across all offices. When all elements are in place in any one office, the office is rebranded as an Intreo office. To date, twelve full Intreo offices have now been opened and service performance has improved in all of these offices.  It is intended to open about 30 Intreo offices during 2013 and complete the rollout during 2014.</p><p>  Enhanced engagement with employers at local level is also part of the new process and this is progressing well.  A dedicated Employer Engagement Unit has been established and an Employer Engagement Manager is available in each region to support and advise employers at each stage of the employment process including the advertisement of opportunities and sourcing potential candidates from the Live Register.</p><p>  The Department currently contracts with external providers for the delivery of both the Local Employment Service (LES) and Job Clubs. These provide employment services, including career planning, CV preparation, engagement with employers and job search/matching assistance etc. </p><p>Following a procurement process, the Department engaged the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion (<i>Inclusion</i>) in November 2012 to provide expert advice and assistance with the design and delivery of a commercial model for the contracted provision of employment services.  The Department is currently considering the <i>Inclusion</i>   report and any subsequent process of engagement with private providers will be undertaken in accordance with normal public procurement procedures.</p></reply>

Each contract is reviewed on an annual basis. As part of the review process the Department undertakes a structured appraisal of that provider&rsquo;s performance with each element of provider performance being scored against a common rating scale used to assess all Job Clubs. Following an evaluation of Bawnogue Unemployed Group Limited, the Department did not believe that it could justify the renewal of the contract and notified Bawnogue Unemployment Group Ltd. of this decision in January 2013.  The annual contract with Bawnogue Unemployed Group Limited subsequently expired on 29 March 2013 but was fully funded by the Department up to that date. </p><p>  The Department is considering alternative arrangements for the provision of job club services in the area and is currently delivering employment services in the area through the Local Employment Service (Bawnogue office) and the Department&rsquo;s employment services office in Clondalkin.  </p><p>  The question of the Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings Regulations does not appear to arise in this case as there is no transfer of an undertaking or a defined economic entity to carry on the activities previously provided by Bawnogue.  </p><p>  With regard to salaries and redundancy payments, the Department is not the employer and therefore such matters are issues for the company itself to address. However, where a company/employer is unable to pay statutory redundancy to employees it is open to them to avail of the Department&rsquo;s redundancy and insolvency payments&rsquo; scheme, details of which are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  The Department is committed to the provision of quality job club services and will continue to evaluate job clubs to ensure the funds disbursed to fund their services are properly and effectively discharged to provide effective services to jobseekers and to facilitate the continuous improvement of the service. </p></reply>

The savings target for 2013 is &euro;710 million, an increase of over &euro;40m on 2012.</p><p>  Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities and are an estimate of the value of the various control activities across the schemes in payment.  It is important to remember that control savings are not actual monies recovered by the Department but are a good indication of the increase in social welfare expenditure that would occur without these activities taking place.  Without this control work, social welfare expenditure would over time increase by this amount.  These activities also have a deterrent or knock-on effect, which are not readily quantifiable in monetary terms.</p><p>  Controls are exercised at both the initial claim stage and at subsequent stages during the claim life cycle. Claims are reviewed on a regular and targeted basis. Means-tested payments are reviewed at certain intervals or when there are indications that changes in circumstances have not been reported to the Department. Those in receipt of illness payments are called for a medical examination by the Department's medical assessors.  Customers in receipt of unemployment payments are checked on a regular basis to verify continued compliance with such requirements as being available for and genuinely seeking employment.</p><p>  Current measures to control fraud and abuse also include desk reviews of claim papers, home visits, the issue of mail-shots to selected customers, database checking and data matching with other organisations.</p><p>  In addition, the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit focuses on planned and systematic control activity and projects.  The concentration is on those schemes and sectors where the incidence of social welfare fraud is most pronounced.  It works in conjunction with other agencies to tackle social welfare fraud and abuse.</p><p>  Furthermore INTREO, the integrated employment and support service currently being rolled out across the Department&rsquo;s local office network, comprehensively seeks to activate and review customers, where up to now three separate agencies had this role.

The government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the gradual implementation of a guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly, require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">In this regard the State already provides a significant number of initiatives which are of relevance to young people and the Department of Social Protection took steps in Budget 2013 to increase funding and places for schemes such as JobBridge, Community Employment, T&Uacute;S and a new state employment scheme in the local Government sector.  In total an additional 10,000 places will be provided. </font>    Other relevant provision is made through the training and education programmes delivered through F&Aacute;S and the further education sector.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The size and the timescale for any additional provision that is both desirable and feasible, over and above that outlined above, will be established over the coming months.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">In this context, the Government intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to maximise the impact of a youth guarantee in Ireland. We have sought funding from the European Commission for a proposed pilot Youth Guarantee Scheme (YGS) in the Ballymun area of north Dublin, and numerous organisations (e.g. IBEC, Ballymun Job Centre, National Youth Council of Ireland) have agreed to participate in this pilot. We are currently waiting to hear from the European Commission as to whether or not our application has been successful. We have been informed that a final decision on our application will be made by the end of June.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Subject to approval from the Commission, the proposed Ballymun YGS pilot will look to develop an activation approach tailored to the needs of young people.  It is intended that the Ballymun pilot YGS will, in respect of the target group of young people, guarantee access to career guidance/assistance leading to identification of an individual career plan for the young unemployed person with follow-through to training, education, work experience or full-time employment.  Depending on the needs of the young individual the steps in the career plan might include personal assessment, job search assistance, skills training, work experience internships, but the objective in all cases will be to lead the young person to employment placement or further education or training. A particular focus of the pilot YGS will be to involve, and build links with, employers in the locality and the immediate hinterland in order to ensure that the guidance and training elements of the YGS are tailored to the needs of the local labour market and also to generate work placement/experience opportunities for the YGS participants.</font></p></reply>

The new pilot scheme will provide 6,000 after-school child care places and will cost &euro;14 million.  </p><p>  The first pilot phase of the scheme commenced on 29 April, 2013 with 500 subsidised after-school child care places becoming available in seven designated Intreo and social welfare offices. The pilot will enable my Department to review the effectiveness of the scheme for its continued roll-out to the full 6,000 places by September, 2013.</p><p>  The availability of these new child care places is a positive measure for lone parents and builds on my pledge to work to address the child care needs of lone parents as part of the reforms of the OFP scheme.  It   represents a further step in the Government&rsquo;s long-term commitment to building a first-rate child care system for all families.</p><p>  In addition to the 6,000 places available in this new initiative, lone parents are eligible to apply for the existing D/CYA childcare schemes. The D/CYA currently administer the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) schemes, through which child care is provided to some 40,000 children of low-income parents at reduced rates, as well as the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which is availed of by some 65,000 children every year.  </p></reply>

These improvements reflect the findings of a number of recent reviews &ndash; the &ldquo;CE Financial Review of Schemes&rdquo; (2012) and the &ldquo;Review of the Department of Social Protection Employment Support Schemes&rdquo; (2012).  In response, the Department is planning a number of improvements which will provide a clear progression path and a structure for CE participants.

The Agency will sponsor a New York tour of the play, &quot;The Boat Factory&quot; in June 2013, in conjunction with Tourism Ireland.</p><p>  I should refer the Deputy again to the work of Colmcille, a partnership programme between Foras na Gaeilge and B&oacute;rd na G&aacute;idhlig to promote the use of Irish and Scottish Gaelic within Ireland and Scotland and also between the two countries. Through its work programme, Colmcille seeks to foster understanding of the diverse culture of the Irish and Scottish Gaelic communities and to encourage debate on common concerns with regard to social, cultural and economic issues with a view to building self-confidence within the respective language communities. In 2011, Colmcille launched Sl&iacute; Cholmcille, a major heritage and cultural tourism trail linking sites in Ireland and Scotland.  </p><p>  Further information is available at <font color="#2F2F2F"> </font>and<font color="#2F2F2F"> at </font>.   <font color="#2F2F2F"> </font></p></reply>

This was in keeping with the recommendations of Justice Quirke following the Peatlands Forum and with the motion agreed unanimously by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 7th   of March.</p><p>  My Department has now engaged a team of specialists who are undertaking the necessary scientific work to underpin the National Plan and to inform the future restoration and management of each of the SACs. This work is being overseen by an independent steering group with input from the Peatlands Council. Draft proposals for each of the sites will be discussed with affected parties as part of this process. </p><p>  The detailed exploration of relocation sites is a key element in progressing the National Plan. In collaboration with the Peatlands Council, and with the assistance of Bord na M&oacute;na, my Department is actively engaging with turf cutting communities to consider how relocation can be progressed. </p><p>  The aim of my Department is to facilitate, as far as possible, those qualifying cutters who wish to continue to cut turf by putting in place relocation sites for as many cutters as possible in the shortest possible time. Given the complexities of the process it can take time to resolve all issues to finality even as new sites come on stream. The provision of financial payments or deliveries of turf is available to those awaiting relocation. My officials will continue to work with local groups on these issues within the principles of the relocation scheme.</p><p>  Arrangements for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs have been made for groups from Clara Bog in County Offaly and from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog in County Galway. </p><p>  My Department also envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during this turf cutting season provided that final agreement is reached with relevant cutters.</p><p>  Of the remaining 49 raised bog SACs, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 32 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites. Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation.</p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na undertook a preliminary assessment of a potential relocation site for turf cutters on Coolrain Bog Special Area of Conservation on behalf of my Department. On the basis of this assessment, Bord na M&oacute;na has undertaken a stratigraphy assessment of this site in order to get a better indication of the quality and quantity of peat there. The stratigraphy report has recently been received by my Department. Officials from my Department will contact turf cutter representatives from Coolrain Bog shortly with a view to discussing the report and other relevant issues. </p><p>  A payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum is available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to applicants from Coolrain Bog while awaiting relocation to a non-designated bog. </p><p>  The continuation of cutting on parts of any raised bog SAC,  such as Coolrain, may only be considered within the strict parameters of Article 6 of the Habitats Directive, which prescribe the circumstances under which potentially damaging activities can be consented to. In the context of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, it may be possible to bring some flexibility, within the terms of the Habitats Directive, that could allow limited cutting within a small number of sites, if there are no alternatives. </p><p>  I am determined that, in collaboration with the Peatlands Council and local turf-cutting communities, substantial progress will be made on the plan over the coming months. My Department has stepped up contact with turf-cutting groups to seek long-term solutions to the issues for their particular bogs, in compliance with EU and national law. I hope that the Plan can be completed by November, in time to submit an application to the European Commission under Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, if required, prior to the 2014 cutting season. </p><p>  However, the engagement and agreement of turf-cutting communities to its proposed approaches will be essential to meeting this timeline, and to unlocking the potential flexibility it offers.</p></reply>

The last Budget specifically contained a ten point tax reform plan to support small businesses. The measures contained in the Budget are intended to assist small businesses in a number of ways, including:helping their cash flow position; helping them access funding more easily; reducing the costs associated with the administrative burden of tax compliance; boosting demand for their products in new markets abroad; incentivising firms to create jobs.</p><p>  As regards labour costs for small and medium enterprises, the economy has in recent years achieved very significant improvements. The European Commission, in its most recent forecast, projected that Irish unit labour costs will improve by 23 per cent relative to the euro area average over the period 2009 to 2014.  </p><p>  In this regard, I have been engaged in a continuous process of reform to improve Ireland's competitiveness by enhancing wage flexibility while also ensuring protection for vulnerable workers. Last year, I reduced the overall number of Joint Labour Committees (JLCs). I asked the Labour Court to undertake a review of remaining JLC's in line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act which I introduced last year. Last week, the Labour Court submitted to me its Review on the Reform of the remaining JLC's. I view this report very much within the context of the continuous process of reform in the area that is designed to improve Ireland's competitiveness by enhancing wage flexibility while also ensuring protection for vulnerable workers. Specifically, the Report suggests a template on how many Committees will continue in existence, and the format within which they will operate over the next five years. </p><p>  The Government is determined to maintain a focus on competitiveness and, to that end, Forf&aacute;s, in conjunction with my Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Protection has been tasked under the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 to assess the potential for further actions to support improvements in labour market competitiveness.</p><p>  Finally, my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, recently announced details of a new initiative, the JobsPlus scheme, which will incentivise businesses to hire additional employees from the Live Register.  This innovative job creation scheme is focused on the long-term unemployed, providing a cash-flow benefit to businesses which hire jobseekers who have been on the Live Register for 12 months or more.</p></reply>

Whatever the system of funding, the rationale for providing funding will continue to apply and any changes that may be implemented must continue to provide a secure funding base for public service broadcasting and content.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the replacement of the existing funding system based on the collection of television licence fees with one based on the imposition of device-independent charge on eligible households and businesses is a complex process and the logistics involved require thorough attention. Issues such as identifying the most appropriate collection method, exemptions and enforcement mechanics require detailed consideration and all have a bearing on the timeframe for implementation.</p><p>  I should emphasise that the proposed charge would replace the existing TV licence system. Furthermore, it is my expectation that the current exemptions in relation to pensioners and those entitled to the Household Benefit Package will continue to apply.</p><p>  As I have previously indicated to the House, my Department has been carrying out a Value for Money Policy Review on the proposed policy. This Report has been submitted to me very recently and I will give due consideration to the Report and its recommendations in the coming weeks.

There is potential for maximising synergies while addressing the possible trade-offs between competitiveness, security of supply and sustainability.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Commissioner Oettinger attended the Informal Meeting. He highlighted how any new framework should take into account current economic difficulties whilst remaining ambitious on the long-term low carbon objective.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The Council of Energy Ministers also discussed the effects of unconventional oil and gas on energy supply, competitiveness and prices.  In relation to the work currently underway by the European Commission on unconventional hydrocarbon extraction, the Irish Presidency requested that the Commission would reflect on the debate among Ministers in Dublin, particularly on the global competitiveness and security of supply aspects, and to take those views into consideration in their work on the matter, having regard to legitimate environmental and safety considerations.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The two days of discussions were informed by the goal of full implementation of the internal energy market.  Ministers agreed that this is not an end in itself, but rather, it must bring tangible benefits to all energy consumers.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">On the issue of the links between smart technology, innovation and energy policy, I concluded that the ultimate objective in rolling out standardised smart meters and smart grids across Europe must be value and benefit driven, with a specific consumer focus. In so doing, we must recognise the energy needs, circumstances and IT capabilities of all categories of consumers.  Data protection concerns should also be considered and addressed.  The need for public awareness campaigns on the potential advantages was acknowledged and the benefits must be clear to all individual energy customers and management of energy consumption.  Product and price analysis must be simple and straightforward.  Suppliers will also have a responsibility to build consumer trust given the huge volume on data in question.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The financing of energy efficiency measures was also discussed. Realising the energy efficiency potential of buildings is central to the EU's energy efficiency policy.  Nearly 40% of final energy is consumed in homes, offices and shops.  The challenge that faces Energy Ministers is to find the necessary finance to underpin the energy retrofit renovation that is required as part of our 2020 energy and climate goals.  This is particularly important given the potential for jobs and growth that a sustained campaign of energy efficiency in buildings would realise.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">At a thought provoking final session which considered the integration of variable renewable energy sources, in particular wind and solar energy, the Ministers agreed that the proper development of energy policy must adequately recognise the numerous challenges, including cost considerations, in the incremental transition to a low carbon economy.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">I concluded the two day session by stating that in relation to all the energy matters considered by the Ministers, our level of ambition must be underpinned by a rigorous analysis of the costs and benefits associated with the different possible approaches to new and existing policies, especially in exploiting new opportunities.  National energy circumstances are also important, as we strive to reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">I look forward to continuing discussions on identifying a robust 2030 framework which will facilitate long term European competitiveness and security of supply.

I am advised the counter works very well on this site.  However fish have been seen travelling over the weir outside of the fish pass in high water conditions so it is not a complete count but it counts the majority of the fish.</p><p>Table A below represents the number of fish that have traversed the counter for January, February and March of 2013. These figures are available from Inland Fisheries Ireland through the Limerick office.</p><p>Table B below represents the breakdown of 1,509 for the commercial catch for June, July and August 2012.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware the final 10kms of the course of the River Feale is known as the Cashen River and there are 49 public commercial draft net licences and 2 private commercial draft net licences on the River.  The number of licences available for draft net operations is set out in the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order currently S.I. 75 of 2013.  This Order authorises the issue of commercial fishing licences by Inland Fisheries Ireland and sets out the criteria under which those licences may be issued and prescribes the maximum number of commercial licences that may be issued.</p><p>The mechanism for controlling the take of salmon by the commercial fishery is not by licence number but by quota.  Each year commercial fishermen apply for commercial licences and are assessed against criteria as set out in the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order which gives priority to established fishermen with a recent history of fishing in the fishery.  All applications are put before the Board of Inland Fisheries Ireland for approval.</p><p>It is important to note that the Total Allowable Catch (quota set) determines the number of fish that can be harvested regardless of the number of licences in operation.  The Total Allowable Catch is the surplus available above the conservation limit for the river that can be harvested.  This allows for the sustainable exploitation of the river whilst conserving the required number of spawning fish for the system.</p><p>The surplus available for 2013 for the River Feale is 1,992 fish.  This quota is divided between the commercial fishermen and recreational anglers by the River Basin District Director following consultation with the Fisheries District Committee.  The quota is identified by the National Standing Committee for Salmon following assessment of all the relevant scientific data for the river in question including catch figures for the previous 5 years and any other relevant data.  This is set out in the Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Scheme Regulations S.I. 556 2012 which sets the quota for the Feale including the Galey and Brick rivers at 1,992 for exploitation by commercial and rod and line licensed fishermen in 2013.</p><p><b>Table A - Fish Counter</b></p><p><table><tr><th>2013 Month</th><th>Feale Counter Figure (Up Only)</th></tr><tr><td>January</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>February</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>March</td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td>Total to date</td><td>135</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table B- Commercial Catch</b></p><p><table><tr><th>2012 Month </th><th>Commercial Catch</th></tr><tr><td>June</td><td>221</td></tr><tr><td>July</td><td>1040</td></tr><tr><td>August</td><td>248</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The National Broadband Scheme and the Rural Broadband Scheme (NBS &amp;amp; RBS) are examples of such market interventions to provide basic broadband services in areas of the country not served on a commercial basis. </p><p>  Between a combination of this public financing and the significant private sector investment that continues to be made by the various commercial operators, all parts of the country now have access to at least a basic level of broadband service. </p><p>With such services now widely available across Ireland, the focus is on accelerating the roll out of high speed broadband services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  </p></reply>

Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector operators, including eircom, are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department will appoint, in the next few days, a team of experts to assist it in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013.</p><p>  I do not expect the procurement phase of the project to commence until 2014. Accordingly, no negotiations have been undertaken with any service provider with regard to a commercial agreement for the provision of high speed broadband services for citizens and businesses in rural areas.  This procurement process will be conducted in accordance with EU procurement rules and EU State Aid guidelines.</p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-30a.809.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013043000057#WRR01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 369, 371 and 372 together. </p><p>  International comparison tables of broadband speeds and services should be interpreted with some caution.  International comparisons do not take account of high speed services at speeds up to and exceeding 1 gigabit per second which are contracted by heavy users of such service for use using leased lines or comparable links.  Furthermore, International comparison tables are based on marketed services which do not take account of actual accessibility to those speeds within any state nor do they take account of the actual customer experience which may differ from state to state.</p><p>  In Ireland high capacity broadband links over leased lines, which are capable of meeting the needs of heavy users including hospitals, schools, local authorities and third level educational institutions, are widely available.  However, as mentioned above, these services are not included in international comparisons.  In the case of post primary schools the Government has announced plans to equip all post primary schools with 100Mbps broadband.  This programme is continuing and all schools will be connected by the start of the 2014 academic year </p><p>  In the case of marketed broadband services, data reports published by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), reveal that the number of broadband subscribers has more than doubled in Ireland to over 1.6 million between 2007 and 2012.  Similarly, in the case of speeds, the number of residential customers contracted in a range between 2&ndash;10 megabits per second (Mbps) increased from 41% of all subscribers in 2007 to 71% in 2012.  The number of subscribers accessing speeds exceeding 10 Mbps increased from 0.2% to 24% in the same period.  95% of customers are therefore contracted at speeds of 2 Mbps or more compared to an EU average availability at 2 Mbps or more over fixed lines of 92%.</p><p>  In the case of comparing the fastest marketed speeds, the most recently published OECD data ranks Ireland 16th   fastest of more than 30 countries surveyed for fastest advertised retail broadband speed.</p><p>  Subject to the cautions expressed above about interpreting international comparison tables, it can be concluded that there has been significant growth in the take up of marketed retail broadband services and contracted speeds in Ireland in recent years and, in addition, high bandwidth is widely available in Ireland over leased lines.  The take up of basic broadband in Ireland at speeds of 2 Mbps or more compares favourably with similar accessibility as an EU average.  The availability of high speed services is also increasing rapidly with UPC now offering speeds of 150Mbps to almost 700,000 homes and Eircom preparing to launch new next generation fixed line services.  Mobile operators are also preparing to launch high speed 4G services following ComReg&rsquo;s successful conclusion of the multi band spectrum auction.  The Government has committed to ensuring that broadband speeds of at least 30Mbps are available in all parts of Ireland.  This will require intervention by the State in areas where there is no case for investment by the commercial market.  My Department is in the process of appointing consultants to assist in developing the necessary mapping, EU State Aids and procurement process for this intervention.</p><p>  The National Broadband Plan (NBP) therefore anticipates that all parts of Ireland will have access to 30Mbps broadband well ahead of the EU target date of 2020.</p></reply>

Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  </p><p>  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department will over the coming days appoint experts to assist it in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  </p><p>  A formal national mapping exercise will be undertaken to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years so as to inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014. </p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p></reply>

I have no statutory function with regard to such matters.  As shareholder, however, I have a strong concern in relation to the ongoing commercial position of the Company.  I regularly liaise with the Company in this regard.  An Post has many strengths and has the largest retail presence in the country.  I have impressed on the Company the need to further exploit its unique position in this regard.  I have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins.  I welcome the progress An Post has made towards diversification with its enhanced arrangement with AIB and its agreement with Aviva for the transfer of Aviva Ireland&rsquo;s branch offices personal insurance business book to One Direct.  In the context of the public sector transformation agenda, I will continue to engage with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to consideration, as appropriate, of the post office network for transactional elements of the business of Government Departments and Agencies.  I have stressed to my Government colleagues that the network is ideally configured for over the counter transactions.</p><p>  While I have overall responsibility for the postal sector, the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011 charges the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), as the postal regulator, with the promotion of the development of the postal sector and particularly the availability of the universal postal service, the promotion of the interests of users and the facilitation of the development of competition in the sector.  ComReg is in regular contact with my Department.  According to the Act, An Post is statutorily required, as the designated universal service provider, to provide a universal postal service.  The essential element of this obligation is the collection and delivery of mail to every address in the State on every working day.  The universal service obligation ensures by way of regulatory obligations that a minimum set of services is provided at an affordable price for the benefit of all users, irrespective of their geographical location.  It is a fundamental principle of the regulatory framework for postal services and is an explicit requirement of the EU Postal Services Directive which has provided for the gradual and controlled opening of the postal services market to competition.</p></reply>

The Oil Bulletin is designed to improve the transparency of oil prices and to strengthen the internal market.  The relevant link is <i></i>.  In addition to the weekly oil bulletins, the Commission also, on a less frequent basis, produces three maps of Europe with the euro prices for petrol, diesel and the varying national tax take for these two products in each of the 27 EU Member States.  The maps currently provide the clearest overview comparison of the price differences between Member States. </p><p>  The oil bulletin of 15 April 2013 shows the price of petrol in Ireland was &euro;1.62 per litre including taxes and duties, while the price of diesel was &euro;1.55 per litre including taxes and duties.  The weighted EU average for the EU 27 for the same week was &euro;1.59 per litre for petrol including taxes and duties and &euro;1.45 per litre for diesel including taxes and duties.  A separate analysis relating to the Euro area only (17 Member States) shows the weighted average price for petrol was &euro;1.62 per litre and for diesel was &euro;1.43 per litre.  As can be seen from the reports on the European Commission website, prices in EU Member States and the weighted averages fluctuate on a weekly basis.  While Ireland's diesel prices in that particular week were higher than the EU average, our petrol prices were comparable with the weighted average in Euro area countries.  There have also been times in the recent past when Irish prices have fallen below the European weighted average.</p><p>  I have no statutory function in the setting of oil prices.  The price paid at the pump by consumers is largely determined by taxation levels, the internationally traded price of crude and the consequent price the refined product is traded at in Europe, and the level of competition in the retail market.  The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market.  Upward trends in global oil prices underscore the Government's commitment to delivering national energy efficiency and renewable energy objectives, which are aimed at moving the economy away from reliance on imported, carbon intensive fossil fuels such as oil.</p></reply>

The last Budget specifically contained a ten point tax reform plan to support small businesses. The measures contained in the Budget are intended to assist small businesses in a number of ways, including:</p><p>  - Helping their cash flow position;</p><p>  - Helping them access funding more easily;</p><p>  - Reducing the costs associated with the administrative burden of tax compliance;</p><p>  - Boosting demand for their products in new markets abroad;</p><p>  - Incentivising firms to create jobs.</p><p>  As regards labour costs for small and medium enterprises, the economy has in recent years achieved very significant improvements. The European Commission, in its most recent forecast, projected that Irish unit labour costs will improve by 23 per cent relative to the euro area average over the period 2009 to 2014.  </p><p>  In this regard, I have been engaged in a continuous process of reform to improve Ireland's competitiveness by enhancing wage flexibility while also ensuring protection for vulnerable workers. Last year, I reduced the overall number of Joint Labour Committees (JLCs). I asked the Labour Court to undertake a review of remaining JLC's in line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act which I introduced last year. Last week, the Labour Court submitted to me its Review on the Reform of the remaining JLC's. I view this report very much within the context of the continuous process of reform in the area that is designed to improve Ireland's competitiveness by enhancing wage flexibility while also ensuring protection for vulnerable workers. Specifically, the Report suggests a template on how many Committees will continue in existence, and the format within which they will operate over the next five years. </p><p>  The Government is determined to maintain a focus on competitiveness and, to that end, Forf&aacute;s, in conjunction with my Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Protection has been tasked under the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 to assess the potential for further actions to support improvements in labour market competitiveness.</p><p>  Finally, my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, recently announced details of a new initiative, the JobsPlus scheme, which will incentivise businesses to hire additional employees from the Live Register.  This innovative job creation scheme is focused on the long-term unemployed, providing a cash-flow benefit to businesses which hire jobseekers who have been on the Live Register for 12 months or more.</p></reply>

It is a matter for each local authority to decide upon the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean up actions in relation to both litter and illegal dumping, taking account of local circumstances and priorities.  My Department also provides funding to local authorities to support their efforts in this area.   </p><p>  While I currently have no plans to launch a national litter and illegal dumping awareness campaign on television and national radio, I have recently allocated &euro;900,000 to local authorities from Environment Fund under the 2013 Anti-Litter &amp;amp; Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grants Scheme.  My Department has co-funded these grants for local authority anti-litter awareness and education initiatives since 1997.  Under this scheme, local authorities are responsible for selecting suitable projects for funding and deciding on individual grant allocations.  The scheme requires that projects selected should promote greater public awareness and education in relation to both litter and graffiti.  They should also, where possible, focus on voluntary initiatives by community and environmental groups and involve schools and young people in anti-litter and anti-graffiti action.  Typically, eligible projects include local media campaigns, clean-ups, primary/secondary school competitions, exhibitions and the production of videos, posters and leaflets.  The maximum grant for a project may be up to 70% of the cost, with the balance being met by local contributions. </p><p>  My Department has also taken several steps to combat the problem of small scale illegal dumping in recent times.  In summer 2012, I launched a national campaign in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency and supported by the print media, to highlight the economic value of our environment and encouraging the public to report all incidences of illegal dumping to the Agency's National Environmental Complaints hotline at 1850 365 121.  In 2012, I also provided funding for a new once off Litter Enforcement Grant Scheme, intended to support the enforcement activities of local authorities through measures such as the deployment of mobile CCTV equipment to catch fly tippers and illegal dumpers. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the significant penalties currently in place for both littering and illegal dumping, my Department is currently preparing legislative proposals that would provide for the introduction of a specific on-the-spot fine for incidences of fly-tipping or small-scale illegal dumping.  I expect to be in a position to submit proposed Heads of a Bill in this regard to Government for approval shortly.   </p><p>  My Department also continues to provide funding support to a number of other anti-litter initiatives, including Tidy Towns, the National Spring Clean, the Irish Business against Litter (IBAL) Litter League, the Protecting Uplands and Rural Environments (PURE) project and the Green Schools Programme, while the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as an independent public body under the aegis of my Department, also has a role in providing guidance to the public and to industry on various environmental topics, including waste prevention and generating greater environmental awareness.   </p></reply>

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  The Government has also decided that Irish Water, a new State-owned water company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group, will be responsible for the metering programme.  The Water Services Act 2013 assigns the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme.   </p><p>  The procurement process for the metering programme is underway.  The criteria for the procurement process were developed by my Department, in consultation with Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, to ensure that SMEs have an opportunity to compete for contracts.  The tender criteria have been developed to ensure that sub-contractors have the capacity to carry out the scale of work involved to the necessary high standard.  The approach being taken for the sub-contractor panel is consistent with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines on facilitating SME participation in public procurement (that Department's Circular 10/10 refers).  It is expected that the regional management contractors, who will be appointed in June 2013, will be utilising the resources of the pre-qualified sub-contractors for the purpose of delivering the meter installation works.  The installation of meter boxes and domestic water meters should commence in July 2013 and will be rolled out as quickly as possible thereafter. </p></reply>

The Regulations will require that homeowners demonstrate significant pyritic damage in accordance with the recently published standard by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, I.S. 398 &ndash; Reactive Pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1.  This standard provides guidance on the building condition assessment, as well as on the sampling and testing to be carried out to establish the presence of significant pyritic damage.</p><p>  To be eligible for an exemption from the LPT, a homeowner must obtain a certificate, from a competent person, confirming the presence of significant pyritic damage on the basis of a building condition assessment in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 and having regard to the outcome of the testing and classification of the sub-floor hardcore material carried out in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013.  Eligibility for an exemption will be determined by reference to the presence of significant pyritic damage in the relevant property concerned.</p><p>  Conscious of the need to reduce costs to affected homeowners, provision is being made in the Regulations for the use, where feasible, of the results from testing of the sub-floor hardcore undertaken prior to the publication of I.S. 398-1:2013, to classify the hardcore material if the testing that has been carried out is in accordance with, or equivalent to, the test methods provided in I.S. 398-1:2013, and this has been validated as such by a competent person.</p><p>  A Building Condition Assessment in accordance with I.S. 398 will be required to be carried out by a competent person irrespective of when the testing is, or was, carried out.</p><p>  A homeowner cannot claim the exemption until the relevant certificate has been issued in respect of the residential property.  He or she should notify the Revenue Commissioners at that stage to claim the exemption.  Special arrangements will apply in respect of 2013 and 2014 to facilitate homeowners in claiming an exemption.  While homeowners who do not have the relevant certificate on the first liability date of 1 May 2013 (liability date for 2013), or by 1 November 2013 (liability date for 2014), will be required to pay LPT for those periods, they will be able to reclaim the tax paid if they obtain the certificate by 31 December 2013 and notify the Revenue Commissioners in writing on or before 31 January 2014.  As an alternative to such retrospective treatment they can opt to start the period of exemption from the liability date following the issue of the certificate.</p></reply>

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date is liable to pay the Household Charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. It is a matter for an owner of a residential property to determine liability and pay the Charge.</p><p>The Local Government Management Agency is administering the Household Charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.  The table below details the properties registered for the Household Charge, including waiver registrations, by local authority area on 30 November 2012, 31 December 2012, 31 January 2013, 28 February 2013, 31 March 2013 and on 26 April 2013.</p><p>I am advised by the Agency that due to relatively low volumes, waiver details are not automatically extracted on a daily basis and the numbers of waivers cannot be retrospectively generated once a date has passed. Therefore, in assembling the table, the figure for the number of waivers for some dates has been estimated by the Agency using the closest available date for which waiver figures are recorded. Given the low number of waivers as a proportion of the total number of properties registered, the impact on the attached table is minimal.</p><p><table><tr><th>County/City

In the event of a provider receiving a report of a mobile phone being stolen, the IMEI number is used to prevent that mobile device from being used.</p><p>I can also advise the Deputy that a proactive approach is being applied by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to theft from persons, and in particular the theft of mobile phones.  A crime prevention information leaflet,   Mobile Phone Theft Prevention Advice, is available on the Garda Website and a public awareness campaign, including a dedicated item on the Crimeline programme, was undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in March 2013 to inform and advise the public on how to protect their mobile phones.</p><p>  In addition, the Dublin City Joint Policing Committee in association with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Dublin City Council have prepared an information booklet outlining the risks associated with the use of smart phones in public places.  It also provides information on ways in which people can safeguard their phones, including obtaining their IMEI numbers and through increased SIM locking and PIN activation to ensure that if their phone is stolen the service provider can immediately block the phone, rendering it immediately inoperative. These leaflets are currently being distributed throughout Dublin City with a view to increasing the public&rsquo;s awareness to smart phone theft.</p><p>  At an enforcement level, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also continues to address the challenges associated with thefts from the person, including theft of mobile phones.   In this regard Operation Aughrim was introduced in June 2012, in the Dublin Metropolitan Region, with particular emphasis being placed in the Pearse Street and Store Street Districts. This operation is intelligence led with uniformed Garda&iacute; engaged in a high visibility patrols as well as plain clothes members conducting surveillance in identified hotspots.  Contact with mobile phone shops which specialise in the sale, supply and repair of second hand smart phones also forms part of this operation.</p></reply>

There are currently 35 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA, providing accommodation and ancillary services to 4,715 persons.</p><p>  The Direct Provision system remains a key pillar of the State's asylum and immigration system and I have no plans to end it.  I, and previous Ministers for Justice and Equality, have explained in response to previous D&aacute;il Questions how the normal structures dealing with homelessness could not cope when the number of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland increased dramatically, and how the Direct Provision system was the only realistic accommodation solution.  There are no cheaper alternatives to the direct provision system.  In fact, if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' it would likely create, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system. This was a key finding in the recent Value for Money Report on the direct provision system which was published in 2010 and is on the RIA website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie.</i>   I have also explained the nature of the full board accommodation system provided; how RIA coordinates through other Government bodies a number of ancillary services to residents; how residents are offered free medical screening on arrival in the State and have access to health services; and how residents have access to primary and secondary education services, on the same basis as Irish citizens.</p><p>  The practical effect of limiting the time spent by children spent in Direct Provision to six months is that the system itself becomes largely inoperable beyond that period for all residents. The alternative is the granting of the right to work and an extensive range of mainstreamed social and housing supports which, for the reasons given above, is not a realistic policy option.  That said, I have acknowledged that the length of time spent in direct provision and the complexity of the asylum process is an issue to be addressed.  The accommodation system is inextricably linked to the surrounding asylum process. The revised Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I intend to re-publish, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion.  Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing, I am proposing to introduce new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications in light of recent judgments in the Superior Courts.  My Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office, is developing a new legislative and administrative framework for the processing of current and future subsidiary protection applications. This work is being given high priority and applicants will be advised of the new arrangements as soon as possible. </p><p>  In relation to the psychological needs of asylum seekers in direct provision, including their children, all such persons are entitled to the same level of medical - including psychological - care as persons residing in the general community. Asylum seekers are, by definition, a category of persons who arrived in this country seeking protection from harm.  They are disconnected from their home country, from family and from their social network. Decisions as to whether there needs to be specific research into the psychological needs of a particular set of children is ultimately a matter for the HSE to determine. In this context, it should be noted that the medical and psychological services provided to asylum seekers are at least on a par with those provided to the community generally. Some additional supports such as psychological supports focussed specifically on asylum seekers are also provided. Other organisations also provide supports locally and nationally, many of which (such as Spirasi's Centre for the Survivors of Torture) receive funding from the HSE.</p><p>  In this connection, it cannot be emphasised enough that RIA takes the issue of child welfare, and the protection of residents generally, very seriously. RIA has had a child protection policy, based on the HSE's Children First Policy, in place since 2006. There is a specific unit in RIA called the Child and Family Services Unit, which is fully staffed and whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system.  It also acts as a conduit between RIA and the HSE, the latter having statutory functions in this area.  Moreover, all staff in centres must be Garda vetted and comply with RIA's child protection policy, a copy of which is available on its website - www.ria.gov.ie.  This is in furtherance of RIA's policy which has as its principal aim the minimisation of risk to children and vulnerable adults residing in its centres. </p><p>  In terms of an independent external enquiry into the direct provision system ,I have already indicated that it cannot be viewed separately from the overall asylum and immigration system which is ultimately a matter of Government policy subject to scrutiny and oversight by the Oireachtas. Over the years, the system has been open to scrutiny by many national and international bodies. Centres have been visited by various international bodies, including the UNHCR, the Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner, by the Council of Europe European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), and others.  On 6 October, 2011, in Geneva  I appeared before the UN Human Rights Committee in connection with its scrutiny of Ireland under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Process . No recommendation was made in relation to the Direct Provision system in the Committee's subsequent UPR report on Ireland. </p><p>  The practical day to day operation of the system is,of course subject to inspection, including independent inspection.. All accommodation centres under contract to RIA are obliged to ensure that their premises comply with and operate in accordance with all relevant statutory requirements of local authorities in relation to planning, building, bye-laws, bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, sewage disposal, fire precautions, and general safety. Inspections of the direct provision centres are carried out by RIA inspectors, an external Inspectorate (QTS Ltd), plus other inspections for fire safety and food safety (EHO). As already cited, a comprehensive review on the operation of the asylum seeker accommodation programme was carried out and the subsequent report -  <i>&quot;Value for Money and Policy Review - Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme&quot; -  </i>  was published in May 2010. A copy of this review is available on the RIA website at www.ria.gov.ie.</p></reply>

A PIP will have to be free from any undue influence, guidance or control by any other person that could prevent or hinder their performance of their functions under the Act.  Therefore it is important that we provide a strong regulatory framework that will cover the control and supervision of individuals who will provide services under the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act.</p><p>  All PIPs will be authorised and regulated by the Insolvency Service of Ireland, in accordance with Part 5 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 - Sections 159 to 169.  In Part 5 of the Act, Section 163 sets out how an individual may make application to carry on practice as a Personal Insolvency Practitioner, and Section 164 the matters which the Insolvency Service must take into account in deciding whether an applicant should be authorised as a PIP or whether authorisation is to be refused. </p><p>  The Insolvency Service of Ireland will shortly publish the Regulations under Section 161 of the Act in regard to the authorisation and regulation of personal insolvency practitioners.  The Regulations will set out the necessary criteria in regard to qualifications.  As I have previously stated, I expect that accountants, lawyers and a broad range of financial advisors may wish to seek regulation as practitioners, but it will not be confined to these professions.  The qualifying criteria for becoming a practitioner will be rigorous and will be based on a series of important considerations such as educational and professional qualifications, relevant knowledge and experience, and the completion of a course of study - by passing an exam - on the laws and practice generally, as they apply in the State, in relation to the insolvency of individuals and knowledge of the Act.  Applicants will also have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Insolvency Service that they are fit and proper persons, that they are financially sound, and that they have the organisational capability and the resources to carry on the practice of being a practitioner.  They will have to hold professional indemnity insurance as well as being tax compliant. </p><p>  Where a person has concerns that improper conduct by a PIP has occurred or is occurring, they may make a complaint in writing to the Insolvency Service.  The Act provides that the Insolvency Service, following receipt of a complaint, or of its own volition, may investigate any improper conduct by a PIP.  This may result in the suspension or revocation of the authorisation of the personal insolvency practitioner or the imposition of sanctions in accordance with the Act.</p></reply>

Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, an executive office within my Department, actively contributed to all stages of the drafting process in relation to the Convention.  That process took place over a period of almost two years.</p><p>  The detailed provisions of the Convention and the legislative and administrative arrangements that would be necessary to allow signature and ratification of the Convention by Ireland are being examined in conjunction with the government commitment to consolidate and reform domestic violence legislation.  However, I have been advised that Article 52 on emergency barring orders presents a particular difficulty in relation to property rights under the Irish constitution.  I propose to consult again with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office in relation to the legal difficulty relating to Article 52 and other issues.  The matter will then be submitted for decision of the Government on the issue of signature of the Convention.</p><p>  I am informed that 29 Council of Europe member states have signed the Convention and four have ratified it.  It has not yet entered into force as this requires at least ten member states to ratify it.</p></reply>

Payments made to the court poor box are accounted for by the court office concerned and the accounting procedures are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Generally, charities are the recipients of poor box contributions but the decision is solely at the discretion of the Judge who is independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.</p><p>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy I have had enquiries made and I am informed that the position is that where a person is convicted of an offence which incurs penalty points, the award of penalty points is automatic under the legislation and the court has no discretion in the matter.  However, convictions are not incurred by persons who are required by the court to make a payment to the poor box.  <br />  The Deputy has referred to section 63 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 but an offence under that section does not attract penalty points.  The table below shows the number of defendants who were before the court in 2012 and to date this year for offences that incur penalty points in which the outcome involved a payment to the poor box.  These cases were either dismissed or struck out.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Defendants</th></tr><tr><td>2013 (Jan - Mar)</td><td>437</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1,255</td></tr></table></p><p>In 2005, the Law Reform Commission examined the matter in its report entitled <i>The Court Poor Box: Probation of Offenders</i> (LRC 75-2005).  The Commission recognised both the negative and positive aspects of the court use of the poor box and accordingly recommended that the court poor box be replaced by a statutory reparation fund.  A key element of the LRC recommendation was that the reparation fund should be ringfenced and used to assist programmes aimed at preventing offending behaviour and for the purpose of assisting victims of crime.  The Commission was of the view that the reparation fund should remain linked to the criminal justice process and thus broadly adhere to the principles of restorative justice.  I intend to bring forward legislation in due course to replace the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 with modern provisions dealing with community sanctions and the role of the Probation Service in the criminal justice system.  In the context of that legislation, the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in relation to the court poor box are being examined by my Department with a view to bringing forward proposals for a transparent statutory reparation scheme.  <b>  </b></p></reply>

Section 17 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 was repealed by section 3(e) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003. </p><p>  Section 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, which replaced section 17 of the 2000 Act, provides for the making of regulations specifying particulars to be affixed to containers in which  intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off licensed premises which would enable the licensee and the licensed premises concerned to be identified.  The Government Alcohol Advisory Group considered the feasibility of such regulations in its 2008 Report.  The Group noted that while the labelling of alcohol containers was an attractive idea, significant challenges would need to be overcome in order to render it effective in practice.  These challenges arose under two headings.</p><p>  Firstly, practical difficulties would arise at retail level in cases where several individual containers were packaged together for sale, e.g. an enclosed six-pack of bottles; a plastic-wrapped tray of cans; or a wooden box containing bottles of wine.  This raised the question of whether an appropriate label could be attached earlier in the supply or distribution chains rather than at the point of sale.  The Group noted that attaching such labels to containers at an earlier stage might be simpler but it could create logistical difficulties for importers and distributors.  Moreover, in the case of imports from EU countries, such additional labelling requirements could be regarded as infringing internal market rules relating to free movement of such goods. </p><p>  Secondly, from an enforcement perspective, it was clear that possession by an underage person of a labelled container would not in itself constitute proof that the alcohol in the container has been illegally supplied to that person by the licensee whose particulars appeared on the container.  The labelled container could have been taken from the family home or have been sold to a person over the age of 18 in good faith before being passed on to the person in possession of it.  Indeed a container might have changed hands several times before coming into possession of the underage person. </p><p>  The Group also noted that according to answers already given to parliamentary questions on the subject, issues relating to the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container had been raised during discussions on implementation of the 2003 Act with the Office of the Attorney General.  That Office had expressed serious doubts about the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container and the overall effectiveness of any regulations that might be made under section 22 of the 2003 Act. </p><p>  For the reasons set out above, I do not intend to make regulations under section 22 of the 2003 Act.  I am however prepared to give serious consideration in the context of the forthcoming Sale of Alcohol Bill to any reasonable and workable labelling proposal that would not give rise to the difficulties outlined in the 2008 Report. </p></reply>

I am pleased to note that since the introduction of this Scheme that significant quantities of fodder have been imported and are reaching those in most need. </p><p>  In terms of EU payments, it will be recalled that my successful approach to Commissioner Ciolos for agreement to making an advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment was prompted by the very wet weather experienced throughout last summer.  Mindful of ongoing difficulties, I have decided that a formal request should again be made to the EU Commission seeking agreement to pay an advance from 16 October of the 2013 Single Farm Payment which, at almost 2 months ahead of the standard timeline, is the earliest potential payment date.  Payments under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme are scheduled to begin issuing in September 2013.  </p><p>  I am, of course, keeping this ongoing situation under constant review.</p><p>  The Department has an emergency animal welfare helpline in operation and farmers are being referred to the Co-operatives and or to the Department&rsquo;s veterinary personnel as appropriate. Department Veterinary Inspectors continue to be actively engaged in providing emergency assistance under the Department&rsquo;s early warning system to farmers whose animals are currently experiencing serious welfare issues and where the farmer him/herself is unable to cope with the situation. </p></reply>

Under comitology procedures, it is now a matter for the European Commission to legislate on the matter. It is likely that a ban on the three substances under consideration will now come into effect later this year. </p><p>  At the Appeals Committee meeting on 29 April, Ireland engaged with the Commission and the Member States in a constructive and helpful way and actively supported efforts to find a workable and meaningful compromise on the proposals to restrict the use of neonicotinoid insecticides. These efforts aimed to find solutions that allowed suitably controlled use of the compounds without presenting unacceptable risks to bee populations. </p><p>  Ireland had initially opposed the Commission proposal to allow time for further consideration of the scientific evidence and to create the space for consideration of a compromise. Ireland recognised the importance of the precautionary principle in relation to this matter, and fully bore this in mind in discussions aimed at achieving an approach that would enjoy broad support among EU Member States and be acceptable to the Commission. However, efforts to find a compromise failed and Ireland decided not to oppose the Commission proposal but rather to abstain in the vote.</p></reply>

A survey conducted on a statistically selected sub-sample of Brucellosis round test bloods (17 herds per county) taken last November shows exposure in 24 counties. This survey will be repeated in June. </p><p>  While the situation for individual farmers can be very difficult, the advice remains that the economic impact on a national level is likely to be low. Based on the pattern in the UK and elsewhere, between 4-6% of holdings are likely to be affected. In those holdings that are affected, the within-herd/flock impact in terms of deformities is likely to be mild in most cases at 2-5% of affected pregnancies, but moderate at worst. The highest level of problems would be expected in herds that have synchronised breeding programmes and where large numbers of animals were infected during the critical period of pregnancy in 2012. My Department is currently assessing the impact following the end of the calving/lambing season</p><p>  Exposure of non-pregnant animals to the virus may, in fact, be beneficial pending the development of an effective vaccine. Exposed animals develop a strong immunity and are unlikely to suffer any ill-effects if exposed to the virus on a subsequent occasion. If this viral infection becomes endemic, the ill-effects are likely to be confined to younger animals and cows and ewes that have not been previously exposed. Based on Australian experience in vaccinating against a similar virus/disease (Akabane virus infection), the expert view is that vaccination is likely to be an effective tool in control of the SBV infection. The development of a vaccine is in progress and my Department is continuing to monitor developments closely. </p><p>  Meanwhile, farmers are advised to contact their veterinary practitioner if they encounter cases of aborted foetuses or newborn animals showing malformations or nervous signs and also in  cases where lambs or calves cannot be delivered naturally.  </p></reply>

I have been working to encourage more new entrants to take up farming as a career.  Budget 2013 saw the extension of key reliefs that were already in place for young new entrants (such as the 100% relief from Stamp Duty and the 100% stock relief for Young Trained Farmers).  Extending these reliefs is not straightforward given that there is a requirement for EU State Aid approval for such measures.  The deputy will also be aware that changes were made to retirement relief in budget 2012 to encourage inter-generational land transfers.</p><p>I am delighted that the number of applicants for Teagasc courses has greatly increased the last two years.  Teagasc has responded well to this demand and have introduced new courses to cater for a variety of needs.  For example Teagasc launched a new Professional Diploma in Dairy Farm Management (Level 7) in association with University College Dublin (UCD). Teagasc have also developed recently a new<i></i>  Level 6 Specific Purpose Certificate in Farm Administration course to help meet the training requirements for full-time or part-time farmers. </p><p>  It should be noted that there has been no change to the very important 90% agricultural relief on Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT). This means that farms worth up to &euro;2.5 million will continue to be fully exempt from CAT with regard to transfers to a child.</p><p>  Measures to provide targeted support to young farmers are part of the current negotiations on the reform of the CAP and will I hope form part of any final agreement.  I have strongly supported the proposal for a top-up for young farmers under pillar 1 of the CAP, and indeed Ireland was one of the first countries to suggest this measure in the negotiations.</p><p>  I am also happy that the new restructuring relief was announced in the2013 budget.  This is the result of detailed work which analysed the reasons why the old consolidation relief was not working.  I am confident that the new relief in relation to Capital Gains Taxes will be more effective, especially given that Stamp Duty rates have been reduced.  Re-structuring is essential for us to meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  We need to use land more productively and encourage more young farmers to make the best use of the land. An EU Commission study found that '<i>younger[farm] managers tend to perform better than the EU average, with 46% more area and 57% more economic potential for 21% more labour force</i>'<sup> [[1]</sup>  Commission Staff Working Paper, Impact Assessment, CAP towards 2020, <i>Annex 1: Situation and prospects for EU agriculture and rural areas</i>  , p. 25. Brussels, 12/10/2011.<sup>1]</sup>  .  </p><p>  Ireland has a very low level of land sales, with most land staying within the same family for generations.  Only 0.4% of land changes hand in any given year.  Young farmers that want to expand need to be able to access land.  According to the latest census of agriculture the average farm has 3.8 land parcels.  This means that our farmers are wasting time and diesel driving between plots of land, increasing the stress and the risk of accidents.  Young farmers will now have an opportunity to consolidate their holdings and increase efficiency.  </p><p>  I am hopeful therefore that the measures that I have introduced will encourage more young people into farming and address the age profile imbalance in Irish farming.</p><p><sup>[1]</sup>  Commission Staff Working Paper, Impact Assessment, CAP towards 2020, <i>Annex 1: Situation and prospects for EU agriculture and rural areas</i>  , p. 25.

It will be recalled that my successful approach to Commissioner Ciolos for agreement to making an advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment was prompted by the very wet weather experienced throughout last summer. The effects of this prolonged wet weather, together with the extended winter, have led ultimately to the current fodder crisis. </p><p>  In light of the difficulties experienced by farmers in sourcing fodder supplies, last week I announced the allocation of &euro;1 million to fund the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme, which is designed to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage (hay, silage, haylage) from outside the island of Ireland. This will substantially cover the cost of transport into the country and will reduce the cost to farmers of a bale of hay by approximately one third.</p><p>  Mindful of ongoing difficulties, a formal request will be made to the EU Commission  seeking agreement to pay an advance from 16 October of the 2013 Single Farm Payment which, at almost 2 months ahead of the standard timeline, is the earliest potential payment date.  </p><p>  In order to ensure that payments are processed efficiently and effectively, I would urge those who have yet to submit their applications under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme to do so via iNet, my Department&rsquo;s on-line application system, as there are significant benefits in doing so, not least of which is that it guaranteed immediate, verifiable receipt by my Department of their applications and, through the system of in-built validations, significantly reduces the numbers of errors that could be made, thereby ultimately leading to speedier payment. Furthermore, the introduction in 2012 of an on-line mapping element allowed farmers, or their agents, who needed to submit maps to my Department, to do so through iNet, thereby dispensing with the need to submit paper maps. </p></reply>

The scheme is designed to alleviate the additional feed costs incurred by eligible owner(s) whose holdings are restricted during   the period from the 1 November to 30 April, subject to a number of eligibility conditions. </p><p>  The holding in question was restricted under the TB and Brucellosis Eradication Scheme on 21 February 2013, following the disclosure of 3 reactor animals in the herd. However, an essential condition for eligibility is that the holding of the applicant continues to be restricted following a full herd Reactor Re-test. In this instance, the Reactor Re-test is due to be carried out after the closing date of the scheme i.e. 30 April. The date for the Reactor retest is determined by the date of removal of the previous reactors from the herd and cannot be brought forward.  While an application for the Hardship Grant was received in the local District Veterinary Office on the 12 March 2013, the herdowner has been advised by the DVO that he is not eligible for the scheme as his reactor retest will not have been completed before the closing date of the scheme.</p><p>  While the person in question is not eligible for the ERAD Hardship Grant, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that I announced last week a comprehensive package of measures aimed at addressing the fodder shortage crisis, including a &euro;1m fund to contribute to the transport costs of importing fodder to the country, which will reduce the cost of purchasing fodder for farmers by approximately a third, in the days ahead. In addition, the co-ops have agreed to my request to substantially increase the volume of fodder being imported into the country over the short to medium term. The co-ops have also agreed to consider the introduction of interest free credit, within limits, to farmers for the purchase of fertiliser, limited to the month of May. The person in question should contact his local co-op to determine whether he can qualify for assistance under these arrangements. </p><p>  I should also explain that emergency assistance is also available under the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council&rsquo;s early warning system to ensure that there is no reason for any farmer to see their animals starve. I have also asked the advisory service to prioritise advice to farmers in the period ahead and to focus on the optimum use of fertiliser in generating feed for the national herd. In addition, outstanding scheme payments are being processed with urgency.</p></reply>

The service operates across the greater Dublin area (Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow).  Referrals are made by service providers outside of normal working hours i.e. Garda&iacute;, hospital and ambulance service personnel.</p><p>  Outside the greater Dublin area, the HSE operates an Emergency Place of Safety (EPSS) whereby Garda&iacute; can access an emergency placement for children found to be at risk under Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 out of hours.  This service involves the out of hours placement of a child in a family setting until the next working day when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case.  As part of this service Garda&iacute; have access to advice and information from a commissioned social work  resource which is provided on a contract basis.</p><p>  Where children under 18 are found to be out of home, a HSE social worker meets with the young person to establish why the young person left home, the potential for them returning home and to establish their physical. social and psychological well being, including any need for medical treatment or treatment for addictions. If the assessment establishes that the young person needs to be taken into care in order to have their needs met, they will be taken into care and placed in a residential or foster care placement. </p><p>  Under Section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991,where it appears to the HSE that a child in its area is homeless, the HSE shall enquire into the child's circumstances. Where the HSE is satisfied that the child does not need to be taken into care, their needs are met by the provision of  other supports and suitable  accommodation under Section 5. Under the HSE policy on the use of Section 5, the child receives an accommodation, a key worker and a placement plan.</p><p>  I am advised by the HSE that there was one child in Dublin being supported under Section 5 at the end of December 2012.</p></reply>

Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>  My Department also provides funding for a Local Youth Club Grant Scheme<i></i>  which supports youth work activities at a local level (&euro;1.035m in 2013).  The funding under this scheme has not been cut in 2012 or 2013.  These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through local Vocational Education Committees.

It is anticipated that this report will inform the provision of funding for youth programmes/services going into the future. </p><p>  In addition, my Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year. The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years. </p></reply>

The provisions of the proposed Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2013 will amend the Adoption Act 2010 to provide for the non-voluntary adoption of a child where his or her parents have failed in their duty towards that child.  The draft Bill will change the criteria, applicable under section 54 of the 2010 Act, under which the High Court may authorise the making of an adoption order without parental consent, in the case of a child who is in the care of prospective adopters and where that child&rsquo;s parents have failed in their parental duty to the child. The proposed legislation is not intended to provide that a child, who has contact with and a strong beneficial relationship with his or her birth parents and wider family, may be adopted unless that child's parents have voluntarily placed the child for adoption and have consented to the adoption order being made in respect of the child. </p><p>  The draft Bill will also provide for the voluntary placement for adoption of any child irrespective of the marital status of his or her parents. In the case of a child of married parents, both parents must place the child for adoption and before doing so, will be counselled and given information in accordance with the provisions of section 14 of the Adoption Act 2010. </p><p>  It is my intention to bring the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2013 before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible, following conclusion of all proceedings and processes relevant to the confirmation of the referendum certificate of the 31st Amendment to the Constitution.</p></reply>

The main objective of this project is to meet the Programme for Government commitment to end the practice of detaining children in St Patrick's Institution. </p><p>  My officials in the Irish Youth Justice Service continue to work closely to progress this project with the Office of Public Works (OPW) which is providing the relevant project management services for my Department.

My aim is to deliver suitable detention facilities on the earliest possible date, in a manner that complies with all design, planning and heath and safety requirements.  I  am also conscious that the Oberstown campus is already the location of the existing children detention facilities and these must remain in operation during the construction project.

During my visit I met with my counterpart, Minister Dmitry Livanov, Minister of Education and Science of the Russian Federation. This meeting was productive and allowed for an exchange of views on the possibility of Ireland entering into a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption with Russia. </p><p>  The Russian authorities acknowledged the satisfactory outcomes for Russian children adopted in Ireland and expressed a willingness to conclude an agreement with Ireland which would be subject to the approval of the Russian parliament. My Department, in consultation with the AAI, is continuing efforts to draft wording of a bilateral agreement,  including in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, which would satisfy our legal and Constitutional requirements, in particular in relation to the Russian requirement for post adoption reports.  The wording of the draft bilateral agreement will be a matter of consideration by the Attorney General's office  in advance of any further discussions with the Russian authorities.</p><p>  The Authority advises that a question has arisen with regard to the interpretation of Section 63 of the Adoption Act, 2010. Therefore the Board has adjourned making a decision on a small number of applications for an entry in the Register of Intercountry Adoptions while the Board seeks advice from its legal advisors.  </p></reply>

This support is in addition to the financial support they receive from the German foundation set up to support people affected by the German made drug.</p><p>  Each Irish survivor received lump sum payments from the German Foundation and the Irish Government in the early 1970s.  In 1975 the lump-sums paid by the Irish Government ranged from &euro;6,400 to &euro;21,000.  In addition, each survivor receives on-going monthly payments from both the German foundation and the Irish Government.  Combining the Irish and German payments, most individuals receive over  &euro;2,500 per month, or &euro;575 per week tax free.</p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to reopen discussions with Irish survivors of thalidomide. I met with both representative organisations in July 2011 and have been in correspondence since.  </p><p>  Given the challenges that persist for each individual, this Government's aim is to address the health and personal social care needs of thalidomide survivors living in Ireland.  I have stated that I am willing to enter into discussions about a health care package on a non-statutory basis; an ex-gratia payment having regard to current financial circumstances; and a statement to the D&aacute;il recognising the challenges faced by survivors.  </p><p>  The Irish Thalidomide Association announced publicly in 2012 that it had ceased talks with the Government. The Association's legal advisor has initiated personal injuries claims against the manufacturer and distributors of the thalidomide drug and the State.</p><p>  I have asked the Irish Thalidomide Survivors Society to consider, in good faith, proceeding with a Health Care Protocol which envisaged appointing and training a multi-disciplinary team, arranging a multi-disciplinary health evaluation, identifying and documenting each individual's healthcare needs/issues and developing plans to address those needs. The team is planning to attend a centre of excellence in Sweden next month. The Society is unwilling to proceed on this basis and is seeking commitments to additional supports I am not in a position to provide. Each Irish thalidomide survivor has a medical card and it is open to each individual to apply for the numerous public supports available to people with a disability provided by other Departments such as housing adaptation grants, disabled drivers tax concessions and disability allowance.</p></reply>

Fluoridation of public water supplies is provided for in the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies Act) 1960. The policy of water was reviewed by the Forum on Fluoridation, which published its report in 2002. It concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. In 2011 the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), published its &lsquo;Opinion on critical review of any new evidence on the hazard profile, health effects, and human exposure to fluoride and the fluoridating agents of drinking water&rsquo;.  The main conclusions of the SCHER report are that there are no known health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU. </p><p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters. It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population. The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by the World Health Organisation; the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Service and the Surgeon General of the United States; the World Dental Federation; the International Association for Dental Research; the Royal College of Physicians of England and by major international scientifically validated reviews in many countries. The Expert Body keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review.</p></reply>

In time, only registrants will be entitled to use these titles. The Council - also known as CORU - was established in March 2007 and is working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practise for the 12 designated professions.  The first registration board to be established, the Social Workers Registration Board, was established in August 2010, and the associated Social Workers Register opened for receipt and processing of applications on 31 May, 2011.  A second registration board, the Radiographers Registration Board, was established on 16 December, 2011 and its register is expected to be established on 30 June 2013.  Three further registration boards, the Dietitians Registration Board,  the Occupational Therapists Registration Board, and the Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board have been established with effect from 1 November 2012.  It is  proposed to establish the Physiotherapists Registration Board shortly and expressions of interest from interested parties are currently being sought through the Public Appointments Service to fill vacancies on the soon to be established Board.  All the registration boards and their registers for the remaining designated professions should be established by 2015.</p><p>  While the legislation empowers the Minister for Health to include, if he considers it appropriate and in the public interest to do so, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system over time, and under specific criteria, I have no plans at present to regulate creative arts therapists.  The question of regulating further health and social care professionals may be reviewed post 2015 in the context of progress made by CORU at that juncture.  The issue of recognition of creative arts therapies in the public health services, the need for such services and the direct employment of creative arts therapists are matters for the Health Service Executive in the first instance.</p></reply>

Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data.  For the first time  data is available on <i>www.ntpf.ie</i>.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals.  In the first instance, this will allow resources to be targeted towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment.  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time.</p><p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The reforms, which are intended to better equip the Task Forces to respond to the current pattern of substance misuse, also provide for the extension of their remit to include alcohol addiction.  Against this background, on 26 February, on receipt of an invitation from the Board of the Tallaght Local Drugs Force, I met with Members of the Board at Kiltalown House (Tallaght Rehabilitation Project), who provided a very comprehensive briefing on the day to day challenges the Board face in tackling the on-going destructive consequences of drugs in their communities.  The Board expressed their support for the forthcoming proposals on Alcohol policy, and the role Local Task Forces may play in combating the excessive levels of alcohol in society.  I also made a short visit to a number of local drugs related projects including JADD - Jobstown Assisting Drug Dependency and St Aengus Community Action Group to see at first hand the excellent work being progressed by Local Drugs Task Force projects.</p><p>  As previously outlined to the House, the review of Drugs Task Forces is ongoing.  It is envisaged that the final report will take account of Government decisions in relation to addressing the alcohol issue.</p></reply>

There are currently two categories of eligibility for all persons ordinarily resident in Ireland i.e. full eligibility (medical card) and limited eligibility (all others).  Full eligibility is determined mainly by reference to income limits and is granted to persons who, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services to themselves and their dependents without undue hardship.  There is a provision for discretion to grant a card in cases of "undue hardship" where the income guidelines are exceeded.  The HSE  set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.</p><p>  The Primary Care Reimbursement Service of the Health Service Executive has confirmed that all medical card applications are firstly considered on income grounds.  Where an applicant is over the income threshold applicable for a medical card and where the applicant has included details of medical circumstances along with supporting documentation such as a GP or consultant's letter, the application is then forwarded to the Medical Officer for discretionary consideration.  Every application is reviewed on its own merits and the Medical Officer provides recommendations based on the nature of the medical circumstances of the applicant, considered within the context of the applicant's household income.</p></reply>

Medical card holders are required to pay prescription charges. Prescription charges are not payable in respect of items supplied under the Long Term Illness Scheme. </p><p>  In the case of persons who have both the medical card and LTI, the HSE policy is that they should use their medical card to access medicines. The main reason for this is that the supply of medicines under the LTI costs the HSE considerably more than under the GMS Scheme. A retail mark-up of 20% is payable to pharmacists for items supplied under the LTI Scheme but there is no retail mark-up for items supplied under the GMS Scheme. </p><p>  The decision by the previous Government not to extend prescription charges to the Long Term Illness Scheme has given rise to the anomaly identified by the Deputy.

This does not indicate whether the evidence is good or poor, simply that more than one laboratory researcher has made this finding. The Agency currently accepts a standard of 4 parts per million for naturally fluoridated water in the USA, which is 5 times higher than the levels for fluoridated water in Ireland. It should be noted that among those substances classed by the Agency in the same group as fluoride are common substances such as ethanol, ozone and chlorine dioxide as well as caffeine, which is found in tea and coffee and acrylamide, which is found in well browned toast and roast potatoes.</p><p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health has reviewed a number of studies over the years in relation to neurological effects. These studies have typically involved dosing laboratory rats with very high levels of fluoride. The EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) review in 2011 referred to the Whitford study in which rats were given doses equivalent to 200 times the human exposure without demonstrating any neurological effects. </p><p>  A number of studies from China, and the systematic review of these by Choi (from the Harvard Medical School) which claim an effect on children's IQ at very high levels of naturally occurring fluoride, were assessed by the Expert Body in 2011 and were found to be of no relevance to Ireland, given our regulated fluoridation levels. The view of the Expert Body is that the overall design of the studies is poor and they do not provide evidence of any effect on children's IQ from either high or low fluoride levels. This view was shared by SCHER in its 2011 Review. It should be noted that the Deans of Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Dental Medicine have recently confirmed their support of water fluoridation as a safe public health measure for people of all ages. </p><p>  The Expert Body is satisfied that water fluoridation, at its optimal level, causes no ill effects. The effects of fluoridation on health and related matters are kept under constant review.</p></reply>

The Health Service Executive has responsibility for health service delivery and at my request the HSE developed a range of appropriate services and supports to address the needs of this group.  Together, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills provide a very comprehensive range of services and supports to those affected.</p><p>  These supports and services include access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred. This includes expenses for counselling services for individuals and also for families of children affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination,  in cases where such services are not already available through the HSE.  Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for the appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place are ongoing. The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected.</p><p>  The HSE's advocacy unit is in regular contact with the support group SOUND and last met representatives of the group on 28 February 2013.  Through regional co-ordinators the HSE also has frequent contact with individuals affected by narcolepsy and their families to facilitate access to services already in place. Last month, on 22 March 2013 the HSE held an information day for families affected by narcolepsy to ensure those affected were made fully aware of all of the services available to them. I would like to assure the Deputy that this matter continues to be a priority for my Department.</p></reply>

Therefore, efforts to combat harmful materials and activities on the Internet can be hampered by the multiplicity of jurisdictions, various legal systems, differing societal norms, or other relevant factors in this regard.  Many pro-eating disorder websites may be hosted outside this jurisdiction, principally in the United States.  As such they would be subject to the US jurisdiction and action that could be taken would be limited.</p><p>  While acknowledging such difficulties, it should be emphasised that there is a self-regulatory framework in place for internet service providers (ISPs) in Ireland. The Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland Code of Practice and Ethics sets out clear guidelines and minimum standards in respect of dealing with complaints regarding suspected illegal material.  However, it is considered that pro-eating disorder websites would not be illegal, and any action that could be taken against them would be limited.  The Deputy may rest assured that the Department of Health, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, are cognisant of the issues raised in this instance and will continue to pursue an inter-agency response to policy and service delivery levels to best tackle concerns in relation to eating disorders overall.</p></reply>

In addition, the Irish Medicines Board has reviewed the policy on interchangeability of anti-epileptic drugs of a number of countries, including, Denmark, Sweden, the UK, and the Netherlands. I am not aware of any issues in relation to legislation introducing generic substitution in Canada.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill, passed Committee Stage on 19 March and is currently at Report Stage. Under the Bill, the Irish Medicines Board has statutory responsibility for establishing and publishing a List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products.  In deciding whether to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the Board must be satisfied that each medicinal product which falls within the group:</p><p>  (a) has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in each of its active substances as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group;</p><p>  (b) is in the same pharmaceutical form as, or in a pharmaceutical form that is appropriate for substitution for, each of the other products in the group; and</p><p>  (c) has the same route of administration as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group.</p><p>In addition, the Bill provides that the Board is not permitted to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products where:</p><p> - there is a difference in bioavailability between the medicinal products and the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products which may lead to a clinically significant difference in efficacy between them, and</p><p> - any of the medicinal  products cannot be safely substituted for any one or more of the other medicinal products in the group.</p><p>  I would like to emphasise that in making a decision to add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products the Board is obliged to have regard to the criteria as set out in the Bill and that these criteria fully reflect the recommendations set out in the Joint Department of Health/HSE report 'Proposed Model of Reference Pricing and Generic Substitution' (the Moran Report, 2010) regarding criteria for interchangeability.  To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the provisions of the Bill address the concerns raised in relation to the substitution of anti-epileptic drugs. I met with the Irish Epilepsy Association in January and explained this position.  It is also important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine. All of the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board.</p></reply>

To support the provision of such traffic calming measures, a non-statutory Traffic Management Guidelines Manual was published in 2003 jointly by the then Department of Transport, the Department of the Environment, Heritage &amp;amp; Local Government and the Dublin Transportation Office and distributed to each road authority setting out guidance on best practice. Guidance is given in Chapter 6 on traffic calming, including the types of roads on which particular types of traffic calming measures are appropriate.

I assured them that my aim is to strengthen the RTP by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making  the programme a sustainable part of the public transport system. This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.  To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA) with effect from 1st   April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport.   I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups such as Longford Community Resources Ltd in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community.  However, given  resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.   The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved. If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.</p><p>  Work has been underway over the last six months to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. This has involved consultations with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the County and City Managers Association and the rural Transport Network in the context of aligning the new structure with the local authority structure.</p><p>  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken regarding the County Longford area or any other part of the country. I am awaiting proposals from the NTA when they have concluded their deliberations and discussions but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure in the near future which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.   I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.</p></reply>

If there is any evidence that various charges are being misrepresented to consumers, then the National Consumer Agency has the power to investigate such claims.</p></reply>

However, Member States are permitted to test more frequently and an annual NCT for cars ten years and older commenced in Ireland with effect from 1 June 2011. Current EU legislation does not provide for a deferment of the due date for mandatory testing and test dates are set by reference to the date of first registration of the vehicle.</p><p>  My Department sought to explore the mechanisms provided by Article 4.2. of Directive 2009/40. The European Commission took the view that those provisions relate to the exemption from roadworthiness testing of vehicles that are never or seldom used on public roads.  If Ireland wished to exempt vehicles that were only temporarily withdrawn from use on public roads from roadworthiness testing the Commission suggests that it might be necessary to suspend registration in order to prevent use on a public road.</p><p>  However, in the event that such a vehicle were returned to use, it would be subject to roadworthiness testing appropriate to its age by reference to the date of its first registration and the expiry date of the certificate issued would not extend past the vehicle's next due date.</p></reply>

The aim of the branding is to provide greater recognition of taxis, promote greater professionalism of the industry and to reduce the potential for unlicensed vehicles to operate as taxis.</p><p>  Given that there is a such a varied fleet in the Irish taxi market the introduction of a uniform vehicle or indeed a uniform colour would bring with it affordability considerations for those operating in the industry or intending to do so. This was a factor that was taken into account by the Taxi Review Group in making its recommendations for taxi branding. Once it is fully rolled out, the current taxi branding needs to be assessed before consideration can be given to whether any such further measures are necessary.</p></reply>
