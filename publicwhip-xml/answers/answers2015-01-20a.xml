A further 8,451 cases did not have an allocated social worker.  <br/><br/>Of these 8,451 cases, 2,844 were deemed to be high priority.  Of the 8,451 children who do not have an allocated social worker, 5,347 have been waiting longer than three months for a social worker to be allocated to them.  Of these 1,774, are deemed to be high priority.  These cases represent a mix of new referrals that need further assessment and social work input, as well as children known to the Agency who need a continuing social work service.  I am assured by the Agency that emergency cases continue to be dealt with immediately, for instance a child who has been abandoned or is in immediate physical danger or at immediate risk of sexual abuse and that high priority cases are kept under review.<br/><br/>At the end of November, 2014 there were 1,403 whole time equivalent social workers employed by the Agency representing 40% of its overall workforce.  A total of 84 social workers were on maternity leave.  The impact of vacancies on service provision is risk-assessed on an on-going basis to ensure that social work team numbers do not fall below what is considered necessary to provide a safe service. <br/><br/>The Child and Family Agency is taking a number of initiatives to address staff shortfalls:<br/><br/>- Continuing recruitment, with 155 social workers recruited since the Agency was established, and a further 193 posts currently in the recruitment process;<br/><br/>- The introduction of a pilot Maternity Leave Scheme whereby temporary staff can be offered a 12 month contract to cover maternity leave;<br/><br/>- In recognition of the challenging nature of this work, new entrants and graduates have a reduced workload for their first year, with opportunities for regular supervision with experienced practitioners;<br/><br/>- The roll out of a caseload management system to ensure caseloads are manageable and prioritised appropriately.<br/><br/>For the Deputy's information, I have set out in tabular format, the total number of children in receipt of social work services broken down by those who have been allocated a social worker, those who are awaiting allocation to a social worker and their associated priority levels as at November 2014.  Also included are details of the length of time children have been waiting for allocation to a social worker and their associated priority level. <br/><br/>The Agency has advised that it collects the relevant data in a standardised manner and not in the format as requested by the Deputy.  <br/><br/><b>Breakdown of Allocation by Priority</b><table><tr><th>Open Cases by Priority</th><th>Allocated</th><th>Unallocated</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>8,767</td><td>2,844</td><td>11,611</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>6,852</td><td>3,977</td><td>10,829</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>4,369</td><td>1,630</td><td>5,999</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>19,988</td><td>8,451</td><td>28,439</td></tr></table><br/><br/><b>Breakdown of Unallocated cases by Length of time and Priority</b><table><tr><th>Open Cases Unallocated at the end of the Month</th><th><div>High Priority</div></th><th><div>Medium Priority</div></th><th><div>Low Priority</div></th><th><div>Total</div></th></tr><tr><td>&amp;lt;1 week</td><td><div>103</div></td><td><div>91</div></td><td><div>17</div></td><td><div>211</div></td></tr><tr><td>1-2 weeks</td><td><div>129</div></td><td><div>127</div></td><td><div>44</div></td><td><div>300</div></td></tr><tr><td>2-3 weeks</td><td><div>174</div></td><td><div>199</div></td><td><div>64</div></td><td><div>437</div></td></tr><tr><td>3-4 weeks</td><td><div>179</div></td><td><div>296</div></td><td><div>83</div></td><td><div>558</div></td></tr><tr><td>1-2 months</td><td><div>272</div></td><td><div>483</div></td><td><div>127</div></td><td><div>882</div></td></tr><tr><td>2-3 months</td><td><div>213</div></td><td><div>303</div></td><td><div>200</div></td><td><div>716</div></td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt;3 months</td><td><div>1,774</div></td><td><div>2,478</div></td><td><div>1,095</div></td><td><div>5,347</div></td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>2,844</div></td><td><div>3,977</div></td><td><div>1,630</div></td><td><div>8,451</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The 2004 Act gives the Commission robust powers to conduct investigations within its terms of reference in the manner it considers appropriate while adhering to the rules and procedures contained within the Act. </p>  <p>  The primary focus of this investigation is on the experiences of women and children who lived in Mother and Baby Homes over the period 1922-1998. While the Terms of Reference provide for a comprehensive investigative framework, the Commission is independent in the performance of its investigations and in deciding how best to approach its work.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that Section 8 of the 2004 Act provides that the Commission may, with the consent of the Minister, appoint persons with relevant qualifications to advise and assist the Commission.  Given the range and scale of the discrete issues to be examined, it is anticipated that the Commission may require the assistance of additional professional expertise and specialists for particular tasks, and funding is available for this purpose. Therefore, it is ultimately a matter for the Commission to consider whether it requires archaeological research and there is ample discretion in the Commission of Investigations Act for the Commission to pursue such methods if it so determines.</p></reply>

The work of the Expert Advisory Group, <i>Right from the Start</i>, has greatly informed the work to date.  I have signalled my intention to conduct focused consultations with relevant parties across the early childhood care and education sector before concluding my own deliberations on the Strategy.  I am also mindful of the importance of other work which is being undertaken in parallel in respect of the future investment priorities in respect of childcare.  Taking account of these developments, I expect to be in a position to publish the Strategy once my own consultations have concluded in the coming months.</p></reply>

The Child and Family Agency (TUSLA) has advised that there were 1,403.46 whole time equivalent social workers employed at the end of November 2014 and that they are currently recruiting an additional 193 social workers to meet existing vacancies. They have also advised that 155 social workers have already been recruited during 2014 and that 102 social workers left employment due to retirement and for other reasons.</p>  <p>  There are currently 84 social workers on maternity leave and in order to address priority gaps in service resulting from maternity leave, a pilot Maternity Leave Cover scheme has been introduced whereby maternity related vacancies in each region can be filled by way of a temporary contracts. The Pilot Scheme involves the allocation of 100 posts between each region, 80 of which relate specifically to social workers. </p>  <p>  The impact of vacancies on service provision is risk-assessed on an ongoing basis to ensure that social work team members are never allowed to fall below what is considered necessary to provide a safe service. Such risk-assessments take account of issues such as case loads and referral numbers. Where necessary, temporary staff  are brought in immediately to cover vacancies until such vacancies are filled on a permanent basis.</p></reply>

As provided for in the Framework, the Department of Social Protection is the lead department on child poverty and has lead responsibility for the commitment to lift over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.  The Department of Social Protection also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.<br/><br/>My Department is working on a number of initiatives which are relevant in addressing issues related to children poverty.  For example, in terms of other provision, my Department is spending &euro;260 million annually on childcare support programmes which provide childcare to 100,000 children. A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes. The CCS programme provides subvention support to parents on low incomes and parents in receipt of certain social welfare payments, whose children are enrolled in community childcare facilities. Additionally, the 3 Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes - the Childcare Education and Training Programme, the Community Employment Childcare programme and the Afterschool Childcare Programme - provide childcare supports to eligible parents returning to work or to education. <br/><br/>It is leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2016).  The ABC Programme is being co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The ABC Programme draws on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people and existing services.<br/><br/>My Department also provides targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects.  In addition, some 31 national and major regional youth work organisations are supported under my Department's Youth Service Grant Scheme and other schemes include the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres.  In 2015, current funding of &euro;49.93m will be provided to my Department for these schemes.<br/><br/>The outcomes of the recent European Commission/Departmental of Social Protection/Department of Children and Youth Affairs national seminar will inform the development of an implementation plan for tackling child poverty.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-20a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015012000058#WRA01700"><p>The Adoption Act 1952 provided a legal basis for adoption in Ireland and for the establishment of the Adoption Board. This brought order to what had been the system of ad-hoc arrangements in lieu of formal adoption procedures up to this point. Prior to the commencement of the 1952 Adoption Act it would be inaccurate to describe these informal adoptions as illegal. However, it is recognised that many adoptions were never formalised even under the transitional arrangement available for some such informal adoptions following the commencement of the Act.  Historic private arrangements operated in conditions of great secrecy and in many cases there are no written records of these events. </p>  <p>  Post 1952, there is some evidence that such ad-hoc arrangements may have continued. It should be noted that there was no barrier to the private placement of a child until the Act of 1998, although such adoptions were required to be legally formalised. In addition, there is some evidence that such private placements may have concealed the true parentage of the child and been registered as a child born to persons with whom the child was placed. Any such registration is a breach of the Civil Registration Acts.  Those affected by illegal registrations, are now unable to access personal records and information.  </p>  <p>  While my Department is not in a position to confirm the actual extent of such registrations, I am advised by the Adoption Authority that a review of the National Adoption Contact Preference Register in 2010 found that there were 100 cases and a further 20 since then, where no adoption took place. The Authority has advised me that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption, or an illegal registration of a birth, should contact the Authority or the Child and Family Agency&rsquo;s Community Services. They are also advised that if any person believes that their birth was illegally registered they should inform the General Registrations Office (GRO) as the body responsible for registration of births, who in turn may refer cases of illegal registrations to the Garda&iacute; Siochana for investigation of criminal wrongdoing. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the proposed Terms of Reference for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes were announced recently and Article 1(VII) specifically requires the Commission to investigate the nature of the relationship between Mother and Baby Homes and other key institutions including children&rsquo;s homes; orphanages; and adoption societies. The Commission will investigate evidence relating to patterns of referral, relationships and cooperation with other entities and intermediary organisations, and any systematic arrangements for the placement of children. I believe that this will allow the Commission sufficient scope to examine both the issue of placing such children for adoption abroad, as well as to examine situations in which the child&rsquo;s parentage was concealed, either by omission or sometimes, by illegal means. If the Commission's reports reveal issues of concern which are potentially criminal in nature, these will be referred to the appropriate investigative and prosecution authorities.</p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to work on the Heads of Bill for the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of Bill as soon as possible. I can say that, the issues in relation to illegal registrations are being considered as part of the drafting process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-20a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015012000058#WRA01900"><p>In developing the Terms of Reference for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters, due regard has been given to the clear emphasis on &ldquo;Mother and Baby Homes&rdquo; in the motion approved by D&aacute;il Eireann on the 11th June 2014. The investigation will thoroughly examine a broad range of matters in relation to the experience of mothers and children who were resident in a Mother and Baby Home over the period 1922-1998. As the Deputy will be aware these Homes have not been the central focus of previous statutory investigations.</p>  <p>  The approach taken to ensure the requisite level of specificity has been to identify Mother and Baby Homes for the purposes of this investigation. The criteria used include having the main function of providing sheltered and supervised ante- and post-natal facilities to single mothers and their children, including both board and lodgings; and an ethos which those running the institutions considered to promote a regime of work, training or education as part of an overall approach to either rehabilitating single mothers, or to give them training for living independently. On the basis of the available information, the institution raised by the Deputy did not provide this type of service for mothers and babies. </p>  <p>   However, it is not accurate to describe these institutions as being excluded from the Commission's work. During the course of consultations, it became clear to me that the issue of entry and exit pathways of both women and children to these Homes raised further questions which needed to be examined. For this reason, the Commission is tasked with examining the extent to which other entities, including children&rsquo;s homes, orphanages and adoption societies, were part of these pathways. This examination will identify patterns of referral, and the practices and arrangements for placing children, including where an intermediary organisation was involved in arranging a subsequent placement. It is certainly open to the Commission to examine the role played by the institution raised by the Deputy in this strand of its investigations. Issues to be examined by the social history module also include the role and interrelationships of a range of institutions, including homes for infants or children. </p>  <p>  I do appreciate that since the decision to establish this investigation was announced there have been calls for the inclusion of a broad range of matters. At least some of these issues are unrelated to the intended remit of this investigation. In addition, and in the interests of maintaining the required focus and specificity on Mother and Baby Homes, it must be recognised that previous inquiries have already examined some related issues. This includes the comprehensive investigation into historical child abuse already conducted by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. Its remit was to inquire into the abuse of children in a broad range of care settings, including childrens' homes, during the period 1940 to 1999.</p>  <p>  The Government is satisfied that the proposed Terms of Reference Government provide an ambitious and appropriately focused set of tasks which can be accomplished by this Commission within a realistic timeframe.</p></reply>

Ultimately it is assisting the Department in gaining a greater depth of knowledge and understanding of child care cases and is increasing the evidence base on which future policy formulation is based.<br/><br/>The Child Care Law Reporting Project publishes reports of child care cases before the courts. It collects and analyses data from the proceedings on the nature and outcomes of the child care proceedings and seeks to promote a public debate on the issues raised through seminars and conferences. This includes small round-table sessions with key policy makers and practitioners. To date, the project has published four volumes of case reports each year in 2013 and 2014 as well as two interim reports, published in November 2013 and October 2014. This work informs Tusla practice and policy on an ongoing basis. Issues raised are also informing the Department's policy and legislative programme. This includes a proposed review of the Child Care Act 1991 which is currently being scoped.</p></reply>

The Irish Youth Justice Service is based in my Department and has responsibility for leading and driving reform in the area of youth justice.<br/><br/>The focus of the <i>Youth Justice Action Plan 2014-2018</i>, which was launched by the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on 3 February 2014 is to achieve better outcomes for children who get into trouble with the law, to reduce crime leading to safer communities and to use detention only as a last resort.  The issue of the nature and pattern of remands in custody for children has recently been the subject of discussions involving the Irish Youth Justice Service and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency which will feed into the development of policy priorities for the Youth Justice Action Plan for 2015.  <br/><br/>Under Section 88 of the Children Act 2001, a court may remand a child in custody who is charged with or found guilty of an offence, who is being sent forward for trial, or in respect of whom the court has postponed a decision. The judiciary are independent in the performance of their functions and the discretion as to whether or not to remand a child in custody is solely for the judge to decide.  The figure of 45% of children quoted by the Deputy is contained in the 2013 annual report of the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  The methodology for this figure is not stated and this may relate to both the detention schools and also 17 year old boys who are currently detained in the adult prison system.  I am advised that in 2013, there were 96 individuals remanded in custody to the children detention schools of whom 26 received a detention order, which equates to 27% of the children concerned.  The comparable figures for 2011 and 2012 were 35% and 31% respectively.  <br/><br/>In many cases, there may be a range of factors affecting the decision of a court on the remand of a child in custody.  As well as a pattern of criminal behaviour, this may also include identified service needs in areas such as mental health supports, substance abuse or educational welfare.  Section 88(10) of the Children Act states that the court shall not remand a child in custody if the only reason for so doing is that the child is in need of care or protection or the court wishes Tusla to assist it in dealing with the case.  The court may also request Tusla to be represented in the proceedings under section 76B of the Children Act.  Children are legally represented in court and the courts also have the authority to require the attendance of parents or guardians to assist the court in dealing with any individual case involving a child.</p></reply>

While due regard has been given to the emphasis on &ldquo;Mother and Baby Homes&rdquo; in the motion approved by D&aacute;il Eireann on the 11th June 2014, the terms of reference also reflect a much wider agenda of directly related matters than was evident at the initiation of this process.</p>  <p>  The approach taken provides a clear and deliberate emphasis on the experiences of women and children who spent time in Mother and Baby Homes over the period 1922-1998. As we know these institutions have not been the central focus of previous investigations. Clear criteria have been used to identify Mother and Baby Homes for the purpose of this investigation, including having the main function of providing sheltered and supervised ante and post-natal facilities to single mothers and their children. The Terms of Reference do include the former Magdalen Home at 8 Lower lesson Street, Dublin 2, as a Mother and Baby Home, although the information available indicates that the Magdalen Laundries did not provide this specific type of service. </p>  <p>  During the course of my consultations with advocacy groups and political colleagues across the spectrum, it became clear to me that the issue of entry and exit pathways of both women and children raised further questions which needed to be examined. In this regard, the Deputy may wish to note that the Commission is tasked with examining the extent to which other entities were part of the entry or exit pathways for single mothers and children into or leaving these specified Homes. It is certainly open to the Commission to give consideration to the Magdalen Laundries in this significant strand of its investigations. The issues to be examined by the social history module also explicitly cite the Magdalen Laundries in this regard. </p>  <p>  I believe that both the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, and the Terms of Reference themselves, provide adequate opportunity for the Commission to take an independent view of the adequacy of scope, given its task. The Deputy may also wish to note that the proposed arrangements, in particular Article 6 of the Terms of Reference, require the Commission to make recommendations in respect of any matters which is not covered by the existing scope, but which it considers may warrant investigation in the public interest.</p>  <p>  Details in respect of the Commission are available on my Department&rsquo;s website including a number of explanatory documents.</p></reply>

I understand that this relates to social work across all services including Primary Care, Disabilities, Mental Health, Older Persons and Children and Families. While the Agency is experiencing some staff retention issues, the turnover of social workers in the Agency&rsquo;s first year of operation (2014) was 6.7% &ndash; less than that experienced in many neighbouring countries. At the end of November 2014, there were 1,403.46 whole time equivalent social workers and the Agency is currently recruiting an additional 193 posts to meet existing vacancies. </p>  <p>  The area of child protection and welfare social work is one of the most challenging areas of work for any professional and involves working closely with some of the most vulnerable and marginalised individuals and groups in society. The Agency is committed to producing a Workforce Development Plan by the end of June 2015, which will provide an opportunity to improve resource deployment and take account of the need to support and develop staff who work in this critical area.</p>  <p>  The impact of vacancies on service provision is risk-assessed on an ongoing basis to ensure that social work team members are never allowed to fall below what is considered necessary to provide a safe service. Such risk-assessments take account of issues such as case loads and referral numbers. Where necessary, temporary staff  are brought in immediately to cover vacancies until such vacancies are filled on a permanent basis.  The Deputy should note that if a child does not have an allocated social worker it does not mean that there is no oversight from social work professionals. Cases awaiting allocation are reviewed regularly by the principal social worker/team leaders and are managed by duty social work teams.  Depending on the circumstances and priority level, the child could be visited regularly by the social worker on duty and/or other professionals, such as teachers, may be contacted daily if necessary.  The purpose of the oversight is to establish if the child&rsquo;s circumstances have changed and to monitor the risk to their well-being. An example could be where an initial assessment has established a child is at high risk due to their parent&rsquo;s abuse of alcohol, however, the child then goes to live with their grandparents, and so immediate risk decreases although the case will require further attention.</p></reply>

The provision of intervention and supports to target the particular needs of children will be dependent on the type of disadvantage, be it social, financial, educational, health etc. Responsibility for the identification and provision of those interventions will fall to my Ministerial colleagues as appropriate to the type of disadvantage. For example, the Department of Education and Skills have lead responsibility for issues concerning educational disadvantage, the Department of Social Protection has lead responsibility for addressing child poverty.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding this, I am fully convinced of the need for a whole-of-government approach in addressing such issues.<i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People (2014-2020)</i>takes such an approach in addressing disadvantage for children, emphasising an integrated and evidence informed approach to working across government, on horizontal and vertical levels, which transfers to all sectors and settings working with children and young people.<br/><br/>While my Department has overall responsibility for the framework, individual Departments will continue to take lead roles on matters within their remit.<br/><br/>My Department has lead responsibility for a range of funding schemes which target disadvantage across the areas of services and supports for children and young people.<br/><br/>My Department supports a range of education support services for children in disadvantaged communities. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has a statutory remit to support children and young people to participate in and benefit from the education system. Tusla has responsibility to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education<br/><br/>Tusla delivers an integrated approach to educational welfare services through the continued reform of work practices to provide an enhanced response to the needs of children, families and schools. Three service strands &ndash; the statutory Educational Welfare Service and the School Support Programme services under the Department of Education's DEIS Action Plan (namely, the Home-School Community Liaison Scheme and the School Completion Programme) collectively form the Educational Welfare Services (EWS) of the Agency. <br/><br/>I am advised by Tusla that the statutory Educational Welfare Services worked with over 20,000 children in 2013. Some 2,434 cases involved intensive intervention and a multidisciplinary approach and the provision of sustained support by an Education Welfare Officer to address the child's needs and support school attendance. During this period the School Completion Programme provided targeted support to approximately 36,000 children and young people at risk of early school leaving across 124 community based programmes.<br/><br/>Tusla also provides a range of services that offer advice and support to families.  This includes over 100 family resource centres.  The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit. The Programme emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level. <br/><br/>The main focus of these services is on early intervention aiming to promote and protect the health and well-being and rights of all children, young people and their families.  At the same time particular attention is given to those who are vulnerable or at risk.<br/><br/>I recently issued the Performance Statement 2015 to the Tusla. This Performance Statement provides Tusla with specific policy guidance, direction, and prioritisation and resource parameters to inform the preparation of its Business Plan for 2015.<br/><br/>As part of the Performance Statement, I have asked that in the area of family support, Tusla should provide a clear framework for action to expedite and enhance their capabilities in the area of early intervention and protection through supporting parents and families in accordance with relevant Government policy.  Key elements of this framework are to be developed during 2015.<br/><br/>My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country, including those from disadvantaged communities.  Targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects.  In addition, some 31 national and major regional youth work organisations are supported under my Department's Youth Service Grant Scheme and other schemes include the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. In 2015, current funding of &euro;49.93m will be provided to my Department for these schemes.<br/><br/>My Department also assists children experiencing deprivation by taking the lead in implementing the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme. The ABC Programme is being co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The ABC Programme draws on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty in communities where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people and existing services.</p></reply>

The comparable figure for the same date in 2013 was 14 children and the same number also applied on 30 October 2014.  The reduction of approximately 50% in the number of children detained in the adult prison system between 2012 and 2013 reflects the transfer of responsibility for 16 year old boys to the children detention schools, which was put in place in May 2012.  On 16 January 2015, there were a total of 16 boys detained in the adult prison system, comprising 6 boys remanded in custody in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and 10 boys serving a sentence of detention in Wheatfield Place of Detention. <br/><br/>There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to end the practice of detaining<b></b>children in adult prison facilities.  Significant progress has been made and this commitment will  be fully met when the extension of the Oberstown campus results in the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from the adult prison system to the children detention schools. The Oberstown capital development project, which commenced on site in September 2013, will enable the extension of the child care model of detention, which focuses on education and rehabilitation in order to minimize re-offending, to all under 18 year olds ordered to be detained by the courts on criminal justice charges.<br/><br/>The first 3 units of residential accommodation, which will prioritise the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities, were formally handed over to the Oberstown campus on 27 November 2014, following the required inspection of works and technical approval of the Office of Public Works, managing the project on behalf of my Department.  I am advised that, in order to ensure safe and secure custody of children in the new buildings and that the appropriate health and safety standards are met, a further period of training and orientation for staff and for the fitting out of the new units with furniture and equipment is required.  This process is ongoing at present and will be completed in the first quarter of 2015.<br/><br/>Other issues impacting on the operational date for the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys are the recruitment of the required complement of new care staff to work in the expanded facilities, and the passage of necessary legislation to ensure that all legal issues relating to the detention of children up to the age of 18 are fully addressed.  Following a recruitment programme carried out in 2014, 38 new care staff have commenced employment on the Oberstown campus and completed the training and orientation process.  However, the recruitment programme had a target of 60 additional care staff and an additional  process for a further phase of recruitment is currently underway.  It is intended that the required staff complement will be reached in the second quarter of 2015 for the operation of all of the new residential units.  <br/><br/>My Department is also progressing the necessary legal changes required in order to transfer responsibility for 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities.  Heads of a Bill to amend the Children Act, 2001 were approved by Government in September 2014 and it is intended that the Bill will be published this quarter and enacted as soon as possible thereafter. <br/><br/>My Department is reviewing these matters on an ongoing basis and it is my intention that the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities will cease as early as possible this year.</p></reply>

It involved bringing together nearly 4,000 staff from three separate organisations, the Health Service Executive, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  The establishment of the new Agency with a budget of over &euro;600m represents one of the most ambitious and far reaching public sector reforms undertaken by the Government.  The Agency, in discharging its functions, is placing a strong emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support, therapeutic and care interventions, all of which are key to the provision of integrated, multi-disciplinary services for vulnerable children and families. </p>  <p>  Psychology services for children are currently being provided by the HSE. The Agency and the HSE have in place both a Memorandum of Understanding and a Joint Protocol for inter-agency collaboration which underpins the provision of these services for children. The purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding is to set out the partnership agreement between the HSE and the Agency to continue pre-establishment levels of service across both organisations. The objective of the Joint Protocol is to specify a pathway and associated responsibilities for children and families whose needs cross between Health Service Divisions and the Agency. </p>  <p>  Both the Memorandum of Understanding and the Joint Protocol are subject to regular monitoring and review to ensure that they are working effectively in the best interests of children and families. Additionally, the Agency and the HSE are working to finalise a service level agreement to underpin the provision of psychological services by the HSE which will assist the Agency in fulfilling its statutory obligations.  The service level agreement with the HSE will determine the quantum of service needed to meet the Agency's requirements and will be an interim arrangement pending the Agency providing the service directly.  </p>  <p>  Clinical psychology services are directly provided by the Child and Family Agency within multi-disciplinary teams deployed by the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS). Services provided include assessment and focused interventions for children and young people with complex clinical needs and high risk behaviours. They also provide support to other professionals in order to guide interventions to children and families.</p></reply>

Ensuring the best possible outcomes for children in their early years is therefore an important element in future economic planning. </p>  <p>  The case for investing in children and young people on both social and economic grounds is supported by a body of international evidence.  As the Minister with responsibility for this key area, I propose to establish a cross-Departmental group at senior level to develop a whole-of-Government approach to future investment in early childhood care and education and after-school care. The group will undertake an economic and cost benefit analysis of policies and future options for increasing the supply, accessibility and affordability of quality childhood care and education services. </p>  <p>  It is clear that accessibility, affordability and high quality childcare can play a critical role in achieving a number of Government priorities, including improving educational outcome for children, reducing poverty and increasing parents' participation in the labour market. The importance of this area is reinforced by continuing economic improvement and job growth and an increased focus on activation for those currently outside the labour market.</p>  <p>  To ensure that all the potential benefits can be realised, future public investment in childcare must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. It must look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as consider the after-school needs of older school-going children. It is crucial, therefore, that we develop a coherent cross-Government approach to investment in childcare services.</p>  <p>  The group which I propose to establish will include representatives of the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach and will be led and supported by my Department.  I will be asking that the work of this group be carried out within a relatively short time frame and I expect that the group will be in a position to report to me in the Summer.</p></reply>

The Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. It provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children.</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects. In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million has been provided for the School Completion Programme. The Agency has approved local projects' school retention plans for the 2014/2015 academic year. The first instalment of 2014/15 funding issued to local projects last September. Further payments totalling approximately &euro;9.5m have issued over the past month, with a third instalment in May 2015.   </p>  <p>  The estimate for the Child and Family Agency for 2015 is &euro;631 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation. My Department has recently issued a Performance Statement to the Agency under Section 45 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013. This includes my priorities for consideration in the development of the Agency's 2015 Business Plan. The Business Plan will set out the Agency's proposed activities, programmes and priorities for 2015, including provision for the School Completion Programme, in the light of the monies available.</p>  <p>  A review of the School Completion Programme has commenced. It is being carried out by the ESRI following a procurement process managed by the Agency. The programme has been in operation since 2002 and I believe that it is timely that a review be carried out.  The Review is an important initiative to plan for the future development of this Programme.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed during the 2014/2015 academic year.</p></reply>

I view these independent inspection reports as an essential component of quality improvement for children's residential centres, which work alongside internal processes within the Agency.  Residential care accounts for a very small proportion - less than 5% - of children in care (316 of 6,454).  During 2014, HIQA focused its inspections of residential centres on how staff manage children - usually older teenagers - who have behaviour described as challenging and difficult.</p>  <p>  Last week there were concerning reports in the media regarding a children's residential care unit in the southern region following the publication of an inspection report on 12th January 2015.  HIQA's inspection found that the three teenagers living in the centre at the time were taking risks primarily in the form of taking illegal substances when outside the centre.  The inspection report notes that the staff and managers tried to make sure that these young people were safe but weren't able to prevent them from leaving the centre without permission or taking drugs.  I am advised by my officials that Ireland is somewhat unusual in that we have quite a number of 16 and 17 year olds coming into care.  Latest figures from the Agency indicate that 14% that is, 258 of young people received into care in 2013 were over the age of 16.  Some of these young people had very difficult lives before coming into care including histories of emotional and behavioural difficulties and substance misuse.  Agency staff and those working in HSE mental health and addiction services engage with these young people to try and help them overcome their problems - but helping young people with such complex backgrounds is challenging work.</p>  <p>  I take the care and safety of all children and young people in care very seriously indeed, as do the Agency's staff, and I recognise that the job of helping troubled young people to resolve their difficulties is key to keeping them safe.  This includes referring young people to specialist addiction counsellors in the HSE when required.</p>  <p>  The Agency has advised me there is one young person living in the centre now - he is doing well and has a good relationship with the staff.  Another young person was discharged home and the third is in a private residential centre (following a period of detention in the criminal justice system).  Since the inspection, the Agency has advised that it is carrying out a management review of the centre and that no further children are to be admitted pending its outcome.  I have asked the Agency to keep my Department appraised and look forward to learning the outcome of the review.</p></reply>

Any person, or persons, who run an organisation which provides services to children and young people should be aware of, and comply with, their child protection obligations as set out in Children First. Section 4.7.2 of the Guidance provides that all statutory, voluntary and community organisations working with and in direct contact with children should have procedures and guidelines derived from and consistent with the current <i>Children First: National Guidance</i>. <i>Our Duty to Care: The Principles of Good Practice for the Protection of Children and Young People</i>, published in 2002, offers specific guidance to the community and voluntary sectors on the promotion of child protection and welfare practices.<br/><br/>The Children First Bill, 2014, which is currently progressing through the Oireachtas, will place key elements of the Children First National Guidance on a statutory basis once it is enacted and commenced. In effect, this means that providers of relevant services will acquire a number of statutory obligations. Under the Bill, providers of relevant services are defined as organisations which employ one or more persons. Relevant services are listed in Schedule 1 of the Children First Bill and include educational, research, training, cultural, recreational, leisure, social and physical activities. Once the Bill is commenced, a provider of relevant services will be required to undertake a risk assessment of the potential harm which could come to a child while availing of the services, and to then prepare a Child Safeguarding Statement which outlines the policies and procedures which are in place to mitigate the risks identified. Furthermore, certain persons who are mandated persons under the Bill, will be required by the legislation to report child welfare and protection concerns. These would include persons employed as safeguarding or child protection officers in organisations providing services to children. <br/><br/>In parallel to the legislative process, my officials are currently revising and updating the existing Children First National Guidance. This is to ensure that the Guidance, which will continue as the basis for all citizens to report concerns, reflects the new legislative obligations and provides, in one place, a complete reference resource for individuals and organisations.  This will provide clarity and ensure consistency between the proposed legislation and the existing non-statutory obligations which will continue to operate administratively for all sectors of society.<br/><br/>Requirements in relation to the vetting of persons who work with children are a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality. The Deputy should refer to the website of that Department for further information, including in relation to the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act, 2012.</p></reply>

Responsibility for 16 year old boys was transferred from the adult prison system to the Oberstown campus in May 2012 and this commitment will be fully met when the extension of the Oberstown campus results in the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from the adult prison system to the children detention schools. The Oberstown capital development project, which commenced on site in September 2013, will enable the extension of the child care model of detention, which focuses on education and rehabilitation in order to minimize re-offending, to all under 18 year olds ordered to be detained by the courts on criminal justice charges.<br/><br/>The first 3 units of residential accommodation, which will prioritise the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities, were formally handed over to the Oberstown campus on 27 November 2014, following the required inspection of works and technical approval of the Office of Public Works, managing the project on behalf of my Department.  I am advised that, in order to ensure safe and secure custody of children in the new buildings and that the appropriate health and safety standards are met, a further period of training and orientation for staff and for the fitting out of the new units with furniture and equipment is required.  This process is ongoing at present and will be completed in the first quarter of 2015.<br/><br/>Other issues impacting on the operational date for the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys are the recruitment of the required complement of new care staff to work in the expanded facilities, and the passage of necessary legislation to ensure that all legal issues relating to the detention of children up to the age of 18 are fully addressed.  Following a recruitment programme carried out in 2014, 38 new care staff have commenced employment on the Oberstown campus and completed the training and orientation process.  However, the recruitment programme had a target of 60 additional care staff and an additional process for a further phase of recruitment is currently under way.  It is intended that the required staff complement will be reached in the second quarter of 2015 for the operation of all of the new residential units.<br/><br/>My Department is also progressing the necessary legal changes required in order to transfer responsibility for 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities.  Heads of a Bill to amend the Children Act, 2001 were approved by Government in September 2014 and it is intended that the Bill will be published this quarter and enacted as soon as possible thereafter. <br/><br/>My Department is reviewing these matters on an ongoing basis and it is my intention that the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities will cease as early as possible this year. </p></reply>

The most recent data available is for the reference year 2013.<br/><br/>Job creation for an enterprise in a given reference year is measured as the positive difference in the number of paid employees recorded with non-zero reckonable pay in the reference year compared with the previous year.

Jobs lost in the services sectors as a whole is the sum of all enterprise jobs lost.  It should be noted that when interpreting figures, jobs lost for a particular year means that these jobs were identified in the previous year but not in the reference year, that is some of these jobs may have disappeared sometime during the previous year.  Net job creation is calculated as the difference between job creation and jobs lost.<br/><br/>The calculation of rates for a given year is based on the average number of jobs counted in the given year and the year previous to the given year.<br/><br/>Considering the services sectors as Business Economy services excluding activities of holding companies (G to N,-642)<b>,</b>jobs lost rates fell from 27% in 2009 before stabilizing at 12% from 2011 onwards.
