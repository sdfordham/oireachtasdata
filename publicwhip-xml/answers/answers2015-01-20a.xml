A further 8,451 cases did not have an allocated social worker.  <br/><br/>Of these 8,451 cases, 2,844 were deemed to be high priority.  Of the 8,451 children who do not have an allocated social worker, 5,347 have been waiting longer than three months for a social worker to be allocated to them.  Of these 1,774, are deemed to be high priority.  These cases represent a mix of new referrals that need further assessment and social work input, as well as children known to the Agency who need a continuing social work service.  I am assured by the Agency that emergency cases continue to be dealt with immediately, for instance a child who has been abandoned or is in immediate physical danger or at immediate risk of sexual abuse and that high priority cases are kept under review.<br/><br/>At the end of November, 2014 there were 1,403 whole time equivalent social workers employed by the Agency representing 40% of its overall workforce.  A total of 84 social workers were on maternity leave.  The impact of vacancies on service provision is risk-assessed on an on-going basis to ensure that social work team numbers do not fall below what is considered necessary to provide a safe service. <br/><br/>The Child and Family Agency is taking a number of initiatives to address staff shortfalls:<br/><br/>- Continuing recruitment, with 155 social workers recruited since the Agency was established, and a further 193 posts currently in the recruitment process;<br/><br/>- The introduction of a pilot Maternity Leave Scheme whereby temporary staff can be offered a 12 month contract to cover maternity leave;<br/><br/>- In recognition of the challenging nature of this work, new entrants and graduates have a reduced workload for their first year, with opportunities for regular supervision with experienced practitioners;<br/><br/>- The roll out of a caseload management system to ensure caseloads are manageable and prioritised appropriately.<br/><br/>For the Deputy's information, I have set out in tabular format, the total number of children in receipt of social work services broken down by those who have been allocated a social worker, those who are awaiting allocation to a social worker and their associated priority levels as at November 2014.  Also included are details of the length of time children have been waiting for allocation to a social worker and their associated priority level. <br/><br/>The Agency has advised that it collects the relevant data in a standardised manner and not in the format as requested by the Deputy.  <br/><br/><b>Breakdown of Allocation by Priority</b><table><tr><th>Open Cases by Priority</th><th>Allocated</th><th>Unallocated</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>8,767</td><td>2,844</td><td>11,611</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>6,852</td><td>3,977</td><td>10,829</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>4,369</td><td>1,630</td><td>5,999</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>19,988</td><td>8,451</td><td>28,439</td></tr></table><br/><br/><b>Breakdown of Unallocated cases by Length of time and Priority</b><table><tr><th>Open Cases Unallocated at the end of the Month</th><th><div>High Priority</div></th><th><div>Medium Priority</div></th><th><div>Low Priority</div></th><th><div>Total</div></th></tr><tr><td>&amp;lt;1 week</td><td><div>103</div></td><td><div>91</div></td><td><div>17</div></td><td><div>211</div></td></tr><tr><td>1-2 weeks</td><td><div>129</div></td><td><div>127</div></td><td><div>44</div></td><td><div>300</div></td></tr><tr><td>2-3 weeks</td><td><div>174</div></td><td><div>199</div></td><td><div>64</div></td><td><div>437</div></td></tr><tr><td>3-4 weeks</td><td><div>179</div></td><td><div>296</div></td><td><div>83</div></td><td><div>558</div></td></tr><tr><td>1-2 months</td><td><div>272</div></td><td><div>483</div></td><td><div>127</div></td><td><div>882</div></td></tr><tr><td>2-3 months</td><td><div>213</div></td><td><div>303</div></td><td><div>200</div></td><td><div>716</div></td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt;3 months</td><td><div>1,774</div></td><td><div>2,478</div></td><td><div>1,095</div></td><td><div>5,347</div></td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>2,844</div></td><td><div>3,977</div></td><td><div>1,630</div></td><td><div>8,451</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The 2004 Act gives the Commission robust powers to conduct investigations within its terms of reference in the manner it considers appropriate while adhering to the rules and procedures contained within the Act. </p>  <p>  The primary focus of this investigation is on the experiences of women and children who lived in Mother and Baby Homes over the period 1922-1998. While the Terms of Reference provide for a comprehensive investigative framework, the Commission is independent in the performance of its investigations and in deciding how best to approach its work.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that Section 8 of the 2004 Act provides that the Commission may, with the consent of the Minister, appoint persons with relevant qualifications to advise and assist the Commission.  Given the range and scale of the discrete issues to be examined, it is anticipated that the Commission may require the assistance of additional professional expertise and specialists for particular tasks, and funding is available for this purpose. Therefore, it is ultimately a matter for the Commission to consider whether it requires archaeological research and there is ample discretion in the Commission of Investigations Act for the Commission to pursue such methods if it so determines.</p></reply>

The work of the Expert Advisory Group, <i>Right from the Start</i>, has greatly informed the work to date.  I have signalled my intention to conduct focused consultations with relevant parties across the early childhood care and education sector before concluding my own deliberations on the Strategy.  I am also mindful of the importance of other work which is being undertaken in parallel in respect of the future investment priorities in respect of childcare.  Taking account of these developments, I expect to be in a position to publish the Strategy once my own consultations have concluded in the coming months.</p></reply>

The Child and Family Agency (TUSLA) has advised that there were 1,403.46 whole time equivalent social workers employed at the end of November 2014 and that they are currently recruiting an additional 193 social workers to meet existing vacancies. They have also advised that 155 social workers have already been recruited during 2014 and that 102 social workers left employment due to retirement and for other reasons.</p>  <p>  There are currently 84 social workers on maternity leave and in order to address priority gaps in service resulting from maternity leave, a pilot Maternity Leave Cover scheme has been introduced whereby maternity related vacancies in each region can be filled by way of a temporary contracts. The Pilot Scheme involves the allocation of 100 posts between each region, 80 of which relate specifically to social workers. </p>  <p>  The impact of vacancies on service provision is risk-assessed on an ongoing basis to ensure that social work team members are never allowed to fall below what is considered necessary to provide a safe service. Such risk-assessments take account of issues such as case loads and referral numbers. Where necessary, temporary staff  are brought in immediately to cover vacancies until such vacancies are filled on a permanent basis.</p></reply>

As provided for in the Framework, the Department of Social Protection is the lead department on child poverty and has lead responsibility for the commitment to lift over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.  The Department of Social Protection also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.<br/><br/>My Department is working on a number of initiatives which are relevant in addressing issues related to children poverty.  For example, in terms of other provision, my Department is spending &euro;260 million annually on childcare support programmes which provide childcare to 100,000 children. A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes. The CCS programme provides subvention support to parents on low incomes and parents in receipt of certain social welfare payments, whose children are enrolled in community childcare facilities. Additionally, the 3 Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes - the Childcare Education and Training Programme, the Community Employment Childcare programme and the Afterschool Childcare Programme - provide childcare supports to eligible parents returning to work or to education. <br/><br/>It is leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2016).  The ABC Programme is being co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The ABC Programme draws on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people and existing services.<br/><br/>My Department also provides targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects.  In addition, some 31 national and major regional youth work organisations are supported under my Department's Youth Service Grant Scheme and other schemes include the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres.  In 2015, current funding of &euro;49.93m will be provided to my Department for these schemes.<br/><br/>The outcomes of the recent European Commission/Departmental of Social Protection/Department of Children and Youth Affairs national seminar will inform the development of an implementation plan for tackling child poverty.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-20a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015012000058#WRA01700"><p>The Adoption Act 1952 provided a legal basis for adoption in Ireland and for the establishment of the Adoption Board. This brought order to what had been the system of ad-hoc arrangements in lieu of formal adoption procedures up to this point. Prior to the commencement of the 1952 Adoption Act it would be inaccurate to describe these informal adoptions as illegal. However, it is recognised that many adoptions were never formalised even under the transitional arrangement available for some such informal adoptions following the commencement of the Act.  Historic private arrangements operated in conditions of great secrecy and in many cases there are no written records of these events. </p>  <p>  Post 1952, there is some evidence that such ad-hoc arrangements may have continued. It should be noted that there was no barrier to the private placement of a child until the Act of 1998, although such adoptions were required to be legally formalised. In addition, there is some evidence that such private placements may have concealed the true parentage of the child and been registered as a child born to persons with whom the child was placed. Any such registration is a breach of the Civil Registration Acts.  Those affected by illegal registrations, are now unable to access personal records and information.  </p>  <p>  While my Department is not in a position to confirm the actual extent of such registrations, I am advised by the Adoption Authority that a review of the National Adoption Contact Preference Register in 2010 found that there were 100 cases and a further 20 since then, where no adoption took place. The Authority has advised me that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption, or an illegal registration of a birth, should contact the Authority or the Child and Family Agency&rsquo;s Community Services. They are also advised that if any person believes that their birth was illegally registered they should inform the General Registrations Office (GRO) as the body responsible for registration of births, who in turn may refer cases of illegal registrations to the Garda&iacute; Siochana for investigation of criminal wrongdoing. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the proposed Terms of Reference for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes were announced recently and Article 1(VII) specifically requires the Commission to investigate the nature of the relationship between Mother and Baby Homes and other key institutions including children&rsquo;s homes; orphanages; and adoption societies. The Commission will investigate evidence relating to patterns of referral, relationships and cooperation with other entities and intermediary organisations, and any systematic arrangements for the placement of children. I believe that this will allow the Commission sufficient scope to examine both the issue of placing such children for adoption abroad, as well as to examine situations in which the child&rsquo;s parentage was concealed, either by omission or sometimes, by illegal means. If the Commission's reports reveal issues of concern which are potentially criminal in nature, these will be referred to the appropriate investigative and prosecution authorities.</p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to work on the Heads of Bill for the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of Bill as soon as possible. I can say that, the issues in relation to illegal registrations are being considered as part of the drafting process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-20a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015012000058#WRA01900"><p>In developing the Terms of Reference for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters, due regard has been given to the clear emphasis on &ldquo;Mother and Baby Homes&rdquo; in the motion approved by D&aacute;il Eireann on the 11th June 2014. The investigation will thoroughly examine a broad range of matters in relation to the experience of mothers and children who were resident in a Mother and Baby Home over the period 1922-1998. As the Deputy will be aware these Homes have not been the central focus of previous statutory investigations.</p>  <p>  The approach taken to ensure the requisite level of specificity has been to identify Mother and Baby Homes for the purposes of this investigation. The criteria used include having the main function of providing sheltered and supervised ante- and post-natal facilities to single mothers and their children, including both board and lodgings; and an ethos which those running the institutions considered to promote a regime of work, training or education as part of an overall approach to either rehabilitating single mothers, or to give them training for living independently. On the basis of the available information, the institution raised by the Deputy did not provide this type of service for mothers and babies. </p>  <p>   However, it is not accurate to describe these institutions as being excluded from the Commission's work. During the course of consultations, it became clear to me that the issue of entry and exit pathways of both women and children to these Homes raised further questions which needed to be examined. For this reason, the Commission is tasked with examining the extent to which other entities, including children&rsquo;s homes, orphanages and adoption societies, were part of these pathways. This examination will identify patterns of referral, and the practices and arrangements for placing children, including where an intermediary organisation was involved in arranging a subsequent placement. It is certainly open to the Commission to examine the role played by the institution raised by the Deputy in this strand of its investigations. Issues to be examined by the social history module also include the role and interrelationships of a range of institutions, including homes for infants or children. </p>  <p>  I do appreciate that since the decision to establish this investigation was announced there have been calls for the inclusion of a broad range of matters. At least some of these issues are unrelated to the intended remit of this investigation. In addition, and in the interests of maintaining the required focus and specificity on Mother and Baby Homes, it must be recognised that previous inquiries have already examined some related issues. This includes the comprehensive investigation into historical child abuse already conducted by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. Its remit was to inquire into the abuse of children in a broad range of care settings, including childrens' homes, during the period 1940 to 1999.</p>  <p>  The Government is satisfied that the proposed Terms of Reference Government provide an ambitious and appropriately focused set of tasks which can be accomplished by this Commission within a realistic timeframe.</p></reply>

Ultimately it is assisting the Department in gaining a greater depth of knowledge and understanding of child care cases and is increasing the evidence base on which future policy formulation is based.<br/><br/>The Child Care Law Reporting Project publishes reports of child care cases before the courts. It collects and analyses data from the proceedings on the nature and outcomes of the child care proceedings and seeks to promote a public debate on the issues raised through seminars and conferences. This includes small round-table sessions with key policy makers and practitioners. To date, the project has published four volumes of case reports each year in 2013 and 2014 as well as two interim reports, published in November 2013 and October 2014. This work informs Tusla practice and policy on an ongoing basis. Issues raised are also informing the Department's policy and legislative programme. This includes a proposed review of the Child Care Act 1991 which is currently being scoped.</p></reply>

The Irish Youth Justice Service is based in my Department and has responsibility for leading and driving reform in the area of youth justice.<br/><br/>The focus of the <i>Youth Justice Action Plan 2014-2018</i>, which was launched by the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on 3 February 2014 is to achieve better outcomes for children who get into trouble with the law, to reduce crime leading to safer communities and to use detention only as a last resort.  The issue of the nature and pattern of remands in custody for children has recently been the subject of discussions involving the Irish Youth Justice Service and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency which will feed into the development of policy priorities for the Youth Justice Action Plan for 2015.  <br/><br/>Under Section 88 of the Children Act 2001, a court may remand a child in custody who is charged with or found guilty of an offence, who is being sent forward for trial, or in respect of whom the court has postponed a decision. The judiciary are independent in the performance of their functions and the discretion as to whether or not to remand a child in custody is solely for the judge to decide.  The figure of 45% of children quoted by the Deputy is contained in the 2013 annual report of the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  The methodology for this figure is not stated and this may relate to both the detention schools and also 17 year old boys who are currently detained in the adult prison system.  I am advised that in 2013, there were 96 individuals remanded in custody to the children detention schools of whom 26 received a detention order, which equates to 27% of the children concerned.  The comparable figures for 2011 and 2012 were 35% and 31% respectively.  <br/><br/>In many cases, there may be a range of factors affecting the decision of a court on the remand of a child in custody.  As well as a pattern of criminal behaviour, this may also include identified service needs in areas such as mental health supports, substance abuse or educational welfare.  Section 88(10) of the Children Act states that the court shall not remand a child in custody if the only reason for so doing is that the child is in need of care or protection or the court wishes Tusla to assist it in dealing with the case.  The court may also request Tusla to be represented in the proceedings under section 76B of the Children Act.  Children are legally represented in court and the courts also have the authority to require the attendance of parents or guardians to assist the court in dealing with any individual case involving a child.</p></reply>

While due regard has been given to the emphasis on &ldquo;Mother and Baby Homes&rdquo; in the motion approved by D&aacute;il Eireann on the 11th June 2014, the terms of reference also reflect a much wider agenda of directly related matters than was evident at the initiation of this process.</p>  <p>  The approach taken provides a clear and deliberate emphasis on the experiences of women and children who spent time in Mother and Baby Homes over the period 1922-1998. As we know these institutions have not been the central focus of previous investigations. Clear criteria have been used to identify Mother and Baby Homes for the purpose of this investigation, including having the main function of providing sheltered and supervised ante and post-natal facilities to single mothers and their children. The Terms of Reference do include the former Magdalen Home at 8 Lower lesson Street, Dublin 2, as a Mother and Baby Home, although the information available indicates that the Magdalen Laundries did not provide this specific type of service. </p>  <p>  During the course of my consultations with advocacy groups and political colleagues across the spectrum, it became clear to me that the issue of entry and exit pathways of both women and children raised further questions which needed to be examined. In this regard, the Deputy may wish to note that the Commission is tasked with examining the extent to which other entities were part of the entry or exit pathways for single mothers and children into or leaving these specified Homes. It is certainly open to the Commission to give consideration to the Magdalen Laundries in this significant strand of its investigations. The issues to be examined by the social history module also explicitly cite the Magdalen Laundries in this regard. </p>  <p>  I believe that both the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, and the Terms of Reference themselves, provide adequate opportunity for the Commission to take an independent view of the adequacy of scope, given its task. The Deputy may also wish to note that the proposed arrangements, in particular Article 6 of the Terms of Reference, require the Commission to make recommendations in respect of any matters which is not covered by the existing scope, but which it considers may warrant investigation in the public interest.</p>  <p>  Details in respect of the Commission are available on my Department&rsquo;s website including a number of explanatory documents.</p></reply>

I understand that this relates to social work across all services including Primary Care, Disabilities, Mental Health, Older Persons and Children and Families. While the Agency is experiencing some staff retention issues, the turnover of social workers in the Agency&rsquo;s first year of operation (2014) was 6.7% &ndash; less than that experienced in many neighbouring countries. At the end of November 2014, there were 1,403.46 whole time equivalent social workers and the Agency is currently recruiting an additional 193 posts to meet existing vacancies. </p>  <p>  The area of child protection and welfare social work is one of the most challenging areas of work for any professional and involves working closely with some of the most vulnerable and marginalised individuals and groups in society. The Agency is committed to producing a Workforce Development Plan by the end of June 2015, which will provide an opportunity to improve resource deployment and take account of the need to support and develop staff who work in this critical area.</p>  <p>  The impact of vacancies on service provision is risk-assessed on an ongoing basis to ensure that social work team members are never allowed to fall below what is considered necessary to provide a safe service. Such risk-assessments take account of issues such as case loads and referral numbers. Where necessary, temporary staff  are brought in immediately to cover vacancies until such vacancies are filled on a permanent basis.  The Deputy should note that if a child does not have an allocated social worker it does not mean that there is no oversight from social work professionals. Cases awaiting allocation are reviewed regularly by the principal social worker/team leaders and are managed by duty social work teams.  Depending on the circumstances and priority level, the child could be visited regularly by the social worker on duty and/or other professionals, such as teachers, may be contacted daily if necessary.  The purpose of the oversight is to establish if the child&rsquo;s circumstances have changed and to monitor the risk to their well-being. An example could be where an initial assessment has established a child is at high risk due to their parent&rsquo;s abuse of alcohol, however, the child then goes to live with their grandparents, and so immediate risk decreases although the case will require further attention.</p></reply>

The provision of intervention and supports to target the particular needs of children will be dependent on the type of disadvantage, be it social, financial, educational, health etc. Responsibility for the identification and provision of those interventions will fall to my Ministerial colleagues as appropriate to the type of disadvantage. For example, the Department of Education and Skills have lead responsibility for issues concerning educational disadvantage, the Department of Social Protection has lead responsibility for addressing child poverty.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding this, I am fully convinced of the need for a whole-of-government approach in addressing such issues.<i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People (2014-2020)</i>takes such an approach in addressing disadvantage for children, emphasising an integrated and evidence informed approach to working across government, on horizontal and vertical levels, which transfers to all sectors and settings working with children and young people.<br/><br/>While my Department has overall responsibility for the framework, individual Departments will continue to take lead roles on matters within their remit.<br/><br/>My Department has lead responsibility for a range of funding schemes which target disadvantage across the areas of services and supports for children and young people.<br/><br/>My Department supports a range of education support services for children in disadvantaged communities. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has a statutory remit to support children and young people to participate in and benefit from the education system. Tusla has responsibility to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education<br/><br/>Tusla delivers an integrated approach to educational welfare services through the continued reform of work practices to provide an enhanced response to the needs of children, families and schools. Three service strands &ndash; the statutory Educational Welfare Service and the School Support Programme services under the Department of Education's DEIS Action Plan (namely, the Home-School Community Liaison Scheme and the School Completion Programme) collectively form the Educational Welfare Services (EWS) of the Agency. <br/><br/>I am advised by Tusla that the statutory Educational Welfare Services worked with over 20,000 children in 2013. Some 2,434 cases involved intensive intervention and a multidisciplinary approach and the provision of sustained support by an Education Welfare Officer to address the child's needs and support school attendance. During this period the School Completion Programme provided targeted support to approximately 36,000 children and young people at risk of early school leaving across 124 community based programmes.<br/><br/>Tusla also provides a range of services that offer advice and support to families.  This includes over 100 family resource centres.  The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit. The Programme emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level. <br/><br/>The main focus of these services is on early intervention aiming to promote and protect the health and well-being and rights of all children, young people and their families.  At the same time particular attention is given to those who are vulnerable or at risk.<br/><br/>I recently issued the Performance Statement 2015 to the Tusla. This Performance Statement provides Tusla with specific policy guidance, direction, and prioritisation and resource parameters to inform the preparation of its Business Plan for 2015.<br/><br/>As part of the Performance Statement, I have asked that in the area of family support, Tusla should provide a clear framework for action to expedite and enhance their capabilities in the area of early intervention and protection through supporting parents and families in accordance with relevant Government policy.  Key elements of this framework are to be developed during 2015.<br/><br/>My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country, including those from disadvantaged communities.  Targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects.  In addition, some 31 national and major regional youth work organisations are supported under my Department's Youth Service Grant Scheme and other schemes include the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. In 2015, current funding of &euro;49.93m will be provided to my Department for these schemes.<br/><br/>My Department also assists children experiencing deprivation by taking the lead in implementing the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme. The ABC Programme is being co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The ABC Programme draws on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty in communities where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people and existing services.</p></reply>

The comparable figure for the same date in 2013 was 14 children and the same number also applied on 30 October 2014.  The reduction of approximately 50% in the number of children detained in the adult prison system between 2012 and 2013 reflects the transfer of responsibility for 16 year old boys to the children detention schools, which was put in place in May 2012.  On 16 January 2015, there were a total of 16 boys detained in the adult prison system, comprising 6 boys remanded in custody in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and 10 boys serving a sentence of detention in Wheatfield Place of Detention. <br/><br/>There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to end the practice of detaining<b></b>children in adult prison facilities.  Significant progress has been made and this commitment will  be fully met when the extension of the Oberstown campus results in the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from the adult prison system to the children detention schools. The Oberstown capital development project, which commenced on site in September 2013, will enable the extension of the child care model of detention, which focuses on education and rehabilitation in order to minimize re-offending, to all under 18 year olds ordered to be detained by the courts on criminal justice charges.<br/><br/>The first 3 units of residential accommodation, which will prioritise the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities, were formally handed over to the Oberstown campus on 27 November 2014, following the required inspection of works and technical approval of the Office of Public Works, managing the project on behalf of my Department.  I am advised that, in order to ensure safe and secure custody of children in the new buildings and that the appropriate health and safety standards are met, a further period of training and orientation for staff and for the fitting out of the new units with furniture and equipment is required.  This process is ongoing at present and will be completed in the first quarter of 2015.<br/><br/>Other issues impacting on the operational date for the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys are the recruitment of the required complement of new care staff to work in the expanded facilities, and the passage of necessary legislation to ensure that all legal issues relating to the detention of children up to the age of 18 are fully addressed.  Following a recruitment programme carried out in 2014, 38 new care staff have commenced employment on the Oberstown campus and completed the training and orientation process.  However, the recruitment programme had a target of 60 additional care staff and an additional  process for a further phase of recruitment is currently underway.  It is intended that the required staff complement will be reached in the second quarter of 2015 for the operation of all of the new residential units.  <br/><br/>My Department is also progressing the necessary legal changes required in order to transfer responsibility for 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities.  Heads of a Bill to amend the Children Act, 2001 were approved by Government in September 2014 and it is intended that the Bill will be published this quarter and enacted as soon as possible thereafter. <br/><br/>My Department is reviewing these matters on an ongoing basis and it is my intention that the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities will cease as early as possible this year.</p></reply>

It involved bringing together nearly 4,000 staff from three separate organisations, the Health Service Executive, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  The establishment of the new Agency with a budget of over &euro;600m represents one of the most ambitious and far reaching public sector reforms undertaken by the Government.  The Agency, in discharging its functions, is placing a strong emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support, therapeutic and care interventions, all of which are key to the provision of integrated, multi-disciplinary services for vulnerable children and families. </p>  <p>  Psychology services for children are currently being provided by the HSE. The Agency and the HSE have in place both a Memorandum of Understanding and a Joint Protocol for inter-agency collaboration which underpins the provision of these services for children. The purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding is to set out the partnership agreement between the HSE and the Agency to continue pre-establishment levels of service across both organisations. The objective of the Joint Protocol is to specify a pathway and associated responsibilities for children and families whose needs cross between Health Service Divisions and the Agency. </p>  <p>  Both the Memorandum of Understanding and the Joint Protocol are subject to regular monitoring and review to ensure that they are working effectively in the best interests of children and families. Additionally, the Agency and the HSE are working to finalise a service level agreement to underpin the provision of psychological services by the HSE which will assist the Agency in fulfilling its statutory obligations.  The service level agreement with the HSE will determine the quantum of service needed to meet the Agency's requirements and will be an interim arrangement pending the Agency providing the service directly.  </p>  <p>  Clinical psychology services are directly provided by the Child and Family Agency within multi-disciplinary teams deployed by the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS). Services provided include assessment and focused interventions for children and young people with complex clinical needs and high risk behaviours. They also provide support to other professionals in order to guide interventions to children and families.</p></reply>

Ensuring the best possible outcomes for children in their early years is therefore an important element in future economic planning. </p>  <p>  The case for investing in children and young people on both social and economic grounds is supported by a body of international evidence.  As the Minister with responsibility for this key area, I propose to establish a cross-Departmental group at senior level to develop a whole-of-Government approach to future investment in early childhood care and education and after-school care. The group will undertake an economic and cost benefit analysis of policies and future options for increasing the supply, accessibility and affordability of quality childhood care and education services. </p>  <p>  It is clear that accessibility, affordability and high quality childcare can play a critical role in achieving a number of Government priorities, including improving educational outcome for children, reducing poverty and increasing parents' participation in the labour market. The importance of this area is reinforced by continuing economic improvement and job growth and an increased focus on activation for those currently outside the labour market.</p>  <p>  To ensure that all the potential benefits can be realised, future public investment in childcare must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. It must look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as consider the after-school needs of older school-going children. It is crucial, therefore, that we develop a coherent cross-Government approach to investment in childcare services.</p>  <p>  The group which I propose to establish will include representatives of the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach and will be led and supported by my Department.  I will be asking that the work of this group be carried out within a relatively short time frame and I expect that the group will be in a position to report to me in the Summer.</p></reply>

The Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. It provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children.</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects. In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million has been provided for the School Completion Programme. The Agency has approved local projects' school retention plans for the 2014/2015 academic year. The first instalment of 2014/15 funding issued to local projects last September. Further payments totalling approximately &euro;9.5m have issued over the past month, with a third instalment in May 2015.   </p>  <p>  The estimate for the Child and Family Agency for 2015 is &euro;631 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation. My Department has recently issued a Performance Statement to the Agency under Section 45 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013. This includes my priorities for consideration in the development of the Agency's 2015 Business Plan. The Business Plan will set out the Agency's proposed activities, programmes and priorities for 2015, including provision for the School Completion Programme, in the light of the monies available.</p>  <p>  A review of the School Completion Programme has commenced. It is being carried out by the ESRI following a procurement process managed by the Agency. The programme has been in operation since 2002 and I believe that it is timely that a review be carried out.  The Review is an important initiative to plan for the future development of this Programme.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed during the 2014/2015 academic year.</p></reply>

I view these independent inspection reports as an essential component of quality improvement for children's residential centres, which work alongside internal processes within the Agency.  Residential care accounts for a very small proportion - less than 5% - of children in care (316 of 6,454).  During 2014, HIQA focused its inspections of residential centres on how staff manage children - usually older teenagers - who have behaviour described as challenging and difficult.</p>  <p>  Last week there were concerning reports in the media regarding a children's residential care unit in the southern region following the publication of an inspection report on 12th January 2015.  HIQA's inspection found that the three teenagers living in the centre at the time were taking risks primarily in the form of taking illegal substances when outside the centre.  The inspection report notes that the staff and managers tried to make sure that these young people were safe but weren't able to prevent them from leaving the centre without permission or taking drugs.  I am advised by my officials that Ireland is somewhat unusual in that we have quite a number of 16 and 17 year olds coming into care.  Latest figures from the Agency indicate that 14% that is, 258 of young people received into care in 2013 were over the age of 16.  Some of these young people had very difficult lives before coming into care including histories of emotional and behavioural difficulties and substance misuse.  Agency staff and those working in HSE mental health and addiction services engage with these young people to try and help them overcome their problems - but helping young people with such complex backgrounds is challenging work.</p>  <p>  I take the care and safety of all children and young people in care very seriously indeed, as do the Agency's staff, and I recognise that the job of helping troubled young people to resolve their difficulties is key to keeping them safe.  This includes referring young people to specialist addiction counsellors in the HSE when required.</p>  <p>  The Agency has advised me there is one young person living in the centre now - he is doing well and has a good relationship with the staff.  Another young person was discharged home and the third is in a private residential centre (following a period of detention in the criminal justice system).  Since the inspection, the Agency has advised that it is carrying out a management review of the centre and that no further children are to be admitted pending its outcome.  I have asked the Agency to keep my Department appraised and look forward to learning the outcome of the review.</p></reply>

Any person, or persons, who run an organisation which provides services to children and young people should be aware of, and comply with, their child protection obligations as set out in Children First. Section 4.7.2 of the Guidance provides that all statutory, voluntary and community organisations working with and in direct contact with children should have procedures and guidelines derived from and consistent with the current <i>Children First: National Guidance</i>. <i>Our Duty to Care: The Principles of Good Practice for the Protection of Children and Young People</i>, published in 2002, offers specific guidance to the community and voluntary sectors on the promotion of child protection and welfare practices.<br/><br/>The Children First Bill, 2014, which is currently progressing through the Oireachtas, will place key elements of the Children First National Guidance on a statutory basis once it is enacted and commenced. In effect, this means that providers of relevant services will acquire a number of statutory obligations. Under the Bill, providers of relevant services are defined as organisations which employ one or more persons. Relevant services are listed in Schedule 1 of the Children First Bill and include educational, research, training, cultural, recreational, leisure, social and physical activities. Once the Bill is commenced, a provider of relevant services will be required to undertake a risk assessment of the potential harm which could come to a child while availing of the services, and to then prepare a Child Safeguarding Statement which outlines the policies and procedures which are in place to mitigate the risks identified. Furthermore, certain persons who are mandated persons under the Bill, will be required by the legislation to report child welfare and protection concerns. These would include persons employed as safeguarding or child protection officers in organisations providing services to children. <br/><br/>In parallel to the legislative process, my officials are currently revising and updating the existing Children First National Guidance. This is to ensure that the Guidance, which will continue as the basis for all citizens to report concerns, reflects the new legislative obligations and provides, in one place, a complete reference resource for individuals and organisations.  This will provide clarity and ensure consistency between the proposed legislation and the existing non-statutory obligations which will continue to operate administratively for all sectors of society.<br/><br/>Requirements in relation to the vetting of persons who work with children are a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality. The Deputy should refer to the website of that Department for further information, including in relation to the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act, 2012.</p></reply>

Responsibility for 16 year old boys was transferred from the adult prison system to the Oberstown campus in May 2012 and this commitment will be fully met when the extension of the Oberstown campus results in the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from the adult prison system to the children detention schools. The Oberstown capital development project, which commenced on site in September 2013, will enable the extension of the child care model of detention, which focuses on education and rehabilitation in order to minimize re-offending, to all under 18 year olds ordered to be detained by the courts on criminal justice charges.<br/><br/>The first 3 units of residential accommodation, which will prioritise the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities, were formally handed over to the Oberstown campus on 27 November 2014, following the required inspection of works and technical approval of the Office of Public Works, managing the project on behalf of my Department.  I am advised that, in order to ensure safe and secure custody of children in the new buildings and that the appropriate health and safety standards are met, a further period of training and orientation for staff and for the fitting out of the new units with furniture and equipment is required.  This process is ongoing at present and will be completed in the first quarter of 2015.<br/><br/>Other issues impacting on the operational date for the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys are the recruitment of the required complement of new care staff to work in the expanded facilities, and the passage of necessary legislation to ensure that all legal issues relating to the detention of children up to the age of 18 are fully addressed.  Following a recruitment programme carried out in 2014, 38 new care staff have commenced employment on the Oberstown campus and completed the training and orientation process.  However, the recruitment programme had a target of 60 additional care staff and an additional process for a further phase of recruitment is currently under way.  It is intended that the required staff complement will be reached in the second quarter of 2015 for the operation of all of the new residential units.<br/><br/>My Department is also progressing the necessary legal changes required in order to transfer responsibility for 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities.  Heads of a Bill to amend the Children Act, 2001 were approved by Government in September 2014 and it is intended that the Bill will be published this quarter and enacted as soon as possible thereafter. <br/><br/>My Department is reviewing these matters on an ongoing basis and it is my intention that the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities will cease as early as possible this year. </p></reply>

The most recent data available is for the reference year 2013.<br/><br/>Job creation for an enterprise in a given reference year is measured as the positive difference in the number of paid employees recorded with non-zero reckonable pay in the reference year compared with the previous year.

Jobs lost in the services sectors as a whole is the sum of all enterprise jobs lost.  It should be noted that when interpreting figures, jobs lost for a particular year means that these jobs were identified in the previous year but not in the reference year, that is some of these jobs may have disappeared sometime during the previous year.  Net job creation is calculated as the difference between job creation and jobs lost.<br/><br/>The calculation of rates for a given year is based on the average number of jobs counted in the given year and the year previous to the given year.<br/><br/>Considering the services sectors as Business Economy services excluding activities of holding companies (G to N,-642)<b>,</b>jobs lost rates fell from 27% in 2009 before stabilizing at 12% from 2011 onwards.

This Scheme, managed by the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform, is designed to enhance communication, co-operation and understanding between the Civil Service and the Private Sector and to provide staff  development opportunities for participants through new work experiences and project based assignments.  It is also intended to enhance mutual understanding of the drivers of policy and to better inform the policy formulation process of the Civil Service.</p>  <p>  The scheme is aimed at civil service staff  in management roles (Higher Executive Officer, Administrative Officer, Assistant Principal Officer, Principal Officer and equivalents) and at executives in management positions in the private sector.  The terms and conditions for such exchanges are set out in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 3/2013.  </p>  <p>  In November 2013, under this scheme, as part of a reciprocal arrangement, a member of staff at my Department took up a secondment in IBEC and a member of staff from IBEC took up a secondment in my Department.  This secondment concluded in September 2014.  My Department remains open to further such mutually beneficial arrangements under the Scheme.  In addition, a member of staff was seconded to my Department from Zurich Insurance for the period of the Irish Presidency of the European Union in 2012.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.<br/><br/>However, the Government also recognises the need for additional measures to address unemployment in the interim while the economy recovers.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s <i>Pathways to Work</i>Strategy, which is being led by the Department of Social Protection.<br/><br/>These policies have helped underpin the employment recovery that began, at the national level, in 2012.<br/><br/>The numbers on the live register in County Longford have fallen from a peak of 5,647 in August 2009 to 4,293 in December 2014.  The reduction represents a fall of 24% over this period, as compared with a reduction of 19% in the national total.  This indicates that the county has shared in the overall national recovery. <br/><br/>The Midlands-North Division of the Department is taking a proactive approach to activation and employer engagement.  There are 7 Activation Case Officers based in Longford together with an Activation Support Team.  The Activation Team in conjunction with Longford Chamber of Commerce hosted a breakfast briefing for employers in 2014 outlining and promoting supports and services available from the department to employers.<br/><br/>The Activation Unit in Longford works closely with other stakeholders including the Longford-Westmeath Educational Training Board to identify suitable training and educational opportunities for jobseekers in Longford.<br/><br/>A dedicated Employer Engagement Unit has been established within the Midlands-North Division and is working closely with employers.  It is taking a proactive, hands-on approach to ensure that suitable people are matched to appropriate vacancies.  The intention is that the Unit will become a first choice recruiter for all employers both large and small in the area.<br/><br/>In addition, my Department is currently in the process of evaluating tenders for JobPath, the Government&rsquo;s new labour market activation service aimed specifically at the long-term unemployed and those most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.  This will provide additional capacity for the Department&rsquo;s employment services, enhancing efforts to address unemployment.  JobPath will operate nationwide, including in County Longford.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-20a.195.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015012000061#WRD02800"><p>The Pensions Ombudsman has power to make determinations which are legally binding on parties to a complaint or dispute, subject to appeal to the High Court.  However, a relatively small percentage of disputes are resolved in this way as the bulk are normally dealt with through mediation between the parties and the giving of general information and/or advice in the form of a report.  The table below shows the number of cases for which detailed investigation files were opened each year since 2004 and the number resolved by each of these three methods.  <br/><br/>The total gross number of complaints received is considerably higher than this table shows.  Since 2010 (the first year from when full detailed figures are available) there has been a yearly average of 1,652 complaints received and 1,593 closed.  Some complaints received (typically 18%) are outside the terms of reference of the Office or cannot be investigated for legal reasons.  Following examination, these are either rejected or referred to other tribunals, as appropriate.  Other reasons for closure include withdrawal of the complaint by the complainant, perhaps following a referral for internal dispute resolution.<br/><br/>The time taken to close a case can vary from a single day to several years.  The factors influencing the time taken include the nature and complexity of the case itself; the number of parties involved (e.g., employer, trustees, administrators, financial services providers, Government Departments and agencies); the completeness and accuracy of the information given to the Office; the completeness and speed of response by those named in the complaint or dispute; the dependence or otherwise on other external processes; and the willingness or otherwise of parties to cooperate fully with the investigation.  Completion times can range from a matter of days to a number of years, depending on those factors.  Typically, mediated cases are closed in half the time taken by those which go to a formal determination, as the latter entail detailed and time-consuming reports.  In 2013, 38% of cases were closed in less than five weeks, but 32% had taken more than a year.  The office of the Pensions Ombudsman has no record of ever stating that a case submitted in 2013 would not be completed for five years.  However, it is conceivable that the resolution of a dispute could depend on and must await the outcome of some other process such as a liquidation or receivership, outside the control of the Pensions Ombudsman.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Cases on hand start of year</th><th>New cases</th><th>Closed in year</th><th>Determinations upheld</th><th>Determinations Not upheld</th><th>Mediations Favourable#</th><th>Mediations Unfavourable</th><th>Report/Advice info given</th></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>112</td><td>297</td><td>122</td><td>7</td><td>16</td><td>22</td><td>11</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>287</td><td>397</td><td>385</td><td>24</td><td>52</td><td>95</td><td>51</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>291</td><td>439</td><td>307</td><td>32</td><td>29</td><td>88</td><td>29</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>423</td><td>515</td><td>584</td><td>30</td><td>34</td><td>159</td><td>38</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>354</td><td>727+31*</td><td>639</td><td>37</td><td>15</td><td>128</td><td>43</td><td>146</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>473</td><td>616+20*</td><td>711</td><td>32</td><td>15</td><td>160</td><td>47</td><td>246</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>398</td><td>558+31*</td><td>555</td><td>27</td><td>47</td><td>103</td><td>43</td><td>203</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>432</td><td>485+49*</td><td>557</td><td>37</td><td>25</td><td>87</td><td>26</td><td>238</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>409</td><td>601+36*</td><td>677</td><td>37</td><td>21</td><td>79</td><td>15</td><td>357</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>369</td><td>463+45*</td><td>655</td><td>37</td><td>33</td><td>74</td><td>8</td><td>330</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>222</td><td>Detail breakdown not yet available</td><td>Detail breakdown not yet available</td><td>Detail breakdown not yet available</td><td>Detail breakdown not yet available</td><td>Detail breakdown not yet available</td><td>Detail breakdown not yet available</td><td>Detail breakdown not yet available</td></tr></table>*cases reopened following resubmission or completion of Internal Disputes Resolution<br/><br/># Favourable means resulting in some advantage to complainant<br/><br/><b>Nature of complaints: 3 most common complaints, by year</b><br/><br/>2004: Post-retirement increases; membership/entry conditions; failure of scheme to respond.<br/><br/>2005: Non-remittance of contributions (mainly Construction Industry); Membership/entry conditions; post-retirement increases.<br/><br/>2006: Membership/entry conditions; Miscalculation of benefits; non-remittance of contributions.<br/><br/>2007: Miscalculation of benefits; membership/entry conditions; transfers.<br/><br/>2008: Miscalculation of benefits; non-remittance of contributions; failure to disclose information.<br/><br/>2009: Miscalculation of benefits; Loss of fund value; non-remittance of contributions.<br/><br/>2010: Non-remittance of contributions; Miscalculation of benefits; Loss of fund value.<br/><br/>2011: Miscalculation of benefits; non-remittance of contributions; Loss of fund value.<br/><br/>2012: Miscalculation of benefits; Transfers; non-remittance of contributions.<br/><br/>2013: Miscalculation of benefits; Loss of fund value; Cost of/credit for added years.<br/><br/>2014: Detailed breakdown not yet available.</p></reply>

Such cases are examined on a case by case basis having regard to the situation presented.  The person concerned was awarded rent supplement where the monthly rent is in excess of the prescribed rent limits, in order to prevent homelessness, under this legislation.</p>  <p>  Rent supplement is subject to a means test which is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  The weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;40 for coupled households.  Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs. </p>  <p>  The rent supplement claim for the person concerned has been reviewed again.  The means testing of the application showed that his family have a total weekly contribution of &euro;140.70.  The rent charged equates to &euro;276.90 per week and their entitlement to rent supplement is calculated at &euro;136.20 per week or &euro;590.30 per calendar month.  This calculation is correct and is in accordance with Social Welfare legislation.  It is not possible to apply a different means test in order to reduce the persons&rsquo; contribution or increase the amount of rent supplement payable.</p></reply>

Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the OFP scheme of approximately &euro;607 million.     </p>  <p>  The purpose of the phased OFP scheme age change reforms that were introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, is to reduce long-term social welfare dependency by ending the expectation that lone parents will remain outside of the workforce indefinitely.  These reforms aim to provide the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to access the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment programmes, to develop their skills set and, ultimately, to secure employment and financial independence.</p>  <p>  The final phase of the OFP scheme age change reforms will be taking place on 2 July, 2015, when the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which an OFP recipient&rsquo;s payment ceases will be reduced to 7 years for all recipients.  It is anticipated that approximately 30,200 OFP recipients will transition out of the OFP scheme on that day.  </p>  <p>  When introducing the OFP scheme age change reforms, a special provision was included for recipients who are claiming the domiciliary care allowance (DCA) payment for a disabled child aged under 16 years alongside a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA).  The half-rate CA is only payable for children aged under 16 years where the DCA is also in payment.</p>  <p>  In these circumstances, the OFP payment is extended beyond the maximum age limit of the scheme and paid until the child for whom the DCA is in payment reaches the age of 16 years.  This special provision ensures that OFP recipients who care for a disabled child will continue to receive support until that child reaches the age of 16 years and can apply for the disability allowance (DA) in their own right.  </p>  <p>  As a result of this special provision, 1,650 lone parents will continue to receive both the OFP payment and half-rate CA and will not be affected by the OFP scheme age change reforms on 2 July, 2015.  </p>  <p>  Approximately 800 other customers who are claiming both the OFP and half-rate CA payments are caring for another person (i.e. an adult or a child aged 16 years or over) and, as such, are not in receipt of the DCA payment.  These customers will transition out of the OFP scheme on 2 July, 2015, and will have their CA claim automatically assessed and re-rated to a full-rate CA payment of &euro;204 per week and &euro;29.80 per week for each qualified child.  The income loss occurs as these lone parents are moving from one-and-a-half payments to a single full-rate CA payment.  This is the most advantageous option that is available to these lone parents.  These individuals will retain their existing secondary benefits such as the respite care grant, free travel and the household benefits package.</p>  <p>  Historically, the transition of recipients from the OFP scheme to the CA scheme has always occurred in this manner, with concurrent OFP and half-rate CA entitlement being replaced with full-rate CA entitlement once the maximum age limit of the youngest child is reached.  There are no plans to review the ongoing OFP entitlement to the age of the youngest child.</p></reply>

The allowance is paid for 26 weeks from October to April.  The payment represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household. It is not intended to meet those costs in full. Only one allowance is paid per household. </p>  <p>  The allowance is paid to approximately 415,000 customers at an estimated cost of &euro;208 million in 2014.  This includes people in receipt of job-seekers allowance or basic supplementary welfare allowance for more than 15 months (390 days). </p>  <p>  The fuel allowance is a means tested payment, targeted at those who are more vulnerable to energy poverty, including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.  Short term payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit are not means tested payments and therefore do not qualify for the fuel allowance.</p></reply>

The 2015 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;3.01 billion.    </p>  <p>  It is a fundamental qualifying condition of both schemes that a person must be fully unemployed for four in any period of seven consecutive days, so a person working four or more days a week will not qualify.   </p>  <p>  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, resulting in an increase in the number of persons employed for less than a full week.  This is an important policy issue for the Department but any changes to the current criteria could have significant cost implications for the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes  </p>  <p>  The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare has examined the issue of the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems to determine how the social welfare system can best achieve its goals of supporting persons through periods of involuntary unemployment, while incentivising work and disincentivising welfare dependency.

Their assessments conform to the ethical conduct and behaviour guidelines of the Irish Medical Council. Medical Assessors are required to be medical practitioners who are on the general register of medical practitioners while holding an appointment.  They must have at least three years satisfactory experience in the practice of medicine since registration.  Many of the Medical Assessors have specialist post-graduate qualifications and three have mental health/child and adolescent psychiatry qualifications or experience.  All have received special training in human disability evaluation.  They also have special training in disability assessment.  The Medical Assessors have an on-going commitment to continuing medical education to ensure that standards are maintained and enhanced.  The Medical Assessors also work in a collegiate way to ensure that best practice and professional expertise is shared and applied across all of the cases that are reviewed by them.  This includes daily case conference meetings and a medical research unit to actively engage in the update of the body of medical knowledge and evidence based practice.</p>  <p>  Applications for disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance and domiciliary care allowance are normally assessed by Medical Assessors at desk level on the basis of medical evidence submitted.  Medical eligibility is determined by the severity and expected duration of the medical condition.  Each case is individually assessed on its own merits and in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s evidence based medical guidelines and protocols.</p></reply>

The 2015 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;3.01 billion.</p>  <p>  Reduced rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were first introduced in 2009.  Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to recipients under 26 years of age. </p>  <p>  This is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.  It aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.</p>  <p>  The jobseekers benefit scheme works differently.

As at 15 January 2015, a total of 36,603 internships have commenced with 6,291 participants currently on a JobBridge placement, and 816 internship posts currently advertised on the JobBridge website.  To date, almost 16,000 host organisations have participated in the scheme.</p>  <p>  A rigorous monitoring system is in place to ensure that the JobBridge Scheme is not abused.  All internships are subject to monthly compliance checks, and more than 9,000 on-site monitoring visits have been conducted since the scheme was introduced.  These on-site monitoring visits are to host organisations either chosen at random or in response to concerns raised by interns or others.  These on-site visits indicate that 97% of internships are proceeding satisfactorily and in line with the established criteria, and the vast majority of host organisations have been found to be compliant with the scheme rules.</p>  <p>  Since the introduction of JobBridge, a total of 520 complaints have been received regarding the scheme.  All complaints are taken seriously and are investigated as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  At present, a total of 43 host organisations are excluded indefinitely from participation, and a number of others are excluded for shorter periods of time.  The reasons for exclusion from participation in the scheme vary and include issues such as poor quality internships, that there is evidence of employment displacement, that the internship as operated did not reflect that which was advertised and that the Standard Agreement was not completed as required.</p></reply>

This reflects EU VAT law, with which Irish tax law must comply.  In this regard, Article 78 of the EU VAT Directive provides that the taxable amount shall include "taxes, duties, levies and charges, excluding the VAT itself".  In this respect, where the charge for a supply of service, such as an electricity bill, includes the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy, VAT law dictates that VAT should be calculated on the PSO levy element of the charge as well as the charge for the service.  The same situation applies in the case of other excises, including for example excises on petrol, auto-diesel, tobacco and alcohol products.</p></reply>

The valuation is not affected by any repairs or improvements made to a property or by any general increase or decrease in property prices that might occur during the valuation period. </p>  <p>  In regard to property sales, all purchasers of relevant residential properties, as part of the conveyancing process and prior to the completion of a sale, should satisfy themselves as to whether the LPT valuation declared by the vendor on the specific valuation date appears reasonable and honestly made (having obtained all relevant supporting documentation from the vendor).  To facilitate this process, the vendor is obliged to provide the purchaser or the purchaser's solicitor with details of the Property ID, the valuation band as declared on the LPT Return and the basis for arriving at that valuation.  Any concerns regarding the original valuation should be addressed at this point before ownership of the property is transferred. </p>  <p>  Section 35(5) of the Act does however provide for the submission of a revised LPT Return in advance of the next valuation date where specific information or documentation supporting such a change comes to hand, or where the purchaser feels that the original valuation (by the vendor) could not have been reasonably arrived at.  Supporting documentation in this regard could include a copy of a professional valuation or documented information on property sales for comparable properties in the local area.  The supporting documentation must be relevant to the valuation date (1 May 2013) rather than to current property values.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific case to which the Deputy refers, I am advised that the original owner (the vendor) filed a 2013 LPT return confirming the property in Band 3 (&euro;150,001-&euro;200,000).  The purchaser subsequently contacted LPT Branch requesting that she be allowed to pay the 2015 liability in Band 2 (&euro;100,001-&euro;150,000) but did not provide any documentation or evidence supporting the validity of such a reduction.  The LPT team explained to the person that she would need to produce appropriate documentary evidence supporting her request for a reduction before Revenue could adjust the Valuation Band.  The LPT team also advised the person that any uncertainty about the current valuation should have been addressed with the vendor before the sale of the property was finalised, but that she will have an opportunity to submit a revised valuation for the property on 1 November 2016. </p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue has confirmed to me that it will re-examine the issue if the person produces documentation supporting her assertion that the property is more relevant to Band 2 than Band 3 but has no discretion to do so in the absence of such evidence.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-20a.313.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015012000064#WRG01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 to 232, inclusive, and 235 and 236 together.<br/><br/>In relation to Question No. 230 (Ref: 2245/15) and Question No. 231 (Ref:  2246/15), as I previously informed the Deputy in my response to Question No. 202 on 25 November last year, a Subcontractor will not generally describe him/herself as such when first registering for Income Tax with Revenue and this consequently limits the Revenue Commissioners ability to provide precise statistics on the annual amount of PRSI and USC paid in each year.<br/><br/>I am advised that all contractors in the construction sector, engaged under a relevant contract, are also required to register for Relevant Contracts Tax (RCT) some contractors though work outside the RCT system, for example, where there is no sub-contracting of work on a particular job.  For those operating under a relevant contract, when registering for RCT, they declare themselves as Principal Contractors, Principal/Subcontractors which means that they can act as a principal on some contracts and a subcontractor on other contracts - or Subcontractors.  Therefore, the details provided include all contractors who were registered as a Principal/Subcontractor or as a Subcontractor for any part of the years in question.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the details provided were compiled on the basis of contractors who were registered for RCT, not necessarily on whether they were active in that year within the RCT sector.  In addition, for joint assessment cases, given the complexity involved in establishing which spouse is actively engaged in the RCT sector, only data on the assessable spouses PRSI and USC was extracted; therefore in joint assessment cases the non-assessable spouses PRSI and USC has been excluded. <br/><br/>As a result of the foregoing, the data set out in the following table are tentative and represent best estimates.  The figures are based on declared PRSI and USC liabilities submitted by self-employed contractors (excluding companies) in their annual tax return and the most recent figures available are for the 2013 tax year.<table><tr><th>Year  </th><th>PRSI  </th><th>USC  </th></tr><tr><td>2008  </td><td>&euro;35,761,693</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>2009  </td><td>&euro;23,095,095</td><td>*N/A</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;18,201,182</td><td>*N/A </td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;20,542,795</td><td>&euro;29,429,853</td></tr><tr><td>2012  </td><td>&euro;19,716,784</td><td>&euro;27,859,142</td></tr><tr><td>2013  </td><td>&euro;20,586,953</td><td>&euro;28,204,585</td></tr></table>*Income Levy data not available in the timeframe.<br/><br/>Regarding Question No. 235 (Ref: 2318/15), I am further advised that a Principal contractor has a statutory obligation to notify Revenue through the eRCT system of details of all contracts entered into with a subcontractor.  On receipt of these contract details, the Contract Confirmation letter is generated and if the Subcontractor is registered for ROS, they will receive an electronic copy of the letter into their ROS Inbox immediately.  In the vast majority of cases, the Subcontractor, or their agent, will be registered for ROS.<br/><br/>For the minority who receive the Contract Confirmation letter in paper form, these are printed and posted twice a week from Revenue's central dispatch centre and therefore the turnaround time is only a matter of days.<br/><br/>When the Subcontractor receives the Contract Confirmation letter, they are obliged to notify Revenue if they believe that they are not a subcontractor of this Principal or indeed if any of the details entered by the Principal were incorrect.  This procedure acts as a safeguard for a Subcontractor who has any concerns as to the nature of their relationship with the Principal and the Subcontractor is fully entitled to clarify with the Revenue Commissioners any matters they are unsure about.<br/><br/>Regarding Question No. 232 (Ref: 2250/15), in my reply to Question 216 on 2 December last year I previously provided the Deputy with specific data on tax, interest and penalties recovered by the Revenue Commissioners where they uncovered non-compliance with RCT obligations.<br/><br/>Furthermore, in my reply to Question No. 13 on 3 December last year, I explained to the Deputy that the eRCT system had succeeded in taking away the vulnerabilities for fraud, mainly extraction fraud, based on bogus contractors and bogus documentation that attached to the previous paper-based RCT system.  This is a critical feature of the electronic RCT system.  The previous paper-based system was exploited by criminal gangs with extraction repayment frauds using bogus deduction cards and bogus sub-contractors to obtain significant fraudulent claims.  The electronic RCT system has been designed to remove the opportunity to extract fraudulent claims from the Exchequer.<br/><br/>I also previously informed the Deputy that businesses have a number of tax obligations including obligations relating to tax returns, the payment of tax on the profits of the business, the VAT system, the PAYE system and, where appropriate, the eRCT system.  In the course of a Revenue compliance intervention, a Revenue officer may investigate matters pertaining to those obligations and, where necessary, seek the relevant outstanding taxes, interest on late payment of tax and relevant penalties.<br/><br/>The Revenue Commissioners have provided the following information in relation to construction related compliance interventions carried out by them in the period 2008 to 2014, with respect to all taxes and not purely RCT. <table><tr><th>Year  </th><th>Audits  </th><th>**Other Risk Management Interventions </th><th>Total</th><th>Total Yield (&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>2008  </td><td>2,928</td><td>0  </td><td>2,928  </td><td>&euro;121.3m</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>2,537</td><td>0</td><td>2,537  </td><td>&euro;99m</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>2,044</td><td>2,175</td><td>4,219  </td><td>&euro;68m</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1,819</td><td>9,644 </td><td>11,463 </td><td>&euro;59.5m  </td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1,291</td><td>28,373 </td><td>29,664 </td><td>&euro;51.6m</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>1,075</td><td>51,248  </td><td>52,323  </td><td>&euro;55m</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>889</td><td>52,359 </td><td>53,248</td><td>&euro;56.3m</td></tr></table>** The full recording in Revenue's case management system of non-audit interventions and the associated yield began in 2012.<br/><br/>I am further advised that Revenue has always committed a significant resource to monitoring activities in the construction sector and is involved in an ongoing programme of construction related audits, compliance interventions and site visits, directed at large public and private sector contracts, one-off housing and jobs involving repairs, maintenance and enhancements. Revenue's compliance approach is to make the appropriate intervention in a well chosen case. A well chosen case will be identified on the basis of risk, informed by all the information available to Revenue. While the taxpayer's use of the eRCT system will be examined in any compliance intervention, it will be only one of a range of issues to be reviewed.<br/><br/>As regards Question No. 236 (Ref: 2319/15), it is not possible in the timeframe available to provide the Deputy with the information requested for 2008-2013 in relation to non-resident subcontractors.  However, the Revenue Commissioners have informed me that in 2014 they carried out 40 audits of non-resident contractors, representing 4.5% of all audits carried out in the construction sector.  I am further advised that the Revenue Commissioners will write separately to the Deputy with the relevant details for the years 2008 to 2013.<table><tr><th>Number of Audits </th><th>Total </th><th>Tax </th><th>Interest </th><th>Penalties</th></tr><tr><td>40  </td><td>&euro;2,032,505  </td><td>&euro;1,448,704  </td><td>&euro;223,979  </td><td>&euro;359,822</td></tr></table><br/><br/>I am also advised that apart from audits, Revenue also conducts more targeted interventions like aspect queries and profile interviews on specific risk areas and compliance activity on non-residents engaged in the construction sector needs to be considered in totality.  I am further advised that the Revenue Commissioners will also write separately to the Deputy with the details of non-audit interventions for the years 2008 to 2014.<br/><br/>I am very satisfied that Revenue's policing of the construction sector, which is regarded by the Commissioners as one of the riskiest areas of business activity from a tax compliance perspective, is a high priority for them and will continue to be so as we see a welcome revival in the fortunes of the sector.  I am also satisfied that the introduction of the electronic RCT system provides Revenue with significant realtime information with which to target their resources.<br/><br/>However, I note the Deputy's continuing interest in the construction sector and compliance with RCT obligations.  In previous replies, I suggested that if the Deputy had any specific information in relation to tax evasion or abuses of the tax system, he should pass that information to my officials who will ensure that it gets to the Revenue Commissioners.  I re-state that offer.</p></reply>

Retail credit firms are a regulated category of entities which are authorised to provide credit (in the form of cash loans) directly to individuals.  Some firms authorised in this category are mortgage lenders. Retail credit firms have been subject to regulation by the Central Bank since 1 February 2008. A register of all Retail Credit Firms is available on the Central Bank's website.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that latest Central Bank mortgage arrears and restructures statistics were published in December and cover the period to end September 2014.  This publication shows that overall arrears and arrears greater than 90 days fell for the fifth and fourth consecutive quarter respectively.  There were 760,238 private residential mortgage accounts for principal dwellings held in the State at end-September 2014, with some 84,955 principal dwelling houses in arrears of greater than 90 days, representing a decline in the greater than 90 days arrears category of 6 per cent over the quarter.  The Central Bank has advised that, at end-September 2014 non-bank lenders accounted for 5.2 per cent of the total stock of residential mortgage accounts outstanding at end-September 2014 (5.4 per cent in value terms).  A total of 18,064 mortgage accounts issued by these lenders were in arrears of more than 90 days at end-September, this figure accounted for 15.5 per cent of total mortgages in arrears over 90 days.  In addition, data published by the Department of Finance last week also showed that the number of accounts in mortgage arrears is declining.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that the same consumer protection framework applies to retail credit lenders as to other regulated lenders including the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.  The CCMA sets out requirements for all mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, dealing with borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears on a mortgage loan which is secured by their primary residence.  It provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  The Central Bank has advised that retail credit firms were also included in the scope of the Central Bank's review of the 'Implementation of the Revised CCMA' by mortgage lenders, the purpose of which was to ensure that mortgage lenders achieved full implementation of the requirements of the revised CCMA by end December 2013.</p>  <p>  This Government tackled the issue of mortgage arrears head on.  We overhauled the systems and structures to support customers in arrears to find solutions.  We acknowledged from the outset that, due to the scale of the challenge, resolution for all customers in arrears was likely to take a significant period of time.  The mortgage arrears resolution process is working.  The number of mortgages in arrears is declining.  There is, however, no doubt that the issue of longer terms arrears remains the biggest challenge.  Borrowers in difficulty must engage with their lender as early as possible in order to identify the best solution to their debt situation.  This will afford them the protection of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) and ensure that the resolution arrangement that is finally agreed is both affordable and sustainable.  Of course, the Central Bank is also working with all mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, in relation to lenders' mortgage arrears resolution strategies and approaches to dealing with borrowers in or facing arrears.  Early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving cases of mortgage difficulty. </p></reply>

These changes have included reductions of the interest rates and, in the case of the EU facilities, extensions of maturities. While not part of the EU-IMF Programme we have also negotiated the replacement of the Promissory Notes issued to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds. In addition, we have recently made an early repayment of a large portion of Ireland's IMF programme loans and further early repayments are planned. </p>  <p>  The savings arising from these measures are set out below. These savings are equivalent to the cost of not having achieved these measures. </p>  <p>  When the programme was initially agreed in late 2010, the average interest rate on the &euro;67.5 billion available to drawdown from the external sources was estimated by the EU Commission to be 5.82% on the basis of market rates at that time. The average life of the borrowing was initially set at 7.5 years. </p>  <p>  In July 2011, the Euro Area Heads of State or Government (HOSG) agreed to reduce the cost of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) loans, and similar reductions were subsequently agreed for the interest rates on the loans provided by the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and also by the three bilateral lenders (UK, Sweden and Denmark).  It is estimated that the interest rate reductions on the EU funding mechanisms and the bilateral loans are worth of the order of &euro;9 billion over the initially envisaged 7&frac12; year term of these loans.  As of end-December 2014 the all in euro equivalent cost of our EU IMF programme loans is estimated to have been 3.3%.</p>  <p>  Also in 2011, the average maturity of the EFSM and the EFSF loans was extended to a planned 12.5 and 15 years respectively.  </p>  <p>  In April 2013, EU Finance Ministers agreed in principle to further extend the maximum weighted average maturities on our EFSF and EFSM loans by up to 7 years, over and above the extension agreed in 2011. This further maturity extension removes a refinancing requirement of some &euro;20 billion for the Irish State in the years 2015 to 2022.  This extension of maturities has a number of significant benefits for Ireland, including smoothing our redemption profile, improving long term debt sustainability and it also has a positive impact on the cost of Exchequer borrowing through creating further downward pressure on our borrowing costs.  </p>  <p>  While not part of the EU-IMF Programme, it is also worth mentioning that in February 2013, the Irish Government replaced the Promissory Notes issued to IBRC with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds. This has resulted in significant benefits to the State, including increasing the weighted average life from c.7-8 years for the Promissory Notes to c.34-35 years for the floating rate notes.</p>  <p>  The most recent initiative we have undertaken is the early repayment of up to &euro;18.3 billion of our IMF loans.</p>  <p>  Following completion of all necessary approval procedures by our EU and bilateral lenders in November 2014, Ireland repaid the first &euro;9 billion tranche to the IMF over two dates in December 2014. The &euro;9 billion repayment represents almost 40% of Ireland's IMF loan facility.</p>  <p>  This repayment transaction is estimated to reduce the interest bill by approximately &euro;750 million over the lifetime of the loans.</p>  <p>  By reducing the interest bill on the national debt we reduce the amount of resources that go towards servicing the debt.  This frees up resources for investment in activities that will grow the economy, create jobs and opportunities. This has knock on benefits across the economy and can lower the cost of debt for businesses and families.</p>  <p>  Further early repayments of up to &euro;9.3 billion are planned. .</p>  <p>  Total estimated interest savings in excess of &euro;1.5 billion are expected to be achieved when the early repayment to the IMF is completed.

Member States can retain historical zero-rated VAT treatment under Article 110 of the EU VAT Directive, where a good or service was zero rated on and from 1 January 1991.  Ireland applies the zero rate to most food. In this context, it is not possible to apply the zero rate to any new food and drink items that have not already applied at the zero rate.</p>  <p>  Interpretation of VAT law by the Revenue Commissioners is guided by the decision of the Appeal Commissioners and the Courts and decisions of these institutions may lead to changes in interpretation such as those that relate to smoothies. VAT cases before these fora have been determined on the basis that food products that may benefit from the zero rate must fall within the ordinary and everyday meaning of "food" and not be excluded from the zero rate by the goods specified in Section 8 of the Second Schedule. Any business that is dissatisfied with the rate of VAT has a number of avenues of redress available including internal review by another Revenue officer, external review by a nominated person and formal appeal avenues to the Appeal Commissioners and onwards to the Courts.</p></reply>

The Section gives Revenue the authority to instruct financial institutions to transfer funds, to the value of the outstanding debt, from any account held in the name of a defaulting taxpayer. It also provides Revenue with the authority to instruct any third party owing a debt to the defaulting taxpayer to pay those funds directly to Revenue. </p>  <p>  Section 1002 does not provide for the blocking of accounts as indicated by the Deputy and Revenue has assured me that it does not instruct the financial institutions in this regard. Any such actions are a question for those bodies rather than for Revenue. </p>  <p>  In regard to the deployment of its various debt collection/enforcement options, including Attachment, Revenue has assured me that before any such action is considered, the defaulting taxpayer is given every opportunity to engage and agree mutually acceptable arrangements in respect of the outstanding debt. The enforcement process only starts where there is no meaningful engagement by the taxpayer in seeking realistic solutions. </p>  <p>  With specific regard to the use of Attachment, Revenue has confirmed to me that the power is normally only deployed where other enforcement options have failed to secure the outstanding debt. For example, during 2014 Revenue deployed Attachment in less than 5,000 cases out of a total of almost 41,000 cases where debt was enforced. Revenue has also assured me that it has strict guidelines in place, including authorisation at a senior level, to ensure Attachment is only used in appropriate circumstances.</p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to mortgage interest rates charged, that is a commercial matter for each institution concerned. A Relationship Framework has been specified that defines the nature of the relationship between the Minister for Finance and the banks in which the State has a shareholding. These Frameworks were published on 30 March 2012 and can be found at: /.  <br/><br/>The interest rates charged by lending institutions in Ireland are determined taking into account a broad range of factors, including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding mix. <br/><br/>I should also point out that while the cost of funds for Irish lending institutions has come down significantly in the past couple of years, it is still much higher than the ECB base rate. Finally, lending institutions in Ireland, including those in which the State has a significant shareholding, must ensure that the rate they lend at is economically sustainable and provides a return for that institution and ultimately the State, where it is a shareholder. Without a positive return on their lending, these institutions would not be capable of maintaining and growing their capital base and thus be in a position to support the economy.<br/><br/>The Deputy should also be aware that the Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. However the Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997.</p></reply>

It should also be noted that most of these income earners will have been liable to increased Universal Social Charge (USC) rates on income in excess of &euro;70,044, which limits the benefit of the total tax package to any one individual to a maximum of around &euro;14 per week. It is estimated that the additional yield on USC for these cases will be in the order of &euro;113 million.</p>  <p>  These figures are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2012, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim. They are estimated by reference to 2015 incomes and are provisional and may be revised. Married persons or civil partners who have elected or who have been deemed to have elected for joint assessments are counted as one tax unit.</p></reply>

The Office of Public Works (OPW) is currently taking legal advice on this matter and, as such, is not in a position to provide an update at this stage on the timescale for the appointment of a contractor.</p>  <p>  I and the Government remain fully committed to the provision of this important scheme for the people of Bandon.  I am advised by the Commissioners of Public Works that they are confident that the current legal issue will be resolved as quickly as possible and that the project can then progress to the construction stage.  It is expected that construction of the scheme will take approximately two years to complete from appointment of a successful contractor.</p></reply>

The Decision, building on the earlier 2011 Decision, required my Department to prepare Guidelines on a new process to be agreed by Government. <br/><br/>The Guidelines were approved by Government in November 2014 and seek to provide good practice rules around the implementation of the Decision, which has at its core three key principles:<br/><br/>- promote wider access to opportunities on State Boards;<br/><br/>- put in place detailed and comprehensive criteria for those roles; and<br/><br/>- introduce transparent and rigorous assessment of candidates against these criteria.<br/><br/>The Guidelines clarify which positions on Boards they apply to and change the process around Ministerial appointments of individuals to State Boards. <br/><br/>The new arrangements provide for a robust selection system operated independently by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) with selection being based on objective criteria. The new arrangements will ensure that candidates recommended for appointment have the skills and competencies required to carry out their duties on a State board.  <br/><br/>Under the new system for appointments to State Boards, the specific requirements identified for board roles will be published as well as information illustrating the knowledge, skills, experience and expertise possessed by appointees conforming to those requirements. <br/><br/>Applications are welcome from people who believe they have the relevant skills and experience to join a State Board, barring any disqualifications that may apply under legislative provision. Persons interested in serving on a board should apply via the State Boards portal run by PAS at .<br/><br/>The Guidelines are at .</p></reply>

This resulted in a net increase of 8,476 in the number of people employed by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, the highest net gain in the history of the agency. This increase in employment reinforces Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy of driving innovation, scale and leadership positions in international markets and new sectors.This continuation of employment growth demonstrates clearly the direct impact that increasing exports has on jobs in Ireland. Enterprise Ireland supported companies now, directly and indirectly, account for more than 300,000 jobs in the Irish economy  - 16% of total workforce.<br/><br/>These full-time employment and total employment levels are the highest recorded in the history of the agency.<br/><br/>Enterprise Ireland offers a range of financial and non-financial supports to assist clients to win business and sustain and create jobs through all stages of the business development cycle.  <br/><br/>Start-ups remain a key source of employment for the Irish economy and over time many start-ups will develop and grow and emerge as the medium and large sized companies of the future. Supporting Start-ups through feasibility funding, Competitive Start Funds, High Potential Start-Up (HPSU) supports and the LEO network is critical to job creation now and in the future. <br/><br/>As part of the Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s offering in the Start-Up space the agency looks to develop and target HPSUs.  HPSU companies are defined as start-up ventures that are:<br/><br/>- Introducing a new or innovative product or service to international markets.<br/><br/>- Involved in manufacturing or internationally traded services.<br/><br/>- Capable of creating 10 jobs in Ireland and realising &euro;1 million in sales within three to four years of starting up.<br/><br/>- Led by an experienced management team.<br/><br/>- Headquartered and controlled in Ireland.<br/><br/>- Less than six years old.<br/><br/>The tabular statement shows the number of HPSUs approved from 2010 to 2014 and the total amount paid to these companies in relation to all approvals from the year they became a HPSU.<br/><br/>These companies have created 3,706 jobs (3,287 full-time and 419 part-time) between 2010 and 2014.<br/><br/>The most recent export data available is from the 2013 Annual Business Review survey.

These international brands are an attraction for additional companies to potentially locate to the Midlands.</p>  <p>  There are 35 IDA Ireland client companies based in the Midlands Region, employing in the region of 3,800 across the Region.  Of these, 6 are located in Co. Longford and employ  560 people and a further 16 companies are located in Co.

The scheme is delivered on behalf of IDA Ireland by Connect Ireland to support any potential investors identified to locate here.  One such success under the Scheme has been Arc Consulting who are now located in Longford.</p>  <p>  I have been working with my Department on the development of a framework for the formulation of Regional Enterprise Strategies that will enable us to identify the sustainable competitive strengths of each region and to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprise growth and jobs in areas of potential.  A key element of this process is the Regional Enterprise Forum, which I chaired in Athlone on 19 December last.  I hope to publish the framework strategy shortly.  The Regional strategy will be rolled out firstly in the Midlands before being rolled out in other regions and will include specific actions and targets on the part of my Department, the enterprise development agencies and other public bodies to promote enterprise growth and job creation in the region.</p>  <p>  Additionally, IDA Ireland is currently finalising its new strategy to cover the 5-year period from 2015.

The report, along with explanatory material, can be found at .<br/><br/>The Commission has indicated that, based on the comments received, there are a number of areas that appear to be particularly important to respondents, which represent four areas of work that should be explored further.  These are: the protection of the right to regulate; the establishment and functioning of arbitral tribunals; the relationship between domestic judicial systems and Investor to State Dispute Settlement (ISDS); and the review of ISDS decisions for legal correctness through an appellate mechanism.  <br/><br/>The EU Commission has indicated that, in the first quarter of 2015, it will be discussing the report with Member States and the European Parliament, and with different stakeholders, including non-governmental organisations, business, trade unions, consumer and environment organisations.  The Commission has further indicated that, following these consultations, it will develop specific proposals for the TTIP negotiations.  <br/><br/>I very much welcome this approach, and I believe that it is important to take time to have open and constructive discussion following the Commission&rsquo;s report that will inform the next steps.  <br/><br/>At this stage, there are no negotiations taking place with the United States on this aspect of the proposed agreement.</p></reply>

Over the past number of months, officials from Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and my Department have been involved in a series of engagements with the main stakeholder groups in the Midlands to discuss the strengths and opportunities that can be built upon to support enterprise and jobs growth in that region.<br/><br/>As part of the consultation process, a major stakeholder Forum was held in Athlone on 19 December last.  The aim of the Forum was to identify practical actions that could be taken by the public sector or the business sector to progress the key issues which were identified by stakeholders as important to support job creation in the Midlands.  Feedback from the Forum was captured in a structured way and participants were also invited to submit any additional ideas or proposals to a dedicated mail box in my Department - .  <br/><br/>All proposals received, either through the Stakeholder Forum, or in subsequent submissions, are being examined by my officials who are currently finalising the preparation of the Regional Enterprise Strategy for the Midlands.  The process is concentrated on identifying practical actions that can be taken in the short-to-medium term, and broadly within existing resources, to improve the operating environment for businesses.  <br/><br/>Last week, the Government set out its ambition to achieve full employment by 2018.  Achieving this objective will be supported by each region realising its economic potential.  In a similar fashion to the annual Action Plan for Jobs the Regional Enterprise Strategies will identify measures that can be taken to enable the region as a whole to realise its economic potential and create jobs, building on its existing competitive strengths. </p></reply>

The ultimate objective is increased employment and prosperity in Ireland.  <br/><br/>The companies that Enterprise Ireland works with are a vital source of employment in every county and region across Ireland. <br/><br/>In 2014, EI assisted companies generated 19,705 new jobs.  This resulted in a net increase of 8,476 in the total number of people employed by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, the highest net gain in the history of the Agency.<br/><br/>At the end of 2014, total direct employment (full and part time) in Enterprise Ireland client companies stood at 180,072 in 2014.  Of these, 156,202 are full-time jobs, while 23,870 are part-time.  These full-time employment and total employment levels are the highest recorded in the history of the agency.<br/><br/>This continuation of employment growth demonstrates clearly the direct impact that increasing exports has on jobs in Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland supported companies now, directly and indirectly, account for more than 300,000 jobs in the Irish economy - 16% of total workforce. <br/><br/>Employment data for Enterprise Ireland is collected annually as part of the Annual Employment Survey which measures the number of jobs in Agency assisted clients. <br/><br/><b>Table 1</b>below identifies the breakdown of employment by

My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is engaged in a comprehensive programme of gathering the necessary baseline data appropriate to the Conservation Objectives of &lsquo;Natura&rsquo; areas.  This data collection programme is substantially complete.  This is followed by data analysis and the setting of appropriate Conservation Objectives by the NPWS.  Once this process is complete all new, renewal and review aquaculture applications can be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.</p>  <p>  The Appropriate Assessment of Castlemaine Harbour has been completed and the relevant licensing determinations have been made based on applications to hand at the time of the assessment.</p>  <p>  The specific applications referred to by the Deputy were submitted to my Department subsequent to the carrying out of the Appropriate Assessment process for this harbour.  Accordingly, it was not possible to assess these applications against the designated Conservation Objectives for the harbour.</p>  <p>  The optimum method for appropriately assessing applications by individual operators, who are not included in the initial overall assessment procedure, is under consideration by my Department.  The process must comply with best scientific practice and be achieved in a manner which will be acceptable to the national authorities and to the EU Commission.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the assessment procedures agreed with the EU Commission require Appropriate Assessments in respect of aquaculture activities to be carried out by the national authorities and unilateral departure from these arrangements is not possible.</p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to expedite the conclusion of this matter as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In keeping with normal protocols in such cases, the herd concerned was subject to 2 further tests at 60 day intervals to determine if the restriction could be lifted.  While the first of these two 60-day tests disclosed no further reactors, the second test on 20 December 2014 gave an indeterminate result for two animals (i.e. the reactions by these animals to the TB skin test were not within the defined norms such that they could be determined to be either positive or negative).  The normal procedure for such situations was followed and the animals were subject to two follow-up blood tests (Gamma Interferon) on 5 and 12 January 2015, both of which were negative (it is normal practice by the Department, where there is an absence of correlation between the skin and the initial blood test, to conduct a second blood test).  Having fully complied with the normal procedures, the herd concerned was de-restricted on 14 January.</p>  <p>  As the regulatory authority with responsibility for implementing the bovine TB eradication programme, my Department was centrally involved in the decision making process in this case.  In this context, and in accordance with normal practice, communications take place as necessary between relevant officials, including a meeting on 9 January 2015 (but not on 7 January as stated in the Question).  However, a decision on de-restriction had to await the final outcome of the blood testing phase referred to in the preceding paragraph and, as stated, this decision was not taken until 14 January 2015.  In summary, I am satisfied that no decisions were taken in haste and that my Department acted appropriately in this matter and that all of the appropriate procedures were followed with a view to the elimination of TB from the herd and to prevent any spread to other herds.  I am not aware of conflict of interest in the management of this issue.</p>  <p>  In relation to the second matter raised which, I should emphasise, has no bearing on the management of the disease incident referred to above, as I have stated in response to recent questions on this issue, following stakeholder representations over a number of years, Teagasc proposes to establish a &lsquo;suckler&rsquo; demonstration farm in Athenry to serve farmers in the West of Ireland.  The project is modelled on the well known Greenfield dairy demonstration farm in Kilkenny, which annually attracts large numbers of farmers and discussion groups.  The Greenfield model is very highly regarded, and provides a public good demonstration service to all farmers in the dairy sector.  It is envisaged that the Athenry suckler project would operate along similar lines with the aim of demonstrating to farmers the profit that can be obtained from a well run suckler beef farm.</p>  <p>  The operation of the demonstration farm and the dissemination of research from this farm is an &lsquo;operational&rsquo; matter for Teagasc and its governing Authority, which comprises representatives of the main stakeholder groups in the agri-food sector including the farm organisations.</p></reply>

This resulted in a reduction in the number of local offices from 58 to 16 enhanced Regional Offices.  A follow-on review of business processes and procedures and, in particular, the administrative support requirements, in those 16 offices resulted in the introduction of a number of significant changes in the implementation of controls in the TB eradication programme.  As a consequence of these changes and having regard to the significant efficiencies which have already arisen as a result of the investment made by my Department in IT in recent years, the number of staff required to deliver the service in the local offices has been considerably reduced.  The review concluded that further substantial efficiencies would accrue from the centralisation of administrative support and, in light of this, my Department has commenced a process to centralise this support in 2 &lsquo;back office&rsquo; locations, namely Portlaoise and Cavan.</p>  <p>  The centralisation of administrative functions facilitates the redeployment of staff from my Department&rsquo;s Regional Offices to other State agencies and, thereby, enable Government to provide services through these agencies more efficiently.  My Department has already engaged with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Social Protection, the Revenue Commissioners and the Payroll Shared Services Centre with a view to new work for staff from my Department that are affected by the reorganisation plan.  Following the Government decision to locate one of the 3 Payroll Shared Services Centres in Galway, my Department has been requested to redeploy our administrative staff in Galway to that Centre.  No date has been set yet for redeployment but the Department anticipates it is likely to happen in mid 2015.  The proposed redeployment to the Shared Payroll Service does not involve administrative staff being moved from their current location in Renmore.</p>  <p>  It is important to state that any changes to my Department&rsquo;s Galway office will not negatively impact upon local access and services for local customers.  Department veterinary inspectors, agricultural inspectors and technical officers will remain in place and frontline services will be fully maintained and public access for all of the Department&rsquo;s stakeholders will continue to be available.  Similar changes have taken place in the Department&rsquo;s offices in Clonakilty, Limerick, Waterford and Enniscorthy without any negative implications for the provision of services to farmer clients.</p></reply>

The European Court of Justice declared in case C418/04 that, by failing to take all the measures necessary to comply with Article 6(3) of Directive 92/43 (Habitats Directive) in respect of the authorisation of aquaculture programmes, Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under that Directive.</p>  <p>  In the negotiations to address the judgment a process was agreed with the European Commission which would lead to full compliance by Ireland with the relevant EU Directives.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, in the case of aquaculture sites located within Natura 2000 areas the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, has engaged in a comprehensive programme to gather the necessary baseline data appropriate to the conservation objectives of these areas.

This comprehensive data collection programme, together with the setting of appropriate Conservation Objectives by the NPWS, enables all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.

I have already made it clear that there is no evidence that Ireland is a particular transit hub for persons to travel to Turkey on the way to Syria and Iraq, any more than any country with international flight connections can be said to be a transit hub for these persons. I should add that Ireland already has strong immigration controls in place and cooperates fully in exchanges of information with other countries.</p>  <p>  There are a small number of people based here who support extremism and would try to facilitate others to travel to conflict zones. The activities of these people are closely monitored by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is also very close cooperation with security services in other jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  Ireland, like any other democratic country with similar values, is not immune to a threat from international terrorism.  While an attack on Ireland is possible it is not assessed as likely. There is no specific information in relation to a threat to Ireland. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are keeping the level of threat from international terrorism under continuous review in light of ongoing developments and continuing to take all appropriate measures to counteract this threat. In this they have the full support of the Government.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that the necessary legislation is in place to address terrorist threats. The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014 has already passed all stages in the Seanad.  The Bill, when enacted, will create the three new offences of, public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism. These offences will carry sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment on conviction on indictment. It is expected that the Bill will come before the D&aacute;il shortly.</p></reply>

The attack in July 1975 not far from Newry took the lives of three of the members of the band, Fran O'Toole, Brian McCoy and Tony Geraghty, and wounded Stephen Travers and Des McAlea.  The brutal attack on the Miami Showband is one of the violent incidents which sticks in the memory as among the most bloody episodes in the history of the troubles.  Indeed, two of the gang that carried out the attack were killed when the bomb they were planting exploded prematurely.</p>  <p>  The attack was claimed at the time by the Ulster Volunteer Force.  It is very clear, however, from the various investigations that have been carried out down the years that members of the Ulster Defence Regiment were deeply involved in it.  Indeed, three former members of the UDR were prosecuted in Northern Ireland and convicted of murder for their part in the Miami Showband attack.  The report of the PSNI's Historical Inquiries Team in 2011 concluded that the murders raised troubling questions about collusion between security forces in Northern Ireland and loyalist paramilitaries.  I understand also that a civil action for damages is being pursued currently in Northern Ireland against the police and the UK Ministry of Defence.</p>  <p>  It is impossible to forget the many horrific acts of troubles-related violence that were carried out or, indeed, the pain that is still being felt as a result.  The impact of this and many other atrocities continues to be felt to this day and our thoughts are with the survivors and the relatives of those events.  As the Deputy is aware, the late Judge Henry Barron carried out detailed and painstaking inquiries into many of these awful events in which so many innocent people lost their lives.  The Garda authorities co-operated fully with the Barron inquiries.</p>  <p>  In 2007 a monument dedicated to the memory of the three band members who lost their lives in this brutal attack was erected in Dublin.  The memorial is situated at the site of the old National Ballroom at Parnell Square where the band had played regularly and it is, I think, a very fitting tribute to those talented young men.</p>  <p>  On the general question of dealing with the past, the Deputy will be aware that the Stormont House Agreement contains a series of valuable measures in this regard.</p></reply>

The counsel appointed to the panel were all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.  The review of each complaint will consist of an examination of the papers in the complaint by a counsel from the Panel. </p>  <p>  The counsel are all fully aware of and share my concerns that nothing arises which might in any way detract from the integrity of the review mechanism, including issues of conflict of interest.  Arrangements have been put in place  to ensure that if there is any conflict, or potential conflict, the particular counsel not only will not be involved in the particular case but also will not be aware of which counsel is reviewing it.  This is normal professional conduct and there are sufficient counsel on the panel to ensure the practicality of this.

The person who has raised the complaint in this matter has been advised of these arrangements as has her legal representative.</p>  <p>  Each recommendation that is made by the Panel will be very carefully considered, but as a matter of general principle let me say quite clearly that, in coming to a decision in each case, I will be very strongly guided by the independent advice of counsel. Quite clearly, having engaged counsel for this review, it would be entirely appropriate to be guided by their advice.  For this reason, it would not be appropriate to comment upon the potential outcome of individual complaints being reviewed by this mechanism before I have received and considered counsel's recommendation therein.​</p></reply>

One of the consequences of that decision was that the transport arrangements in place for Ministers of State became applicable to Government Ministers, subject to very limited exceptions on security grounds.  In addition, it was decided that former Presidents and Taoisigh would only be supplied with official transport for important State occasions. The revised transport arrangements came into operation for Government Ministers on 1 May 2011 and for former Office Holders on 16 June 2011.<br/><br/>Office Holder cars are currently placed at the disposal of the President, An Taoiseach, An T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Chief Justice and the Director of Public Prosecutions.<br/><br/>The Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote.

Freedom of movement is subject to limitations and conditions and a Member State may refuse an EU national the right of entry or residence on the grounds of public policy, public security or public health. Measures affecting freedom of movement and residence must be based on the personal conduct of the individual concerned, and such conduct must represent a sufficiently serious and present threat to fundamental interests of the state.</p>  <p>  Persons not entitled to EU freedom of movement rights are subject to separate legislation provisions regarding entry to and residence in the State. In particular, section 4 of the Immigration Act 2004 provides that an immigration officer may refuse to give permission to enter the State to a non-national under certain circumstances, including where the non-national has been convicted of an offence that may be punished under the law of the place of conviction by imprisonment for a period of one year or by a more severe penalty.  A non-national may also be refused permission to land or be in the State, if an immigration officer has reason to believe that the non-national&rsquo;s entry into, or presence in the State, could pose a threat to national security or be contrary to public policy and also where there is reason to believe that a non-national intends to enter the State for purposes other than that expressed by him/her.</p>  <p>  As well as the legal requirement that non-nationals seek permission to enter the State on arrival at approved ports of entry, as part of the visa application process for visa required nationals additional checks are carried out as required with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other countries' immigration and police authorities. Checks are also carried out with the UK authorities in the context of maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area. Visa required nationals must also declare in their visa application if they have any criminal convictions in any country.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, where any person who is not a citizen of Ireland or the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, who is resident in the State, is known or suspected to have engaged in criminal activity, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may provide relevant information to the Irish Naturalisation &amp;amp; Immigration Service (INIS) for the purpose of consideration being given to initiating a process for the purpose of arranging for their removal from the State pursuant to section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 or, if the person is an EU national, pursuant to Regulation 20 of the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2006.</p>  <p>  It is also the case that any person residing in or visiting the State  who is alleged to have committed a criminal offence in the jurisdiction will be made amenable to and subject to the laws of the State.</p></reply>

I am assured that an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are pro-active in attempting to detect any breach of this law. The prevention and detection of human trafficking and the protection of victims has been a policing priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since 2009. Comprehensive arrangements are in place for the training of Garda&iacute; to recognise and deal with all issues relating to human trafficking.<br/><br/>In 2009, the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) of my Department initiated a data collection strategy for the purpose of gaining a more in-depth understanding of the nature and extent of human trafficking in Ireland. AHTU publishes annual reports setting out information on the criminal justice response to human trafficking in Ireland as well as information on alleged victims of human trafficking encountered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and International and Non Governmental Organisations working in the field disaggregated by gender, age, region of origin and type of exploitation. The reports are available on Ireland's dedicated anti-human trafficking website <i>www.blueblindfold.gov.ie</i><b></b>and on my Department's website.  For the Deputy's convenience, the information sought, as outlined in these annual reports, is as follows.<br/><br/>The specific information sought by the Deputy is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th><b>YEAR</b></th><th><b>Number of Convictions related to trafficking for sexual exploitation</b></th></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>10</td></tr></table><b>NOTE:</b><br/><br/>1.

Since 2009,  trafficking in human beings has been identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as one of the priorities in its Annual Policing Plan with a focus on the prevention and detection of human trafficking.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 provides for penalties of up to life imprisonment and, at the discretion of the court, a fine for persons who traffic or attempt to traffic other persons including for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  It also makes it an offence to sell or offer for sale or to purchase or offer to purchase any person for any purpose.  Penalties of up to life imprisonment and, at the discretion of the court, a fine apply in respect of these offences.  Furthermore it is an offence for a person to solicit for prostitution a person who s/he knows or has reasonable grounds for believing is a trafficked person.  The penalty can be up to five years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine on conviction on indictment.</p>  <p>  There is a dedicated Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) in my Department to ensure that the State's response to human trafficking is coordinated and comprehensive.  In addition to this dedicated Unit there are 3 other dedicated Units in State Agencies dealing with the issue namely:</p>  <p>  - the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; </p>  <p>  - the Anti-Human Trafficking Team in the Health Service Executive;  </p>  <p>  - and a specialised Human Trafficking legal team in the Legal Aid Board.</p>  <p>  The State provides a wide range of support services to victims of human trafficking including those persons who have been trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  These services include accommodation, medical care and planning, psychological assistance, material assistance, legal aid and advice, immigration and residence permissions, vocational training and education.</p>  <p>  Specific detailed training is provided to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Almost 4000 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have received awareness training in human trafficking and over 900 have participated in the in-depth training course developed jointly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). A module dealing with human trafficking forms part of the training programme for all new recruits to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. There are also a wide range of other training and awareness raising activities on-going and extensive consultation structures exist with up to 70 State Agencies, Non- Governmental Organisations and International Organisations.</p>  <p>  AHTU, in partnership with Ruhama, has been successful in obtaining EU funding for a project aimed at delivering activities that promote zero tolerance of human trafficking as a form of violence against women. This project has two strands: one aimed at women at risk of sexual exploitation and another aimed at men and boys promoting zero tolerance of human trafficking as a form of violence against women. Activities under both strands of this project will  occur this year.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that the measures taken to combat human trafficking for sexual exploitation, including legislation, are adequate. To this end, on 27 November 2014, I published the General Scheme of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2014 which includes two new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services. The first is a general offence of purchasing sexual services which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the offence of purchasing a sexual service from a trafficked person and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not be subject to an offence. </p>  <p>  Unlike the existing offences relating to prostitution such as soliciting, loitering or brothel keeping, the new offences will specifically target the demand for prostitution.The purpose of this new legislation is to reduce the demand for the services of victims of human trafficking who are being sexually exploited in prostitution.  My primary concern in introducing these provisions is to vindicate the human rights of those trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.</p></reply>

Following full consideration, the Visa Officer decided to refuse the grant of the visa on 2 November, 2014.  The decision to refuse was appealed on 14 December, 2014 and was upheld by an Appeals Officer on 24 December, 2014.  A letter providing the reasons for this was issued to the applicant.  At both the stage of the original decision and at appeal stage, it was considered that the financial situation of the sponsor in Ireland fell substantially short of the financial criteria as set out in Paragraph 17.2 of the Policy Document on Non-EEA Family Reunification agreed by the Government last year.  In these circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that the granting of a visa in this case could result in a cost to State funds or resources.</p>  <p>  As the appeal process has been completed, the application in question is now closed.  However, it is always open to the person concerned to make a new application at any time should they so wish, especially if their or the sponsor's circumstances change.

Queries in relation to general matters may be made directly to INIS by email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which as been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

The Department of Justice and Equality leads on the National Disability Strategy and my Department supports that effort.<br/><br/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, </i>the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People includes a number of commitments from across a range of Government Departments and agencies aimed at improving outcomes for children and young people with disabilities.<br/><br/>The National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan contains three actions which my Department must progress involving children with disabilities in participation and consultation; needs assessment in the context of child welfare and protection; and better supports in the preschool year. <br/><br/>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme makes special provisions for access by children with special needs. These include an exemption to the upper age limit and the option of splitting the provision over two years, by availing of the programme for 2 days per week in the first year and for 3 days per week in the second year. A module on working with children with special needs is being included in FETAC Level 6 Awards for pre-school leaders to assist in up-skilling pre-school services. My Department has been working with the Departments of Health and Education &amp;amp; Skills on building better supports to facilitate the inclusion of special needs children in mainstream pre-school settings.  <br/><br/>I believe that Tusla, now just one year old, has a significant contribution to make to supporting children and families dealing with a disability. I am informed by Tusla that it has put in place a number of its initiatives. The &quot;Meitheal&quot; model currently under development will identify additional supports for families who do not meet the threshold for receipt of a child protection or child welfare service but have other vulnerabilities identified and ensure those needs are met by the appropriate service provider. Tusla is working to enhance links in these areas to ensure that services are provided in a co-ordinated and efficient manner. A key priority for Tusla in 2015 will be the development of collaborative arrangements in respect of primary care provision, including a focus on Youth Mental Health. Performance indicators are in place regarding children in care with disability. Tusla has ongoing liaison with the Health Service Executive with regard to disability services.<br/><br/>In December 2014, the National Disability Authority and Tusla jointly co-hosted a roundtable on &quot;Parents and Parenting with a Disability&quot;. The priority issues to emerge from the discussion highlighted a range of needs - early identification and intervention; early assessment based on competency to parent; clarity on the role of statutory bodies; joined-up and planned approach in support services and supports in the community. None of these conclusions are new and none are a surprise but they are a reflection of the challenges that faces families and the services they need in dealing with disability.</p></reply>

During the meeting a number of matters were discussed including the need to ensure that all children have a trusted person to whom they can disclose any abuse which they may have been subject to. During the meeting, I outlined the existing arrangements which are in place under Child First National Guidelines regarding the reporting of abuse. I also outlined the statutory role of the Child and Family Agency under the Child Care Act 1991 and the new responsibilities regarding reporting that will arise from the Children First Bill. In addition, I outlined the very important provisions set out in the Bill regarding the receipt of child's disclosures of harm by mandated persons and the requirements to report such disclosures immediately. Notwithstanding those proposed provisions, I undertook to consider further the need for a "child-friendly" access point for a child to make a disclosure in circumstances where they are reluctant to disclosure to a parent or other trusted adult and in situations where a trusted adult may indeed be the abuser. I have asked the CEO of the Child and Family Agency to consider such matters in devising information and reporting arrangements for the children, parents, mandated persons and other reporters. In particular, I have asked him to consider the possibility of having specific child-oriented access points to ensure that every child has an easy, reliable and approachable point of contact which is well-recognised and appealing to children who find themselves in such circumstances.</p></reply>

As provided for in the Framework, the Department of Social Protection which is the lead department on child poverty has the lead responsibility for a specific commitment to a national child-specific social target to lift over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.  The Department of Social Protection are active partners in the implementation infrastructure of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures which is being led by my Department.  The Department of Social Protection also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.<br/><br/>My Department is leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2016).  The ABC Programme is an innovative prevention and early intervention initiative consisting of committed funding for an area-based approach to helping to improve outcomes for children and thereby impacting on child poverty. The programme builds on and continues the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) 2007 - 2013 which was co-funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) and The Atlantic Philanthropies (AP).<br/><br/>The ABC Programme targets investment in evidence-informed interventions to improve the long-term outcomes for children and families living in areas of disadvantage. It aims to break &ldquo;the cycle of child poverty within areas where it is most deeply entrenched and where children are most disadvantaged, through integrated and effective services and interventions&rdquo; in the areas of child development, child well-being, parenting and educational disadvantage. <br/><br/>The ABC Programme is jointly funded by my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies (AP). The total amount of committed funding from both the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and The Atlantic Philanthropies available in the period 2013-2016 will be &euro;29.7m. <br/><br/>The ABC Programme Project Team was set up in 2013 to oversee the implementation of the programme.  The Project Team is chaired by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and includes representatives from six other Government Departments, our co-funders The Atlantic Philanthropies, Tusla Child and Family Agency as well as two organisations, Pobal and the Centre for Effective Services (CES), which have been designated to manage the programme on behalf of Department of Children and Youth Affairs and The Atlantic Philanthropies.<br/><br/>As part of the rigorous ABC Programme application process, applicants were required to demonstrate through the use of Pobal Maps that their applications covered disadvantaged areas.  Pobal Maps was developed by Pobal to allow the identification of disadvantage areas at a local level.<br/><br/>In 2013, 13 sites were approved for inclusion in the ABC Programme.  It is expected that all of the projects will be operational in early 2015.<br/><br/>The long term goal of the ABC Programme is to mainstream the learning from the Programme.  My Department is currently in the process of considering how best this learning can be disseminated and replicated in mainstream services post 2016.  My Department will consider this in consultation with the ABC Project Team to ensure the efficient and effective return on investment in the area of services for children and young people.</p></reply>

In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve, approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.<br/><br/>Ongoing engagement and dialogue with the voluntary youth sector organisations and with young people themselves are priorities in the formulation of policies and provision of services to support young people&rsquo;s development and learning. My Department works closely with the youth sector interests in various fora in developing key initiatives. The National Youth Work Advisory Committee, whose members include representatives of the national youth organisations, Government departments and the Education and Training Boards, that support youth services at local level, has an important advisory role to me in matters to do with provision for young people. My Department has worked with the youth sector on the development of youth work responses to the challenges of youth unemployment, including the contribution that the youth services can make to the Government's employment agenda and the <i>Action Plan For Jobs, 2014</i>.<br/><br/>The youth sector is engaged in the development, by my Department, of the new National Youth Strategy 2014- 2020.  The strategy will have its basis in National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, &lsquo;<i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>&rsquo; and will span the period 2014 &ndash; 2020. A National Youth Strategy Task Group, convened by my Department, is overseeing the development of the new Strategy. This Task Group comprises statutory youth interests and voluntary agencies and organisations working with young people. <br/><br/>I am keen that all stakeholders have a role to play in the development of the National Youth Strategy and a comprehensive consultation process is underway at present. It includes online surveys of young people and those working with young people and three major stakeholder consultation events planned for later this month. These events are for young people, the youth sector, NGOs working for and with young people, Education and Training Boards, Government departments, agencies, business and academia and other youth interests. <br/><br/>I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet regularly, with youth organisations and groups. In September, I met with the representatives of some 30 national and major regional youth organisations. My aim is to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people, having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. There has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which was a key priority for youth organisations. My Department is in the process of notifying youth organisations and projects, including Kildare Youth Service, of their 2015 allocations in respect of their youth services. An allocation of &euro;488,200 has been allocated for the projects and services under Kildare Youth Services.</p>  <p>  Last year, officials of my Department met Kildare Youth Services and have visited their office in Naas to hear about their work and their proposals, for the provision of services in County Kildare. My Department provides funding to Kildare Youth Services under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme in respect of six local youth projects in Athy, Naas, Leixlip, Newbridge, the Curragh and Kildare town and a Youth Information Centre in Naas.  In addition, Kildare Youth Hub, Kildare Town has received approval under the 2013 Capital Scheme for the development of a new youth caf&eacute; facility.</p></reply>

I am satisfied that the Agency takes its responsibility regarding the welfare of children in care very seriously and that there is a robust framework of regulations and standards, to ensure that children are placed in safe and caring settings.  All children in care should have an allocated social worker but it is important to note that if a child has not been allocated a social worker then the cases are reviewed regularly by the principal social worker and are often managed by duty social work teams to ensure the necessary services are being addressed.  I would note that the social work services provided under the auspices of the Child and Family Agency are separate from other services, including social, medical and educational services, that a child may require. These services are accessed or continue to be accessed while the child is in care. <br/><br/>The number of children in state care, as of 31 October 2014 was 6,454 and the majority of these children, 93%, were in foster care placements.  The number of children in care by area is given in the table below.<table><tr><th>Area</th><th>Children in Care </th></tr><tr><td>Dublin Mid-Leinster</td><td>1,532</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North East</td><td>1,496</td></tr><tr><td>South</td><td>1,965</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>1,461</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>6,454</td></tr></table><br/><br/>In addition to the inspection regime which gives us information on how standards are being addressed by individual services, the Child and Family Agency has developed a suite of performance indicators to allow policy makers and practitioners to monitor service provision and these are published on the Agency website, www.tusla.ie.  As the majority of children in care are in foster care family settings in the community, indicators of stability of the placement and participation in education are useful in monitoring the performance of the Agency in relation to overall welfare.  I am happy to say that the Child and Family Agency has reported that the results for these indicators are positive and show that placement stability is very high and participation in education is on a par with the national participation rates.<br/><br/>I am satisfied that the necessary services and supports are in place to ensure the protection and welfare of children in State care, and that we have the structures in place to regulate and inspect service provision.  I am also satisfied that my Department and the Agency continue to drive both improvements in the quality of the care services and the quality of the experience for children in care through a partnership approach with services, children  and non-governmental bodies.</p></reply>

These contacts relate to a range of responsibilities that come within my remit and some bodies have multiple contacts with my Department in line with their respective areas of interest. <br/><br/>On an ongoing basis, we have contacts with the State Bodies coming within remit of my Department, namely, the Child and Family Agency and the Adoption Authority of Ireland. We have contact with the Ombudsman for Children in the context of our relationship with that Office under the governing legislation.<br/><br/>The <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>Advisory Council was established in November 2014 and includes representatives from key groups working in the areas of Early Years, Children and Youth, as well as independent experts and individuals nominated by me.  The Advisory Council provides the platform through which the NGO sector connects with and mobilises communities, families and individuals, and are an essential partner to implementation of the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People. <br/><br/>My Department works closely with the youth sector interests in developing  key initiatives such as the National Youth Strategy 2014-20. The National  Youth Work Advisory Committee, whose members include representatives of the national youth organisations, Government departments and the Education and Training Boards, that support youth services at local level, has an important advisory role to me in matters to do with provision for young people. In September 2014 I met with the representatives of some 30 national and major regional youth organisations to see how we can work together within resources available to ensure that programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs. <br/><br/>In the development of the Children First legislation, a number of round-table meetings were held with key stakeholders to brief them on the provisions of the Bill. Further consultations with stakeholders will be undertaken in the context of the passage of the Children First legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas. <br/><br/>My Department works with a wide range of non-government organisations in the development of policy and practice on children and young people&rsquo;s participation in decision-making. A National Strategy on the Participation of Children and Young People in Decision Making is currently being developed. <br/><br/>Some specific topics involve contacts with particular groups. For example:<br/><br/>-the Children's Rights Alliance in relation to policy matters arising under the United Nation Convention on the Rights of the Child  - specifically the Third Optional Protocol to the UNCRC on a Communications Procedure;<br/><br/>-the ISPCC in relation to the Missing Children's Hotline which is now funded by DCYA;<br/><br/>-Barnardos in relation to the provision of Guardian Ad Litem services under the Child Care Act 1991;<br/><br/>-The Children&rsquo;s Research Network for Ireland and Northern Ireland, established in 2010 to support the research community to better understand and improve the lives of children and young people, by creating and maintaining an inclusive, independent, non-profit network through which information, knowledge, experience, learning and skills can be shared.<br/><br/>The Children Detention Schools (CDS) have a service level agreement with certain organisations. Empowering People in Care (EPIC) provide advice, support and individual advocacy services to children and young people in care, those preparing to leave care and those in aftercare. The Youth Advocate Programmes (YAP) organisation build partnerships between vulnerable young people, their families and communities to support their full potential through a community based, strengths focused, intensive support to selected young persons for up to six months on their discharge to aid their re-integration into their community where the child doesn't have other adequate supports in place.<br/><br/>The Early Years Policy Unit in my Department has ongoing interaction on a range of childcare related issues with the 31 City and County Childcare Committees and the 7 National Voluntary Childcare organisations that represent childcare providers and also advocate in relation to childcare issues.  The voluntary organisations include Barnardos, Early Childhood Ireland, Child-minding Ireland, Border Counties Childcare Network, St. Nicholas Montessori, Irish Steiner Waldorf Organisation and Forbair Naionra Teoranta.<br/><br/>Contacts with any other organisations not mentioned above can take place during the year, either at my request or in response to requests from the organisations concerned.</p></reply>

These inspections will have a developmental focus looking in particular at the quality of children&rsquo;s learning experiences and achievements and how this is supported in settings by management and leadership, curricular provision, the learning environment, adult-child interactions and the use of play based approaches. Practitioners in the Early Childhood settings will also have opportunity to engage in professional dialogue with inspectors who have expertise in the area of early childhood education. This professional dialogue together with the publication of reports will provide valuable advice to practitioners on how to improve the quality of learning experiences for the children.</font><br/><br/><font color="#0D0D0D">  The education-focussed inspections will be a separate programme of inspections but they will complement fully the regulatory, care-focussed inspections by the TUSLA Early Years&rsquo; Inspectorate. Having separate care-focussed inspections and education-focussed inspections conducted by cooperating inspectorates is reflective of practice in other jurisdictions and there is strong evidence that this approach works very well. </font><br/><br/><font color="#0D0D0D">Both the DES and TUSLA Inspectorates are committed to working closely to ensure that the inspection processes complement each other, to minimise disruption to the work of early years&rsquo; settings and to avoid unnecessary administrative burdens on leaders and practitioners in early years&rsquo; centres. In this regard, appropriate systems will be put in place to facilitate the sharing of inspection information between both Inspectorates. This will build on the collaboration between both Inspectorates during the joint pilot inspections conducted in 2011/2012 which established a shared understanding of respective roles and inspection processes, and an awareness of the demands on pre-school settings. The Inspectorate of the DES will consult with stakeholders in the sector in advance of commencing the programme of education-focussed inspections.</font><br/><br/><font color="#0D0D0D">The learning from carrying out education focused inspections in the Pre-School Year will contribute to long term planning for the regulation of the early years sector, including the assessment of learning and development outcomes for children aged between 0 and 3.</font><br/><br/><font color="#0D0D0D">  </font>A National Early Years Quality Support Service, known as <i>Better Start</i>, has been introduced under the Early Years Quality Agenda.  As part of that service, funding has been provided to allow for the recruitment of 30 graduates in early childhood care and education who will work directly with services to improve quality, including assisting services in the implementation of the S&iacute;olta Framework and the Aistear Curriculum.  The new service will work closely with the City and County Childcare Committees and the Voluntary Childcare Organisations to support service providers in improving the quality of their services.  The work of the service will be based on a new Practice Guide based on S&iacute;olta and Aistear, which is currently being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).

The programme is normally provided for 3 hours per day, 5 days per week, over 38 weeks.  The Government has made a very significant commitment in maintaining the pre-school year on a universal and free basis despite the current budgetary situation.   </p>  <p>  The ECCE programme is funded by my Department through the provision of capitation grants paid directly to participating services. This capitation payment is for the provision of services, including preparatory and supportive work such as engagement with parents, training and organisation.  The standard capitation fee paid to participating services is &euro;62.50 per week per eligible child.  A higher capitation fee of &euro;73 per week per eligible child is available to pre-school services with more highly qualified staff.  </p>  <p>  There are in the region of 4,200 pre-school services participating in the programme with new services applying to enter the programme each year.  The funding provided under the programme is a guaranteed source of income, paid in advance, and is an important support to services at this time. Services applying to enter the programme should be satisfied that they can meet the full cost of providing the pre-school year from the capitation provided. </p>  <p>  Ireland, like other European countries, does not provide for mandatory Continuing Professional Development for early years practitioners.  Data from the 2014 Eurydice and EUROSTAT Report &lsquo;Key Data on Early Childhood Education and Care &ndash; Education and Training in Europe&rsquo; shows that in Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Cyprus, Poland, Sweden and Norway, CPD is not obligatory for educational and care staff. </p>  <p>  The same report identifies that &lsquo;Continuing professional development (CPD) plays an essential part in increasing ECEC professionals' competencies. In certain cases, participating in training allows staff not only to improve their knowledge and develop additional professional skills in ECEC, but also to upgrade their qualifications.</p>  <p>  I would like to be in a position to provide for mandatory CPD but first I would like to see early years practitioners meet the new minimum requirements.  The Deputy may be aware that as part of the early years quality agenda aimed at improving the quality of childcare services, new qualification requirements for childcare staff working directly with children were announced last year.   A minimum qualification of Level 5 (or equivalent) on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) will be required for all staff working with children in pre-school services and the minimum qualification for all pre-school leaders delivering the free pre-school year under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme will be increased from Level 5 to Level 6 (or equivalent) on the NFQ.  It is expected that new qualification requirements will apply to all existing services from September 2015. </p>  <p>  To support staff who are seeking to meet the new qualifications requirement, funding of &euro;3 million is being made available over the two years 2014/2015 under the Learner Fund.  The Fund is being administered by Pobal, with the assistance of local City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs). </p>  <p>  My Department also provides annual funding to seven voluntary childcare organisations in the childcare sector, who provide support to childcare services throughout the country. This funding, which will amount to over &euro;2.6 million  in 2014, enables the voluntary organisations to provide a range of support services to their members, including on-going training supports.</p></reply>

The Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. It provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children. </p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects. In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million has been provided for the School Completion Programme. The Agency has approved local projects' school retention plans for the 2014/2015 academic year. The first instalment of 2014/15 funding issued to local projects last September. Further payments totalling approximately &euro;9.5m have issued over the past month, with a third instalment in May 2015.   </p>  <p>  There is one post primary school and seven primary schools in the area mentioned by the Deputy. These schools are served by the Ballymun Educational Support Team (BEST) School Completion Programme project, which is integrated with the Aisling Project in Poppintree. I am advised that an amount of &euro;576.261 was allocated by the Agency to these projects for the school year 2014-2015, of which &euro;468,212 has been paid in two instalments by 31 December 2014, with a final payment of &euro;108,049 due in May 2015.</p>  <p>  The amounts provided for 2014-2015 take account of the savings requirements in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012-2014. The allocation of the funding across the range of interventions planned for young people and between the local schools in the School Completion Programme project for the area is a matter for the Local Management Committee.  </p>  <p>  The estimate for the Child and Family Agency for 2015 is &euro;631 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation. My Department has recently issued a Performance Statement to the Agency under Section 45 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013. This includes my priorities for consideration in the development of the Agency's 2015 Business Plan. The Business Plan will set out the Agency's proposed activities, programmes and priorities for 2015, including provision for the School Completion Programme, in the light of the monies available.</p>  <p>  A review of the School Completion Programme has commenced. It is being carried out by the ESRI following a procurement process managed by the Agency. The programme has been in operation since 2002 and I believe that it is timely that a review be carried out.  The Review is an important initiative to plan for the future development of this Programme.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed during the 2014/2015 academic year.</p></reply>

In developing the Terms of Reference due regard was given to the emphasis on &ldquo;Mother and Baby Homes&rdquo; in the motion approved by D&aacute;il Eireann on the 11th June 2014 and the investigation will examine a wide agenda of matters in relation to these homes. The investigation will thoroughly examine the experience of the many mothers and children who were resident in a Mother and Baby Home over the period 1922-1998. The approach taken provides a deliberate emphasis on the experiences of women and children who spent time in Mother and Baby Homes over the period 1922-1998. Accordingly, the Terms of Reference focus on institutions which can be identified as having both:</p>  <p>  - the primary function of providing sheltered and supervised ante and post-natal facilities to single mothers and their children, and</p>  <p>  - an ethos which those running the institutions considered to promote a regime of work, training or education as part of an overall approach to either rehabilitating single mothers before they left the institution, or to give them training for living independently.</p>  <p>  The Commission will also investigate a representative sample of those County Homes which had a considerable focus on these services. On the basis of the available information, I am satisfied that the institutions included in schedule 1 of the draft Order meet these criteria whereas the institutions raised in the details supplied by the Deputy do not, as they did not provide this specific range of services.</p>  <p>  However, where such institutions had a relationships with a Mother and Baby Home, the role played by these institutions can be examined within the Commission's work. Article 1(VII) of the Terms of Reference requires the Commission to investigate the exit pathways of children when they left these Homes, and in particular the nature of the relationship between Mother and Baby Homes and other key institutions &ndash; these include children&rsquo;s homes; orphanages; and adoption societies. This will include identifying patterns of referral, and the practices and arrangements for placing children, including where an intermediary organisation was involved in arranging a subsequent placement.The Terms of Reference also require consideration of the extent to which mother&rsquo;s consented to such placements &ndash; i.e. was their consent full, free and informed &ndash; and the degree to which children&rsquo;s welfare and protection was considered in making such placements. Issues to be examined by the social history module under Article 11 also include the role and interrelationships of a range of institutions, including homes for infants or children. </p>  <p>  I do appreciate that since the decision to establish this investigation was announced there have been calls for the inclusion of a broad range of matters. At least some of these issues are unrelated to the intended remit of this investigation. In addition, and in the interests of maintaining the required focus and specificity on Mother and Baby Homes,  it must be recognised that previous inquiries have already examined some related issues. This includes the comprehensive investigation into historical child abuse already conducted by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. Its remit was to inquire into the abuse of children in a broad range of care settings, including children's homes, during the period 1940 to 1999.</p>  <p>  The Government is satisfied that the proposed Terms of Reference Government provide an ambitious and appropriately focused set of tasks which can be accomplished by this Commission within a realistic timeframe.</p></reply>

Ensuring the best possible outcomes for children in their early years is therefore an important element in future economic planning. </p>  <p>  The case for investing in children and young people on both social and economic grounds is supported by a body of international evidence.  As the Minister with responsibility for this key area, I propose to establish a cross-Departmental group at senior level to develop a whole-of-Government approach to future investment in early childhood care and education and after-school care. The group will undertake an economic and cost benefit analysis of policies and future options for increasing the supply, accessibility and affordability of quality childhood care and education services. </p>  <p>  It is clear that accessibility, affordability and high quality childcare can play a critical role in achieving a number of Government priorities, including improving educational outcome for children, reducing poverty and increasing parents' participation in the labour market. The importance of this area is reinforced by continuing economic improvement and job growth and an increased focus on activation for those currently outside the labour market.</p>  <p>  To ensure that all the potential benefits can be realised, future public investment in childcare must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. It must look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as consider the after-school needs of older school-going children. It is crucial, therefore, that we develop a coherent cross-Government approach to investment in childcare services.</p>  <p>  The group which I propose to establish will include representatives of the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach and will be led and supported by my Department.  I will be asking that the work of this group be carried out within a relatively short time frame and I expect that the group will be in a position to report to me in the Summer.</p></reply>

In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.</p>  <p>  My Department has prioritised the development of a National Youth Strategy for completion this year.  The National Youth Strategy will focus on the youth-related policy commitments outlined in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People. It will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24. It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore in most need of support.</p>  <p>  A National Youth Strategy Task Group, convened by my Department, is overseeing the development of the new Strategy. This Task Group comprises statutory youth interests and voluntary agencies and organisations working with young people.</p>  <p>   I am keen that all stakeholders have a role to play in the development of the new National Youth Strategy and a comprehensive consultation process is underway at present. This consultation process includes online surveys of young people and those working with young people and a number of stakeholder events for all youth interests planned for later this month.  The events will include consultation on the priorities for the new Strategy and the findings of the recently completed Value for Money and Policy Review of Youth Programmes. The Review makes recommendations for the future operation of youth funding schemes and their development in the years ahead to ensure effective, value for money services that will be evidence based and improve outcomes for young people. </p>  <p>  The consultation will run into February 2015 and I anticipate that the Strategy will be completed promptly thereafter.</p></reply>

The delivery of children detention services is focused on education and rehabilitation of those young people detained in order to address offending behaviour and support their early re-integration into the community.  </p>  <p>  The development project which is currently nearing completion in Oberstown will enable the extension of the child care model of detention to all children under the age of 18 years.  The project also includes the provision of new education and recreation facilities as well as dedicated visiting facilities and a medical facility.  These facilities will support and enhance the existing services already being provided to children in detention on the campus.</p>  <p>  An individual management plan is put in place for each child on admission to the children detention schools which includes a mental health assessment to determine the need for more specialist services provided by the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service.  This is a national service provided jointly by Tusla - the Child and Family Agency and the children detention schools which provides clinical services to children in detention and also in  special care facilities, as well as short term interventions when the child returns to the community.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that earlier community based interventions to divert young people from offending behaviour, such as the Garda Youth Diversion Projects and the Garda Diversion Programme are also in place in the community and come under the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  These programmes aim to engage young people in contact with the criminal justice system in a process of learning and development that enables them to make positive lifestyle choices in the community.</p></reply>

However, the HSE has informed me that Garda&iacute; have now cleared the way for the investigation to commence.<br/><br/>The investigation team is working independently of the HSE and is chaired by Mr Christy Lynch.

This review has two purposes:<br/><br/>-  An Assurance review of the services at &Aacute;ras Attracta.  The final report will include an individual plan for improvement in each bungalow within the complex;<br/><br/>-  Secondly the review will identify system wide learning and will involve engagement with academia as well as input from staff.

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

The increase of &euro;10m is part of the initiative to tackle delayed discharges and has been provided for the provision of an additional 300 long stay care places under the NHSS.</p>  <p>  The review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme which is currently in progress will include consideration of the balance between community and residential services as well as the future financing and sustainability of the Scheme.

If this case, I can assure the Deputy that the HSE is not in breach of this principle in its use of Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT).</p>  <p>   DBT is an evidence-based intervention specifically for individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder.  It uses cognitive and behavioural practices focussed on mindfulness and does so in an entirely non-religious fashion.  DBT is therefore a non-religious, secular therapy for people who struggle with distressing and difficult emotions and have a tendency to self-harm.  It provides alternative, less harmful, positive tools and practices to cope with difficult situations and avoid them.  While some tools and practices may contain echoes of religious and spiritual traditions, since most religious and spiritual traditions evolved to help people cope with difficult, traumatic times, DBT is scrupulously non-religious.</p>  <p>  All therapies and programmes within the HSE offer individual choice and therapists adopt a non-judgemental stance and are trained comprehensively to be open to all view points.  Every effort is made to provide an inclusive and safe environment to all service users, irrespective of religious beliefs.</p></reply>

However the HSE, subject to available funding, under the Treatment Abroad Scheme Travel Policy, may provide assistance towards reasonable economic air or sea travel fares for patients, and a travelling companion where appropriate or where the referring consultant identifies a necessity.  The HSE Treatment Abroad Scheme National Travel Policy was implemented in November 2009 to standardise and provide equity to the provision of entitlements relating to travel expenses. Expenses other than air/sea fares are not admissible.  However, patients who experience difficulty funding any additional costs may apply to the Department of Social Protection for assistance as an exceptional needs payment.  It should be noted that, in general, patients do not incur subsistence costs when undergoing treatment abroad as such costs are included in the cost of the care that the patient is receiving.</p></reply>

That Bill will enable the intending parents who undertake donor assisted human reproduction to be assigned legal parentage and to obtain a birth certificate recording both of them as the child's parents.  They will be the parents of the child for all legal purposes.  In tandem with these provisions, the Bill will ban the use of anonymously donated gametes and will require notification of genetic parentage to the national donor-conceived person register.  The donor-conceived person will, on reaching the age of 18, be able to obtain information, including identifying information, about the donor.  These measures are intended to safeguard the right of the child to his or her identity including as to genetic origins.

Patients have the ability to apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public health care outside the state through model form E112.  The application requires the patient's Irish based public referring hospital consultant, following clinical assessment, to certify, among other things, that the treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs.  The treatment must not be available within the State or not available within a time normally necessary for obtaining it.  Once a patient is discharged from a specific episode of care abroad, their care immediately reverts to their Irish based consultant.</p>  <p>  Applications to TAS are processed and a determination given in accordance with the statutory framework prior to a patient travelling to avail of treatment. Each application is reviewed individually and a decision is made in accordance with the legislation and guidelines and on the basis of a review by clinical experts.  Each application is given a formal written decision and where a decision is one of decline, the reason for that decision is clearly outlined and the option of an appeal is afforded.  Previous approvals or declines are not used as an influencing factor on subsequent applications.  The appeals process is outlined in each decline letter without exception.  Where on appeal a decline decision is upheld, the appeal decision letter advises that the applicant can make a further appeal to the Office of the Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  There are no proposals to amend the application process as referred to by the Deputy. It should be noted that, in general, this scheme is one whereby a consultant refers a patient abroad for a specified treatment which is not available in Ireland.  The statutory framework stipulates the patient must be a public patient and is required to have followed public patient pathways.  GPs refer patients to consultants for acute care and it is the treating consultant who, having exhausted all treatment options including tertiary care within the country, refers the patient abroad under the terms of the TAS.  The consultant must specify the specific treatment and in making the referral accepts clinical responsibility in relation to the physician and facility abroad where the patient will attend.  Consultants may only refer patients within their area of specialty.  Therefore it would be inappropriate and contrary to both the criteria and spirit of the statutory framework for this pathway to be circumvented and could have implications for patient safety.</p></reply>

I therefore wrote last week to the President of the Board of NMBI asking that options be explored to bring a resolution to issues surrounding the annual retention fee.  I recognise that the Board must meet its obligations within the financial resources available.  At the same time this demands that obligations are met on the most economic basis possible and that all planned expenditure can be demonstrated as necessary.</p>  <p>  I have requested that the Board of NMBI re-engage in discussions with the staff associations, as a matter of urgency.  An outcome must be found which secures the Board&rsquo;s minimum financial operating requirements but avoids a scenario where nurses and midwives are removed from the Register for non-payment of fees with potential consequences for service availability.</p>  <p>  I will continue to monitor the situation closely in the interests of patient safety and continuity of care.  I have offered that both my officials and I are available to engage with the Board should that be of assistance.</p>  <p>  The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.</p>  <p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.</p></reply>

They are not political or ministerial decisions.</p>  <p>  The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Eculizumab in the GMS and community drugs schemes. Eculizumab or Soliris&reg; to give it its brand name is indicated for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria or PNH.</p>  <p>  The application is being considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines.  In accordance with those procedures the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Eculizumab.</p>  <p>  The Report of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics was published in October 2013. It concluded that at a total cost per patient per year of &euro;437,247 and a cumulative gross budget impact over 5 years estimated at &euro;33million, the therapy did not represent value for money for the treatment of patients in the Irish healthcare setting.</p>  <p>  In addition, the manufacturer did not include an economic model as part of their submission and failed to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of this therapy.  Consequently the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics was unable to recommend reimbursement of the product under the community drugs schemes.</p>  <p>  With regard to the 10 people that currently have access to this drug an interim agreement was put in place to fund these patients.  This was to allow the pharmaceutical company, Alexion Pharma to have developed additional evidence to enable the HSE to make a long-term decision in relation to the funding of this incredibly costly agent.</p>  <p>  Many countries have struggled to accept the price put forward by the pharmaceutical company.  The HSE has been engaging with Alexion Pharma for some time to arrive at a price that would assist it in its desire to fund this medicine for as many patients as possible, within agreed resources.  The HSE's engagement with the company has now been concluded and the Executive is considering the outcome of that engagement.  It is regrettable that to date the company has not been able to provide this drug at a more sustainable price to the HSE to reflect the clinical evidence.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that I fully understand the concerns of patients regarding the availability of this drug and every effort is being made to achieve a satisfactory outcome to this issue.  While I appreciate that some may take the view that the taxpayer should reimburse every licensed medicine for whatever the price the drug company demands, I hope it is appreciated that the better interests of the health service require that we only reimburse the most effective medicines and only at a fair price.</p></reply>

However, the Act provides that the Minister for Health may, under section 4(2), designate a health and social care profession not already designated if he or she considers that it is in the public interest to do so and if specified criteria have been met.<br/><br/>The previous Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, wrote to the Health and Social Care Professionals Council in May of last year advising it of his intention, in the public interest, to designate by regulation the profession or professions of counsellor and psychotherapist under the Act.  The Act provides that the Minister for Health is obliged to consult with the Council in the first instance concerning a proposed designation.  The Act also requires that interested persons, organisations and other bodies be given an opportunity to make representations to the Minister concerning a proposed designation.  The Council has been asked to advise on a number of issues concerning the proposed designation and has been requested to take into consideration the report of Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) on the academic standards necessary for the accreditation of courses in Counselling and Psychotherapy.  This is an essential element as it would inform, for the purpose of registration, the assessment by the registration board, when established, of the qualifications of those currently in practice.  <br/><br/>This is the first stage in the consultation process under the Act and the Minister hopes to receive the Council's report at an early date.  He will then proceed to the next stage which will involve a much wider consultation when he has fully considered the Council's report.  While a number of issues remain to be clarified including decisions on whether one or two professions are to be regulated, on the title or titles of the profession or professions, and on the minimum qualifications to be required of applicants for registration, the Minister hopes to be in a position to progress the question of regulating counsellors and psychotherapists this year.<br/><br/>I note the many excellent counselling services currently provided across the country by the both the HSE and voluntary sector.  Counselling is provided across the health service including primary care, social care and within mental health.  This type of service can be provided by a range of trained health professionals and delivered to meet a clinical need at either primary or secondary care level.<br/><br/>However, the provision of a quality counselling service across both primary and secondary care needs to be developed further, as resources permit.  The Government, in keeping with its commitment in the Programme for Government to increase access to counselling and psychotherapy, has provided funding totalling &euro;7.5 million to develop the Counselling in Primary Care (CIPC) service, which works closely with the HSE Mental Health Service, under whose aegis this funding is provided.  CIPC is one of a range of initiatives taken by the HSE to build the capacity of primary care to respond to mental health needs appropriate to primary care.  I was pleased to note that the HSE in its National Service Plan 2015 has committed to <i>&quot;Reviewing and improving access to psychotherapy and psychotherapeutic interventions in conjunction with the Primary Care Division&quot; </i>as a first step to further consolidate and direct counselling services generally.  <i></i><br/><br/>In relation to the specific question relating to Aspen, as this is a service issue this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 386 of 2006) the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is required to maintain the Asbestosis and Mesothelioma Register.  Operation of the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme is a matter for the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  From a health service perspective, asbestosis is a chronic (long-term) lung condition caused by prolonged exposure to asbestos and patients with this condition have access to the same range of diagnostic and treatment services provided in the public health system as other patients with chronic lung conditions. </p>  <p>  Patients with asbestosis have a higher risk of developing other serious conditions, such as lung cancer, mesothelioma and pleural disease.  Very severe cases of asbestosis can cause serious ill health and reduce life expectancy.  However, in many cases, the condition does not progress.  More people with asbestosis die as a result of one or more of the cancers mentioned above rather than from asbestosis itself.</p>  <p>  Treatment can significantly improve the quality of life of someone with asbestosis.  Treatment components include quitting smoking, vaccinations against potentially dangerous lung infections such as influenza and pneumococcus, drug therapies and oxygen therapy.</p></reply>

The Kilcock development will be delivered as part of the PPP PCC project and it is expected to be completed by early 2017.  The other locations are expected to be delivered in 2015/Q1 2016.  Please see the HSE NSP 2015 page 77.</p>  <p>  As regards the HSE's plans for other locations in Kildare and west Wicklow, the mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care infrastructure is dependent on a number of factors including staffing.  Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care infrastructure is subject to suitable locations being offered/provided/available, to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff.  In addition the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to sufficient financing.  Also there will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer through current and capital expenditure.  There is limited funding available for new projects over the next multi-annual period 2015-2019 given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.  The HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for infrastructure delivery in the most effective way possible to meet needs now and in the future.   </p>  <p>   Your question has been referred to the HSE to provide an update on plans for other Kildare/West Wicklow locations.

This report made a number of recommendations on both internal and national service issues, which will be addressed by the HSE in conjunction with Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin and the Children's Hospital Group.  The report included a recommendation that a Steering Group should be established to develop a National Genetic and Genomic Medicine Network that reflects best international practice.  The Steering Group will be established in February to develop a plan for the National Network, which is expected to take a number of months and which will, when complete, be submitted to the HSE for approval and consideration of resources in the context of the Estimates process. </p>  <p>  There has been no reduction in the scope of the services provided by the genetics service at Crumlin.  The hub-and-spoke model for genetic services is a well-established and recognised model of service delivery and there are no plans to change this approach.  The HSE considers the genetic counselling services as a networked service, with genetic counsellors working with families that need counselling and advice, working under the clinical governance of a consultant and linking into colleagues at Crumlin. </p>  <p>  As with all patient services the governance for service delivery rests with the organisation that provides the service - therefore if a patient attends OLCH Crumlin for genetic services, OLCH Crumlin is accountable and if the genetics service is provided by another hospital, that hospital is accountable for their service.</p></reply>

In addition to the main hospital, the project includes two satellite centres at the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals.  The paediatric clinical genetics service is included in the new children&rsquo;s hospital, and children and, if required, their families will be provided with care and treatment on their genetic conditions.  It is expected that adult patients, such as referrals from cancer or adult cardiology will access adult genetic services on the campus.  Laboratory genetics services, which support both adult and paediatric services, will be provided separately to the new children's hospital building and options for the provision of these services are being considered by the HSE.</p></reply>

However, the Act provides that the Minister for Health may, under section 4(2), designate a health and social care profession not already designated if he or she considers that it is in the public interest to do so and if specified criteria have been met.</p>  <p>  My predecessor, Minister James Reilly T.D, wrote to the The Health and Social Care Professionals Council in May of last year advising it of his intention, in the public interest, to designate by regulation the profession or professions of counsellor and psychotherapist under the Act.  The Act provides that the Minister for Health is obliged to consult with the Council in the first instance concerning a proposed designation.  The Act also requires that interested persons, organisations and other bodies be given an opportunity to make representations to the Minister concerning a proposed designation.  The Council has been asked to advise on a number of issues concerning the proposed designation and has been requested to take into consideration the report of Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) on the academic standards necessary for the accreditation of courses in Counselling and Psychotherapy.  This is an essential element as it would inform, for the purpose of registration, the assessment by the registration board, when established, of the qualifications of those currently in practice.  </p>  <p>  This is the first stage in the consultation process under the Act and I hope to receive the Council's report at an early date.  I will then proceed to the next stage which will involve a much wider consultation when I have fully considered the Council's report.  While a number of issues remain to be clarified including decisions on whether one or two professions are to be regulated, on the title or titles of the profession or professions, and on the minimum qualifications to be required of applicants for registration, I hope to be in a position to progress the question of regulating counsellors and psychotherapists this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-20a.1068.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015012000079#WRW03300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 492 and 507 together. <br/><br/>The conviction in the case of Raif Badawi and the nature of the penalty imposed on him is clearly a cause of concern.  There is also concern about the imprisonment of the prominent human rights activist Waleed Abu al-Khair, which may be connected with that of Mr. Badawi.<br/><br/>The case of Mr Badawi, and our concerns at his sentence have been raised by the European Union on behalf of its Member States, including Ireland, with the Saudi authorities, both when he was convicted and again now that punishment has commenced.  In addition, the spokesperson of EU High Representative Mogherini issued a statement on the case of Mr Badawi on 9 January.  This called on the Saudi authorities to suspend the flogging of Mr Badawi, a call which was echoed on 15 January by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra&rsquo;ad Al Hussein.  I hope that the Saudi Authorities will answer the High Commissioner&rsquo;s call for Mr Badawi to be pardoned and for this harsh form of punishment to be urgently reviewed.<br/><br/>In the meantime, I welcome the fact that the second session of punishment for Mr Badawi has been postponed.  I also welcome reports that his case has been referred to the Supreme Court by King Abdullah.  I hope this will presage a wider rethink of the case by the Saudi authorities.<br/><br/>In July 2014, the human rights activist Walid Abu al-Khair was sentenced to 15 years in prison, with five years of his sentence suspended.  Last week, the Court of Appeal reportedly reinstated this additional five years of imprisonment.  The imprisonment of persons for the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression and association is a matter of concern wherever it occurs. Concerns about this case have also been directly raised with the Saudi authorities by the EU on behalf of its member states.<br/><br/>Ireland normally raises human rights issues, including specific cases, in conjunction with our EU partners in Saudi Arabia, as we do in many other locations.  We carry more weight speaking as a unified group of 2<font color="#004080">8</font>countries.<br/><br/>Ireland has always been at the forefront internationally in raising human rights issues.  At the UN Human Rights Council Ireland has addressed human rights recommendations to Saudi Arabia during its review under the UN Universal Periodic Review procedure which took place in October 2013.  Ireland also works to promote an active dialogue on the part of the EU with all major partners, including the Gulf countries, on matters pertaining to human rights.  The Government&rsquo;s review of foreign policy, <i>The Global Island</i>, which was launched last week, underlines the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to promoting human rights.</p></reply>

The Council welcomed the broadly encouraging prospects while recognising that challenges remain.  The recent announcement by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer on Corporation Tax was also discussed. Both administrations reflected on their respective successes in attracting external investment while acknowledging that there is a key role to be played by indigenous companies in economic development.  The opportunities to work together on Joint Trade Missions and on developing new markets were also recognised.</p>  <p>  The Council noted that, following Ministerial consideration of a report on the feasibility of submitting a joint bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023, it had been agreed to support the IRFU&rsquo;s bid, and indeed the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, First Minister, deputy First Minister and other Ministers had attended the launch of the bid in Armagh just before the Plenary meeting.  The Council discussed the potential benefits hosting such an event would bring to both jurisdictions and agreed that the relevant Ministers should work closely together to ensure the strongest possible bid is submitted.   </p>  <p>  Ministers noted that the new draft PEACE and INTERREG Programmes are currently with the European Commission for consideration and it is hoped that the final Programmes will be launched in Spring 2015.</p>  <p>  The Council welcomed the ongoing discussions between Ministers at NSMC meetings on the potential for collaboration to draw down EU funds and noted that there is active engagement between both jurisdictions on the opportunities available.  The Council looked forward to a further progress report at its next meeting.</p>  <p>  Ministers also noted the position on Sectoral Priorities and the North West Gateway Initiative and agreed to keep these matters on its agenda.  They also discussed the Progress Report prepared by the NSMC Joint Secretaries on the work of the North South Bodies and in the other NSMC areas for co-operation and noted the current position on a North South Consultative Forum.</p>  <p>  There was an in-depth discussion on Child Protection issues with a particular focus on e-Safety, and the good collaborative work already taking place, both within the NSMC structures and elsewhere was noted.  Ministers recognised that issues such as these are cross-cutting and cross-jurisdictional and will require an ongoing collaborative approach between both administrations.  The Council agreed that Ministers who have a remit in Child Protection and E-Safety related activities should engage with their counterparts in the opposite jurisdiction to explore whether there is potential for further collaboration.  It was also agreed that this topic should be revisited at a future meeting. </p>  <p>  The next plenary meeting of the NSMC is scheduled to take place in early summer 2015, and I am looking forward to continuing to work closely and constructively on all of these issues with our Northern colleagues in the North South Ministerial Council. </p>  <p>  Strand Two of the Good Friday Agreement provided for the establishment of the North/South Ministerial Council and the North/South Implementation Bodies. It also provided that consideration be given to a North/South Consultative Forum and a North/South Parliamentary Forum.  The St Andrews Agreement provided further that the Northern Ireland Executive would support the establishment of an independent North/South Consultative Forum.  </p>  <p>  With the establishment in 2012 of the North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association, which is in effect the North/South Parliamentary Forum envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement, the only Strand Two institution that remains outstanding is the North/South Consultative Forum.  The Government continues to support the establishment of the Consultative Forum, and the Taoiseach has raised the Forum at each Plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council he has attended including the most recent meeting on 5 December. </p>  <p>  The other outstanding issues from the Good Friday Agreement and the recommendations from the Haass talks were not discussed at the NSMC Plenary meeting as they are not Strand Two issues and are therefore not among the matters discussed at NSMC meetings.  However, key outstanding matters from the Good Friday and St Andrews Agreement were discussed in the recent Stormont House talks. </p>  <p>  During the course of the talks, the Government advanced the view that a Bill of Rights could set out precisely and formally the rights upon which a shared society for Northern Ireland could be based. Sufficient consensus between the Northern Ireland Executive Parties did not exist to take this forward within the context of the Stormont House Agreement. However, the final Agreement provided that the parties commit to serving the people of Northern Ireland equally, and to act in accordance with the obligations on government to promote equality and respect and to prevent discrimination; to promote a culture of tolerance, mutual respect and mutual understanding at every level of society, including initiatives to facilitate and encourage shared and integrated education and housing, social inclusion, and in particular community development and the advancement of women in public life; and to promote the interests of the whole community towards the goals of reconciliation and economic renewal.</p>  <p>  It is a matter of regret that agreement could not be reached on an Irish Language Act as part of the Stormont House Agreement.  While the St. Andrews Agreement did provide a commitment to introduce an Irish Language Act, the British Government made it clear during the recent talks that, as language matters were now devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, it would not legislate at Westminster for such an Act. It was equally clear that the necessary consensus among the parties for such legislation in the Northern Ireland Assembly was not forthcoming. Nevertheless, the Stormont House Agreement does contain an important and formal recognition by the British and Irish Government of the need for respect for, and recognition of, the Irish language in Northern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  In regard to the commitment in the Good Friday Agreement to establish a Civic Forum in Northern Ireland, I welcome that the Stormont House Agreement provides for the establishment of a civic advisory panel to meet regularly on key social, cultural and economic issues and to advise the Northern Ireland Executive.  </p>  <p>  The Government will continue its efforts to ensure that the full potential of the Agreements is realised towards achieving effective partnership government, genuine reconciliation between divided communities and economic prosperity for all in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

However, I can make the following general points.  All passport applications received are subject to the provisions of the Passports Act, 2008.  One of its key provisions is the requirement for applicants to demonstrate their entitlement to Irish citizenship through the submission of documentary evidence with passport application forms.  The exact format of the documentary evidence required is detailed in the information notes which accompany all application forms.  Staff are trained to process applications of the type referred to by the Deputy and deal with such cases, without difficulty, on a daily basis.<br/><br/>However, in the absence of specific details of this case, it is not possible to comment further on the matter.  I would suggest that the Deputy and/or the parents, contact Mr. Kevin Walzer at the Passport Officer in Balbriggan.  He can arrange a full examination of the child&rsquo;s application to see if passport entitlement exists under the Act.  His email address and telephone number are and 01.673.3215.</p></reply>

While a small number of these staff remain in schools, the schemes are being phased out and have been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme. The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive capitation grant assistance to provide for secretarial services. Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs and the Department does not stipulate how secretarial services are to be obtained. Where a school uses the grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools. My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, a forum was established under the Towards 2016 Agreement involving my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, IMPACT and SIPTU to examine the factual position in schools regarding the terms and conditions of employment of secretaries (and caretakers) employed using grant funding. However, it was not possible to progress the forum's agenda beyond the initial fact finding survey, due to the State's budgetary and financial position. It was agreed that the forum would consider appropriate measures in relation to the rates of pay of school secretaries and caretakers in the event that a review of the Public Service Agreements recommended changes to the benefit of those public servants earning &euro;35,000 or less per annum. This is currently the priority for the Forum and discussions are ongoing.</p>  <p>  Secretaries employed by schools using grant funding are not regarded as public servants except for the purposes of the pay reduction under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No.2) Act 2009, due to the definition of "public servant" used in that Act. The fact that such staff come within the definition of "public servant" solely for the purposes of the Act does not alter their employment status in any other respect.</p></reply>

Where children have significant care needs to the extent that they need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.</p>  <p>  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  All schools were asked to apply to the NCSE for SNA support for the 2014/15 school year by 26 March 2014. The NCSE published details of their allocations for SNA support for the 2014/15 school year in June 2014. The NCSE completed a second round allocations for SNA provision for the 2014/15 school year in October 2014, details of which are available on the NCSE website, www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  Details of the SNA allocations which have been made to each school is available on the NCSE website.</p>  <p>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p>  <p>  Should a school wish to make an application for additional SNA support for a child who was not previously considered for SNA support, or who is due to enrol to a school, they may do so to the NCSE. Schools who wish to appeal the level of SNA allocation which has been made to them may do so via the appeals process which is set out at www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

To ensure that this is achieved, the delivery of major school projects to meet significant demographic demand nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years. In view, therefore, of the need to prioritise available funding for the provision of essential school accommodation to meet this demand, it is not possible for me to advance with a new summer works programme in 2015.</p>  <p>  Over 1,600 applications were received under the 2014 Summer Works Scheme. In total, the spending of more than &euro;70 million on the 2014 Summer Works Scheme has been approved to allow over 770 schools undertake improvement works. In that regard, I wish to advise the Deputies that provision has been made in the 2015 allocation, on foot of the budget, for the carryover costs of such improvement works approved in 2014.</p>  <p>  Commensurate with the level of funding set aside for the Scheme, applications were assessed on a top down basis in accordance with the prioritisation criteria outlined in the Circular accompanying the Scheme. Unfortunately, due to the scale of demand for funding under the Scheme, it was not possible to grant aid all applications. However, in accordance with the Scheme's Circular, these applications will be retained and will be prioritised for consideration under further rounds of the Summer Works Scheme in the future, subject to availability of funding. </p></reply>

It is schools that employ teachers and not my Department.  However my Department has issued a number of Circulars addressing this issue in recent years.<br/><br/>  Under these Circulars School Principals must maintain a list of unemployed registered teachers who are available for substitute work at short notice and report to the Board of Management on any exceptional occasion where they have to engage a registered teacher who is retired.  Circular 31/2011 details a cascade of measures for the recruitment of teachers, prioritising registered teachers over retired registered teachers and unregistered people.<br/><br/>  A retired teacher who returns to teaching on or after 1 February 2012 will commence at the first point of the incremental salary scale (i.e. the lowest point or starting salary for teachers).  Incremental credit for service prior to 1 February 2012, qualification allowances and certain job role allowances are also not payable.  This measure represents a significant financial disincentive for teachers who retired at the top of their salary scale, often with a post of responsibility allowance, to return to teaching.</p></reply>

The initiative for any amalgamation may come from a variety of sources, such as parents, staff, Board of Management and patron(s).  Any such proposal to amalgamate schools must first involve consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders. Following the consultation process, a decision taken at local level will follow. In that regard, any proposed changes must be well planned and managed in a manner that accommodates the interests of students, parents, teachers, local communities and contributes to an inclusive education system. <br/><br/>  Following a process of consultation, the Patron and the school boards concerned in light of the critical demographic position for both schools, have proposed the amalgamation of the schools concerned from September 2016.  The Patron and the respective schools envisage that the new amalgamated school will cater for over five hundred girls and will allow for a broader curriculum and new programme options.  In response, the Department has advised the Patron that it does not have an objection in principle to the proposed amalgamation and the Patron is continuing to engage with the Department in this regard.</p></reply>

This position is reflected in the centrally-devised Primary School Curriculum (1999) which articulates a progressive and developmental learning experience for our pupils.  General guidance and advice for teachers are provided in National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) curriculum documents, and assessment guidelines etc. that are applicable to all primary schools. <br/><br/>  The Primary School Curriculum (1999), which is child-centred rather than subject-centred, also allows for flexibility in timetabling and teaching methods.  It emphasises that children should experience learning through a variety of classroom organisational approaches.  While these include individual learning and whole-class teaching, the curriculum particularly encourages collaborative learning through pair work and group work as appropriate to the specific learning contexts and goals.  Within multi-grade classes, teachers may use a range of models for grouping pupils, including mixed-ability grouping. Integration and differentiation are also key approaches in the primary curriculum.  The organisation of teaching and learning through integrated themes can be highly motivating and satisfying for children and are particularly useful in multi-class situations.</p></reply>

Where children have significant care needs to the extent that they need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.<br/><br/>  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.<br/><br/>  All schools were asked to apply to the NCSE for SNA support for the 2014/15 school year by 26 March 2014.  The NCSE published details of their allocations for SNA support for the 2014/15 school year in June 2014.  The NCSE completed a second round allocations for SNA provision for the 2014/15 school year in October 2014, details of which are available on the NCSE website, www.ncse.ie. <br/><br/>  Details of the SNA allocations which have been made to each school is available on the NCSE website.<br/><br/>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <br/><br/>  Should a school wish to make an application for additional SNA support for a child who was not previously considered for SNA support, or who is due to enrol to a school, they may do so to the NCSE.  Schools who wish to appeal the level of SNA allocation which has been made to them may do so via the appeals process which is set out at www.ncse.ie. <br/><br/>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<br/><br/>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual student for intensive intervention or assessment.  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more students indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. <br/><br/>  If the parents of the child, the subject of this question, have specific concerns about her educational progress I would advise in the first instance that they speak to the Principal of the school with a view to raising these concerns with the assigned NEPS psychologist.</p></reply>

As part of this, certain allowances were withdrawn for new beneficiary teachers, including qualification allowances. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.<br/><br/>  Under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013 &ndash; 2016 (Haddington Road Agreement), revised pay scales for post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 entrants to teaching were agreed and implemented with effect from 1 July 2013.<br/><br/>  The Haddington Road Agreement further provided that the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date would be addressed. In that regard, my Department implemented a further revised incremental salary scale for teachers who entered teaching between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 with effect from 1 November 2013. Allowances payable to post-1 January 2011 entrants and such allowances as remain payable to post-1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels as part of this measure.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-20a.1232.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015012000083#WRAA01300"><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Government recently committed, as part of the budget announcements made last year, to provide for 365 new Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts to support children with special educational needs in schools in 2015, bringing the total number of SNAs available for allocation in 2015 to 11,330 posts. <br/><br/>  This is the highest level of SNA allocation that we have ever had, and will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.<br/><br/>  I also wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school. Where children have significant care needs to the extent that they need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.<br/><br/>  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.<br/><br/>  All schools were asked to apply to the NCSE for SNA support for the 2014/15 school year by 26 March 2014. The NCSE published details of their allocations for SNA support for the 2014/15 school year in June 2014. The NCSE completed a second round allocations for SNA provision for the 2014/15 school year in October 2014, details of which are available on the NCSE website, www.ncse.ie. <br/><br/>  Details of the SNA allocations which have been made to each school is available on the NCSE website.<br/><br/>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <br/><br/>Should a school wish to make an application for additional SNA support for a child who was not previously considered for SNA support, or who is due to enrol to a school, they may do so to the NCSE. Schools who wish to appeal the level of SNA allocation which has been made to them may do so via the appeals process which is set out at www.ncse.ie. <br/><br/>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<br/><br/>  As the Deputy's question relates to the consideration of an the SNA allocation by the NCSE to an individual, I have referred this question to the NCSE for their consideration and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is the intention of Government that, in delivering on the mandate to bring improved coherence to local and community development, LCDCs actively pursue involvement in these programmes.</p>  <p>  While the Local Government Act 2001 does not explicitly oblige LCDCs to submit an expression of interest or to prepare a local development strategy under the LEADER programme, a decision by an LCDC not to do so would be contrary to their intended role.  The Act does oblige them to have regard to Government policies and objectives in the performance of their functions. Accordingly, as it unquestionably remains Government policy that each LCDC will apply under the new LEADER programme, they are required to do so.</p>  <p>  The regulatory framework for the LEADER elements of the RDP requires an open and transparent selection process to ensure that the strategies and local action groups chosen are best placed to maximise the impact of the LEADER funding in each area. Strategies chosen will have undergone a rigorous independent selection process and will be selected based on open and transparent criteria. It is possible therefore that, in some cases, current Local Action Groups may not be chosen to deliver the LEADER elements of the RDP.</p>  <p>  I recognise the benefits to the new programme for local development companies, and other community groups, to be active partners in the development and implementation of LEADER strategies.  I will continue to encourage discussions at local level with a view to encouraging LCDCs, Local Development Companies and other interested entities in agreeing a single, coherent approach in each area.  Where agreement is reached, and the LCDC is successful in the LEADER strategy selection process and is the designated local action group for their area, I would envisage that the existing local development companies will be key implementers of LEADER strategies.</p>  <p>  While it is the Government&rsquo;s preference for a single, coherent LEADER strategy in each designated area, my Department will fully adhere to EU regulatory requirements and manage a fully open and transparent selection process that does not preclude the emergence, or funding, of multiple LEADER strategies in a single area.</p></reply>

Local authorities were requested to submit proposals for the implementation of the new library structures and the other provisions arising.  The initiative is the outcome of a considered and thorough review of the library service and in-depth consultation with stakeholders, which established the need for scale in the management of a modern library service.  The increased capacity resulting from the new structures will increase the scope for developing and enhancing services to the public, providing a broader range of services to the same high standard across the country. </p>  <p>  This initiative has been carefully planned to maintain the local library service branding and identity.

When taking an estate in charge under the terms of this provision, a planning authority must take in charge, among other things, any, sewers, water mains or drains within the attendant grounds of the development.  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides for the transfer of responsibility for the provision of public water services from local authorities to Irish Water.  In addition, it provides a mechanism whereby water services infrastructure taken in charge by local authorities pursuant to section 180 of the Act of 2000 will be subsequently transferred by Ministerial Order to Irish Water.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where a housing estate, and its associated water services infrastructure, has not yet been taken in charge by the relevant local authority, and therefore not yet transferred to Irish Water by way of Ministerial Order, the responsibility for the provision of water services remains with the developer of the estate.  This responsibility has not changed in recent months.</p>  <p>  My Department, following consultation with Irish Water and local authorities, issued a guidance circular to local authorities on 5 November 2014 clarifying the procedures to be followed by local authorities in relation to the taking in charge of existing residential estates that are connected to public water supply and/or wastewater collection systems followed by the transfer, or otherwise, of water services infrastructural assets in agreement with Irish Water.  This advice is intended to facilitate and expedite the taking in charge of housing estates by local authorities and the subsequent transfer of the water services infrastructure and, consequently, the responsibility for the maintenance of water services, to Irish Water.</p>  <p>  This matter will be kept under review by my Department and further guidance will be issued if required.</p></reply>

A number of actions arising from the Summit were considered at the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform on 8 December and were then formalised into an <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness</i>which was noted by the Government at its meeting on 9 December 2014.  A copy of this action plan is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .  Progress in implementing this plan is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.<br/><br/>The action plan focuses on the Dublin region because the issue of homelessness is most acute in this region.  However, there are a number of actions in the plan which address homelessness in other regions including the other major urban centres such as Galway City.  I understand that there is sufficient emergency bed capacity in Galway so that there is no reason for anyone to sleep rough due to lack of accommodation.<br/><br/>Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities and the purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.  Additional funding for homeless services across the country in 2015 will ensure continued progress toward the achievement of the Government's target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  My Department is currently considering the appropriate allocation of the 2015 homelessness budget so as to ensure that Section 10 homelessness funding contributes to meeting the needs in the various regions.</p></reply>

Accommodation provided under the Rental Accomodation Scheme (RAS) is governed by the terms of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended.  The Act provides the main regulatory framework for the private rented residential sector and provides for security of tenure.  The grounds upon which a tenancy in the private rented residential sector may be legally terminated are clearly set out in the 2004 Act.  It also specifies minimum obligations for both landlords and tenants under a tenancy.<br/><br/>In accordance with the terms of the Scheme local authorities retain the responsibility to source further accommodation for a household accommodated under RAS should the dwelling that the household is living in become unavailable through no fault of their own.  It is a matter for local authorities to make every effort to secure suitable alternative accommodation for any household in RAS in the circumstances outlined as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>In light of the well documented pressures on the rental market in certain locations it is not always straightforward to source new RAS properties.  In all cases, not just where a tenancy is under threat, there is no bar on RAS households from sourcing alternative accommodation themselves, if they so desire, independent of the local authority.  Once the local authority is satisfied that the accommodation meets the needs of the household and conforms to standards for rental accommodation which are set out in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 the property can be brought into the RAS Scheme.<br/><br/>The supply of social housing is a key priority for the Government. The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>, which I published in November 2014, sets out clear, measureable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list.<br/><br/>The Strategy provides for a total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and aims to meet the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, consequently addressing the needs of the 90,000 households currently on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.  Implementing the Strategy will require a considerable and co-ordinated effort from key stakeholders.  The detailed governance structure, including dedicated work streams, will ensure the actions in the Strategy are overseen and delivered.

LCDP is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State.  The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281 million over that period.  It is being implemented on a transitional basis until March 2015, pending the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in April 2015.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of the services to clients, SICAP is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently underway.  The closing date for receipt of tenders under stage two was noon on 19 December 2014.  The tenders received are currently being evaluated and tenderers will be informed of the outcome by mid February. Contracts for SICAP will be determined following the outcome of the procurement process.</p>  <p>  The procurement process for SICAP was open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme.  In Stage one, joint applications were encouraged and organisations of varying sizes (for example smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations) were invited to submit joint applications.</p>  <p>  Consistent with the transitional arrangements to extend the LCDP until the roll out of SICAP in April 2015 and to ensure business continuity, interim LCDP funding will be provided to the Cherry Orchard Equine, Education and Training Centre up to end March 2015, pending the outcome of the SICAP competitive process.  As Stage two of the process (Invitation to Tender) is currently underway, I am not in a position to meet with the group concerned at this time.</p>  <p>  My Department appreciates the importance of the work of the Cherry Orchard Equine, Education and Training Centre.  Nevertheless, the issues involved are broader than just those relating to SICAP.  However, it is my Department&rsquo;s intention to examine the position with regards to a number of groups, including the Cherry Orchard Equine, Education and Training Centre, in the near future and my Department will be in contact with the group in that regard.</p></reply>

That said, I understand that some small groups, such as the groups under the remit of the National Collective of Community Based Networks (NCCWN) and the National Traveller Partnership (NTP), faced a number of challenges in competing in the Stage one process.  The results of Stage one were released on 24 September 2014 and I can confirm that none of the NCCWN groups expressed an interest either as lead applicants or as part of a consortium.  I am now considering the implications of that for NCCWN and my Department is liaising with other relevant Departments to find a workable solution.  My Department will be arranging a meeting with the NCCWN shortly.<br/><br/>With regard to NTP, the majority of its affiliated groups did express an interest at stage one, as part of consortia.  The outcome of the SICAP procurement process will be known next month.<br/><br/>Separate to, and outside of SICAP, discussions with the Department of Justice and Equality are nearing conclusion to design a Traveller support scheme based on, <i>inter alia</i>, Traveller Inter Agency projects and supports.<br/><br/>I can confirm that interim LCDP funding, based on a small budgetary reduction in the order of 6.5%, on 2014 levels, will be provided to NCCWN and NTP up to end March 2015.</p></reply>

The 2004 Act represented the most significant legislative reform in the private rented sector in over a century.  Prior to this there was little or no security of tenure for tenants and in most tenancies the landlord had a virtually absolute right to terminate the tenancy subject to only 28 days' notice.<br/><br/>Security of tenure under the 2004 Act is based on rolling four-year tenancy cycles.  Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period.  This is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy.  Landlords and tenants may not contract out of any of the provisions of Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act and no lease, tenancy agreement, contract or other agreement may operate to vary or modify the provisions of Part 4 of the Act.<br/><br/>Where a Part 4 tenancy lasts for four years without a notice of termination being served by the landlord or the tenant, a further Part 4 tenancy comes into being and this will continue on at the expiration of each further four year period unless the tenancy is validly terminated by either the landlord or the tenant on one of the grounds under the Act.<br/><br/>A landlord may not serve a notice of termination except in very clearly defined circumstances such as a failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations in relation to the tenancy.  Notice periods for the termination of a tenancy by the landlord vary depending on the duration of the tenancy but periods of up to 112 days are provided for under the Act.  Where there is a dispute regarding the appropriate period of notice to be given in respect of a tenancy or the validity of a notice of termination, or where the tenant does not comply with the notice of termination, the dispute may be referred to the Private Residential Tenancies Board for resolution.<br/><br/>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012 is currently before the Oireachtas and will amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for repeal of section 42 of the 2004 Act which allows a landlord to terminate a further Part 4 tenancy within the first six months of that tenancy for no stated ground.  The Bill has passed all stages in the D&aacute;il, together with Second Stage in the Seanad.</p></reply>

The 2004 Act provides that rents may not be greater than the open market rate and may only be reviewed upward or downward once a year, unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation that warrants a review.  In the third quarter of 2014, rents were 5.6% higher nationally than in the same quarter of 2013, according to the most recent rent index from the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).  Rents for houses were 4.3% higher while apartment rents were 7.3% higher than in the same quarter of 2013.  In Dublin, which is seeing the highest rates of increase nationally, overall rents were higher by 9.5%.<br/><br/>A recent poll for the PRTB found that only 64% of tenants were aware of their rights under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  Tenants must be given 28 days&rsquo; notice of new rent and can make an application for dispute resolution to the PRTB where they feel the rent increase is in excess of the market rent.  These provisions have effect notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in a lease or tenancy agreement.<br/><br/>The PRTB is developing a new communications strategy, which will include increasing awareness of existing rights and obligations under the legislation.  The first element in the strategy, a &lsquo;do you know&rsquo; campaign, commences in the national press this week.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the main cause of rising rents is a lack of supply in the market and the recently published <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>sets out clear, measureable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list.  In addition, the implementation of the range of actions under the Government&rsquo;s <i>Construction 2020</i>Strategy will support increased supply in the wider housing market.</p></reply>

As matters stand, the Board has received in the order of 627 completed applications across 26 developments containing multiple applications plus 47 single site applications and these are currently being processed.

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.<br/><br/>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades.  Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br/><br/>On the 24 November last, a public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 was launched.  This consultation will end on the 12th February, 2015.  The map can be accessed at<i></i>.  The areas on the map marked Blue will all have access to high speed broadband services of at least 30 Mbps from the commercial sector by end of 2016.  The areas marked Amber will require the intervention of the State and include almost all of the target villages identified in April 2014.  At least one operator has since extended its roll out programmes and committed to providing high speed broadband in a small number of these communities.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30 Mbps will be delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.<br/><br/>In tandem with the mapping consultation, intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy.  The strategy will address a range of issues in relation to the intervention including the optimum procurement model, ownership model for the infrastructure, intervention cost and likely market impact.  My Department is finalising the appointment of external advisors to provide legal, economic, technical and financial advice on the various aspects of the Plan over the next two years.  The next steps in this process will see a further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy in mid-2015.  The Intervention strategy will be notified to the European Commission for State Aid clearance.<br/><br/>Following the public consultation, towards the end of this year a detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. The Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible.  It is expected that the physical build of this network will commence from 2016.<br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government.  It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

An Post pays the Department all TV licence revenues collected from sales and the Department of Social Protection pays an agreed sum in respect of 'free' TV licences issued by that Department. This sum is currently set at &euro;52 million per annum.  From these gross receipts, the Department pays An Post commission in respect of the TV licence activities An Post undertakes in its role as the Minister&rsquo;s collection agent.  In addition, 7% of the total revenue net of An Post&rsquo;s commission is paid to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland for the operation of the Broadcasting Funding Scheme, which provides funding in support of high quality programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience, and programmes to improve adult literacy.  Revenue from this fund can be applied for by independent producers and broadcasters for specific projects of a public service nature.

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided. The proposed State intervention under the National Broadband Plan aims to conclusively address Ireland's connectivity challenges, delivering high quality broadband to those parts of rural Ireland that would not otherwise be served by the commercial sector, and ensuring that any network that is built is capable of scaling up to meet both current and future demand.  This is a complex intervention that will determine the quality, choice and cost of services in rural areas not just in the next five years, but also for decades to come.  Over 700,000 premises are currently in the proposed intervention area and these premises cover 100,000 km of road network.<br/><br/>Detailed public consultation is a key feature of the proposed intervention strategy under the National Broadband Plan.  In June 2014, my Department launched a Call for Inputs in relation to technical and other aspects of the proposed strategy.  This in turn provided critical information that informed the development of the national high speed broadband map which I published in November.<br/><br/>The publication of the national high-speed broadband map represented a major milestone on the project. The detailed map (which can be viewed on both a national and county level) is publicly available and there is an ongoing facility for stakeholders and members of the public to comment or make submissions. The BLUE areas on the map are based on information provided by commercial network operators. They show where commercial operators have committed to providing high speed services by end 2016. Members of the public can review their area or house on the map and provide feedback, particularly if they have information to suggest they will not have commercial high speed broadband by 2016 for whatever reason particular to their home or business.<br/><br/>In tandem with the publication of the map I also published a detailed consultation paper on the mapping process and this remains open to industry and the public to comment on until the 12th February. Submissions made in respect of this paper will feed in to the on-going work on developing a comprehensive intervention strategy which is scheduled to be completed this summer.<br/><br/>Once approved by Government, the intervention strategy will also be published and will be the subject of further public consultation prior to being finalised.  I hope to be then able to move to the formal procurement stage towards the end of this year.  The selection criteria that will be used to select the preferred bidder/s will include an assessment of the efficiency and speed of delivery.  I am keen to see the implementation begin as quickly as possible and completed at the earliest opportunity.  I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having the final homes and businesses connected within a 5 year period.<br/><br/>Given the scale and importance of the intervention, extensive public consultation is necessary and appropriate.  Members of the public and stakeholders can contribute to the latest consultation which is available on the Department's mapping site<i></i>.</p></reply>

It is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers.  The PSO levy is vital to enable Ireland to meet its 2020 40% target for electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020, which in turn is important for the achievement of Ireland's 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception.  The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002).  The annual PSO levy amount for 2014/2015 is &euro;335.4 million.  This equates to &euro;64.37 per annum for residential customers, &euro;221.66 per annum for small to medium sized business customers and &euro;34.20/kVA for medium and large customers.</p>  <p>  The biggest driver for the levy rise for this year is the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price, which is estimated to be around 10% lower than last year.  This results in lower predicted market income for the PSO plants and, therefore, a higher levy is required to cover their allowed costs.  The lower wholesale electricity price is currently being driven by lower international gas prices in evidence since Mid-2013.  This pushes up the proposed PSO levy.  However, if these lower gas and wholesale prices are sustained, it will reduce the wholesale cost of electricity that suppliers pay.  In turn, suppliers should be in a position to reduce their retail prices and potentially offset the PSO levy increase.  I note increased competition in the retail electricity sector recently which should help offset some of this increase.  The CER is tasked with retail market monitoring and executes this role vigorously to ensure competition leads to the fairest prices for customers.</p></reply>

The Takeover Panel Rules in relation to communications apply to all parties during an offer period, including the Government as a shareholder, and all parties must apply the highest standards of care to any statements made on the matter.</p>  <p>  The State has a significant but, nonetheless, a minority shareholding in Aer Lingus &ndash; with just over 25% of the shares. In 2012, the Government included this shareholding among the assets to be sold under the State Asset Disposal programme, but agreed that the stake would only be sold when market conditions were favourable and if acceptable terms and an acceptable price could be secured.</p>  <p>  Currently, no formal offer has been made to Aer Lingus' shareholders.  If an offer is made it will, of course, be given very careful examination before the Government takes any decision in relation to its shareholding. In late 2012, following a third hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus, the Government indicated that it would not be prepared to sell the shareholding in circumstances which could significantly impact on competition and connectivity in the Irish market.  Such considerations would also be foremost in our minds if a further offer is made for the company.</p></reply>

I am also very aware of, and concerned about, the continuing decline in passenger numbers at the airport.  It was because of this decline that the Cork Airport Development Council (CADC) was established under an initiative of my predecessor, with the intention of bringing key local stakeholders together to foster a common understanding of issues of concern, identify potential opportunities for growth and to address the operating performance of the airport.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, following the restructuring of the State airports under the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014, Cork Airport was provided with a new management structure aimed at putting the airport on a sound footing to manage and develop its business on a competitive, commercially driven basis.  That structure is now bedded down and the airport, the DAA and the CADC are focussing their efforts on identifying new route markets and developing new services.</p>  <p>  I believe that there are opportunities, particularly in the tourism sector, to grow incoming passenger numbers in the Cork region.  I am aware that DAA has attractive incentive programmes available that encourage the introduction of new routes and services.  In addition, I understand from Tourism Ireland that there are opportunities under its cooperative marketing initiative to encourage the introduction of new services.  Ultimately, however, creating new services and growing inbound tourism depends on the availability of competitive access and ensuring that potential visitors have a reason to visit. Cork Airport, the DAA and the CADC, along with the regional stakeholders, should be pursuing every opportunity to highlight the tourism product that is available in its catchment area.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the DAA and Cork Airport management, working with the stakeholders in the region can together consolidate its product, identify new opportunities and return growth to the airport.</p></reply>

The comparable figure for 2013 is &euro;3.3 billion;<br/><br/>- employment in tourism will reach 250,000 (approximately 200,000 at present); and<br/><br/>- there will be ten million overseas visits to Ireland annually by 2025 (compared to an estimated 7.3 million in 2014).<br/><br/>The Tourism Policy Statement sets out key policy objectives under a range of headings, including a central role in tourism for Local Authorities and communities, which will enable areas like Longford and Westmeath to achieve their full tourism potential.<br/><br/>A series of Tourism Action Plans, the first of which will cover the period 2015-2018, will be prepared to set out specific actions that will be required to achieve the policy objectives and headline goals.<br/><br/>Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, operational responsibility for development of tourism in individual regions is a matter for the Board and management of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.

If the person does not pay within 28 days, a further notice is sent informing them that they may pay the charge plus 50% within a further 28 days.  If no payment is made at that point, court proceedings are begun.</p>  <p>  Under the third payment option, an individual will receive, with their court summons, a fixed charge notice allowing them to pay up to seven days before the court hearing.  This system was legislated for in the Road Traffic Act 2010, and I am moving to bring it in.  One of the advantages of the system will be that people will not be able to claim in court that they did not receive a fixed charge notice, given that the third notice will have come with the summons to court.</p>  <p>  Following the receipt of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sanction, work on the implementation of the third payment option project has been ongoing.  It is my understanding that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service will continue to work on the project over the coming months with a view to having the necessary arrangements in place as soon as possible next year.</p></reply>

The slots are not 'owned' as such by the airlines. However, at congested airports, such as Heathrow, a secondary market has developed that has allowed airlines trade slots to meet their changing business needs.</p>  <p>  The allocation of slots at congested airports in the EU is governed by EU Regulation.  Aer Lingus has access to a significant portfolio of slots at London Heathrow on the basis of so-called 'grandfather rights'.  The airline has these rights because it has been operating services to Heathrow for many decades. As long as Aer Lingus continues to use these slots, the airline has the right to retain them from season to season.</p>  <p>  At the time of the Aer Lingus IPO in 2006 a specific mechanism was built into the company's Memorandum and Articles of Association whereby any proposed disposal of Heathrow slots, over which the airline had rights at the time of listing on the stock exchange, may be subject to a requirement for a resolution approved by shareholders voting at an extraordinary general meeting.  Where a resolution by shareholders is called for, the voting threshold to prevent a disposal of Heathrow slots proposed by the Company is such that the percentage vote against disposal at the EGM must be greater than the percentage of the Company&rsquo;s shares held by the Minister for Finance plus 5% (or 25% if greater).  This mechanism still applies today.</p>  <p>  The ability of the State's shareholding to block a disposal of slots is not guaranteed under this mechanism, as the support of at least another 5% of shareholders is required.  Furthermore this mechanism relates only to a disposal - the company does not require any shareholder approval to change the routes for which it uses the slots.</p></reply>

The majority of exemptions issued in recent years are in respect of the unloaded personal weapons of troops travelling on civil aircraft that are refuelling at Irish airports.  In common with most other jurisdictions and in accordance with the Chicago Convention, civil aircraft making technical stops (such as a refuelling stop) at Irish airports do not require authorisation. <br/><br/>My Department received 606 applications for such exemptions in 2014.  Most of these relate to foreign civil aircraft landing in Ireland or passing through Irish airspace.  However, a small number relate to Irish registered aircraft operating in Ireland or overseas.  Of these 606, 584 permits were issued, three were withdrawn and 19 were refused.  The refusals were on the basis of the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. <br/><br/>Requests came from airlines from the USA, Poland, Ireland, Turkey, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Russia, Netherlands and Spain.The vast majority of the requests came the USA.</p></reply>

The responsibility for the licensing of public bus passenger services was transferred under Statutory Instrument No. 566 of 2010 from my Department to the NTA with effect from 1st December 2010.     </p>  <p>  The NTA published, in November 2010, new Guidelines for the licensing of public bus services which set out the basis for a reformed licensing system for commercial bus passenger services in the State.  The Guidelines identify commercial bus passenger services as a key part of public transport services in the State.  These Guidelines are available on the NTA&rsquo;s website and include details of the objectives and factors taken into account in considering an application for a licence.  As the NTA has indicated, these are commercial services and it is open to the operator of such services to withdraw or curtail services.  </p>  <p>  The NTA is also responsible for those public transport services which comprise the Public Service Obligation (PSO) network.  While PSO funding in 2015 has been maintained at the same level as in 2014, I understand that the NTA has indicated that funding would not be available in respect of the services referred to by the Deputy.  However, I understand the NTA will consider services to the towns now bypassed by the M9 in the context of tendering for the provision of services funded by the Rural Transport Programme (RTP). </p>  <p>  I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA and asked it to respond to the Deputy when it has completed its consideration of inclusion of the areas referred to in the tendering for RTP.</p></reply>

These approaches can include objective historical descriptions, as well as the broader, collective memory of community.</p>  <p>  Depending on their level of interest, such remembrances are dealt with in different ways and levels.  Through the limited resources available, efforts are being made to provide as wide a range of memory retrieval and preservation as possible, </p>  <p>  In this context, I refer to the advice of the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations which proposed that the historical approach to the Decade of Commemorations should be marked by a return to primary sources, and that resources  be primarily targeted towards making these sources as widely available as possible.  To that end, the Military Service Pensions Archive project has been funded as one of the major capital projects associated with the Commemorative programme. </p>  <p>  My Department has also supported developments at the National Archives of Ireland and at academic institutions, including the Royal Irish Academy &lsquo;Judging&rsquo; biography series, with its focus on primary sources, and the Maynooth University &lsquo;Letters of 1916&rsquo; project.  This latter is involved in digitising hundreds of contemporary letters related to the 1916 Rising and using these as a tool to stimulate discussion, particularly with groups not hitherto engaged in history. </p>  <p>  Similarly, the National Library of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in World War One Europeana collection days have presented an opportunity for individuals and families to share both historical artefacts and associated lore publicly for the first time. </p>  <p>  In January 2014, the Abbey Theatre held a major symposium on &lsquo;The Theatre of Memory&rsquo; at which President Michael D Higgins addressed the topic of &lsquo;Myth Making and Ethical Remembering&rsquo;.  In this address, available online, President Higgins addressed how historical events are approached in different ways according to the prevailing attitudes of the time. This year&rsquo;s symposium addresses &lsquo;Theatre of War&rsquo; in the same vein. Events of this nature, originated by the National Cultural Institutions under the aegis of my Department, are an important contribution to the commemoration programme </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the agreed focus on primary sources, I am aware of the importance of cultural memory and lore in relation to the commemorative period and my Department has supported several projects, including the &lsquo;1916 Oral History Project&rsquo; wherein over one hundred of the closest surviving relatives of 1916 veterans were interviewed and their family accounts of the events of that period were collected and catalogued. My Department is currently supporting the preparation of a book &ldquo;To Speak of Easter Week&rdquo; based on this research.</p></reply>

I have also been advised that Waterways Ireland is unaware of any request from the organisers to provide new facilities on Waterways Ireland property for the event and that there are already a number of existing facilities in the area.  While enquiries have been made to Waterways Ireland about a certain facility, I understand that it is not located within or close to Waterways Ireland's area of responsibility.</p></reply>
