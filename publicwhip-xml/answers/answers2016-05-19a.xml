    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-19a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051900052#WRA00600"><p>The Government has committed to establishing a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the Public Service, including the entry pay levels to which the Deputy refers.</p><p>The Government recognises the importance of being able to attract quality new entrants to the Public Service, particularly so in important professional areas like education.</p><p>  The restrictions in entry pay levels were introduced in 2011 and 2012 across the public service at a time when the pressure in public finances was severe and the scope for new recruitment was very restricted.</p><p>  Under the Lansdowne Road Agreement the process of restoring public pay is commencing. An important feature of this is the flat rate increase which is being implemented.  This is proportionately more valuable to those early in their careers.  Restoration of the supervision and substitution payment is provided for subject to co-operation with the Lansdowne Road Agreement. The Lansdowne Road Agreement did not address the issue of pay of new entrants.</p><p>  My Department continues to seek to engage with teacher unions on issues of mutual concern and has recently reached agreement with INTO and TUI in respect of discussions to improve the position of teachers on fixed-term and part-time teaching; a robust review of in-school management structures; an increase in the quantum of the extra Croke Park hours which do not have to be worked on a &quot;whole school&quot; basis.</p><p>  The Government has also indicated that it will support the gradual negotiated repeal of FEMPI measures having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <table><tr><th></th><th>PRE-2011 ENTRANT SCALE

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-19a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051900052#WRA00800"><p>Schools have a role to play in supporting their students to develop the key skills and knowledge to enable them to make informed choices when faced with a range of difficult issues, including drugs and alcohol.  This is mainly done through the Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, which has a specific module on the use and misuse of a range of substances.  Addiction prevention is paramount.</p>  <p>  SPHE is currently mandatory in all primary schools and in junior cycle.  It will also form part of the new mandatory 'Wellbeing' area of learning for the new junior cycle.  New guidelines for Wellbeing are currently being prepared by NCCA for use by schools from September 2017.  In fact these guidelines are out for consultation presently and the NCCA would welcome the views of all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Schools are also encouraged to deliver the SPHE programme in senior cycle.</p>  <p>  In recent years, my Department Inspectorate published two composite reports which provide insights into the effectiveness of the teaching of SPHE at primary and post-primary level.</p>  <p>  At primary level, the report published in 2009 drew from forty inspections of the teaching of SPHE.  At post-primary level, the report published in 2013, drew from sixty-three inspections at post-primary level which focused on Junior Cycle SPHE and Senior Cycle Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE).  Within these reports, inspectors describe the overall quality of subject provision and whole-school support for SPHE as very good or good in most schools.  In response to questionnaires in these schools, 84% of students strongly agreed that SPHE helped them to understand the reasons for substance misuse, and 90% of students strongly agreed that SPHE helped them to understand the effects of abuse on individuals.</p>  <p>  Schools have access to a number of resources that support the delivery of the substance use module of SPHE. Examples include the "Walk Tall" Programme for primary pupils and a post-primary resource called "On My Own Two Feet". The Walk Tall programme materials have been updated and will be available to schools, through national professional development seminars in September 2016.</p>  <p>  There is also the Health Promotion Initiative which involves the HSE Health Promotion Officers working with the Department's Professional Development Service for Teachers Wellbeing Team to support schools across a range of health issues including addiction prevention.</p>  <p>  Data to date suggests that only 40% of schools are participating in this initiative.  In September 2015 and in February 2016, circulars promoting Healthy LIfestyles in post -primary schools and primary schools respectively were issued.  Through the circular schools were "strongly encouraged to participate in the HPS initiative".</p>  <p>  The latest data, taken from my Department's Lifeskills survey (2012), indicate that more than 90% of primary and post primary schools provide their students with information on alcohol and drug abuse, through SPHE and other means.  These results were almost identical to the position reported by schools through the 2009 Lifeskills survey.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Lifeskills survey is currently being analysed and the results will be available shortly.  This will allow for the measurement of schools' progress in this area, since 2009 and 2012.  It will also include an update on schools participating in the Health Promoting Schools Initiative.</p>  <p>  All of the proactive work done in schools complements the Government's Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013 - 2025 - Healthy Ireland.  Schools can do so much but it is through working together, across Government departments, through families and communities that we can create an environment for our people who have the knowledge, skills and resilience to choose to lead a healthy life.</p></reply>

The decision not to admit further schools to the programme was taken in light of the prevailing economic climate and consequential budgetary constraints.  It is important to note that no schools have been included in the programme since that date, irrespective of the individual circumstances at issue.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that a process to review the DEIS Programme is currently underway.  The overall scope of the review is to assess the existing DEIS Programme in the context of evaluations to date and any relevant policy and other developments in order to inform future policy to tackle educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  All aspects of the DEIS programme are being considered including the identification of schools.  A Technical Advisory Group is examining available data sources in order to develop an improved identification process for the allocation of resources in the future.  I envisage that a new identification process, when available, will enable all schools to be considered for inclusion in a future framework for the allocation of additional resources to address educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  The majority of the review work programme is scheduled for completion by the end of the current school year.  In the meantime my focus, and that of my Department, is on maintaining current DEIS supports while the review process is underway.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, pending the outcome of the review process I do not propose to make any changes to the current programme, including the addition of further schools or any other 'interim' arrangements.</p></reply>

Work already under way in my Department envisages legislative change to Section 28 of the Education Act 1998, and creating an ombudsman with powers to externally review school actions would require new legislation that could be progressed in tandem.</p></reply>

An important feature of this is the flat rate increase which is being implemented.  This is proportionately more valuable to those early in their careers.  Restoration of the supervision and substitution payment is provided for subject to co-operation with the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement did not address the issue of pay of new entrants.</p><p>My Department continues to seek to engage with teacher unions on issues of mutual concern and has recently reached agreement with INTO and TUI in respect of discussions to improve the position of teachers on fixed-term and part-time teaching; a robust review of in-school management structures; an increase in the quantum of the extra Croke Park hours which do not have to be worked on a &quot;whole school&quot; basis.</p><p>The Government has also indicated that it will support the gradual negotiated repeal of FEMPI measures having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <table><tr><th></th><th>PRE-2011 ENTRANT SCALE 1/1/10 TO

With regard to the institute of technology sector, the Strategy recommended significant reforms to position the sector to meet national strategic objectives.  In particular, the Strategy recommended consolidation within the sector and a pathway of evolution for those consolidated institutes of technology, to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria and to apply to become technological universities.</p>  <p>  The intention has always been that a Technological University would be distinctly different from traditional universities and institutes of technology by virtue of their mission relating to graduate formation, applied research and scholarship, dissemination of knowledge to meet the needs of society and enterprise with a very strong regional focus.</p>  <p>  In relation to the position of the Technological Universities Bill, this Bill was at Report Stage at the time of dissolution of the previous D&aacute;il in February 2016.  I recognise that there were a significant number of matters raised in respect of the Bill at both Committee and Report Stage.  It is my intention to now consult with all of the relevant stakeholders in relation to both the matters raised during the legislative process and the commitments contained in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Following the finalisation of this consultation process I will then advance the legislation having determined a position in relation to any matters raised as part of this consultation process.</p></reply>

Before the introduction of any subject, there is a process of development of detailed subject specifications by the NCCA.  There is also a dedicated programme of professional development for teachers which includes guidance on teaching and learning methods, supports for the new methods and the assessment approach.</p><p>As the Deputy knows English was the first subject, and the 3 year cycle started in September 2014.  The first students emerging from this cycle will receive their new Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement in Autumn 2017.  The Profile of Achievement will record outcomes from a broader range of learning experiences across the three year programme. It will include the outcome of the two Classroom-Based Assessments as well as the separate final state-certified (SEC) written examination.  The final written examination result will incorporate the result of an Assessment Task based on the student's own written evaluation of his/her learning experience on their second classroom-based assessment task (worth 10% of marks).  It is intended that the Profile of Achievement will also include other learning achievements including learning on short courses, other experiences and events and achievement in the area of Wellbeing.</p><p>Students currently in second year who have not completed their first Classroom-Based Assessment (CBA) will, as agreed with the teacher unions, have the opportunity to complete this early in the first term of the coming school year.</p><p>It is a matter of deep regret that ASTI has failed to deliver on the 2015 agreement with their leadership.  Their continuing refusal to cooperate with the new framework is impacting on current junior cycle students of English.</p><p>I have received a letter from the General Secretary of the ASTI dated 9th May, indicating that the ASTI looks forward to engaging with me on a number of named issues, including junior cycle reform.</p><p>I welcome the indications of the ASTI in this regard. If the ASTI requires further clarifications on any aspects of the published framework, I am happy to facilitate their request.  My Department has already clearly signalled that it is willing to support the ASTI in re-visiting this issue with their members.</p><p>  I intend to make contact with the ASTI to arrange for an appropriate engagement in follow-up to the letter of 9 May.</p></reply>

An important feature of this is the flat rate increase which is being implemented.  This is proportionately more valuable to those early in their careers.  Restoration of the supervision and substitution payment is provided for subject to co-operation with the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement did not address the issue of pay of new entrants.</p><p>My Department continues to seek to engage with teacher unions on issues of mutual concern and has recently reached agreement with INTO and TUI in respect of discussions to improve the position of teachers on fixed-term and part-time teaching; a robust review of in-school management structures; an increase in the quantum of the extra Croke Park hours which do not have to be worked on a &quot;whole school&quot; basis.</p><p>The Government has also indicated that it will support the gradual negotiated repeal of FEMPI measures having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <table><tr><th></th><th>PRE-2011 ENTRANT SCALE 1/1/10 TO

An important feature of this is the flat rate increase which is being implemented.  This is proportionately more valuable to those early in their careers.  Restoration of the supervision and substitution payment is provided for subject to co-operation with the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement did not address the issue of pay of new entrants.</p><p>My Department continues to seek to engage with teacher unions on issues of mutual concern and has recently reached agreement with INTO and TUI in respect of discussions to improve the position of teachers on fixed-term and part-time teaching; a robust review of in-school management structures; an increase in the quantum of the extra Croke Park hours which do not have to be worked on a &quot;whole school&quot; basis.</p><p>The Government has also indicated that it will support the gradual negotiated repeal of FEMPI measures having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <table><tr><th></th><th>PRE-2011 ENTRANT SCALE 1/1/10 TO

As you are aware I received my seal of office on the evening of 6th May, just less than two weeks ago. </p>  <p>  The formal negotiations with the two second level teacher unions and my Department were completed last summer.  In fact, my predecessor and the leaders of the two unions, on 22nd May 2015, signed a joint statement on the "Principles and Implementation for the Junior Cycle" in which it was agreed that it was a "reasonable basis upon which reform should proceed".  Further agreement on resources for implementation was provided in a July 2015 document.  Based on those the Framework for Junior Cycle 2015 was published last August.</p>  <p>  The TUI members voted in favour of the reform but the ASTI members rejected the reform at ballot by a margin of 55:45, with only 38% of their members voting.  Further clarification was sought by the ASTI on aspects of the reform and this was provided last December.</p>  <p>  It is a matter of deep regret that the ASTI failed to deliver on the 2015 agreement.  Their continuing refusal to cooperate with the new Framework is impacting on current junior cycle students of English.</p>  <p>  I have noted the content of an ASTI announcement in March of this year and the remarks of their General Secretary to their Easter Convention in relation to a decision of the ASTI Standing Committee to call a series of one-day strikes from September 2016.  In his remarks, the General Secretary stated that their intention is to "allow for constructive use of the window of opportunity that exists in the interim period of time.  That opportunity is there for the next Minister for Education and Skills, if they so choose to avail of it.</p>  <p>  I have also received a letter from the General Secretary of the ASTI dated 9th May, indicating that the ASTI looks forward to engaging with me on a number of named issues, including junior cycle reform.I welcome the indications of the ASTI in this regard.   If the ASTI requires further clarifications on any aspects of the published framework, I am happy to facilitate their request.  My Department has already clearly signalled that it is willing to support the ASTI in re-visiting this issue with their members.</p>  <p>  I hope that the ASTI can re-consider their current stance.  This is in the interests of their own members who are currently teaching a new programme for which they have not received the available professional training.  It is also in the paramount interest of the students who are disadvantaged by the current situation.</p>  <p>  I intend to make contact with the ASTI to arrange for an appropriate engagement in follow-up to the letter of 9 May. </p></reply>

The guidelines refer to preventative approaches that schools can adopt in creating a safe and supportive environment.</p>  <p>  The publication provides step-by-step guidelines for teachers and principals on how to respond when a tragedy occurs.  It offers support to schools at a potentially overwhelming time. NEPS has also provided schools with additional guidance material in relation to social media use and critical incidents.  The guidelines focus on alerting schools to planning processes, structures and actions which will better allow them to cope with traumatic incidents such as suicide, murder, accidental death including road traffic accidents and drowning, and death through illness of members of the school community.  In relation to suicide, advice is also given on prevention and positive mental health approaches.</p>  <p>  NEPS psychologists will also, at the specific invitation of school authorities, provide advice and attend at the schools immediately following such incidents to offer direct assistance to school staff and/or pupils.</p>  <p>  In relation to the instances raised by the Deputy, I can confirm that staff from the psychological services have been in contact with, and attended at, schools in the North Inner City.  In line with the Critical Incident Guidelines, schools have been advised to ensure maintenance of a safe secure and calm school environment.  Advice and support have been provided to staff in these schools in relation to how to deal with the traumatic effects on the pupils in their care at an age appropriate level, to be vigilant as to how effects of the trauma might manifest and to identify pupils at risk for referral to the appropriate clinical support service.  Schools have also been advised as to how to communicate similar advice to parents in de-stressing and rationalising the situation for their children.</p>  <p>  At a community level, NEPS has been involved in a consultation with the local Children's/ Young People's Services Committee to support a cross-agency co-ordinated response in Dublin's North-Inner City.  This involves Tusla, the HSE and other voluntary agencies.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will understand that it would not necessarily be prudent or appropriate to identify the particular schools involved but I can assure her that ongoing support is available to any school which requires support.</p></reply>

The Deputy will also be aware that under the new Programme for Government we are pressing forward with an accelerated programme of Garda recruitment with a view to achieving a Force of 15,000 members.  This is a central element of the Government's anti-crime strategy and it builds on the recruitment of 1,150 new Garda&iacute; since we reopened the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014.  I can assure the Deputy that I will be engaging with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with a view to achieving our recruitment targets as soon as possible.  The ongoing recruitment process will undoubtedly support enhanced policing in all areas of the country, including those referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the stations referred to at Lucan and Ronanstown form part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West Division and that as of the 31 March 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 686 members, 46 Reserves and 46 (Full Time Equivalents) civilians assigned to the Division.  The detailed breakdown of these resources is set out in the following table.</p><p>I am very much aware of the impact of burglary crime on householders and communities in all areas of the country, and I have brought the Deputy's concerns in relation to the area in question to the attention of the Garda authorities.  While I would not seek to minimise the serious effects of these crimes, it is worth noting that since the launch of Operation Thor by the Commissioner in November 2015 we have seen very positive trends in the level of burglary crime nationally.  In fact, the most recent CSO Recorded Crime Statistics show that during the last three months of 2015 the overall number of burglaries reduced by 26.2% compared to the same period in 2014.</p><p>Operation Thor was developed after I initiated a broad review of our approach to burglary crime in the early part of last year.  Operation Thor is now providing a concerted drive against those involved in burglary crime, including the highly mobile criminal gangs who have targeted communities in many areas of the country and caused so much damage and distress in the process.  The concentrated Garda activity under Operation Thor has so far produced more than 19,000 anti-crime patrols and in the order of 23,000 targeted checkpoints nationwide.  There have also been in the region of 1,300 arrests covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.</p><p>I have also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.  I am very pleased that this new legislation is now available to support the work which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor.</p><p>Operation Thor delivers on increased investment in policing by this Government and marks a significant step-up in the Garda response to burglaries and related crime.  In excess of &euro;5 million is being specifically committed to support Operation Thor and includes funding for Garda overtime which is supporting a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.  Furthermore, investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.  The Government is also investing in Garda airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems.  In fact, the Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides an additional &euro;205 million for Garda ICT over the lifetime of the Plan, underlining the ongoing commitment in the Programme for Government to resource and equip An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide enhanced policing and to support communities in all areas of the country.<table><tr><th>DMR WEST 31 March 2016</th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>-</th></tr><tr><td>DISTRICT</td><td>STATION</td><td><div>Garda</div></td><td><div>Reserve</div></td><td><div>Civilians</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLANCHARDSTOWN</td><td><div>154</div></td><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>17</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CABRA</td><td><div>67</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>FINGLAS</td><td><div>106</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>BLANCHARDSTOWN         <br /><br /> <br /><br /></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>327</div></td><td><div>21</div></td><td><div>22</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYFERMOT</td><td><div>86</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLONDALKIN</td><td><div>86</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>9</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RATHCOOLE</td><td><div>20</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>CLONDALKIN             <br /><br /> <br /><br /></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>192</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LUCAN</td><td><div>74</div></td><td><div>13</div></td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RONANSTOWN</td><td><div>93</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>LUCAN                  <br /><br /></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>167</div></td><td><div>17</div></td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>686</div></td><td><div>46</div></td><td><div>46</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The second Special Criminal Court became operational on 25 April 2016 and sat for the first time on 6 May 2016. Prior to the first sitting of this court, the waiting time for the hearing of cases, indicated to be ready for trial, was 24 months.  This has now been reduced to 18 months and, as the two Special Criminal Courts continue to sit, the waiting times will continue to reduce.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is, of course, a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the presiding judge who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  Shortly after his appointment last year, the President of the High Court made arrangements for Special Criminal Court No. 1 to sit five days per week rather than the four days that had been the case.  This was possible because of the new arrangements made to deal with bail applications in the High Court.  Both the Special Criminal Court No. 1 and the Special Criminal Court No. 2 now sit five days per week which will also assist in reducing the waiting times for cases to come to hearing.</p></reply>

The report deserves the most careful consideration so that we can all do everything possible to avoid a repeat of the issues which gave rise to it in the first place.  In this regard, I have asked the Garda Commissioner to examine the report and to indicate to me what further measures might be taken to try to prevent the type of difficulties outlined in it in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na arising again.  I am also seeking her proposals concerning the recommendations which it contains in relation to the Garda service.  And I have forwarded a copy of the report to the Policing Authority in the context of its statutory role in relation to oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Commission submitted the report to me on 25 April 2016.  On receipt of the report I immediately referred it to the Attorney General and was advised, in line with the provisions of Section 38 of the Commission of Investigation Act 2004, to undertake a process to establish whether there was anything in the report which might prejudice criminal proceedings pending or in progress.  This involved consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was only possible to conclude that process on 10 May, and having established that the issue of prejudice does not arise, the next day I presented the report to Government and published it.  So it is not correct to say that there was a delay in publishing the report.</p>  <p>  While I regret that elements of the report were leaked to the media in advance of publication, I do not believe that an inquiry into the leaking of the O'Higgins report or parts of the report prior to its publication would be likely to identify the sources of any leaks.  Leaving aside the clear legal constraints arising in relation to the work of any Commission of Investigation, I believe the partial leaking of the report carries with it a real danger of undermining the work of the Commission.</p>  <p>  I very much appreciate that the events outlined in the report have been traumatic for many people who have been affected by them.  It would be an injustice to those who brought events to light in the public interest and those who have lived under the shadow of these events for a long time, if we do not take on board the lessons from these events.  Equally, as the report makes clear, victims were badly served in a number of these cases and their rights must be more central in the way that the Garda&iacute; handle investigations.  I hope they can take some reassurance from the fact that the examination of those events in this report will help serve to consolidate a programme of reform which will ensure we continue to have a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in which its members and the community it serves can take great pride.</p>  <p>  I hope there can be general agreement too that what is important now is that the report is considered carefully in its totality and that we learn whatever lessons we can from it, particularly in the context of maintaining the high level of confidence which the community have in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I am committed to overseeing further reforms which are necessary to avoid a recurrence of the type of incidents highlighted in the report and I await proposals from the Garda Commissioner and the Policing Authority in this regard.</p>  <p>  This House will shortly have a chance to debate the findings of the report and I believe we would all do well to reflect fully on its contents with the objective of making sure everything possible is done to avoid in future the type of difficulties outlined in the report.</p></reply>

Defibrillators, other than implantable defibrillators, are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%.  Parts or accessories and training are also liable to VAT at the standard rate.  </p>  <p>  There is no provision in VAT law that would make it possible to apply a reduced rate or zero rate to the supply of such products. Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rate on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.  In addition, Member States may only apply a reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive.  While Annex III does include the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use.  In this regard, a reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of defibrillators.  Therefore the only rate that can apply to the supply of defibrillators and their accessories is the standard VAT rate of 23%.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government commits to raising the issue of VAT rates applying to certain products such as defibrillators at EU level.  The European Commission's Action Plan on VAT was adopted on 7th April 2016 and contains a proposal to look at VAT rate policy across the EU in 2017.  The rates proposal may offer Member States more flexibility in the future in determining VAT rates applicable to goods and services, and this forum will provide an opportunity to discuss VAT applicable to defibrillators.  However, the Deputy will be aware that any proposed changes to the current EU VAT Directive would require unanimous agreement from all Member States.</p></reply>

There is no formal timeline for a when the final decision will be made in our case.</p>  <p>  This a priority matter and Ireland has   co-operated fully with the process to date and will continue to do so.  Detailed and comprehensive responses have been provided to the Commission demonstrating that the appropriate amount of Irish tax was charged in accordance with the relevant legislation, that no selective advantage was given and that there was no State Aid.</p>  <p>  I remain of the view that there was no breach of State Aid rules in this case and that the legislative provisions were correctly applied.  In the event that the Commission forms the view that there was state aid, Ireland is entitled to challenge this decision in the European Courts.  As the Government have already indicated, we will take that course of action, if necessary, to continue to vigorously defend the Irish position.</p>  <p>  As I have said previously, there is simply no question that the Irish authorities sought to give the company in question any kind of special tax deal.</p></reply>

This role includes processing and vetting applications from bodies claiming the tax exemption and once granted, undertaking appropriate compliance checks, having regard to risk, to ensure continued compliance with the relevant terms and conditions.</p>  <p>  Revenue has assured me that bodies that have charitable tax exemption are subject to an appropriate level of compliance monitoring, having regard to its overall risk focused compliance intervention programmes.  Compliance interventions are not determined by whether the body concerned is religious or secular.</p>  <p>  I am also informed by Revenue that religious organisations who have employees are obliged to operate PAYE/PRSI in respect of their employees and are subject to the same degree of risk based interventions as any other organisation.</p></reply>

This is scheduled to take place after the first 18 months of the Fund's operations have elapsed.  The Fund was established under the NTMA (Amendment) Act 2014, which was enacted in December of that year.  A decision to conduct a review of the Fund's strategy after 18 months was based on its unique mandate as a sovereign development fund.  This unique mandate refers to its double bottom line which comprises of investing: (i) on a commercial basis; and (ii) in a manner designed to support economic activity and employment in Ireland.</p>  <p>  At this point the Fund has been established for just under 18 months with its first investment strategy having been published in July 2015.  It is timely that a review of the Fund's investment strategy be conducted during the second half of 2016 as this ensures that a sufficient period of time has elapsed in order consider the operations and impact of the Fund. </p>  <p>  The NTMA (Amendment) Act 2014 provides that ownership of the Fund vests with the Minister for Finance.  It also provides that the Fund shall, in reviewing its investment strategy, consult the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The review of the ISIF will be conducted in accordance with these provisions.  In addition, the legislation provides that the Minister for Finance may consult with other Government Ministers as appropriate.  As the review will not be conducted for some time yet, the exact details of the process and timelines of the review have yet to be considered fully.  It is envisaged that the review will involve close consultation between ISIF and my Department, as well as the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform, and any other Department as considered appropriate.  However, the exact details of the review in terms of the stakeholders to be consulted have yet to be considered and decisions on these issues will be taken in the lead up to the review's commencement in the second half of 2016.</p></reply>

Furthermore, this allocation is expected to be continuously reduced as the Fund deploys its capital.  The Fund's divestment approach is phased with a view to protecting the taxpayer from unnecessary losses.  This is in alignment with the Fund's double bottom line mandate of investment (i) on a commercial basis and (ii) in a manner designed to support economic activity and employment in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The first investment strategy of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which was published in July 2015, is publicly available.  It sets out the long-term strategic direction for the Fund, and outlines that the "Energy (allocation) will include a significant element of renewable energy investments".  Importantly, the Fund commits to operating to the highest global standards, investing in line with both the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), of which it is a signatory, incorporating environmental, social and governance factors into its investment decision making, and the Santiago Principles, which are the globally accepted best practice principles for sovereign funds.  To date, any exclusions from the Fund (e.g. on the basis of ethical investment criteria) are those mandated by legislation, such as the Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Act 2008 (as amended). </p>  <p>  The ISIF has a close working relationship with what is now the Department of Communications, Climate Change &amp;amp; Natural Resources and is committed to investing in the energy sector in a manner that is consistent with the Government's commitment to make the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and sustainable economy, as reflected in the Climate Change and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 and in the Paris Agreement, signed recently by Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on Ireland's behalf.</p>  <p>  The Fund's investment policy is set out in the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, and its strategy is determined, monitored and kept under review in accordance with that Act.</p></reply>

Responsibility for mental health initiatives for young people is shared across a number of Government Departments and agencies including the Department of Health, Department of Children and Youth Affairs, Health Service Executive and Tusla.  </p>  <p>  My own Department is committed to work in this area.  Under the Framework for Junior Cycle 2015, a new area of learning entitled "Wellbeing" will be a mandatory part of Junior Cycle with effect 2017.  This is currently being developed by the NCCA.  Support for teachers in promoting wellbeing, including the positive mental health of young people in schools is an important part of the work of the Department's Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST).  Funding for the initiatives has yet to be finalised.

In the context of a rapidly increasing school population, my Department's priority is to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and in this regard, it is sometimes necessary to make use of temporary accommodation in order to meet the accommodation needs of schools.</p>  <p>  Under my Department's Capital Programme (2011-2015) in excess of &euro;2.1 billion was spent on the provision of new schools and the refurbishment of existing schools which resulted in the completion of 238 major school projects and 1,131 additional accommodation projects.  As a result, 2,894 additional classrooms were provided in primary schools to accommodate 80,000 additional pupils as well as 403 replacement classrooms which provided new accommodation for 11,000 pupils.  At post-primary level 23,000 additional places and 10,000 replacement places were also provided.</p>  <p>  My Department's 6 Year Construction Programme (2016-2021) was announced in November 2015 as part of a &euro;2.8 billion schools capital investment plan.  Under this programme funding will be provided for over 310 large scale school building projects and will deliver some 19,000 additional permanent primary school places and 43,000 additional post-primary school places.  The new Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms for schools outside of the programme where an immediate enrolment need has been identified, such as the appointment of an additional teacher. In addition it is my intention to replace all purchased prefabs with permanent accommodation over the lifetime of the programme.</p></reply>

One of the many benefits of the introduction of the Primary Online Database is that it will enable the progress of children through the education system to be accurately monitored.  From 2015/2016 onwards the Primary Online Database will provide the Department with the capacity to compile this vital information on children that do not make the transition from primary to post-primary education.</p><p>Secondary Education: </p><p>At secondary level, the following information is taken from the 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 Retention reports by the Department of Education and Skills, on school retention in Ireland.  It is based on a detailed analysis of the records held in the Department's Post-Primary Pupils Database (PPPDB) for the cohort of entrants to the first year of the junior cycle in the years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 who sat the Leaving Certificate Examinations in the years from 2009 to 2014.  The Department will produce a report on the 2009 cohort for those who sat the Leaving Certificate in 2015 by June this year.  See Table 1.</p><p>For more detailed information on these cohorts please visit the DES website for the full report: </p><p>Third Level Education: </p><p>The overall new entrant non-progression rate was 15% in 2007/08 and has remained constant at 16% from 2010/11 to 2012/13.  While the number of new entrants increased from 2007/08 to 2012/13, the number of students who did not progress to the following year of study, also increased between these periods.  Of note, the rate of non-progression at level 6 in the institute of technology sector shows an incline from 2007/08 of 25% to 30% in 2010/11 and 2011/12.  This declined to 26% in 2012/13.  In the colleges sector (level 8), the non-progression rate remains consistent at 4% with the exception of 2012/13 where a two percentage point difference is observed.  However, the numbers remain very small overall for this sector and so small differences may appear significant.  See Table 2.  As part of the implementation of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-19, a working group is being established to address the issue of non-progression and non-completion in higher education.</p><p>Further Education and Training: </p><p>The information on Further Education and Training is being compiled and will be sent directly to the Deputy. </p><p>Table 1: National Leaving Certificate Retention Rate for 2004 - 2008 cohorts<table><tr><th>Year Retention Rate</th><th>%</th></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>87.7</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>89.5</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>90.2</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>90.1</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>90.6</td></tr></table>Table 2: Trends in Non-Progression Rates by Sector and NFQ Level from 2007/08 to 2012/13<table><tr><th>Sector</th><th>Level</th><th>2007/08 - 2008/09</th><th>2010/11 - 2011/12</th><th>2011/12 - 2012/13</th><th>2012/13 - 2013/14</th></tr><tr><td>Institutes of Technology</td><td>Level 6<br /><br />Level 7<br /><br />Level 8<br /><br />All New Entrants</td><td>25%<br /><br />26%<br /><br />16%<br /><br />22%</td><td>30%<br /><br />28%<br /><br />17%<br /><br />24%</td><td>30%<br /><br />29%<br /><br />17%<br /><br />24%</td><td>26%<br /><br />28%<br /><br />17%<br /><br />23%</td></tr><tr><td>Universities</td><td>Level 8</td><td>9%</td><td>9%</td><td>10%</td><td>11%</td></tr><tr><td>Colleges</td><td>Level 8</td><td>4%</td><td>4%</td><td>4%</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>All Institutions</td><td>Level 8</td><td>11%</td><td>11%</td><td>11%</td><td>12%</td></tr><tr><td>All Institutions</td><td>All New Entrants</td><td>15%</td><td>16%</td><td>16%</td><td>16%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Tax relief provisions are also available so that second and subsequent siblings do not have to bear the full cost.  In addition, higher education institutions have provisions in place to allow students to pay the contribution in two moieties.</p>  <p>  The sector has expanded considerably in recent years, both in terms of meeting increased demand from school leavers and also in providing opportunities for people to upskill and reskill under programmes like Springboard.  The number of students (full-time equivalents) attending higher education has grown from 163,000 in 2008/09 to 192,000 in 2014/15.  Demand for higher education is projected to continue to grow over the next decade as a result of demographics placing further pressures on the system.</p>  <p>  In light of this, the previous Government established an Expert Group to examine future funding requirements for higher education and to present options for developing a sustainable long term funding strategy for the sector.  This Group has completed its work and its report will shortly be considered.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Expert Group will allow for a real and meaningful discussion on the funding requirements of the sector and how those requirements should be met.  The engagement with the cross-party Oireachtas Committee will ensure that all views can be heard and considered on the most appropriate way forward for the Irish higher education system.</p></reply>

Under this scheme, schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that my Department, over the course of recent economic difficulties, has not only maintained psychologist staffing levels within NEPS, but has increased them by some 10% since late 2008, to 165 whole time equivalent psychologists currently employed.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits that we will invest additional resources in the National Educational Psychological Service to ensure earlier intervention and access for young children and teenagers and to offer immediate support to schools in cases of critical incidents.  The Programme commits to bring the total number of NEPS psychologists to 238 from the current sanctioned limit of 173.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem-solving and solution-focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum-based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.</p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  I would advise that if there are concerns in relation to the educational development of the student referred to in Deputy's question, they should be raised in the first instance with the Principal of the school he is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist.</p></reply>

The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p><p>The school planning areas in County Kildare are experiencing some demographic growth, however, not to such an extent that would currently warrant the provision of new schools.  These areas are being kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated child benefit data and updated enrolment data and the impact of existing and planned capacity increases to schools within the planning areas.</p><p>In November 2015, my predecessor announced the major school projects, including those for Kildare, that will commence construction from 2016 - 2021 as part of my Departments Six-Year Programme.  The programme aims to prioritise new building projects and major extensions in areas where significant demographic need has been established.  The Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms for schools outside the plan where an immediate enrolment need has been identified, such as the appointment of an additional teacher.  In addition, the Programme prioritises projects that have a deficit of mainstream accommodation for projected enrolments, require refurbishment and replacement of poor accommodation.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that extensions to two primary schools in Clane were approved under the Five-Year Plan.  One project has been completed and the other is progressing through architectural planning.  Also, in recent years four new schools have opened in County Kildare, comprising two new primary schools which opened in 2012 and 2013 and two new post-primary schools which opened in 2014 and 2015.</p><p>The current status of all projects, including those in County Kildare, may be viewed on my Department's website at www.education.ie and this will be updated regularly throughout the year.</p></reply>

This improvement takes effect from next September.  It brings the basis of allocation from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the 2016/17 school year.  This improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation is a restoration of 50% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota.</p>  <p>  The delivery of the 50% restoration through a change in the staffing schedule will allow each school to determine how best to allocate the additional resources to meet the guidance needs of the school.  The circular issued earlier this year by my Department outlining the allocation of teaching resources clearly stated that this additional resource is to complement existing resources in order to best meet the guidance needs of the school in line with the school's guidance plan.</p>  <p>  At the time of the guidance cuts, all 195 second-level schools in DEIS were given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1.  This was a 0.75 point improvement compared to the current PTR of 19:1 that applies in non-fee paying second-level schools.</p>  <p>  That was a very important protection for the cohort of our schools in DEIS most in need of support. DEIS schools will also further benefit from the 0.3 improvement to the staffing schedule which will give them an enhanced allocation on the basis of 17.95:1 in respect of the 2016/17 school year.  In the next Budget I will consider the best approach to further meeting commitments in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

This measure is designed to provide rural communities with security about the future of their small schools.  With regard to school ethos, the government supports the concept of parental choice in our school system, whether that be a choice for denominational or multi-denominational education.

This includes 820 redundant apprentices.  The apprenticeship population fluctuates based on the number of apprenticeship registrations and the numbers completing their apprenticeships.  As apprenticeship registrations in the existing trades have been increasing in recent years, more apprentices are in the earlier years of apprenticeship than at the later phases.  This means that the levels of completions will be relatively low in the immediate future in many trades.</p><p>Annual registrations increased by 40% from 2013 to 2014 and the 2015 figure of 3,153 represented a further 17% increase.  The increase in registrations is forecast to be sustained up to at least 2018.  These forecasts, by trade, for 2016 to 2018 are set out in the attached table.  This will result in continuing growth in the apprenticeship population in the existing trades.  SOLAS do not yet have forecasts beyond 2018 but will continue to update their forecasts based on their formal economic model.</p><p>In addition, the apprenticeship population will be further significantly supplemented by registrations on new apprenticeships which are being developed under the auspices of the Apprenticeship Council.<table><tr><th>Forecst Registrations </th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>Trades</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Construction</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Brick &amp;amp; Stonelaying</td><td>65</td><td>120</td><td>215</td></tr><tr><td>Carpentry &amp;amp; Joinery</td><td>425</td><td>645</td><td>975</td></tr><tr><td>Floor &amp;amp; Wall Tiling</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Painting &amp;amp; Decorating</td><td>25</td><td>60</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Pipefitting</td><td>30</td><td>28</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Plastering</td><td>25</td><td>65</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>Plumbing</td><td>370</td><td>525</td><td>625</td></tr><tr><td>Stonecutting &amp;amp; Stonemasonry</td><td>14</td><td>14</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Wood Manufacturing &amp;amp; Finishing</td><td>35</td><td>90</td><td>140</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>989 </td><td>1,547 </td><td>2,217 </td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />ELECTRICAL</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Aircraft Mechanics</td><td>40</td><td>40</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Electrical</td><td>990</td><td>1,205</td><td>1,360</td></tr><tr><td>Electrical Instrumentation</td><td>60</td><td>60</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Electronic Security Systems</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Instrumentation </td><td>14</td><td>14</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Refrigeration and Air Conditioning</td><td>70</td><td>70</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1,194 </td><td>1,409 </td><td>1,569 </td></tr><tr><td>ENGINEERING</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>M.A.M.F.</td><td>190</td><td>195</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Farriery</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Industrial Insulation</td><td>14</td><td>14</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Metal Fabrication</td><td>220</td><td>220</td><td>220</td></tr><tr><td>Sheet Metalworking</td><td>40</td><td>50</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Toolmaking</td><td>65</td><td>65</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>537 </td><td>552 </td><td>557 </td></tr><tr><td>MOTOR</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Agricultural Mechanics</td><td>40</td><td>40</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Construction Plant Fitting</td><td>60</td><td>85</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy Vehicle Mechanics</td><td>142</td><td>146</td><td>152</td></tr><tr><td>Motor Mechanics</td><td>370</td><td>374</td><td>388</td></tr><tr><td>Vehicle Body Repairs</td><td>50</td><td>50</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>662 </td><td>695 </td><td>730 </td></tr><tr><td>Print Media</td><td>8</td><td>16</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>8</td><td>16</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>3390</td><td>4219</td><td>5089</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In addition, a comprehensive pay-by- weight awareness campaign is currently being rolled out, which includes practical advice for householders on reducing and segregating their waste and thereby minimising their costs.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, and while enforcement action against illegal waste activity, including dumping, is a matter for the local authorities or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as appropriate, my Department has introduced a number of measures to strengthen our efforts to combat illegal waste activity generally.</p>  <p>  Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) have been established in each of the three existing waste regions with responsibility for coordinating waste enforcement actions and ensuring consistent enforcement of waste legislation while still leaving local authority personnel as first responders on the ground to specific breaches of waste legislation.  This will facilitate a transformation from process driven enforcement, structured around separate implementation of individual regulations, to one that focuses greatest effort on the waste problems and issues that matter most and to take swift, proportionate and effective action.  The work of the WERLAs is being supported by continued funding provided by my Department for the local authority waste enforcement network.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;8.2 million is being provided in 2016 for the retention by local authorities of 155 specialised waste enforcement officers, critical to tackling issues such as illegal dumping in local communities and in providing an enhanced response on the ground to infractions of the waste code.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, under the new pay-by-weight regulatory regime, local authorities will be establishing a register which records the details of households which are using the services of an authorised waste operator (whether a kerbside collector, pay to use compactor or civic amenity facility).  In gathering these details from service providers, local authorities may use this information to target households which appear not to be managing their waste correctly or using the services of an authorised operator and these data will support a number of awareness, education and enforcement programmes already initiated by individual local authorities.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, fixed penalty notices (or on-the-spot fines) can also be issued from 1 July 2016 in respect of non-compliant waste collectors or service providers for breaches of their waste collection permit conditions.</p></reply>

The RIA further noted that, as the household waste collection market develops, consolidation is likely over the medium to long term, in which a small number of vertically integrated waste collection firms may capture more of the national market.</p>  <p>  In terms of costs to collectors, the exact costs of servicing any given householder will differ considerably due to a number of variables, including the demographic and geographic nature of the local market, shift patterns, the frequency of the service, the degree of segregated collection, and, in many cases, the degree to which a collection route serves both household and commercial waste.</p>  <p>  In terms of moving to pay-by-weight, the RIA also highlighted that a transition to weight-based charging on a national basis could be achieved relatively cheaply, in view of the potential benefits.  The necessary capital investment primarily involves fitting transponders to individual bins, and equipping refuse collection vehicles with data readers and weighing equipment.  Costs in relation to transponders set out in the RIA were understood to be approximately &euro;2.50 per unit, and approximately &euro;3.00 installation cost per unit.  Equipping a refuse collection vehicle with the necessary data reader and weighing equipment is understood to cost approximately &euro;30,000 per vehicle or approximately 10% of the capital cost of the vehicle.  Annual repair and maintenance costs are understood to be of the order of 7% of the initial investment, e.g. &euro;2,100 per refuse collection vehicle.</p>  <p>  The Waste Management (Waste Collection Permit) Regulations 2007, as amended, have required, since 1 July 2015, that vehicles collecting household waste in reusable receptacles (such as wheelie bins) weigh the waste collected and to make this information available to the householder at least once per month.</p></reply>

Following the necessary preparatory work the new Scheme came into operation on 1 January 2016.  The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible tenants must meet certain criteria, including having been in receipt of social housing support for a minimum period of one year and having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.  The scheme applies to all existing local authority houses, other than excluded dwellings.</p><p>All tenants of houses included in the scheme, who meet the eligibility criteria, can apply to purchase their house, provided they are not disqualified from doing so under the provisions of the legislation.  Reasons for disqualification include rent arrears, participation in a previous tenant purchase scheme or engagement in anti-social behaviour.</p><p>The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the Scheme is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, housing authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.</p><p>In determining reckonable income, the income of the tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants can be included, as can the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner/co-habitant of a tenant who live in the house with them.</p><p>A number of income sources, including certain social welfare payments, are disregarded for the purposes of determining reckonable income.  The list of income disregards is included in the Ministerial Direction which can be accessed at the following link:</p><p><i><font color="#2F2F2F">.</font></i></p><p>In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant&rsquo;s income is of a long-term and sustainable nature.  This is necessary to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p><p>The provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed tenure sustainable communities.  Part V units are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme to ensure that units delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time.  The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration.</p><p>The new Scheme is in the very early stages of implementation and my Department is monitoring the operation of the scheme in consultation with housing authorities.  In line with the commitment in the new <i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>to make the scheme more attractive for social housing tenants and to raise new funds for housing development, I intend to undertake a review of the scheme following the first 12 months of operation. I will bring forward any changes to the terms and conditions of the scheme which are considered necessary based on the evidence gathered at that stage.</p></reply>

Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.976 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure.  Because of demographic changes, the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.</p>  <p>  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was estimated to provide annual savings of &euro;48 million.  These savings meant that the Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.  The Department will spend approximately &euro;227 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 418,000 customers.</p>  <p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew, arising from the increased number of pension recipients.  In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum. </p>  <p>  Any decision to restore the telephone allowance would have to be considered in the overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years was given.  This has increased the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  I believe that, taken together with other changes, such as increasing the Christmas Bonus to 75% of weekly rate, the impact of the last Budget has been very positive for older people.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In social assistance schemes generally, where a claimant and/or his/her spouse/partner owns a property other than the family home, the second property is assessed on a capital basis.

It replaced the former smallholders&rsquo; unemployment assistance payment.  In line with the then existing arrangements for unemployment assistance (including smallholders) and pre-retirement allowance, the income of farm assist recipients was exempt from class S PRSI for self-employed workers.  Recipients of farm assist who had previously paid Class S social insurance had the option of paying voluntary contributions to maintain their social insurance record, provided they satisfied the qualifying conditions.</p>  <p>  Since 1st January 2007, the exemption from class S PRSI has been removed and those receiving jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and farm assist are subject to Class S PRSI as self-employed contributors on their self-employed income, provided their annual income is &euro;5,000 or more.</p>  <p>  Currently PRSI credited contributions (credits) are only awarded to former employees, to cover gaps in social insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI such as during periods of unemployment, illness, etc.  Self-employed workers do not qualify for credits.</p>  <p>  Any proposal to award retrospective credits to farm assist recipients would have to be considered in the context of access to credits for all other categories of the self-employed and in the wider Budgetary context.</p></reply>

In addition, ex gratia payments made to women who were admitted to and worked in the Magdalen Laundries or through the Symphysiotomy Payment Scheme are also not taken into account in social welfare means assessments.  All other compensation or court awards which are not provided for in social welfare legislation are assessed in the normal manner. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the means assessment for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance scheme applies to means of the carer and his or her spouse/partner, not the person being cared for.

Since then, support has been provided to some 540 households with expenditure of &euro;1.17 million.</p>  <p>  The scheme is operated on an administrative basis under guidelines that have been issued to staff.  The guidelines outline the supports that come within the scope of the scheme, the income assessment to be applied and the approach to be taken by officers when determining the level of payment to be made. </p>  <p>  The Department has awarded a contract for the provision of loss adjusting services in respect of the humanitarian assistance scheme to support the assessment of damage to individual households in cases where structural repairs are necessary and the cost is estimated in excess of &euro;5,000.  Guidelines, issued in February 2016, provide guidance to officers in respect of claims involving repair of structural damage and detail the arrangements for referring cases to the Department&rsquo;s loss adjusters for assessment and report. </p>  <p>  The role of the loss adjuster is to provide an assessment of the reasonableness of builder&rsquo;s estimates of damage caused to a person&rsquo;s home by means of a site visit to the property.  The loss adjuster provides an individual report per dwelling, including a costed itemised inventory of the works required to replace essential losses, to make any essential repairs and to return the person&rsquo;s house to a habitable condition.  The loss adjuster&rsquo;s report in relation to a specific property can be made available to that householder on request.</p></reply>

I have made clear to the Secretary of State that this will remain firmly on the political agenda of the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to urge the British Government to allow access by an independent international judicial figure to all original documents in their possession relating to these bombings.  I hope that in the week ahead the 32nd D&aacute;il will debate and agree a fresh all-Party motion on this issue, which would reaffirm our shared will and determination to secure progress on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.</p>  <p>  On Tuesday 17 May, the 42nd anniversary of the bombings, I represented the Government at the commemoration ceremony and stood in solidarity with the families of victims and survivors of the atrocity.</p>  <p>  Decades old cases, such as the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, must be adequately addressed if we are to achieve a genuinely reconciled society.  Successive Irish Governments, in our ongoing bilateral relations with the UK and through the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg, have consistently raised with the British Government the obligation to ensure effective investigations of such cases, including in instances of alleged collusion.</p>  <p>  Many families continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one, but also with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events..The establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, is a priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  Following the Assembly elections in Northern Ireland, I have engaged further on this issue, most recently on a visit to Belfast this week where I had discussions about the possible route to a final agreement on legacy issues.  The Government believes that the legacy institutions agreed under the Stormont House Agreement offer the best hope of helping the thousands of families touched by the Troubles.  I am therefore actively working to secure the necessary political agreement to get the legacy bodies established and up and running as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This provides a legal basis for the various policies and practices, which are applied by the Passport Service in the issue of passports.  It broadly requires that a person must be an Irish citizen; his/her identity is proven; andin the case of a child, the witnessed consent of that child&rsquo;s guardian(s) is provided. </p><p>In the case of the first named person, her naturalisation certificate, dated 12 August, 2015, demonstrated her entitlement to Irish citizenship.  However, her application is incomplete in regard to the following requirements of the Act &ndash;</p><blockquote>Identity: The applicant&rsquo;s parents have been asked to supply her original birth certificate.  (Only original certificates/documents are accepted for passport applications.)  This could have verified her name, date and place of birth details.  Unfortunately, only a copy of her birth certificate was received by the Passport Service.  Alternatively, the national passport from her country of birth, Cameroon, would have been acceptable ID.  No such passport has been submitted.  <br /><br />Consent: The witnessed consent of both parents was apparently provided.  However, following inquiries by the Passport Service, the witness in question informed that the applicant&rsquo;s father had not been in his presence when this section of the application form was witnessed.  On this basis, the full consent of the parental guardians has not been given.  </blockquote><p>The Passport Service last wrote to the parents on 25 February 2016 to advise them of the issues above and that the witness date for the original application was over six months and thus out of date.  A new and pre-registered application form was sent to them for their completion.  This has not been returned. </p><p>The current position of the application is that it is not compliant with the Act and cannot progress to passport issue.  In order to finalise this application, the Passport Service needs to receive the following:</p><p>a new witnessed application form and photographs;</p><p>original birth certificate or Cameroon passport (Alternatively, a Public Service card when she reaches eighteen years of age.); and</p><p>witnessed guardian consent (until she reaches her eighteenth birthday on 4 September, 2016).</p><p>As regards the second named person, there is no record on the passport system for this person.</p></reply>

All of our National Parks are open to the public all year round.</p><p>It is estimated that over 2 million visitors visit our National Parks every year.  Visitors can independently explore the parks, or do so as part of guided walks or take part in the many educational programmes run by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  To encourage and maximise use of these facilities, access is free of charge in all cases.  Information on public access to the National Parks and Nature Reserves and their scientific significance can be found on my Department&rsquo;s National Parks and Wildlife Service website at www.npws.ie. </p><p>Within the constraints imposed by current economic conditions, I am continuing to invest in visitor facilities in parks and nature reserves to maximise their sustainable use and enjoyment.  To this end, and building on previous investment in this area, my Department is working on proposals to further develop facilities for visitors such as walking and cycling routes, enhanced signage and interpretation. </p><p>In terms of access to the visitor centre, as distinct from the National Park, at the location referred to by the Deputy, this aspect is contingent on available staffing levels and are the subject of ongoing consideration in light of the overall business needs and within the pay frameworks in place at the time.  Any temporary posts that arise from time to time are advertised in the local media and/or my Department&rsquo;s website at <i><i>www.ahg.gov.ie/en/Heritage</i></i>.  While the visitor centre at this National Park is open on a seasonal basis from March to October, the mountain boardwalk and trails within the National Park are easily accessible over the winter months. </p><p>Our National Parks and Nature Reserves are there for all to enjoy and their locations around the country give everyone easy access to areas of unrivalled natural rugged beauty.  It has been, and continues to be, my intention to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, public access and appropriate visitor use in these parks and reserves.  Such access and use must, of course, be consistent with the ethos of the National Parks as natural places of peace and tranquillity set in scenic landscapes, as well as being compatible with the conservation and biodiversity considerations that are of necessity associated with the management of heritage properties. For example, National Parks and Nature Reserves are largely covered by designations under the EU Birds and Habitats Directives and all activities within these sites must be consistent with the requirements of those Directives.</p></reply>

They are then able to provide an early intervention in situations such as heart attack or cardiac arrest by providing, among other things, resuscitation and defibrillation.</p>  <p>  Cardiac First Responders (CFR) Ireland, launched in 2015, is the national umbrella organisation for Community First Responders Groups.  CFR Ireland is supported by the National Ambulance Service, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council and the Centre for Emergency Medical Science UCD.  There are currently 135 Community First Responder groups linked to the National Ambulance Service National Emergency Operations Centre.  If an emergency 999/112 call for cardiac arrest, choking, chest pain or breathing difficulties is made to the National Ambulance Service in an area where a CFR group is established, the on-duty CFR member gets a text from the National Ambulance Service at the same time that an ambulance is despatched with location and call details.  The First Responder then goes straight to the scene and administers initial care (defibrillation if required) until the National Ambulance Service Emergency resources arrive.</p>  <p>  This national initiative provides an opportunity to extend care for cardiac events.  In addition, the development of a national Automated External Defibrillator (AED) register is under initial consideration.</p></reply>

It is important that consideration be given to how best to provide public funding for fertility treatment.  To that end, Minister Varadkar commissioned an evidence review of international public funding models.  This review will provide us with a comprehensive report of the existing evidence using a systematic approach, which will be invaluable in determining the most appropriate funding model for AHR in the State. It is expected that the evidence review will be completed before the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  Separately to this evidence review, my officials are currently drafting a General Scheme of legislative provisions dealing with AHR, with a view to closing the legislative gap in this area of healthcare.  Once the General Scheme is completed and the AHR legislation is subsequently enacted, the Government will be in a position to provide fertility treatments based on the best model of funding for Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that while in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment is not provided by the Irish public health service, there is some support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.  In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE). Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;.  The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

A number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, an Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  These recommendations include the implementation of administrative reforms to the Scheme, and a review by the National Treatment Purchase Fund of the pricing system for private long-term residential care facilities.</p>  <p>  The Working Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners and, when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  This Group is due to report on progress to the Cabinet Committee on Health in June 2016. </p>  <p>  However, there are no plans to change the level of contributions made by participants in the Scheme towards their cost of care, and this is not part of the Working Group's remit.</p></reply>

These are the continuation of the previous support delivered under the Less Favoured Areas Scheme and a new targeted support for island farmers.  This support for island farmers was included in the RDP in recognition of the specific constraints island farmers face.  For example, island holdings are generally small and fragmented and farming these holdings is a low yield and labour intensive undertaking.  In recognition of these constraints, the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme includes higher rates of payment for island farmers as follows:</p><p>- &euro;250 per hectare for the first 20 hectares of island land farmed</p><p>- &euro;170 per hectare for hectares 20-34</p><p>- &euro;70 per hectare for hectares 34-40</p><p>The &euro;15 million commitment in the Programme for Government will underpin these payments and ensure sufficient funding is available in the RDP during the remainder of the term of the programme.</p></reply>

There is a requirement and obligation to ensure that the expenditure claimed by scheme participants reflects the reality of what took place.</p>  <p>  The person registered as the owner of the herd number cited was written to by the Department in September 2014 requesting the submission of alternative verifiable proof to support an invoice that was included in the claim for expenditure incurred.  A number of letters have been exchanged since.  However, no verification of the expenditure has been received.</p>  <p>  A further letter issued to the person concerned on 14 October 2015 informing them of a determination made by the Department which included the clawback of undue payments already made and the imposition of penalties as set out in the EU Regulations.

They were also advised of the option of appealing this decision to the Agriculture Appeals Office within three months of the date of the review letter.</p>  <p>  A further letter issued to the person named on 31 March 2016 giving details of the amount to be recouped.

A range of flight carriers make the appropriate arrangements for the safe transport of animals worldwide in accordance with the requirements of International Air Transport.

The Code of Practice emphasises that owners and keepers must take full responsibility for the physical and social well-being of greyhounds in line with best welfare practice.</p>  <p>  Oversight mechanisms in place regarding greyhound exports include inter-agency co-operation, co-operation with fellow members of International Greyhound Forum and from intelligence/information which is received from Welfare Officers during the course of investigations carried out under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.  Where any breaches of welfare standards are identified under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011, Bord na gCon takes stringent actions and prosecutions ensue in accordance with the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011. Bord na gCon expects the proper standard of welfare of greyhounds to be maintained in all jurisdictions worldwide and advises all owners involved in the export of greyhounds to only export to destinations that provide the expected levels of greyhound care and management as defined in the Code.</p></reply>

Farmers availing of the facility must pay at least one third of the bill in each of the first two years (2015 and 2016) with the balance to be paid in 2017.  The Department implemented the scheme nationally and 3,741 farmers (out of a total of 6,109 farmers who incurred the levy) deferred repayments of &euro;35.6m in superlevy liability, (out of a total national levy liability of &euro;71.2m). </p>  <p>  The mechanism required the Exchequer to pay the superlevy liability to the EU in full in 2015, and to recover the levy from farmers over the three years from 2015 to 2017.  A wide process of consultation in the design of the scheme was undertaken with farm organisations and co-ops and it was agreed that once the initial farmer instalment was paid in 2015, the optimum repayment model for the balancing payments would involve ten equal instalments from the months of May-September in 2016 and 2017. </p>  <p>  These amounts will be deducted by co-ops from a farmer&rsquo;s monthly milk cheques to coincide with the peak milk supply months of April to August.  The co-ops will then forward the money each month to the Department.  This approach was also agreed as part of the sanction given by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.   </p>  <p>  As part of the discussions in the run-up to the March Council of Agriculture Ministers, Ireland proposed a further deferral of the payment to 2017 and 2018, to ease the financial burden on liable farmers in 2016.  However the European Commission advised that the legal basis for the Regulations under-pinning the scheme are no longer in existence and therefore further amendments were not possible.  While Ireland suggested a possible alternative legal approach, it was clear that the proposal enjoyed very little support from other Member States and was therefore unlikely to succeed. </p>  <p>  On that basis the focus turned to other measures in the package which can be of assistance to Irish dairy farmers to help them through current difficulties, including the doubling of intervention fixed price buying-in thresholds.  I did however raise the matter with Commissioner Phil Hogan in our recent bilateral meeting, as well as at yesterday&rsquo;s Council of Minister&rsquo;s meeting, and encouraged the Commission to reflect again on whether a legal basis could be found to facilitate a further deferral in superlevy repayments for farmers.</p></reply>

It now operates 37 Irish registered aircraft, out of several European bases, and has several hundred people working for it.  The airline applied for a permit to operate to the US, including the announced services from Cork; however that permit is still pending.  The permit application has been subject to an ongoing public consultation process in the US. Multiple submissions have been made both for and against the application.  Those opposed to NAI have raised similar issues to those outlined in the Deputy's question.  My Department has recently made a public submission reiterating its concerns regarding the potential implications this case is having for the reputation of Ireland and Irish aviation.  The submission makes it clear that there is no basis for the irresponsible, unfounded and damaging public statements that have been made about the standard of social and employment protection in Ireland and about the capability of the Irish regulatory authorities to effectively oversee the safety of NAI&rsquo;s operations.</p>  <p>  The Norwegian Air Group has stated that its primary motivation for establishing an Irish airline was to have an EU based airline within the group (Norway is not a member state of the EU). Other reasons cited included the Irish aircraft financing regime, the considerable aviation cluster located in Ireland and the highly regarded Irish civil aviation authorities.</p>  <p>  The airline has stated that NAI has no Asia-based crew and that U.S. and EU-based crew will be used on NAI transatlantic services.  It also stated that Norwegian always follows the rules and regulations in all the markets in which it operates and offers employees competitive wages and conditions.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that I am fully supportive of the airline's US permit application and I look forward to the permit being granted as soon as possible, so that the airline can continue to offer innovation and competition in the air transport market between Europe and the US. </p>  <p>  I would be grateful if the Deputy could produce any evidence, and the source of any such evidence, that the airline plans to use its Irish subsidiary to bypass Norwegian employment laws, erode wages and disrupt work practices.</p></reply>

As set out in 'A Programme for a Partnership Government', our objective is to protect our national competitiveness from unsustainable cost growth and to deliver a job-fit business environment which ranks in the top tier globally.</p>  <p> The Costs of Doing Business Report published by the National Competitiveness Council on 21 April provides an assessment of Ireland's cost competitiveness performance vis-a-vis a range of competitor countries.  The report, which has been noted by Government, concentrates on the costs that are largely domestically determined such as labour, property, transport, energy, water, waste, communications, credit /financial, and business service.  It finds that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last five years.  This has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in.  However, despite these improvements, Ireland remains a relatively high cost location for a range of key business inputs and there is upward cost pressure evident in property, business services and the labour market. The Council warns that Ireland is particularly vulnerable to external shocks beyond our control &ndash; external risks at the moment include in particular Brexit, oil prices and exchange rate movements. </p>  <p>  The report is a timely reminder of the risks of complacency regarding our cost competitiveness performance.  The improved competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s exporting sector has been one of Ireland&rsquo;s greatest strengths in recent years and has been central to economic growth and job creation. It has been critical to the success of Irish based exporters, allowing them to maximise the opportunities arising from increases in global demand.  Even with improvements in competitiveness, threats to continued economic success abound. While the Irish economy is experiencing rapid growth, the global economic outlook is less certain, with growth prospects in emerging and advanced economics far from certain. </p>  <p>  I share the Council&rsquo;s view that to protect the gains achieved to date, to further embed and sustain the recovery, and to ultimately spread the benefits of economic growth to all, we must continue to enhance all aspects of our competitiveness.</p>  <p>  Addressing Ireland&rsquo;s international cost competitiveness is a key economic policy priority for Government and as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, a range of initiatives are in train across Government Departments to support cost competitiveness.  To date, the National Competitiveness Council has reported regularly to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Jobs where its recommendations are progressed by relevant line Departments.  This facilitates timely attention to areas of opportunity for improvement.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Council and my Department and its agencies are continually engaged with relevant stakeholders on the particular policy needs required to support cost competitiveness.  These stakeholders include other Government Departments, regulatory bodies and public and private bodies. In this regard, there is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage their cost base and drive efficiency, thus creating a virtuous circle between the costs of living, wage expectations and cost competitiveness. Measures that ensure open and competitive markets are also essential.  The policy implications of the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2016 report&rsquo;s analysis, and associated structural reforms required to address Ireland&rsquo;s cost base, will be included in the Council&rsquo;s annual Competitiveness Challenge report which will be brought to Government published later this year.</p></reply>

We have made substantial progress since the Action Plan for Jobs process was first introduced in 2012.  We can point to the considerable strides made with 1.9 million people at work today (QNHS Q4 2015) and an unemployment rate down to 8.4 percent in April 2016.</p>  <p>  Yet, we still have some way to go.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets out a target to create an additional 200,000 jobs over the period 2016 to 2020, informed by our statement on enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025, which set out Ireland&rsquo;s potential across a number of key metrics.  Achieving our ambition for sustainable job growth will require a continued cross government focus on addressing the challenges and realising the ambition set out in Enterprise 2025. </p>  <p>  To deliver on this ambitious target, in the Programme for Government we commit to maintaining the OECD endorsed Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) Process that will set out, on an annual basis, the best ideas for job creation within available resources.  Building on this process, we will also implement regional jobs plans, with local input, to help spread growth to all areas.  Our aim is for an unemployment rate in each region that is within one percent of the State average by 2020.</p>  <p>  The focus on job creation is a government wide agenda, and it involves:</p>  <p>    - One: a focus on achieving a leap forward in the capacity and the performance of enterprises based here/ and in attracting further investment : we will put in place an extra &euro;500 million in capital funding to accelerate export led jobs growth across Ireland&rsquo;s regions;</p>  <p>    - Two: focusing investments in areas where Ireland can differentiate itself internationally &ndash; specifically Talent (education &amp;amp; Skills); Place-making (attractive places to live and work); Innovation (continuing to invest and stimulating increased RD&amp;I activity by enterprises) and being Connected (including through our trade and investment linkages, collaborations and clustering): among other initiatives, we will double the number of apprenticeships by 2020 and promote creativity and entrepreneurial capacity in students; increase the capital budget for local and regional roads by 50 percent in the years ahead as the national finances are repaired; and</p>  <p>   - Three: excelling on getting the fundamentals right in terms of finance, cost competitiveness, tax environment and economic infrastructures.  The Programme for Government commits to introducing tax incentives to support our entrepreneurs and job creators, including further reducing Capital Gains Tax for new start-ups, and increasing the earned income tax credit for the self-employed.  We will maintain a focus on protecting our national competitiveness from unsustainable cost growth.</p>  <p>  Only a strong economy supporting people at work can pay for the services needed to create a fair society.  It is entrepreneurs and businesses that create jobs.  Our aim is to provide a supportive environment for enterprise and employment and to ensure that we deliver on our ambition for more inclusive prosperity.

The purpose of an examinership is to facilitate the survival of the company and the whole or part of its undertaking as a going concern.  Examinership allows some breathing space for potentially viable but ailing companies.  The main advantage of examinership is the court protection afforded to the company from any actions brought by larger creditors to the detriment of all, including employees.  The process involves the appointment of an examiner who will then consider various &ldquo;rescue plans&rdquo; (such as restructuring) designed to get the company back on its feet.  During an examinership (a period that lasts 70 days but can be extended to 100 days) a company continues to trade and operate as usual.</p>  <p>  As the company concerned is under the protection of the Court it would be inappropriate for me to comment further. </p></reply>

This measure, which will be introduced  from September 2016, means that children will be eligible to start free pre-school when they reach the age of 3, and continue to avail of free pre-school until they start primary school (once the child is not older than 5&frac12; years at the end of the pre-school year i.e. end June).  Following the introduction of the expanded programme there will be three opportunities each year - in September, January and April - for eligible children to enrol for the free pre-school provision.  This will ensure that children aged 3 or over have the opportunity to enrol as soon as possible after their third birthday.</p>  <p>  The expansion of the ECCE programme will see the number of children benefitting from the Programme rise from around 67,000 to around 127,000 in a given programme year.  For the 2016/17 programme year, it is estimated that 89,500 children will be eligible to enrol in the Programme from September 2016, an additional 22,000 from January 2017 and a further 15,500 from April 2017.</p>  <p>  My Department made detailed information available to the City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs), including Kildare CCC, at the beginning of this year indicating the number of children, by every electoral division across the country, who would be eligible for an ECCE place in September 2016, January 2017 and April 2017.  My Department continues to work closely with the City and County Childcare Committees to match this data against their reported capacity in the sector to meet the increase in demand.  This exercise is almost complete.  Where any capacity issues are found, I will be asking the relevant City / County Childcare Committee to work intensively with my Department to resolve the issue.</p>  <p>  The Department announced earlier this year the introduction of an Early Years Capital Programme 2016 with total funding of &euro;4 million available.  This funding was targeted at early years pre-school providers that are making alterations to their services to accommodate the increased numbers of children eligible for the free pre-school provision following the decision to expand the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  The maximum grant available under this programme is &euro;10,000.  The closing date for applications was 8 April, 2016.</p></reply>

I have been advised by Pobal that an appraisal process is underway and that recommendations for approval of funding, in line with the published criteria, will be with my Department by early June.

The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) is a cross-Government initiative, led by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and involving the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills and others.  The model will deliver seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE programme.  These are:</p><p>Level 1 -<b>An Inclusive Culture</b>: includes training dedicated Inclusion Co-ordinators in pre-schools, and a small capitation increase for particular childcare services to support fully inclusive practice;</p><p>Level 2 - <b>Information for Parents and Providers:</b>includes development of a national website and information packs for parents and providers;</p><p>Level 3 - <b>A Qualified and Confident Workforce:</b>resourcing formal and informal training for early years practitioners to support more inclusive provision;</p><p>Level 4 - <b>Expert Educational Advice &amp;amp; Support:</b>enhancing the Better Start Early Years Specialist Service so that practitioners have prompt access to advice and support from experts in early years education for children with disabilities;</p><p>Level 5 - <b>Equipment, Appliances and Minor Alterations:</b>the provision of specialised equipment, appliances or capital grants towards the cost of minor building alterations so that children with disabilities can participate in pre-school;</p><p>Level 6 - <b>Therapeutic Intervention:</b>additional resources to enable access to HSE therapeutic services, where these are needed to allow a child enrol, and fully participate in, pre-school.</p><p>Level 7 - <b>Additional Assistance:</b>where the supports available at levels 1-6 are not sufficient to meet a child&rsquo;s needs, additional capitation can be made available to childcare providers to support the pre-school leader to ensure children&rsquo;s full participation.  This could include, for example, buying in additional support, or, in particular circumstances, reducing the staff:child ratio.</p><p>Work is well advanced across many elements of the model with a view to introducing the initiative from September 2016.  It is intended that service providers and parents will be able to submit applications for supports under the new model from June 2016 onwards to allow them to plan for pre-school enrolment in September 2016 and to ensure that children will begin to benefit from these measures from that point forward.</p><p>Funding of &euro;14.35 million has been provided by my Department for the implementation of the scheme in 2016.  The model will build incrementally over a number of years with full implementation costs in 2020 estimated at almost &euro;40 million. </p><p>Finally, the Deputy has asked specifically about funding for the provision of Special Needs Assistants.  The model does not involve the provision of special needs assistants and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs does not fund such services.  The HSE does, on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis, make some supports available and it is expected that these arrangements will continue until the new model has been established.  </p></reply>
