The research showed that the average costs of the diets supplemented under the scheme could be met from within one third of the current rate of personal social welfare payments. A decision was taken to allow existing recipients to continue to receive the diet supplement at the current rate of payment for as long as they continue to have an entitlement to the scheme or until their circumstances change. This measure ensured that nobody was immediately worse off by the closure of the scheme. An increase in weekly means, including any increase in social welfare income including state pension, affects the rate of diet supplement payable. </p>  <p>  Community Welfare Service (CWS) staff who administer the SWA scheme continue to have statutory powers to award a payment or supplement in cases of exceptional need.  Customers experiencing financial hardship should contact their local CWS officer who may be able to offer assistance.  </p></reply>

The Health and Safety Authority are the statutory body with responsibility for ensuring that workers and those affected by work activities are protected from work-related injury and ill-health.</p><p>Furthermore, directors and senior managers carry particular responsibilities under the 2005 Act if it can be shown that an offence committed by their undertaking was attributable to neglect, connivance, consent or authorisation on their part.

This is compiled by the CE Supervisor with the participant, having regard to the participant&rsquo;s training needs, career plan and employment goals.  It is the responsibility of the scheme sponsor to ensure that all participants engage in training that is accredited on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) <i>or</i>in industry-certified training that is quality assured and provides value for money to the Department.  Training should be procured, in the first instance, from the local Education and Training Boards (ETBs) at low or no charge to the Scheme.  It is recommended that this is planned in advance with the ETBs so that the learning needs of participants can be met.  </p><p>Other training options must be procured through Departmental procurement procedures.  Any proposed training that exceeds the training budget allocated is assessed based on the value of the training provided, having regard to furthering the overall employment prospects of the individual.</p><p>Training for participants is monitored through the programme and training monitoring visits carried out by the Department on an annual basis.  In recent times, the Department has improved the programme and monitoring of schemes and the renewed focus on the training and development of individuals is leading to greater options and achievements for the learner.  The role of the sponsoring organisation and the CE supervisor in the provision of training, guidance and support is also critical to achieving positive outcomes.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-02-03a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016020300004#WRA01600"><p>I understand that the Deputy is proposing to apply a tax on the profits of tobacco companies. The Deputy may be aware that the Irish Heart Foundation proposed a similar levy in its pre-Budget 2016 submission. I take all proposals made as part of the Budget and Finance Bill process under consideration, and will continue to do so. </p>  <p>   In Ireland profits of companies are taxed through corporation tax. Ireland's corporate tax rate of 12.5% on trading income is akin to a brand and is an important part of the Government's strategy of creating an enterprise friendly environment to attract jobs and investment to Ireland. One of the main features of the rate is its simplicity and the fact that it applies to a broad base. </p>  <p>  The Deputy's suggested approach would involve complexity and could undermine the attractiveness of Ireland's corporate tax offering.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to predict the effect such a levy would have on the behaviour and decisions of companies within the State. This uncertainty in relation to responses prevents a reliable estimate being made of any yield that might accrue to the Exchequer if such a levy were imposed on their profits. The proposal could also give rise to State Aid implications. </p></reply>

Up until 2018 however, tax relief continues to be available for interest paid on all qualifying home loans taken out on or after 1 January 2004 and on or before 31 December 2012, regardless of whether the individuals concerned are first-time buyers or non-first-time buyers.</p><p>Mortgage interest relief was restricted in Finance Act 2009 so that, with effect from 1 May 2009, the interest payable on a qualifying home loan qualified for tax relief only for the first 7 tax years of the life of that loan.  This applied to the interest payable on existing and new qualifying home loans by both first-time buyers and by non first-time buyers.</p><p>There was no change in the rate at which tax relief was available to first-time buyers, which was as follows: </p><p>-  25 per cent of relievable interest for years 1 and 2; </p><p>-  22.5 per cent of relievable interest for years 3, 4 and 5; and -</p><p>-  20 per cent of relievable interest for years 6 and 7.</p><p>For non first-time buyers, the rate of relief was 15% of relievable interest.Relievable interest is the amount of interest paid, subject to a ceiling on the maximum amount that can be relieved, as follows: </p><p>-  In the case of a first-time buyer in the first seven years of entitlement - &euro;10,000 (&euro;20,000 for a married individual/civil partner/widowed individual) and  </p><p>-  In other cases &euro;3,000 (&euro;6,000 for a married individual/civil partner/widowed individual).</p><p>Where mortgage interest relief would otherwise have ceased in 2010 or later, Finance Act 2010 extended the tax relief to 2017 at prevailing rates and ceilings.  That Act also extended the tax relief to 2017 on interest paid on new qualifying home loans taken out on or before 31 December 2012. There was no subsequent change to the rates or ceilings in respect of first time buyers who took out a loan in 2009 or 2010.</p><p>Finance Act 2012 subsequently introduced a new rate of relief of 30% of relievable interest, again subject to the ceilings above, as respects qualifying interest paid on a qualifying loan taken out on or after 1 January 2004 and on or before 31 December 2008.  This applied to the purchase of an individual's first qualifying residence or second or subsequent qualifying residence but only where the first qualifying residence was purchased on or after 1 January 2004.  The rationale behind this change was to help address the particular problems faced by those who bought homes at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008, fulfilling the commitment in the Programme for Government.</p><p>Further detailed information in relation to mortgage interest relief is available from Tax and Duty Manual 08.03.08 which is available on the Revenue website - .</p></reply>

This  may be paid where it is a direct continuation of an illness under the Critical Illness Protocol andfurther period of sick leave is required to rehabilitate from the critical illness/injury; </p><p>-  an occupational health physician certifies that there is a reasonable prospect of the individual returning to work and giving regular and effective service; and </p><p>-  the decision to award the additional period of temporary rehabilitation remuneration is reviewed every 6 months.  </p><p>While I have outlined the general provisions of the  Sick Leave Scheme that relate to critical illnesses it is the individual's circumstances, including their sick leave record and the nature of the illness, that are relevant in determining their access to paid sick leave.</p></reply>

A discrete argument in the proceeding was whether or not the CPSA was subject to Judicial Review in the circumstances before the Court. The Court ultimately found that the CPSA was subject to Judicial Review as argued by the applicant, who was awarded his costs in relation to that discrete argument.  As the CPSA was successful in its defence of the substantive issue raised in the Judicial Review, I am satisfied that there is no need for actions and procedures employed by the CPSA arising from this case specifically to be scrutinised over and above the normal reviews undertaken on an ongoing basis by the Commission. </p></reply>

This whole of Government effort has been integrated into the Action Plan for Jobs process which aims to strengthen the enterprise base, support entrepreneurship and start-ups, regain Ireland&rsquo;s lost competitiveness and ensure the potential of the regions for development and job creation through Action Plan for Jobs-Regional is fully realised, supported by competitive regional funds.</p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs complements the Government&rsquo;s new Pathways to Work which sets out actions to be taken in support of those that are currently unemployed in order to help them access the labour market and new job opportunities.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s strategy is working. Since the first Action Plan for Jobs was launched in Q1 2012, 135,800 more people are at work. Action Plan for Jobs 2016, the fifth Plan, was launched in mid-January and marks the transition from an economy recovering from the most severe recession to a competitive, innovative, highly productive economy providing sustainable full employment for its people. It also marks the transition to the implementation of key Government policies that plan for medium term growth. <i>Enterprise 2025 </i>is our ten year jobs and enterprise strategy, which sets out the roadmap to build a sustainable economy and have 2.18 million people at work by 2020, the highest in the history of the State. </p><p><i>Enterprise 2025</i>was launched in November 2015. It sets out the potential to reach 2.180 million in employment and an overall unemployment rate of 6 percent by 2020. <i>Enterprise 2025</i>envisages an additional 266,000 people in employment by 2020 starting from a 2014 baseline. Achieving this ambition is based on the premise of export led growth and the additional indirect jobs stimulated by the activities of exporting enterprises in the wider economy. Annualised targets have not been set out in the strategy for job creation or specifically for reducing long-term unemployment.</p><p>The ambition is predicated on taking the actions set out in Enterprise 2025 which are focused on supporting the productive sector, enhancing our relative competitiveness, leveraging existing comparative advantage in key sectors, addressing structural issues in the economy, improving productivity and the capacity of enterprises to innovate. <i>Enterprise 2025</i>is complemented by the Pathways to Work (PtW) strategy 2016-2020 that that reflects a shift in focus from &lsquo;activation in a time of recession&rsquo; to &lsquo;activation in a time of recovery and growth&rsquo;.  PtW involves maintaining a priority focus on addressing the young and long term unemployed and also aims to increase labour market participation and employment progression of people who are not currently active in the labour market. </p><p>In addition, the Action Plan for Jobs sets out a more detailed annualised programme of action aimed at achieving the 2020 ambition and is subject to ongoing monitoring in term of delivery of actions and resulting impact. </p><p>Regional Action Plans for each of the eight regions in Ireland have been developed through a collaborative process, and launched over recent months. They aim to realise employment growth throughout the country, leveraging the assets and potential of each and every region in Ireland.</p><p>Through coordinated action across Government and strong alignment across relevant strategies we have ensured a commitment and strong focus on job creation, on reducing unemployment and on realising our ambition for sustainable growth over the coming decade.</p></reply>

Fishermen who may be experiencing financial difficulties while ashore during periods of adverse weather should contact the Department of Social Protection which offers income support payments, subject to certain eligibility criteria.  The new Seafood Development Operational Programme under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund was adopted by the European Commission in December 2015. That Programme provides a comprehensive range of supports for the seafood sector worth &euro;241 million, including a dedicated scheme of supports for the inshore sector to address the various economic and sustainability challenges facing the sector.</p>  <p>  In relation to specific measures to support fishermen affected by significant losses arising from adverse weather events, the EMFF and the Operational Programme provide for the establishment by fishermen of a Mutual Fund for Adverse Climatic events and Environmental Incidents, which when established can provide aid to fishermen affiliated to the Fund in line with pre-defined rules. The Operational Programme will co-fund the Mutual Fund, together with subscriptions from member fishermen. In that sense, the viability of such a Mutual Fund is dependent on the extent to which fishermen commit to membership of that Fund. </p>  <p>  Following the December 2015 adoption of the Programme, I launched the initial tranche of schemes on 14 January 2016 at the Government Press Centre with the support of the European Commission. Further schemes will follow during 2016. I will be discussing with fishing representatives how they may establish this Mutual Fund over the course of 2016.   </p></reply>

In this regard Gardai engage extensively with the community in Tallaght and elsewhere in a range of fora to take on board and respond to local community safety concerns.</p><p>It should be noted that the Recorded Crime Statistics published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for Quarter 3 of 2015 show some encouraging trends across a number of crime categories. In particular, the latest CSO  figures show a notable decrease of 47.4% in the number of murders recorded as well as reductions in other important crime categories such as robbery and weapons offences which were down 9.1% and 7.3% respectively.</p><p>The Government is tackling crime in all areas of the country by investing heavily in policing resources.  In particular, the Capital Plan 2016 - 2021 makes provision for the ongoing delivery of new Garda vehicles, as well as very significant investment in new technology and information systems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, amounting to an investment of &euro;205m over the life of the Plan. In addition, the Government has ended the moratorium on Garda recruitment and Budget 2016 made provision for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; this year bringing to 1,150 the number of new Garda&iacute; who will have been recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014.</p><p>  Early operational feedback from the Garda authorities indicates that the investments in policing are paying off. For example since its launch on 2 November 2015, Operation Thor has made a significant impact on crime, in particular burglary, with an estimated decrease in burglary of 34% when compared to the same period the previous year (these figures will be subject to further analysis and verification by the CSO in due course, in advance of the publication of the full official crime figures for 2015).  Operation Thor provides for intensive overt and covert patrols and maximises all available operational resources to prevent crime, disrupt criminal activity and apprehend criminals  .</p><p>While the deployment of Garda resources in particular locations is a matter for local Garda management in the first instance, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Tallaght Garda District is policed by regular uniformed units, community policing units as well as District Detective and District Drug Units.  It is also supplemented by resources from Divisional units including the Divisional Traffic Unit and the Divisional Burglary Unit.  I am confident that the greatly increased resources which the Government has made available will enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make a significant impact on all forms of crime, to the benefit of communities in Tallaght, as elsewhere.</p></reply>

This requirement exists in order to safeguard a child's constitutional and legal right to a certain minimum education. </p>  <p>  The legislation states that where a parent chooses to educate his or her child in a place other than a recognised school he or she shall apply to the Agency to have the child placed on the register. This includes children whose parent chooses to educate them at home. I am advised by the Agency that 1,111 children were included on this register on 29 January 2016.  </p>  <p>  Following receipt of an application by a parent to have their child placed on the register, the Agency arranges for a preliminary assessment, and if necessary a further comprehensive assessment to be undertaken, to determine whether the child is in receipt of a certain minimum education. Assessments are carried out by authorised persons appointed by the Agency. When the Agency is satisfied that the child concerned is receiving a certain minimum education, the child is placed on the register.</p>  <p>  Under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, the Minister for Education and Skills has a function to issue guidelines for the purposes of determining whether a child is receiving a certain minimum education. These guidelines were issued by the Minister for Education and Skills in 2003.  In relation to the review referred to in the Deputy's question,  I am advised that the Agency has initiated a consultation on the arrangements involved in carrying out the assessment process to determine whether a child is in receipt of a certain minimum education and how the Agency engages with families who are home schooling. The purpose is to inform the Agency's deliberations in relation to its delivery of services. The consultation commenced in November 2015 and has now concluded. It included on-line consultations and workshops with home schooling families and private schools and others.

In preparation for this, and in accordance with the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations, my Department considers it important to seek the views of children of primary school age in relation to what their concerns and priorities would be.  The Department is currently planning consultations with children aged 5 to 12 years.  The plan is to work separately with 5-7 year olds and 8-12 year olds.  It is anticipated that this consultation will be completed by June 2016.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-02-03a.106.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016020300005#WRB03400"><p>In relation to the first part of the question, I have no plans to publish a National Strategy on Children&rsquo;s Cyber Safety.</p><p>Responsibility for children&rsquo;s safety when accessing the internet and social media extends across a number of Government Departments. Areas of concern include cyber bullying, accessing illegal or inappropriate content, and the dangers of posting content online. </p><p>The Action Plan On Bullying, which was published in January 2013, clearly recognised the necessity to tackle the issue of bullying in a holistic way which saw schools as pivotal, but placed the issue within a much wider social context. Cyberbullying is just one aspect of bullying but one, given the rapid expansion of access to technology by young people, that has come much more sharply into focus. The implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying, which is being led by the Department of Education and Skills, provides the framework for the Government&rsquo;s absolute commitment to working with a broad base of interests to protect children and ensure a safer childhood.</p><p>The <i>Children First</i>National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children is also an important resource in the identification, investigation, assessment, reporting, treatment and management of child abuse, including bullying. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has an important role in this regard.</p><p>My Department supports the National Youth Health Programme which is in partnership with the HSE and the National Youth Council of Ireland. The programme's aims are to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion / education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings. The &lsquo;Web Safety in Youth Work&rsquo; resource, available on the National Youth Council&rsquo;s website, provides valuable advice to young people on reporting online behaviour and on passing on concerns about the protection and welfare of a child or young person.</p><p>In relation to illegal content and the posting of personal content online, the important role of parents in talking to their children and providing a space for them to explore issues and voice their concerns cannot be over-emphasised. Parents also have an important function in setting boundaries and implementing parental controls to ensure that their children are not accessing age-inappropriate material.</p><p>The Office for Internet Safety is an Executive Office of the Department of Justice and Equality and was established by the Government to take a lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children. As part of its work it holds an annual Safer Internet Day. This year&rsquo;s Safer Internet Day will be held on 9<sup>th</sup>February and the focus of the day is to highlight the issues around explicit self-generated images of minors being posted on the Internet, and how any image or video posted on the Internet immediately ceases to be private.</p><p>The Office for Internet Safety supports the Hotline.ie service, which provides an anonymous facility for Internet Users to report suspected illegal content, particularly Child Sexual Abuse Material, accidentally encountered online, in a secure and confidential way. In addition to Hotline.ie, there are a number of other websites such as Childline, webwise, Facebook and Twitter, that have the capacity to facilitate anyone to report a concern that they have come across online. </p><p>The second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the ratification of United Nations Treaties and I am answering on the basis that he is referring to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the United Nations Second Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. My Department has a co-ordinating responsibility for implementation of the Convention and its related Protocols. </p><p>The ratification of the Protocol is pending, to ensure that all arrangements are in place to fully comply with the related obligations. The substantive criminal law elements of the Optional Protocol have largely been implemented by the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.</p><p>On 23<sup>rd</sup>September 2015 the Minister for Justice and Equality published the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill. The Bill is currently being considered by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. It includes wide-ranging provisions to enhance the protection of children and vulnerable persons from sexual abuse and exploitation. These provisions include new measures to protect children from online predators. </p><p>When enacted, the Bill will comply with the criminal law provisions of a number of international legal instruments including the UN Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. Ireland will then be in a position to proceed with its commitment to ratify the Protocol.</p></reply>

In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold.  Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility, known as the Keane Report, recommended that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card and that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions for medical card eligibility.  Nonetheless, it is clear that there are people &ndash; including children - with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.</p>  <p>  On foot of the Keane Report, the Clinical Advisory Group on medical card eligibility was established by the HSE to develop a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of disease and appropriate operational guidelines for the medical card scheme.  I can advise the Deputy that the Group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions.  Having regard to the approach of the Keane  Report and  in advance  of the Clinical Advisory Group completing its work, I do not  propose to issue automatic medical cards to one particular group.</p>  <p>  As a result of a range of improvements of foot of the Keane Report the HSE is exercising greater discretion which is evidenced in the  90% increase in the number of discretionary medical cards,  from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 99,000 at 1 January this year.</p>  <p>Until we have universal health care and everyone has eligibility for health services, one will always have anomalies.  There will always be somebody who is just above the means threshold, or who does not have the prescribed disease, or whose condition is not sufficiently severe and, as a result, these individuals will not meet the assessment criteria.  Universal health care, to which I am committed, is the only solution to address this issue.  </p></reply>

It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil and Cervarix).  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and over 100,000 girls have received this vaccine since its introduction.</p>  <p>  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.</p>  <p>  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.</p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.</p>  <p>  I want to make it quite clear that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services.</p>  <p>  In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review, in which the HPRA participated, found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.</p>  <p>  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade administers a roster of election observers so that Ireland can be represented at an appropriate level in international election observation missions organised in the main by the OSCE and the EU.  The current roster was established in May 2013 for a period of five years.</p>  <p>  In 2013, two assessors external to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with a knowledge of election processes and experience of public service, undertook the independent appraisal and scoring of applications for inclusion in the new roster against the four criteria.  These were:  experience of election observation; knowledge of human rights and /or governance issues; language skills; and experience of challenging environments.  In the cases where the assessors declared a potential conflict of interest and recused themselves from the assessment of the application in question, two officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade jointly scored the applications in place of the assessor.  The assessors were paid fees of &euro;200 per day, over ten days in total, in accordance with the relevant Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular,  E12/1/70.</p>  <p>  Following the appraisal of all 263 eligible applications, the 200 individuals who achieved the highest scores were selected to serve on the new election observation roster.  A reserve panel of the next ten highest scoring individuals was also established, from which replacements would be drawn should any members leave the roster.  Since its formation, ten members have left the roster with four replacements appointed to date from the reserve panel.  The process of appointing additional replacements is currently underway.</p>  <p>  Ireland actively participates in the European Commission and European External Action Service - led European Observation network, which brings together election observation focal points from all EU Member States, together with Norway, Switzerland and Canada.  The network facilitates the exchange of information and international best practice on all aspects of election rosters, and helps to ensure that the operation of national rosters conforms to the highest standards.  At the most recent meeting of the focal points, last month, the EU confirmed that Ireland continues to be have a high success rate in having its nominees placed on EU Missions.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that all applicants have been treated fairly and impartially and all unsuccessful applicants were invited to request feedback on their applications. Furthermore, the independent review process which was established has facilitated two applicant reviews.  In both cases, the reviewer judged that the scoring of both applications was fair and impartial across all four published criteria.  In light of these considerations, no legal opinion has been sought on the selection process.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the current roster is well equipped to deal with the requirements of the EU.  The Department will keep the process under review taking into account developments at EU and OSCE level.</p></reply>

My Department now understands that the pupil has in the interim changed school.</p>  <p>  Should the school to which the pupil is now enrolled wish to apply for Assistive Technology support, the school should make such an application to the NCSE.

These defined areas facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs. Since 2011 new schools are established where the current and future demographics of an area require it.</p>  <p>  My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for additional school places will arise. The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Department of Social Protection in addition to information from the Department's own databases. It also uses data from the local authorities. With all of this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.</p>  <p>  On 17 November last, I announced that 4 primary schools and 9 post-primary schools will open in 2017 and 2018, as a result of the outcome of the latest demographic exercises.  This includes a post-primary school to be established in 2018 to serve the Firhouse, Dublin 24 area.</p>  <p>  The patronage determination process for new schools is a separate process, which is run after it is decided that, based on the demographic data, a new school is required. Parental preferences are central to this process and prospective patrons are required to provide evidence of demand for their particular type of school. It is open to all patrons and prospective patrons, including Educate Together, to apply for patronage of a new school under this process.  It is envisaged that the patronage determination process for the new post-primary school to serve Firhouse will commence before the end of this year. </p></reply>

With very limited exemptions, these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units as well as private rented residential accommodation.</p><p>All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).</p><p>Since the establishment of the PRTB, over &euro;30 million has been paid to local authorities to assist them in the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts, including the inspection of rented accommodation. Over 167,000 inspections have been carried out in this period. Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, local authorities have a strengthened legislative framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices where landlords are in breach of their obligations. Fines for non-compliance with the regulations were also increased; the maximum fine increased from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 and the fine for each day of a continuing offence increased from &euro;250 to &euro;400.</p><p>The idea of certification has been proposed before and there is merit in the proposal.

These include:</p><p>-  improving the enforcement of standards by local authorities by prioritising those properties more likely to be in breach of the required standards, and</p><p>-  in time, moving to a model where there would be a responsibility on the landlord to produce a certificate of compliance every three years.</p><p>In the short term it is my intention to promote best practice in implementing the regulations across the local authorities. The possibility of shared services across local authority areas is also to be explored. The regulations will be reviewed this year and the potential role of certification will be considered as part of the review.</p></reply>

My Department has since had a further meeting with the ILCU to address technical aspects of its proposal.</p>  <p>  Conscious of the independence of the Central Bank in its regulatory role in respect of credit unions, bilateral engagement has taken place between my Department and the Department of Finance to consider the potential regulatory and legislative implications of credit union involvement in the social housing sector.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank commenced a number of new regulations for credit unions on 1 January 2016. Prior to their commencement, following careful consideration, the Central Bank made a number of modifications including to Regulation 25(2) which makes reference to the fact that the Central Bank may prescribe, in accordance with section 43 of the Credit Union Act 1997, further classes of investments for credit unions which may include investments in projects of a public nature. The effect of these modifications is that regulation 25(2) now provides that investment in projects of a public nature can include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.   </p>  <p>  I acknowledge the recent modifications made by the Central Bank and the willingness of credit unions to actively seek a role in financing the delivery of social housing. I look forward to the ILCU&rsquo;s further engagement with the Central Bank on foot of the regulatory changes made and my Department will continue to engage constructively with the ILCU in relation to their proposal.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-02-03a.214.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016020300007#WRD04600"><p>I appreciate the concerns of the wider community in relation to these matters. The Litter Pollution Acts, 1997 to 2009, provide the statutory framework to combat the litter problem. Under the Acts, the primary management and enforcement response to littering is, in the first instance, a matter for local authorities.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for each local authority to determine the most appropriate course of action to tackle litter pollution locally, within the legislation provided, including the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean- up actions in relation to litter, taking account of its own local circumstances and priorities.   </p>  <p>  Penalties available under the Litter Pollution Acts for litter offences range from an on-the-spot fine of &euro;150, to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction, and a maximum fine of &euro;130,000 on conviction on indictment. The fines for continuing offences are &euro;600 per day for summary offences and &euro;10,000 per day for indictable offences. A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the Court to pay the local authority&rsquo;s costs and expenses in investigating the offence and bringing the prosecution. The latest figures available from my Department&rsquo;s National Litter Pollution Monitoring System, a system designed to monitor the extent, severity and composition of litter nationally, demonstrate that the litter situation is continuing to improve across the country.</p>  <p>  However, I believe that there is no room for complacency. Accordingly, as the Minister with responsibility for this area, I encourage a multifaceted approach to tackling the litter problem, incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education. As such, through the Environment Fund, my Department supports several anti-litter initiatives to combat litter across the country,   including: </p>  <p>-  The National Spring Clean,</p>  <p>-  The Green Schools Program,</p>  <p>-  Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL) - Litter League,</p>  <p>-  Tidy Towns,</p>  <p>-  The Local Authority Anti-Litter &amp;amp; Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grant Scheme, and</p>  <p>-  Negotiated Agreement with the Banking and Chewing Gum industries.</p>  <p>  Under the Anti-Litter and Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grant Scheme (ALAGS), which my Department has co-funded for local authorities since 1997, local authorities are responsible for selecting suitable projects for funding and deciding on individual grant allocations.   The scheme requires that projects selected should promote greater public awareness and education in relation to litter, including the issue of dog fouling, and since 2008, graffiti.  Under ALAGS, they should also, where possible, focus on voluntary initiatives by community and environmental groups and involve schools and young people in anti-litter and anti-graffiti action. Typically, eligible projects include local media campaigns, clean-ups, primary/secondary school competitions, exhibitions and the production of videos, posters and leaflets. The maximum grant for a project may be up to 70% of the cost, with the balance being met by local contributions. A total of &euro;690,000 was made available to fund suitable projects under the scheme in 2015 and I have already made provision for   similar funding in 2016.</p>  <p>  In addition, due to specific issues in the South Dublin and Wicklow uplands, my Department has provided support for the Protecting Urban and Rural Environments (PURE) project in that area. I made funding of &euro;90,000 available for the PURE initiative in 2015.</p>  <p>  I believe that raising awareness of the litter problem, particularly through demonstrating by our own actions a more responsible attitude to littering, is pivotal   to educating our young people in order to effect a change in society&rsquo;s attitudes towards litter disposal in future generations.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services. These very significant investments represent a step change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>On 22 December 2015, I formally launched the procurement process for the State Intervention to provide high quality, high speed broadband to all premises in Ireland that may not be served through commercial investment. The formal procurement commenced with the publication of the Project Information Memorandum and the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire. In addition, my Department also published:</p><p>-  the National Intervention Strategy &ndash; updated in December 2015, which takes account of responses to the public consultation which took place in July 2015 and subsequent expert analysis; and</p><p>-  the High Speed Broadband Map 2020 which follows ongoing engagement with industry and public consultation. </p><p>The Intervention strategy sets out a detailed service specification including a requirement that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of at least 30mbps download and 6mbps upload. It must also be capable of catering for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with consumer demand. It is therefore a matter for bidders to select the technology which will show how they propose to meet these contractual requirements.</p><p>Given the quality of the services we wish to see delivered, and based on the current absence of significant fibre networks in many parts of Ireland, it is likely that fibre will play a major role in any proposed solution. However, the technology platforms that will provide the final connectivity to the premises will be a matter for commercial operators to decide on in line with EU State Aid guidelines.</p><p>The 2020 map is available at . The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER. </p><p>The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services by the end of 2016 and includes Glanmire, County Cork. Where parts of the town or its environs are not covered by commercial high speed services, these will be the target for the State intervention.</p><p>The areas marked AMBER represent the target areas for the proposed State intervention. Members of the public can see whether their individual premise is in the BLUE or AMBER area by inserting their Eircode, and/ or address, or scrolling through the map. </p><p>The Government is determined to ensure that the network in the AMBER area is built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award. </p><p>In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of addresses in Ireland will have access to high speed services by 2018, with all addresses passed by 2020.</p><p>More generally, I am informed by the commercial operators that next generation broadband services have been rolled out to over 126,000 premises to date in County Cork with over 55,000 more expected to be serviced by commercial investment. Almost 86,000 remaining premises in County Cork will be covered either by further commercial investment or the proposed State intervention.</p></reply>

The initial phase of the consultation closed on 18 September 2015 and was designed to review the technology options that may be supported by the new incentive schemes. There will be two additional public consultation phases in 2016, before any decision is taken on the final design of the new schemes, which will give all interested parties another opportunity to participate in the development of the support schemes. A key component in the design of the schemes will be the consideration of available technologies, including geothermal energy, and will include an assessment of the their cost effectiveness and viability.</p>  <p>  The Energy White Paper - Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030, which I published in December last, commits to the establishment of a regulatory framework to facilitate the exploration for, and development of, geothermal energy resources. </p>  <p>  The question of the timing of future legislation in relation to Geothermal Energy will, at this stage, be a matter for the next Government to decide in the context of its overall legislative priorities.</p></reply>
