Since 1 July 2013, manufacturers are required, when placing a construction product on the market, to make a Declaration of Performance and affix the CE mark to each product.  The relevant harmonised European standard for concrete blocks is </i><i><i>I.S. EN 771-3:2011</i></i><i></i><i><i>Specification for masonry units - Part 3: Aggregate concrete masonry units (Dense and lightweight aggregates</i></i><i>)</i><i>.</i></p><p>Harmonised European product standards provide the methods and the criteria for assessing the performance of construction products in relation to their essential characteristics.  The harmonised standard includes the technical data necessary for the implementation of a system of assessment and verification of constancy of performance including third party oversight (determined as proportionate to the level of risk involved) which the manufacturer is required to comply with.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland <i>has also produced additional guidance to some harmonised European product standards</i><i>in the form of National Annexes or Standard Recommendations which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain products in Ireland.</i></p><p>The relevant Building Control Authorities are taking appropriate actions under applicable legislation to deal with this issue and my Department, in conjunction with the Building Control Authorities, will continue to monitor the situation.  Testing has been carried out in a number of affected developments which has confirmed the presence of deleterious material in the concrete blocks, including pyrite and sulphate.  My Department understands that in each case the costs of the resolution are being pursued, in the first instance, with the contractors and suppliers.  The actions taken thus far by the relevant parties involved would suggest that the regulatory system is functioning effectively and that an appropriate means of redress is being pursued through those responsible for the building failure.   </p></reply>

The current Programme having officially ended at the end of 2013 is being implemented by the Local Development Companies (LDCs) on a transitional basis for 2014 pending the roll out of a new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in January 2015.</p><p>  SICAP is one of my key priorities and in accordance with the Public Spending Code, best practice internationally, legal advice and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of the services to clients, the Programme will be subject to a public procurement process, which is currently underway.</p><p>My Department has already been involved in a high level of engagement with the Irish Local Development Network (ILDN) and other key stakeholders in relation to the new Programme. A number of consultation events were held, and an on-line survey on the SICAP Framework was conducted to give all interested parties an opportunity to input to the new Programme framework.</p><p>I am satisfied that the procurement process underway is in line with best practice and that the procurement documentation on e-Tenders contains all the relevant information on the process. I look forward to the outcome of the process and the roll out of SICAP in January 2015.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities and the purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.</p><p>In February 2013, I published the Government&rsquo;s <i>Homelessness Policy Statement</i>in which the aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined. The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness. The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.</p><p>On 20 May 2014, I published the <i>Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness</i>in which the Government's approach to delivery on its objective of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined. A copy of this plan is available on my Department's website,</p><p>This plan sets out a range of measures to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households within the next three years and mobilise the necessary supports. Progress in implementing the plan will be reported quarterly through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy.</p><p>Under the funding arrangements, responsibility for rigorous assessment, appraisal and decision making in relation to proposals for funding of particular services within the current budgetary allocation rests with the homelessness statutory Management Group of the respective region. My Department has no function in regard to decisions on operational matters which, in the case of the property in question, are a matter for the Dublin Homelessness Management Group, with Dublin City County Council as the lead authority.</p><p>While it is clear that a proportion of funding must be used to provide sufficient bed capacity to accommodate those in need of emergency accommodation, it is equally important that resources are channelled to deliver more permanent responses in a more focused and strategic way.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-17a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061700063#WRBBB01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 109 together.</p><p>My Department understands that the Mica Action Group recently met with a representative of the Pyrite Resolution Board in connection with the occurrence of structural problems in houses in north Donegal which appear to be related to the use of defective blocks in the construction of these houses. While testing appears to have been carried out on some of the affected dwellings, which has indicated that the problem may concern the presence of a contaminant known as Muscovite mica in the concrete blocks, my Department understands that no firm evidence is available to confirm the precise nature and scale of the problem.</p><p>The Building Regulations 1997 set out the legal requirements for the construction of new buildings (including houses), extensions to existing buildings as well as for material alterations and certain material changes of use to existing buildings and are divided in 12 parts (classified as Parts A to M). Technical Guidance Documents are published to accompany each of the parts and provide guidance indicating how the requirements of that part can be achieved in practice. Where works are carried out in accordance with the relevant technical guidance such works are considered to be, <i>prima facie</i>, in compliance with the relevant regulation(s).</p><p>Part A <b>of the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations </b>sets out the legal requirements in relation to structure. The accompanying TGD A provides guidance on how compliance can be achieved and, in the context of block work in houses, reference is given to the appropriate masonry design and construction standards. The materials to be used, e.g. concrete blocks, wall ties etc. are required to meet the specified minimum designations, strengths and other qualities, as set out in TGD A and the referenced standards.</p><p>Part D sets out the legal requirements for materials and workmanship. It requires that all works must be carried out using &ldquo;proper materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used&rdquo; and in a workmanlike manner to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations.</p><p>Primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings. In addition, suppliers of building materials, including quarries, have an obligation to ensure that the materials they supply are fit for purpose.</p><p>While I fully appreciate and acknowledge the extremely difficult and distressing situations that householders have to deal with when faced with the consequences of the use of defective materials or poor workmanship, building defects are, in general, matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, i.e. the homeowner, the builder, the manufacturer, supplier, quarry owner and/or their respective insurers. In the event that the contracting parties cannot reach a settlement by negotiation the option of seeking redress in the Courts can be considered. I believe that the parties concerned should face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate actions to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.</p></reply>

I am currently embarked on a programme of local government reform, which will see an enhanced role for local government in the co-ordination of local and community development programmes. The establishment of Local Community Development Committees, which will include various local partners including local development companies, will be important to implementing a more coherent and integrated approach to local and community development.</p><p>  We have a responsibility to citizens to ensure that available resources are targeted effectively and maximise the benefit for local communities from publicly funded programmes. Accordingly, we must ensure that the level of funding that is directed towards administration and management costs is kept to a minimum.</p><p>  In this regard, I have a strong focus on the local development programmes for which my Department contracts the local development companies. These companies form only part of a complex landscape that requires a more co-ordinated approach in order to increase efficiencies and ensure the maximum impact of all funding available at a local level. However, as deliverers of a range of programmes for various funders, they will retain an important role in the new architecture and I look forward to their co-operation so that publicly-funded services are delivered in a way that is more effective, efficient and , most importantly , centred on the needs of local communities.</p></reply>

While the priority i s to secure compliance based on actual greenhouse gas emission reductions , in the event that adequate mitigation measures cannot be mobilised in the time available, EU law (Decision No 406/2009/EC) provides flexibilities to enable Member States to ensure compliance through, for example, intra Member State trading.</p><p>The emission reduction challenge, as outlined by the Environmental Protection Agency, is well understood by Government, as reflected in the <i>National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development</i>and the <i>General Scheme of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill</i>which I published in April of this year.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to en able the State to move to a low-carbon economy.  Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the General Scheme of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill.</p><p>In anticipation of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a National Low-Carbon Roadmap to 2050, the primary objective of which will be to set out additional measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low-carbon transition agenda.</p><p>The issue of fines does not arise. In the event that it proves impossible to mobilise or resource adequate mitigation measures in the time available to ensure compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target, the flexibilities available to Member States under EU law may have to be used. At this stage, it is far too early to say or attempt to estimate the potential cost of making up any gap in the distance to the 2020 target through use of the flexibility provisions.</p></reply>

On foot of this commitment I asked the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) to commission research on such a scheme and to report back to me with recommendations in that regard. The subsequent report assessed a number of different options for delivery of a scheme ranging from one where all elements are delivered by the PRTB to one where all elements are outsourced to a private operator. The report examined each option in terms of both insurance and custodial type schemes. </p><p>In a custodial scheme, tenancy deposits are transferred to the scheme for the duration of the tenancy. They are then repaid by the scheme operator following agreement between the landlord and tenant or following the outcome of a dispute resolution process in cases where there is no agreement. The interest from the funds deposited pays for the administration of the scheme and there is no fee to either the landlord or tenant. In an insurance-based scheme, the landlord pays a premium to insure the risk of the deposit not being returned but retains the deposit. In the event of a dispute, the landlord lodges the total of the deposit with the scheme and it is repaid to either the landlord or the tenant at the conclusion of a dispute resolution process.</p><p>I considered all of the options presented in the report in order to determine how to offer the greatest protection to tenants at least cost to the Exchequer and secured Government approval for the establishment of a tenancy deposit scheme based on a custodial model. Legislative provisions for the scheme, which are currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, will be included in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 at Committee Stage in the Seanad.</p></reply>

As matters stand, the Board has received in the order of 500 completed applications and these are currently being processed. Each application must first be validated by the Board which involves an assessment of the application against relevant eligibility criteria and may also include an audit of the Building Condition Assessment. Approximately 185 applications have now been validated and forwarded to the Housing Agency for the next stage in the process, which is the assessment, verification and recommendation phase . The stage involves confirmation that the damage recorded in the Building Condition Assessment in respect of a dwelling is attributable to pyritic heave and may involve physical inspection of the dwelling and the testing of the hardcore material.</p><p>  Following completion of this process and approval by the Board for the inclusion of dwelling(s) in the scheme the next stage involves the awarding of a contract for the works and the commencement of the remediation works. While no contracts have been awarded at this point in time the Housing Agency , which is supporting the Board in the delivery of the scheme, is close to awarding a contract in respect of a small number of dwellings.</p><p>  While the Board and I are keen that the actual remediation works should commence at the earliest possible opportunity, it is inevitable that the various stages of the approval process will take a period of time to complete . It is not possible at this stage for the Board to give figures for the number of dwellings that will be remediated or in the process of remediation by the end of 20 14 or 2015 . However, the Board is committed to commencing work on as many projects as is possible in 2014 and 2015.</p><p>  In October 2013 the Government approved initial funding of &euro;10 million for the roll-out of a pyrite remediation scheme in 2014, an additional sum of &euro;1 0 million has now been made available to fund the operation of the scheme in 2015.  The post-2015 funding requirement will be dealt with at that stage having regard to developments over the next 18 months.</p></reply>

There are 34 recommendations in total which are broken into three broad categories covering Governance and Co-ordination, the Centrality of the Regional and Local Dimensions and Facilitating Economic and Community Participation. Full details of the recommendations are available on my Department&rsquo;s website .</p><p>The report&rsquo;s recommendations are far reaching and interdepartmental in nature and in this context will require significant consideration and consultation. The complex nature of the Departmental and agency interactions recommended in the report will require further examination and I am committed to working together with my Government colleagues to determine the best way forward with regard to the implementation of the CEDRA recommendations, working through the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Jobs.</p><p>I am confident that the implementation of the recommendations will ensure the development of strong rural economies that will support sustainable rural communities into the future. In the interim, the CEDRA report is informing the design of the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme 2014 - 2020. In this context, some of the areas which were identified in the CEDRA report and which could be supported under the Programme include enterprise and job creation, rural tourism and recreation, basic services for particularly disadvantaged communities, renewable energy and training.</p><p>I would also like to assure the Deputy that the Government continues to be committed to supporting the development of the broader rural economy evidenced by the fact that we recently secured 7% of the RDP allocation for the LEADER element of the programme when the regulatory framework only required 5%. This, along with an additional &euro;15m to deliver two small mainstream agrifood schemes will provide &euro;250 million in financial resources to rural communities in the 2014-2020 programme period.</p><p>In addition, and reflecting the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the types of issues raised in the CEDRA report, my colleague, Minister of State Alan Kelly announced, in May 2014, a &euro;10 million investment package to develop greenways and cycling routes across the country. Also, in April 2014, my colleague, Minister Pat Rabbitte, announced a Government commitment to a major telecommunications network roll-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as a cornerstone of its investment under the National Broadband Plan.  These are only some of the initiatives already underway that I am confident will contribute to the continued development of sustainable rural communities.</p></reply>

Subsequently the Council notified my Department that two houses in another estate may also be affected; it is understood that 17 houses in the three estates are affected by the cracking in the blockwork. My Department sought additional information from the Council which has recently been submitted and, together with the report submitted last October, is under consideration.</p><p>In March 2014, my Department met with a number of private homeowners whose homes are similarly affected by structural problems. The problems appear to concern approximately 15 houses and the period of construction for the houses involved was 1997 to 2002.</p><p>The Building Regulations 1997 set out the legal requirements for the construction of new buildings (including houses), extensions to existing buildings as well as for material alterations and certain material changes of use to existing buildings and are divided in 12 parts (classified as Parts A to M). Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) are published to accompany each of the parts and provide guidance indicating how the requirements of that part can be achieved in practice. Where works are carried out in accordance with the relevant technical guidance such works are considered to be, <i>prima facie</i>, in compliance with the relevant regulation(s).</p><p>Part A <b>of the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations </b>sets out the legal requirements in relation to structure. The accompanying TGD A provides guidance on how compliance can be achieved and, in the context of block work in houses, reference is given to the appropriate masonry design and construction standards. The materials to be used, e.g. concrete blocks, wall ties etc. are required to meet the specified minimum designations, strengths and other qualities, as set out in TGD A and the referenced standards.</p><p>Part D sets out the legal requirements for materials and workmanship. It requires that all works must be carried out using &ldquo;proper materials&hellip;which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used&rdquo; and in a workmanlike manner to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations.</p><p>Primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings.</p><p>While I fully appreciate and acknowledge the extremely difficult and distressing situations that householders have to deal with when faced with the consequences of the use of defective materials or poor workmanship, building defects are, in general, matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, i.e. the owner, the builder, the manufacturer, supplier, quarry owner and/or their respective insurers. In the event that the contracting parties cannot reach a settlement by negotiation the option of seeking redress in the Courts can be considered. I believe that the responsible parties should face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate actions to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.</p></reply>

I formed the provisional opinion to issue such notice on the basis that the Planning Authority had ignored or not taken account of a submission made on my behalf in November 2013 in respect of the proposed material alterations to the draft Development Plan and that the Plan is not in compliance with the requirements of sections 9, 10, 12 and 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).</p><p>The draft Direction outlined, <i>inter alia</i>, that the decision of the members to alter the policies and objectives in regard to the wind energy objectives as outlined in the draft Direction does not provide for proper planning and sustainable development and would therefore be significantly inconsistent with, <i>inter alia</i>, the Wind Energy Development Guidelines (June 2006). In this regard, planning authorities are required to have regard to the Guidelines when making decisions on applications for wind energy developments. The Guidelines were issued to planning authorities under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) and continue to apply pending any revisions to be made arising from the current focussed review of the Guidelines.</p><p>I recently extended by 4 weeks, the period for making my decision on the draft Direction, as provided for under section 31(16) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), in order to ensure that each submission on the report of the Inspector in respect of the draft Direction in relation to the Westmeath County Development 2014-2022 (and on the report of the Inspector in relation to the draft Direction in respect of the Mullingar Local Area Plan 2014-2022), as well as the reports themselves, are carefully considered.

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants in this sector.</p><p>  Receipt of a determination order is the official notification to parties of the final outcome of a dispute resolution case. A determination order sets out the terms to be complied with, including any payments owing and the length of time given to comply. In making determination orders, the PRTB-appointed adjudicators, mediators or Tribunal members as the case may be, can make provision to allow for payment of awards in instalments to facilitate recovery of the award, based on the circumstances of the case.</p><p>A party who fails to comply with one or more terms of a determination order is open to having legal proceedings taken against him or her in the Courts.  Under the Act, enforcement of PRTB orders is a discretionary power and the Board exercises this power taking account of the circumstances pertaining to each case. However, while there is no legal obligation on the PRTB to enforce, this does not in any way preclude parties from pursuing enforcement independently through the courts including the seeking of a garnishee order.  I have no plans to amend the legislation in respect of the enforcement of determination orders.</p><p>  It should be noted that going to Court does not of itself ensure successful enforcement and more particularly, recoupment of an award.  In many cases the best option, and one which the PRTB facilitates, is for the parties to agree a schedule of payments.</p></reply>

To the end of Quarter 1 this year, NAMA have identified 4,653 units as being potentially suitable for social housing. Of these some 1,849 units have been confirmed by local authorities as being suitable.</p><p>Of the current portfolio of available and confirmed demand properties, 684 units have been contracted or committed for social housing use to date. A further 451 properties are considered as being active transactions whereby terms are agreed or active negotiation is on-going by all parties concerned or where a detailed appraisal (i.e. determining the most likely delivery mechanism) is being carried out. An additional 702 properties are to be further appraised, signalling continued further future delivery in 2015 and 2016. Detailed information in relation to the delivery of NAMA sourced units, updated on a quarterly basis, is available on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website <i>(www.housing.ie).</i></p><p>My Department does not keep a breakdown by council area of the reasons for a local authority deeming a unit not to be suitable for social housing . However , it is estimated that in the region of 20% of the units deemed unsuitable were by reason of maintaining the sustainability of a community.  In addition, the composition of housing need in an area may not match the type of property available. Units identified by NAMA, as with all forms of social housing, must demonstrate that they do not conflict with the broad objectives of sustainable communities which are at the heart of housing policy. However, local authorities, particularly those in high demand areas, are reviewing the list of NAMA sourced properties to see if innovative solutions can be found that might allow them to bring units into use that were previously not considered suitable.</p><p>My Department and NAMA have set a delivery target of 500 units through this process in 2014, a target which I am confident we can meet . However, it should be noted that 2014 and 2015 are likely to represent the peak years for delivery of social housing from NAMA sources under the current model. Along with the on-going review of existing properties by local authorities, a greater focus on building out of incomplete units will be required in order to continue significant delivery of social housing units through this process.</p></reply>

To assist in the development of the Social Housing Strategy, the Housing Agency has invited submissions by 31 July 2014. This invitation of submissions is available at the following weblink:</p><p>.</p><p>With the benefit of the recent injection of &euro;46m for social housing, on top of the original housing budget of over half a billion euro, I now expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 6,000 new housing units. The number and method of delivery of social housing units in future years is determined in the course of the annual Estimates process and the Social Housing Strategy now in preparation will inform the upcoming Estimates discussions.   </p><p>It is clear that the present and foreseeable economic context in which we must address social housing need is such that innovative, and indeed challenging, solutions must be found which will harness new funding streams. While the local authorities will continue to have the lead role in addressing social housing need, in their capacity as statutory housing authorities, the growing role of the not-for-profit sector, as represented by the Approved Housing Bodies, and other potential investors must also be further developed. My intention is that the Social Housing Strategy will be both challenging and innovative, and will provide the basis for an enhanced approach to social housing provision in Ireland. It will contain clear measurable actions that are to be taken to increase the supply of social housing and, most importantly, reduce the number of people on waiting lists over the next five years. </p><p>Action 9 of Construction 2020 provides that the Review of Part V of the Planning and Development Acts, will be completed in Q2 of 2014. It is anticipated that any legislative changes required on foot of the review will be incorporated into the General Scheme of a Planning Bill, which ch is currently in preparation. Action 1 of Construction 2020 provides that a National Framework for Housing Supply be established on a statutory footing with an annual National Statement of Projected Housing Supply and Demand published every June. Implementation of these Actions is a priority for my Department.   </p></reply>

My Department administers the RAPID Leverage Schemes, which are designed to support small scale projects identified locally by Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas. </p><p>  Over the past three years I have continued to meet my Department&rsquo;s existing contractual commitments on RAPID projects throughout the country . In 2014 I allocated funding of &euro;1.9 million which is used for Sports Capital projects jointly funded with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. It is a matter for individual lead Departments to report on the provision of funding and progress on delivery with regard to projects under their responsibility in the different RAPID areas.   </p><p>  The RAPID programme has made substantial progress in identifying the needs of disadvantaged communities and in bringing forward important local projects in response to those needs. I intend that the focus will remain on tackling poverty and social exclusion in RAPID areas and this will be more effectively combined with other programmes and actions delivered on an area basis. This will be overseen by new Local Community Development Committees which are being established in each local authority area under the Local Government Reform Act 2014.   </p></reply>

My Department and the Department of Social Protection continue to work closely on the legal, policy and operational issues involved in developing and introducing HAP. </p><p>  Following administrative and statutory pilot phases in 2014, involving 7 local authorities, and a review of both phases, roll out to the remaining local authorities is scheduled to begin on a phased basis in 2015. The review process for the pilot phase will also provide valuable input in terms of informing the on-going resource requirement for administering the scheme.   </p><p>  In respect of the staff resources, the business process design exercise for HAP which was completed in 2013 involved input from all the relevant key stakeholders. This process included a preliminary examination of the organisational structure that will be required for HAP, including any change management issues that may arise. In the context of that exercise the County and City Management Association (CCMA), as part of the wider local government reform agenda, is considering the delivery possibilities including the costs and resource requirements. The CCMA, in conjunction with the local authorities involved in the first phase of HAP, are providing on-going advice to my Department in that regard. Limerick City and County Council as lead authority has prepared a business case, under the direction of the HAP Project Board, for the delivery of HAP by local authorities and the business case will be taken into account by the CCMA in deciding how best to deliver HAP. </p></reply>

The remaining 20% of LPT collected will then be applied to equalise the impact of this level of local retention between local authorities.  </p><p>  This year, the establishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisational and financial challenges. Service provision responsibilities are moving from the local authorities to Irish Water, infrastructure is being transferred, financing arrangements have altered and local authorities are operating on behalf of Irish Water under Service Level Agreements. These changes must be managed and, in this context, it was necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority for 2014.</p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and, therefore, a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.</p><p>  In 2015, in addition to the changes in water services funding, local authorities will be required to implement changes to their budget process arising from EU obligations, which will require them to prepare draft budget strategies by the end of September 2014 and they will have the power to vary Local Property Tax basic rates by up to 15%. Together, these are significant changes to the current local government funding model and it is essential that the impacts are fully assessed and that the effect on overall Exchequer funding is managed appropriately. </p><p>  My Department is currently considering the local government sector funding model for 2015, including the legislative implications, if any, in consultation with all relevant Government Departments. We will continue to work with local authorities to ensure that they have an appropriate level of information in a timely manner that facilitates their budget process for next year.</p></reply>

Its purpose is to identify the strategic risks, both financial and non-financial, which Ireland faces.  A public consultation process on the draft National Risk Assessment is now underway and submissions have been sought on significant risks that Ireland may face. Departments have been asked to bring the draft to the attention of any relevant persons or organisations that may be in a position to make a worthwhile contribution to a process.  Contributions from Oireachtas members on the draft National Risk Assessment would of course be welcome as part of this consultation process and I would be pleased to see a D&aacute;il debate on the draft if that was arranged by the Whips.</p><p>  A Steering Group representative of all Government Departments has also been established to take responsibility for progressing the National Risk Assessment process including the next steps outlined in the document.  It will identify what policies and processes are in place to mitigate against the risks already identified and consider the results of the public consultation process.  It is also intended to commission a review of governance of risk management across Government which will inform a more systematic approach to identifying and managing broad risks at a strategic national level.  It is intended that the final National Risk Assessment, taking account of the public consultation process and work of the Steering Group, will be published in the early Autumn.</p></reply>

The issue of a passport is, therefore, the culmination of an important and legally-binding process.  The checks and balances within the passport process embrace the standard principles that are provided for in the Act and help to ensure that the identity of the applicant is known and that the person in question is an Irish citizen.  This serves to maintain the worldwide good reputation and integrity of the Irish passport, which, in turn, ensures the safe travel and wellbeing of Irish citizens, as they travel abroad.  Moreover, it helps to combat passport and identity fraud.The Act underpins a long-standing passport policy in regard to the use of verifiable civil documents such civil birth certificates for first-time applicants.  These documents confirm the details of a person&rsquo;s birth name, date and place of birth, all of which are critical components of a person&rsquo;s identity.     The Passport Service received an application from the person in question on 20/06/2012.  As part of the standard examination processes, the birth certificate supplied by the applicant was found not to be authentic.  The applicant subsequently produced another birth certificate which has also been confirmed as not a genuine document.  </p><p>  In the circumstances the Passport Service could not be satisfied as to the identity of the applicant and as a result, the application for an Irish passport could not be approved.  The matter has been referred to the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

We have been working closely with our European Union partners since late 2013 on the response to the crisis.  The EU has supported mediation efforts by the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), and the important agreement signed on 9 May, which provides the basis for the negotiation of a transitional government of national unity. Under this process, the first meeting between President Salva Kiir and opposition leader, Riek Machar, was held on 10 June.  The EU&rsquo;s Special Representative to the region, together with EU Ambassadors, including Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador in Addis Ababa, continue to work to encourage a peaceful solution to the crisis.  </p><p>  The situation in South Sudan was discussed in detail at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on 17 March 2014.  Subsequently, on 15 May, the African Union and the EU met in Brussels and jointly welcomed the 9 May agreement, urging the parties to fully implement all agreements that have been signed to date. The Foreign Affairs Council of EU Development Ministers also discussed developments with High Representative Catherine Ashton on 19 May.  The Minister for Trade and Development, Mr. Joe Costello T.D., highlighted the need for progress by the EU in implementing a comprehensive approach to the political, security, and development crises in South Sudan. </p><p>Since the outbreak of the conflict in mid-December 2013, more than 1.4 million people have been forced from their homes and an estimated five million people are in urgent need of assistance. According to the World Food Programme (WFP), there is a serious risk of famine later this year   unless adequate humanitarian assistance can be delivered to those most in need.  </p><p>  At the South Sudan pledging conference in Oslo on 20 May, international donors pledged more than $600 million dollars in aid, aimed at preventing famine and upholding human rights in the country. This is about half of the estimated total funding required to allow for the provision of vital nutrition supplies, water and child protection services. Ireland pledged &euro;2million at the conference to support the emergency operations of  UN and NGO partners in the country. This includes the provision of &euro;1.36 million to our NGO partners in South Sudan to provide healthcare and protection to vulnerable women and children. In addition, we are providing &euro;500,000 to support the WFP&rsquo;s work in the country and &euro;200,000 to assist South Sudanese refugees who have fled to Uganda. This funding brings our total contribution in 2014 to some &euro;5 million. </p><p>  We will continue to monitor the situation closely and to support the work for a peaceful solution to the crisis. In particular, we will   continue to advocate at all relevant international meeting for increased support to the humanitarian relief effort both within South Sudan and for South Sudanese refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries.</p></reply>

The armed group behind these attacks, ISIS (The Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham/Syria), is a violent, fundamentalist movement, which has committed numerous atrocities in Syria and Iraq. They are very clear in their intent to overthrow regional states and to impose a draconian rule across much of the Middle East. They represent above all a threat to the security and human rights of all in the Middle East, with no respect for the position of women or minority communities. There have already been a number of reports from both Syria and Iraq of horrendous attacks perpetrated by ISIS against Christian communities in both countries. I also condemn and call for the immediate release of the eighty Turkish nationals, including diplomatic personnel, whom ISIS have taken hostage in Mosul.   The offensive by ISIS and its allies in Iraq was discussed at the Ministerial meeting of the EU and League of Arab States which took place in Athens on 10-11 June. The Minister of State for European Affairs, Pascal Donohoe T.D., represented Ireland at the meeting which agreed a joint statement condemning these events and calling for all democratic forces in Iraq to work together and for the restoration of security to Iraq. I anticipate that I will also be discussing developments in Iraq with my colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council next week in Luxembourg. </p><p>  The Iraqi authorities have a clear duty to restore order and protect the safety of all citizens, Shia, Sunni, Kurds and Christians. The peaceful conduct of parliamentary elections in April reflect the deep wish of the Iraqi people to have a democratic State, governed under the rule of law. It is critical that Iraqi political leaders live up to these ambitions and work together to bring this instability and terrorism to an end, including through early agreement on formation of a new government.</p></reply>

Accordingly, a simplified model that did not require the details of the registration number assigned to the last vehicle registered in each of the licensing authorities in each of the previous 19 years was adopted for issuing registration numbers for prior years. The simplified model assigns registration numbers starting from a particular number for each licensing authority regardless of year.  The particular number chosen had to be sufficiently high to enable additional unique registrations to be added.</p><p>  The starting registration number for each licensing authority was selected to ensure that there is no possibility of a vehicle being assigned a number that was previously assigned to another vehicle under the old system. As a result of this, the number will be higher than would have been assigned in the normal course of events for some years.</p><p>  This is a short-term phenomenon.  Vehicles presented for registration that were first registered in 2011 and subsequent years (in another State) will not be affected by this change and will be assigned the next available number in the sequence for that licensing authority and year of registration.</p></reply>

This further maturity extension removes a refinancing requirement of some &euro;20 billion for the Irish State in the years 2015 to 2022.   This extension of maturities has a number of significant benefits for Ireland, including smoothing our redemption profile, improving long term debt sustainability and it also has a positive impact on the cost of Exchequer borrowing through creating further downward pressure on our borrowing costs.  </p><p>  In February last year, the Irish Government replaced the Promissory Notes issued to IBRC with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds. This has resulted in significant benefits to the State including spreading the cost of the Promissory Notes from a weighted average life of c.7-8 years to c.34-35 years at a lower funding cost for the State, resulting in significant annual interest savings.</p><p>  As I have outlined in my replies to a number of previous related Parliamentary Questions, the Euro-area Heads of State or Government (HoSG) agreed in June 2012 that "it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns", and that when a Single Supervisory Mechanism, involving the ECB, is in place and operational, the European Stability Mechanism could recapitalize banks directly. </p><p>The Eurogroup meeting on 20th   June 2013 agreed on the main features of the European Stability Mechanism's Direct Recapitalisation Instrument or DRI. There is a specific provision included in those main features, which states that "The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement." Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it. </p><p>  On 10 June 2014 the euro area Member States reached a preliminary agreement on the European Stability Mechanism's (ESM) direct recapitalisation instrument (DRI). This now requires a decision by mutual agreement of the ESM Board of Governors to create a new ESM instrument in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM treaty and the aim is to have this process completed by November this year.   This would allow the ESM DRI to come into effect once the Single Supervisory Mechanism is in place and operational which is expected to be in November of this year. It will not be possible to make a formal application to the ESM for retrospective recapitalisation in advance of the Instrument being in place.</p><p>  However, both I and my Government colleagues ensure that Ireland's case for retrospective direct recapitalisation is made at all levels as appropriate.  I remain confident that the commitment made by the Euro-area Heads of State or Government in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns will be respected. </p></reply>

Since the Budget announcement about the reduction in the Air Travel Tax, airlines have announced the opening up of new routes resulting in significant increases in passenger numbers with the associated increase in tourism activity and employment.</p><p>  The additional 0.15% levy for 2014 and 2015 will also be used to help make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties although funds from the levy will not be hypothecated or specifically set aside for this purpose. The Government has decided that such liabilities will be met by the Exchequer as they arise.</p><p>  The chargeable persons for the pension fund levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.</p><p>  However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy. </p><p>  I am conscious of the significant contribution of taxpayers, generally, to the rebalancing of the public finances and the measures introduced to support and develop the economy. There has been progress in these areas. These efforts are ongoing, including the continuation of measures in the Jobs Initiative, designed to improve the economic environment by providing the means to encourage job creation in areas of our economy most likely to deliver that employment in the shortest timeframe possible.</p></reply>

It is designed to be an in-work benefit to support the primary carer to take up, or remain in, employment. It should not be considered as a supplementary source of income, on which the financial support of a parent depends. A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child is unsustainable in the current fiscal environment.      </p><p>  The new credit follows on from a recommendation made by the Commission on Taxation in its 2009 report. </p><p>  This measure was discussed at length during the passage through the Oireachtas of the Finance Bill, at which I brought forward an amendment to allow the credit to be relinquished by a principal carer such that a secondary claimant can avail of it provided they meet certain qualifying conditions. The Government, by allowing for such relinquishing, where a principal carer chooses to do so for whatever reason, actually provided for an additional option for single person child carers, over and above that recommended by the Commission on Taxation.</p><p>  As regards the potential of this change to interfere with living standards or the level of maintenance payments, if such reasoning were to be applied, then any general tax increase, as a result of an adjustment in tax credits, rates or bands could lead to similar situations.  Ultimately, maintenance payments are a matter for parents and if necessary, the courts to decide. It is not possible, and indeed would not be appropriate, for the tax code to take account of every possible variable.  I am confident that the new credit targets limited Exchequer resource to where they are needed most. </p></reply>

In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents. These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free childcare places to qualifying F&Aacute;S and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school. Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment.</p><p>In addition, a Single Person Child Carer tax credit of &euro;1650 is provided as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000. This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated. The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and<b></b>increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year.<b></b>To claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit a claimant must not be married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting.</p><p>The Universal Social Charge (USC) was introduced in Budget 2011 to replace the Income Levy and Health Levy. It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base with very few exemptions.</p><p>In Budget 2012 I announced that those earning less than &euro;10,036 would no longer be subject to the Universal Social Charge. This in itself has removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge and is of particular benefit to the low paid.</p><p>I have no plans to introduce a tax relief for parents to assist with childcare costs. To provide such a tax relief could be seen to unfairly discriminate against those individuals who stay at home and look after their children. This could result in married one-earner couples effectively subsidising a two-earner family.</p><p>While wanting to encourage female participation in the workforce, equally we cannot say to individuals who stay at home that they are making a less valuable contribution to society.</p><p>In addition, tax relief is only of benefit to those in the tax net and it is estimated that in 2014, 39% of income earners will be exempt from income tax. it could also be argued that any tax relief would most likely be absorbed by childcare providers in the form of higher prices.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. As the Deputy will also appreciate, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current budgetary constraints. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

This type of targeted intervention gets the best results while minimising unnecessary contact with compliant taxpayers.  The process of identifying risky sectors and taxpayers is greatly enhanced by the computerised Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling System (REAP) developed by Revenue. REAP contains considerable information on all self- assessed taxpayers and is used to profile business sectors and to categorise taxpayers in accordance with defined risk criteria. It also allows for the screening of all tax returns against sectoral and business norms and provides a selection basis for checks or audits. This effectively means that 100% of self-assessed taxpayers, including medical professionals, are risk assessed a number of times a year.</p><p>Revenue has a prioritised focus on those sectors that have traditionally been susceptible to tax and duty evasion such as cash businesses.  This includes risk evaluating medical consultants and other such professionals. In conducting this risk assessment, Revenue uses all sources of information available, including third party data sources like payments from the General Medical Services Board and other valuable transactional level data including invoices and receipts.  These sources are used particularly to corroborate information provided on tax returns.</p><p>I am also informed by the Commissioners that they are constantly reviewing their methods of identifying compliance risks and, where they establish potential additional data sources they seek legislative change to gain access to such data.  In that regard, since 2013 Revenue is provided annually with details of all credit and debit card payments from the merchant acquirers who handle such transactions.  This source of data, when matched against Revenue's register, is helping to identify those medical professionals and others who may operate on a cash only basis.  However, because there are costs associated with the operation of debit/credit cards, there can be valid reasons for a business to decide not to accept them.</p><p>I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are even-handed in the pursuit of non-compliers whether they are professionals or other sole traders and base their interventions on objective risk criteria.  As an indication of compliance activity in the area of medical professionals, Revenue has provided me with the following information, based on a wide ranging definition of medical professionals including General Medical Practitioners, consultants, surgeons, physiologists, psychiatrists and other specialist medical activities:</p><p><b>Compliance Interventions   Medical </b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2014 (to April)</th><th>2013</th></tr><tr><td>No. of Compliance Interventions</td><td>242</td><td>469</td></tr><tr><td>Yield</td><td>&euro;6.3m</td><td>&euro;3.3m</td></tr></table></p><p>Furthermore, the Deputy may wish to note the following data from Revenue's quarterly published defaulters' list specifically relating to hospital consultants and other medical professionals,</p><p>2014 (Q.1) -    3 with a yield of &euro;3.1m</p><p>2013 -            10 with a yield of &euro;1.6m</p><p>2012 -              7 with a yield of &euro;2.7m</p><p>I am also confident that the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing programmes that maximise voluntary compliance and deal in a very determined way with tax non-compliance, particularly in relation to cash businesses.  Of course, if the Deputy has any information that would help target medical professionals engaging in potential income suppression activities, I would encourage him to pass this information on to the Commissioners.</p></reply>

The lender must also provide the borrower with the advantages of the offer and explain any disadvantages.</p><p>If the lender is not offering the borrower any alternative repayment arrangement, the reasons for this must be given in writing. The lender must also inform the borrower that a copy of the most recent Standard Financial Statement (SFS) is available on request, and provide the borrower with details, in writing of: </p><p>- other options available </p><p>- the borrowers right to make an appeal </p><p>- the website of the Insolvency Service of Ireland </p><p>The same information must be given to the borrower if he/she does not accept the alternative repayment arrangement offered to by the lender.  Furthermore, the CCMA provides that if a borrower is not satisfied with the alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender, or if the lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement, the borrower will have the right to appeal that decision to the lender's internal Appeals Board.  If the borrower is not happy with the outcome of an appeal/complaint made to the lender, s/he can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO). Further information on how to make a complaint to the FSO is available at .</p><p>Regarding statistics on repossessions, the Central Bank commenced the publication of such data from the second half of 2009 and the following table sets out the annual position on this from that point in respect of primary dwelling properties:-<table><tr><th>-</th><th>2009 (H 2 only)</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014 (Q 1 only)</th></tr><tr><td>Court Order</td><td>58</td><td>102</td><td>196</td><td>194</td><td>251</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>Voluntarily surrendered/ abandoned</td><td>153</td><td>260</td><td>412</td><td>410</td><td>515</td><td>227</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>211</td><td>362</td><td>608</td><td>604</td><td>766</td><td>281</td></tr></table></p></reply>

There is no additional AIB ann remuneration for retirees outside of their pension payment. </p><p>Bank of Ireland</p><p>The publicly available information in relation to pensions is contained within the Bank of Ireland annual report for the year ended 31 December 2013. </p><p>.</p><p>Permanent TSB</p><p>permanent TSB is in a unique position in that its pension schemes have been wound up and the trustees of the various schemes are currently arranging for the assets of the schemes to be allocated among the pensioners, deferred employees and current employees. This process is still ongoing and details of benefits provided are not available.</p><p>NTMA/NAMA</p><p>As set out in the reply to the Deputy on 15 April 2014, two former employees of the NTMA are in receipt of a pension of between &euro;100,000 and &euro;200,000 and one is in receipt of a pension of between &euro;200,000 and &euro;300,000.</p></reply>

As you know it has been a stated policy objective of the Government to ensure that banks reduced their cost bases so as to be best positioned to support their return to profitability and the recovery in the economy.</p><p>The Mercer Report published last year and the subsequent direction to the banks to reduce their total remuneration costs by 6%-10% formed a central plank of that effort and as I have indicated on numerous occasions, all the banks met this directive. They did not all meet this requirement by similar means, but all had to navigate complex and difficult industrial relations processes, with staff current and former, ultimately contributing significantly to the effort.</p><p>Providing detailed data on the remuneration of thousands of staff at particular points during the year and particularly in different formats, is a time consuming task that diverts bank staff from their day to day roles. However it is perfectly reasonable for the State as owner, to expect significant remuneration disclosures on an annual basis which is why I requested that the State owned banks provide such information for end 2013, either in their published accounts or on their websites. I understand that the State owned banks have recently put this information on their websites. It can be found at the following addresses: </p><p>AIB:</p><p>.</p><p>ptsb:</p><p>.</p></reply>

At present, inflationary pressures in Ireland are more muted than those being experienced in the wider euro area, with end-April Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices data indicating an inflation rate differential of some 0.3 percentage points. Ireland registered an inflation rate of 0.4% compared to the euro area rate of 0.7%. Were a deflationary spiral - a prolonged period of negative price growth -  to take hold, this would likely be met by further monetary accommodation by the European Central Bank (ECB) rather than by its reducing interest rates. If, however, a relative inflation differential were to open up between Ireland and the rest of the euro area where prices remain depressed here yet recovered momentum at European level, this would result in a gain of relative price competitiveness for the Irish economy.  Given trade exposures to the euro area, however, the cost of imported inputs would increase.</p><p>  Given that the ECB is effectively constrained in the conduct of its interest rate policy by the current near-zero lower bound of interest rates, if deflation were to take hold without a corresponding offset in policy by the ECB, this could potentially result in an appreciation of the euro exchange rate which would slow euro area growth and pass through to Irish economic dynamics. The impact would be to reduce both nominal and real GDP growth, by lowering consumption and investment volumes as a result of rising real Irish interest rates. There would also be corresponding negative impacts on trade volumes and labour market dynamics.</p><p>  Quantitative scenario analysis of this type is routinely carried out by the Department of Finance in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute using their NiGEM HERMES model. Risks of this nature are regularly monitored and analysed and input to the conduct of budgetary planning in the form of the scenario analysis is routinely reported in the context of both the Budgetary documentation and the Stability Pact Update. Chapter 4 of the the April 2014 Update contains such an analysis.</p></reply>

This is achieved inter alia by greater levels of trade, a deepening of the Single Market and increased financial integration within the EU, all of which are facilitated by the single currency.</p><p>  While it is fair to say that the euro has been optimal in this regard, it is not to say deficiencies have not become evident in recent years. Perhaps the most obvious example of these is the negative impact of spillover effects resulting from inappropriate policies in some Member States affecting other Member States. A number of important institutional and governance reforms have been implemented in recent years which are addressing these difficulties. These include the six-pack, two-pack and the European Semester. All of these reforms are designed to ensure that Member States implement appropriate and sustainable economic and fiscal policies that take into account the euro area dimension. In addition, steps are being taken to create a safer and sounder financial sector by deepening the integration of the banking system through the creation of the Banking Union.</p><p>   This retro-fitting of the monetary union with the tools to make it commensurate with an economic union is a positive development and I would not understate the importance of the improvements that have been made. Having said that, it will clearly take some time for these reforms to fully bear fruit.</p></reply>

The impact on take-home pay and tax of individual public servants would be influenced not alone by the nature of the reduced tax relief (which is not clear) but also by issues such as the level of pension contributions being made, the marital status of the individual (married/single), the scale of tax credits/allowances available and the rate of income tax applicable in individual cases (standard rate or marginal rate).</p></reply>

However, given the wide range of businesses visited annually, the number of visits to particular types of businesses is not separately recorded.</p><p>On a more general note, the Revenue Commissioners have provided the following data as regards visits to businesses carried out by Revenue staff either solely or jointly with officers from the Department of Social Protection and/or NERA.<table><tr><th>-</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014 (January to April)</th></tr><tr><td>Number of visits carried out by Revenue officers only</td><td>1,982</td><td>1,548</td><td>582</td></tr><tr><td>Number of visits carried jointly by Revenue officers and Department of Social Protection officers</td><td>771</td><td>741</td><td>160</td></tr><tr><td>Number of visits carried out jointly by Revenue officers and NERA officers</td><td>180</td><td>336</td><td>126</td></tr><tr><td>Number of visits involving all three agencies   Revenue, Department  of Social Protection and NERA</td><td>69</td><td>111</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Total number of visits involving Revenue officers</td><td>3,002</td><td>2,736</td><td>898</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The European Commission has indicated that it will also review whether any issues raised relating to the regulatory framework require action.  </p><p>Setanta is a Maltese incorporated company which was both authorised and prudentially supervised by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). The Central Bank is in contact with the MFSA in relation to Setanta Insurance Company Limited, the impact on policyholders and the provision for relevant and appropriate information.  The current legal and regulatory framework for the provision of insurance in the EEA, and the supervision of that activity, is prescribed by European Union Law in the Life and Non-Life Insurance Directives. The provision of insurance throughout the EEA on a freedom of services basis and a freedom of establishment basis (i.e. a branch) within this framework is predicated upon the absence of internal market frontiers and the mutual recognition of the authorisation of insurance undertakings by Member States.  </p><p>The Insurance Directives specify particular roles for both the home Member State supervisory authority (i.e. the supervisory authority that grants an authorisation) and the host Member State supervisory authority (i.e. the supervisory authority of a Member State where an insurance undertaking conducts business of a freedom of services or freedom of establishment basis) of an insurance undertaking. Insurance undertakings authorised under the Insurance Directives are subject to solvency and financial reserving requirements, the supervision of these requirements is the sole responsibility of the home Member State supervisory authority. The primary objective of these requirements is to ensure that claims made in respect of policies issued will be adequately provided for by an insurance undertaking. </p><p>Under Article 20 of the Third Non-Life Directive the Home Regulator is required to notify the Host Regulator if the solvency margin of an undertaking falls below the statutory requirement. In such instances the Home Regulator should inform the Host Regulator of the measures it has taken to address the solvency deficit.  Following negotiations that were completed at European level in November, 2013, a new regime known as Solvency II will commence on 1 January 2016, which will further strengthen the EU regulatory framework. The Solvency II EU Directive sets out new, stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.  The new regime will also ensure greater cooperation between supervisors.</p><p>The Central Bank had Regulator to Regulator contact with the MFSA in September 2013. In October 2013 the Central Bank undertook a consumer protection inspection of Setanta. The Central Bank became aware of prudential issues in the course of this investigation and subsequently shared these with the MFSA in November 2013. At this point the Central Bank entered into a phase of heightened contact with the MFSA in relation to these issues. Regular contact was maintained in the following months, and in January 2014 an announcement was made that the firm would cease writing new business and issuing further renewals. The Central Bank wrote on 16 January 2014 to advise my Department of their concerns with Setanta's solvency margin and I was subsequently informed of this.  </p><p>With regard to the position of Setanta policyholders, my officials have been in discussions with the Central Bank of Ireland, with the Setanta Liquidator, the Accountant of the High Court and with the insurance industry representative bodies.  We are endeavouring to obtain legal certainty on a number of matters relating to unearned premiums and policyholders' claims for compensation and this will be made publicly available in due course.  When clarification has been received from the liquidator in the first instance, I will consider what steps, if any, will be appropriate.  At this time, I propose to set out the position as it currently stands.  </p><p>Setanta was formally placed into liquidation by the MFSA on the 30 April 2014 and a liquidator was appointed. Officials from my Department together with officials from the Central Bank met with the Liquidator and his representatives in Ireland on 7 May 2014 and the Central Bank is in ongoing contact with him regarding the position of Setanta policyholders. All Setanta policies have now been cancelled by the liquidator in line with the terms of the policies.  </p><p>With regard to Setanta premiums and claims, the position on each policy is for the liquidator to decide in due course.  My officials and the Central Bank will remain in close contact with the Liquidator and I have asked that public statements are provided to clarify matters for policyholders and claimants.</p><p>The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is a non-profit-making organisation registered in Ireland.  All insurance companies underwriting motor insurance in this county must, by law, be members of MIBI and contribute to the funding of claims in proportion to their market share.  The principal role of MIBI is to compensate innocent victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles. This is regulated under the terms of an Agreement between the MIBI and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We are endeavouring to clarify the position on a number of matters relating to policyholders' claims for compensation, including the role of MIBI in this regard.  However, if, for legal reasons, MIBI is not in a position to accept a claim, these third party claims will be eligible to proceed for consideration by the High Court for compensation from the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF).</p><p>Under Section 6 of the Insurance Act 1964 the Minister for Finance may, on the recommendation of the Bank, advance from time to time to ICF such sum as he thinks proper to enable payments out of . During the administration of Quinn Insurance Limited, Primor plc (formerly PMPA) and Icarom plc (formerly Insurance Corporation of Ireland) the State was required to advance funds to the ICF in order to ensure that the administrators were adequately funded in order to meet their financial obligations as they arose.</p><p>Claims on personal insurance policies will be payable from the ICF.  All ICF payments are subject to the limit of 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser. Under Section 3.6 of the Insurance Amendment Act 1964 (as amended) first party claims by a body corporate or unincorporated body are not covered by the ICF.  The refund of premiums for either commercial or personal insurance policies is not covered by the ICF or MIBI. </p></reply>

This standard is applied to transfer pricing arrangements of multinational companies in accordance with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations. </p><p>  The arm's length standard is provided for in section 835C of the TCA and applies to arrangements between associated parties which involve the supply and acquisition of goods, services, money or intangible assets. Section 835C provides that where an amount receivable in respect of a sale is understated or an amount payable in respect of an expense is overstated, the arm's length amount will be substituted in each case.  The arm's length amount is the amount that would have been agreed between independent parties. Section 835D of the TCA provides that the arm's length standard, set out in section 835C, is to be construed in such a way as to ensure, as far as practicable, consistency with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. </p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or to the mortgage interest rates charged.  It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.  It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed mortgage position of mortgage holders.</p><p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations.  The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997. </p><p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors, including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution s overall funding.  However, as part of the Central Bank s work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions.</p></reply>

There is, therefore, no statistical basis for providing definitive figures. However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, it is tentatively estimated that the full-year yield to the Exchequer from confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20% in respect of pension contributions to occupational pension schemes, retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts and confining tax relief for the Public Service pension related deduction to the standard rate of 20% would be in the region of &euro;467 million. This estimate includes &euro;90 million in respect of the Public Service pension related deduction.</p><p>  This estimate does not allow for possible behavioural changes that could arise from a change in the rate of relief.  In terms of the 2011 Income Tax year, the latest year for which the necessary figures are available, it is estimated that about 768,000 claimants avail of relief on contributions to occupational pension schemes, retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts.</p></reply>

The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers. The CCMA applies to the mortgage loan of a borrower which is secured by his/her primary residence.</p><p>With regard to the level of communications from a lender to a borrower, the CCMA states that: </p><p>21. A lender must produce and implement a policy regarding <b>communication</b>s with <b>borrower</b>s. That policy must be approved by the board of directors and must ensure that the requirements of Provision 22 are met. </p><p>22. A lender must ensure that: </p><p>a) the level of <b>communication</b>s from the lender, or any third party acting on its behalf, is proportionate and not excessive, taking into account the circumstances of the <b>borrower</b>s, including that unnecessarily frequent <b>communication</b>s are not made; </p><p>b) <b>communication</b>s with <b>borrower</b>s are not aggressive, intimidating or harassing; </p><p>c) <b>borrower</b>s are given sufficient time to complete an action they have committed to before follow up <b>communication </b>is attempted. In deciding what constitutes sufficient time, consideration must be given to the action that a <b>borrower </b>has committed to carry out, including whether he/she may require assistance from a third party in carrying out the action; and </p><p>d) steps are taken to agree future <b>communication </b>with <b>borrower</b>s. </p><p>Communication is defined, in the CCMA, as &quot;the imparting or exchanging of information between a lender and a borrower by speaking, on paper or another durable medium, or using any other medium&quot;.  In addition, a lender must maintain recordings of all Arrears Support Unit telephone calls made to or from a borrower in relation to his/her arrears or pre-arrears.  The intention of this provision is to strengthen protection for borrowers by facilitating compliance monitoring.  </p><p>For mortgage loans not secured by a primary residence, consumers are afforded protection under the Consumer Protection Code 2012. This Code states that:</p><p>8.13  A <b>regulated entity </b>must ensure that the level of contact and communications from the <b>regulated entity</b>, or any third party acting on its behalf, with a <b>personal consumer </b>in <b>arrears</b>, is proportionate and not excessive. </p><p>8.14  Each calendar month, a <b>regulated entity</b>, and/or any third party acting on its behalf, must not initiate more than three unsolicited communications, by whatever means, to a <b>personal consumer </b>in respect of <b>arrears</b>. </p><p>The three unsolicited communications include any communication where contact is attempted but not made with the <b>personal consumer </b>but do not include: </p><p>a) any communication that has been requested by, or agreed in advance with, the <b>personal consumer</b>; and </p><p>b) any communication to the <b>personal consumer </b>the sole purpose of which is to comply with the requirements of this Code or other regulatory requirements. </p><p>If a borrower is not happy with the way that their lender is dealing with them or if they think they are not complying with the Codes, the borrower can make a complaint to their lender.  Borrowers can also make an appeal to the lender's Appeals Board.  If the borrower is not happy with the outcome of the appeal/complaint made to the lender they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO). Further information on how to make a complaint to the FSO is available at . The FSO can work with the Central Bank to address persistent patterns of complaints. </p><p>I cannot comment on the  case to which the Deputy refers as I do not have specific details. I have previously informed the House that my officials are developing legislation on the sale of loan books to unregulated entities. This will address concerns surrounding the continued applicability of the Codes after loan books are sold to unregulated entities.</p></reply>

I am advised that the general position is as follows.  In early 2013, the NTMA Chief Executive committed to a review of NTMA policy in respect of notice periods and post-termination restrictions on employment. Accordingly, the law firm Matheson was engaged by the NTMA to:<blockquote>(i) advise on market norms in the private sector in terms of notice periods and post-termination restrictions;<br /><br />(ii) assess the adequacy of the protections in the current NTMA employment contracts/codes of conduct where employees leave the NTMA to join a commercial entity in the private sector that might gain an unfair advantage by employing them;  and<br /><br />(iii) recommend changes that could be made in this area by the NTMA.</blockquote>This review applied across all the NTMA's business areas, including NAMA.  All NAMA staff are employees of the NTMA and under Section 42 of the National Asset Management Agency Act, 2009 the NTMA assigns staff to NAMA.  Other than a small number of staff reassigned from other functions within the NTMA, NAMA staff are employed on the basis of specified purpose contracts their employment lasts for as long as NAMA requires their particular function.  Matheson's principal recommendations were as follows:<blockquote>- longer notice periods (3 to 6 months) to be introduced for middle and senior NTMA management employees;<br /><br />- garden leave provisions to be included in all NTMA employment contracts; and<br /><br />- post-termination employment restrictions (including cooling-off periods and non-solicitation of employees) to be considered on a case-by-case basis in respect of senior NTMA management employees in particular.</blockquote>However, Matheson stressed that the imposition of such restrictions would need to be balanced against the NTMA's need to recruit good candidates for whom such restrictions may act as a significant disincentive to taking up employment with the NTMA.  Furthermore, to maximise the prospects of enforceability, Matheson advised that any such restrictions would need to be drafted as narrowly as possible.  It was proposed by Matheson that any required changes resulting from these recommendations would be introduced for new NTMA employees and for existing NTMA employees on promotion. The NTMA has accepted the Matheson proposals and is implementing them on this basis.</p><p>With regard to staff assigned to NAMA, it should be noted that the 3 month notice period and garden leave provision were already in operation since the first persons were assigned at start of 2010.  A provision prohibiting certain activities in an employee's subsequent employment for a defined period of time has also been introduced on a case by case basis for new<b></b>employees, in cases where employees have moved from fixed to specified purpose contracts, and on promotion.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware of Section 202 provisions in NAMA Act which are lifelong provisions with respect to confidentiality for all current and former staff assigned to NAMA and to members of the NAMA Board.  In addition, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Board of NAMA's voluntary policy with respect to post-retirement / resignation employment, appointments or consultancy by former members of the Board, except those Board members who are NTMA employees.  The policy sets out that appointed members of the NAMA Board should not, within six months of retiring / resigning from the Board of NAMA:<blockquote>- accept an offer of employment or other appointment,<br /><br />- accept an engagement in a particular consultancy project, or<br /><br />- accept a directorship or other similar opportunity,</blockquote>where the nature and terms of such employment, appointment or engagement could reasonably be considered to lead to a conflict of interest or the perception of such, without first obtaining the approval from the Board of NAMA.</p></reply>

The banks are highlighting the lack of supply of houses in particular urban areas as a contributing factor in the lack of drawdown of approved mortgage facilities.</p><p>  The Government recently launched Construction 2020: A strategy for a renewed construction sector.  The purpose of the strategy is to underpin the future competitiveness of the country, ensuring we will continue to be well positioned to attract the inward investment that has been so important to our economic development.  The strategy includes the Government's desire for a return to sustainable levels of mortgage lending as part of a healthy market.  This involves the consideration of measures to stimulate the development of housing. In order for developers to be supported, they need confidence that customers will be capable of accessing finance to purchase new builds.  This means mortgage products being available to potential purchasers with an ability to support repayments  To address this, my Department is committed under Construction 2020 to examine the concept of a mortgage insurance scheme and how it might benefit new housing completions in the Irish market.  The objective of any scheme would be to ensure adequate availability of mortgage finance on affordable terms for new completions, particularly for first-time buyers, as the economy recovers.  In doing so we would aim to provide the certainty needed to support greater levels of investment in new housing, with the associated benefits for the construction sector and ultimately for the consumer.</p><p>  I look on the development of this initiative as being an aid to encouraging and facilitating the supply of new homes, particularly for young families.  In other jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and Canada mortgage insurance markets have been developed to support bank mortgage lending, particularly to first-time buyers.  Mortgage insurance allows banks to share the risk of mortgage lending, either with the public sector or private sector insurance companies, with the aim of increasing bank lending in general or to target groups.</p><p>  As the construction strategy mentions, my Department is undertaking an economic impact analysis which will assess the impact such a scheme would have on the Irish housing market, taking into consideration time limits, targeting first-time buyers or owner-occupiers and focusing on new housing.  The analysis will draw lessons from mortgage insurance initiatives undertaken in other countries and will include questions as to the appropriateness of a price cap as well as regional or geographical restrictions.  Once this analysis has been completed and presented to me, I will consider the next steps.</p></reply>

Discussions are ongoing at a technical level in relation to the plan, details of which are confidential between the parties and commercially sensitive. I do not intend to speculate on when that process might be concluded.</p><p>  While no plan has been approved, Permanent TSB has made significant progress in delivering key elements of the Restructuring Plan submitted over the last year and the business is being managed structurally in the way envisaged in the plan.  Permanent TSB continues to work to enhance the value of our investments through the continued delivery of the Restructuring Plan, which will, if delivered, provide the State with more optionality regarding the future structure of Permanent TSB.</p><p>  During 2013 Permanent TSB grew its presence and activity in the retail market in general and in the current account and deposit markets in particular, as well as in mortgages and term lending; and it launched several new products during the year.  Permanent TSB has also made progress in relation to managing its portfolio of mortgages in arrears and has created a dedicated team to deal with those customers and to roll out various solutions to them. I am advised by Permanent TSB that during 2013 it made approximately 18,000 offers of long term sustainable solutions to customers in arrears or having difficulty with their mortgage repayments.  The current strategy is for Permanent TSB to be an independent bank, competing within targeted segments of the retail banking market, and I will continue to support the board and management in the delivery of that strategy.</p></reply>

In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents.  These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community child care services to enable them to charge reduced child care fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free child care places to qualifying F&Aacute;S and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free preschool year for children in the year before commencing primary school. Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment.  In addition, a Single Person Child Carer tax credit of &euro;1650 is provided as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000.  This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated.  The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and<b></b>increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year.  To claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit a claimant must not be married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting.</p><p>The Universal Social Charge (USC) was introduced in Budget 2011 to replace the Income Levy and Health Levy.  It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base with very few exemptions.  In Budget 2012 I announced that those earning less than &euro;10,036 would no longer be subject to the Universal Social Charge.  This in itself has removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge and is of particular benefit to the low paid.</p><p>In relation to exempting child care costs from tax when the service is provided by an employer, a similar relief existed where a benefit-in-kind exemption was provided for child care costs where the facilities were provided by the employer.  This was abolished in Finance Act 2011.  The Commission on Taxation recommended the abolition of this exemption, citing equity issues in relation to those parents whose employment does not provide such facilities.</p><p>I have no plans to introduce a tax relief for parents to assist with child care costs.  To provide such a tax relief could be seen to unfairly discriminate against those individuals who stay at home and look after their children.  This could result in married one-earner couples effectively subsidising a two-earner family.  While wanting to encourage female participation in the workforce, equally we cannot say to individuals who stay at home that they are making a less valuable contribution to society.  In addition, tax relief is only of benefit to those in the tax net and it is estimated that in 2014, 39% of income earners will be exempt from income tax. it could also be argued that any tax relief would most likely be absorbed by child care providers in the form of higher prices.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones.  As the Deputy will also appreciate, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current budgetary constraints.  Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

My Department does not collect data on the age cohorts in VTOS in the format requested by the Deputy.  However, statistics at the end of December 2012, which is the latest available data on learners in VTOS, show that 1,018 learners were aged 21 to 24 and 1,792 were aged 25 to 34.</p><p>  Learners in VTOS who were in receipt of a Job Seekers Assistance or Job Seekers Benefit payment from the Department of Social Protection receive a training allowance equal to this amount in lieu of their Department of Social Protection payment for the duration of their VTOS course.  This includes dependents allowances and any other secondary payments they are in receipt of.  Those learners who were in receipt of a One Parent Family payment or a Disability Allowance continue to receive that payment from the Department of Social Protection.  Training allowances are paid by Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and my Department does not collect data on payments made to individual learners.</p><p>  The new training allowance rate of &euro;160 for learners up to age 26 came into effect for new learners in VTOS from 1 January 2013.  As VTOS is operated on an academic year basis the new rate only applied to new learners who enrolled on a VTOS course in September 2013, the start of the academic year.  Data is currently being collated by SOLAS on the 2013 enrolments in VTOS. </p></reply>

My Department has funded the development of two practice frameworks - S&iacute;olta which is a quality framework for early childhood education and Aistear, the curriculum framework for early childhood education.   The learning goals in Aistear for early literacy and numeracy focus on:<blockquote>- Developing non-verbal communication skills, i.e., body movement, facial expression, rules;<br /><br />- Using language in a symbolic form, i.e., pictures, signs, shapes, numbers, letters;<br /><br />- Developing higher-order-skills, i.e., predicting, analysing, justifying, negotiating, reasoning; and<br /><br />- Nurturing positive dispositions, i.e., showing an interest, acting on curiosity, persevering.</blockquote>Working with agencies funded through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment have produced an Aistear-in-Action toolkit for early years practitioners.  Additional supports include a literacy through play network and an Aistear Tutor Network.</p><p>There are a number of other initiatives to foster the development of early literacy and numeracy skills.  Some of these initiatives use the Hanen Learning Language and Loving it programme; others work closely with the Speech and Language Therapy service of the HSE.  A recent initiative includes the Chatter Matters campaign which was launched earlier this year by Dublin's Lord Mayor and which aims to highlight the importance of parents/caregivers talking to and playing with their babies if they are to acquire language.  The next phase in the provision of supports to early years practitioners includes the establishment of a National Early Years Support Service which will work with early years services on quality improvement including the development of a rich environment fostering early literacy and numeracy.</p></reply>

The representative organisations for school principals and school management have developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. Wherever possible, group work and class-based activity should be used to maximise the amount of time available for those pupils who are most in need of one-to-one support. In February my Department published a guide to developing student support teams in post-primary schools. This is an important resource for schools in promoting and protecting students' well-being and an aid to establishing a team or reviewing an existing team.Guidance counsellors have two distinct functions. The first is general career guidance and guidance on the educational opportunities a child or young person might pursue, while the second involves support for students' well-being. The principal and leadership of a school have the best knowledge and experience to determine how exactly guidance resources and teaching resources should be allocated. I do not subscribe to the assertion that teachers, as highly trained individuals and responsible adults operating in a school environment, do not have the professional capacity or knowledge to deal with a significant number of the issues that arise in their classrooms on a daily basis.</p></reply>

The Act empowers the Children's Ombudsman to investigate the administrative procedures followed by a school board of management provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the schools complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman is that a child has, or may have been negatively affected by the action of a school.</p><p>Section 28 of the Education Act 1998 provides for grievance and appeal procedures in schools.

One of these statements is to learn "to value what it means to be an active citizen with rights and responsibilities in local and wider context". As students will be expected to fulfil this statement, it is anticipated that education for active citizenship, including human rights issues, will continue to be an important part of the new Junior Cycle despite the fact that CSPE is no longer a 'compulsory' subject in the Junior Cycle.</p><p>  I recently approved a new short course in CSPE that has been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). This short course will be available to schools to implement from September, should they wish to do so, as part of their Junior Cycle programme. This programme is in fact designed for 100 hours of teaching compared to less than 70 hours for the existing CSPE syllabus.</p><p>  CSPE will also be complemented at Senior Cycle by the introduction of 'Politics and Society' as a new optional Leaving Certificate subject. The draft syllabus for Politics and Society, which has been developed by the NCCA, is structured around four key areas. Two of these areas are 'Active Citizenship' and 'Human rights and responsibilities'. The Politics and Society subject will be made available to schools once the NCCA has advised my Department on a number of outstanding issues. </p><p>  My Department is also currently finalising the first National Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). The strategy acknowledges the importance of issues such as citizenship and human rights as part of education for a more sustainable future. It also acknowledges the close relationship between ESD and Development Education. The Strategy is expected to be published shortly.</p><p>  I am confident that the combination of these measures will ensure that Irish students continue to be interested in citizenship issues. The fact that they are interested in such issues is evident from the data from "Ready to Engage? &ndash; the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study" (2010) which ranked Irish 14 year old students 7th out of 36 participating countries in an international study exploring  young people's active citizenship.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Act and the making of valuations for rating is his sole prerogative and I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard.  The Valuation Act 2001, which came into effect on 2 May 2002, provides for two key elements in the provision and maintenance of the valuation lists for rating authorities.  It provides for the Valuation Office to undertake a general revaluation of all commercial and industrial property in the State and towards this end, the Office is currently engaged in a systematic programme of revaluation which commenced in 2005.  The immediate objective of the national programme is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas is conducted as soon as possible.</p><p>  Revaluation is conducted across all relevant properties in one or more rating authority areas at the same time.  However, implementation of the national programme cannot occur across the entire country simultaneously and the programme must, accordingly, be operated on a phased basis.  Following the first revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation (Section 25 of the Valuation Act, 2001.</p><p>  The revaluation programme began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council areas and more recently to the Dublin City and Waterford City and County Council areas.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December, 2007; Fingal was completed in 2009; Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown was completed in 2010 and Dublin City and Waterford City and County were completed in December, 2013. The revaluation of Limerick City and County area is currently underway.  It is intended to roll out the programme to Galway City and to Counties Carlow and Kilkenny shortly and the necessary consultation process is currently underway with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  While the Commissioner is exploring a number of initiatives to accelerate the programme, he cannot at present give a date for the commencement of the revaluation of all commercial properties in County Donegal or in other rating authority areas.</p><p>  The Act also  provides for the updating of valuation lists through the revision process to allow new properties to be valued and added to the list, improved and extended properties to have their valuations updated and properties that have been demolished in whole or in part to have their valuations amended or struck out as appropriate.  The definition does not allow for a revision of valuation where the change in value is due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as roads or other infrastructural development in the vicinity of a property.  I am informed by the Valuation Office that no application for such a revision of valuation has to date been received in respect of the  property referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>  The procedures for making an application for a determination of a valuation through the revision process are prescribed in section 27 of the Valuation Act, 2001.  An occupier of a property, a rating authority, a person as respects a property to which he/she is an interest holder or an occupier of a property that appears on a valuation list for the same rating authority area may apply in writing to the Commissioner of Valuation for a revision of an existing valuation or for a new valuation to be determined in respect of a new building.  The statutory fee prescribed for the service is &euro;250 which should accompany the application to the Valuation Office.</p></reply>

The Scheme also allows for the granting of Temporary Rehabilitation Remuneration (previously pension rate of pay).  This payment may be paid for up to a maximum period of 18 months generally and only on the basis of a reasonable prospect of return to work by the staff member.  It will be calculated on the basis of what an individual would be entitled to if they were to be paid an ill health pension at that time.</p><p>  The Critical Illness Protocol is a new element of the sick leave scheme in the public service which provides the basis for access to extended sick leave with pay.  There was no provision for critical illness under the previous public service sick leave scheme and no illness was classified as critical, in respect of determining access to paid sick leave, before the introduction of the new scheme.  In assessing whether an illness or injury may qualify for extended sick pay under the Critical Illness Protocol the Employer's Occupational Health Physician will determine, on a case by case basis, whether an employee meets the relevant criteria as follows:</p><p>1. The employee is medically unfit to return to his or her current duties or (where practicable) modified duties in the same pay grade</p><p>2. The nature of this medical condition has at least one of the following characteristics:</p><p>- Acute life threatening physical illness</p><p>- Chronic progressive illness, with well-established potential to reduce life expectancy (in circumstances where there is no medical intervention)</p><p>- Major physical trauma ordinarily requiring corrective acute operative surgical treatment</p><p>- In-patient hospital care of two consecutive weeks or greater. In the case of pregnancy-related or assisted pregnancy-related illness, the requirement for hospitalisation of two consecutive weeks will be reduced to two or more consecutive days of in-patient hospital / clinic care.</p><p>  The HR Manager makes a decision on whether to grant critical illness provisions based on the advice of the Occupational Health Physician.  In the event that a staff member is assessed as meeting the critical illness or serious physical injury criteria they will be allowed access to extended paid sick leave of up to six months on full pay, followed by six months on half pay in a rolling one year period, subject to a maximum of 12 months over a rolling four year period.</p><p>  Members of the Oireachtas and the Judiciary are not included in public service sick leave schemes.</p></reply>

Under the new approach measures are being introduced to increase the cohort of functional bilinguals in the civil service in order to reflect a more competency-based approach to recruitment and, where appropriate, promotion competitions.  In future, in the context of workforce planning frameworks, Departments will be required to identify the posts/areas of work requiring functional bilinguals and to include these in their workforce action plans.  Having regard to the implementation of the Gaeltacht Act 2012, Departments will be asked to pay particular attention to posts that are located in, or that are serving, Gaeltacht areas.  This process will be central to ensuring that future recruitment and interdepartmental promotion competitions run by PAS make sufficient provision for appointments to posts requiring functional bilinguals.  In the case of Departmental recruitment and promotion competitions, an assessment will be made of the requirement for functional bilinguals and, where necessary and appropriate, a sub-panel of functional bilinguals will be put in place.</p><p>  The new arrangements replace the scheme of bonus marks for Irish, introduced nearly 40 years ago following the abolition of compulsory Irish for entry to the civil service.  Under the new arrangements, where a post in a Government Departments is identified as requiring proficiency in Irish, the intention is that it should be filled by a functional bilingual.  It had been intended to pilot the new arrangements in the upcoming Executive Officer (EO) recruitment competition.  However, as priority is now being given to a Clerical Officer (CO) competition and the EO competition will not take place until later in the year, it has been decided that the new arrangements will be piloted in the CO competition which will be announced in the coming weeks.

The CFRAM Programme is being delivered through the CFRAM Studies.  Further details on this Programme are available at <i>www.cfram.ie</i>.  The CFRAM Programme is designed to assess and map the country's river systems to identify areas at risk of significant flooding and to examine options for the sustainable management of the flood risk.  The Programme will:</p><p>- produce detailed flood mapping in order to identify and map the existing and potential future flood hazard and risk areas within the study area,</p><p>- build the strategic information base necessary for making informed decisions in relation to managing flood risk,</p><p>- identify viable structural and non-structural measures and options for managing the flood risks for localised high-risk areas and within each river catchment as a whole.</p><p>This will include appropriate river maintenance measures.</p><p>The OPW is continuing with its programme of major flood relief schemes.  These schemes are focused on locations, throughout the country,  where significant flood events have occurred in the past.  Spending on major flood relief schemes and minor works during the period 2009-2013, inclusive, amounted to &euro;171 million.  Further details are available on www.opw.ie under Flood Risk Management.  In addition to the programme of investment in major flood relief schemes, the OPW also provides funding to local authorities to carry out minor works to address more localised flooding problems throughout the country.</p><p>It is open to local authorities also to undertake flood mitigation works using their own resources.  The investigation of localised flooding problems is a matter for local authorities in the first instance.  It is open to local authorities to submit an application for funding for mitigation measures under the Office of Public Works' Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  Any application received will be assessed under the eligibility criteria, which include a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding.  The Scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.</p><p>Where a drainage scheme is carried out under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995, the OPW has responsibility for maintenance of the completed scheme.  The average cycle of maintenance takes place once every five years.  This work is carried out to ensure that the State's investment in the Arterial Drainage schemes continues to provide the intended benefits.  The total allocation for drainage maintenance for 2014 is &euro;14.8 million.  It should be noted that there are many other rivers and watercourses for which the OPW does not have any maintenance responsibility.  Local Authorities have statutory responsibility for maintenance of rivers and watercourses which form part of Drainage Districts.  For other watercourses falling outside of the OPW and Local Authority areas of responsibility, private landowners generally have responsibility for the maintenance of these.</p><p>The Government decided on 11 February 2014 to allocate total funding of up to &euro;69.5 million for repair of public infrastructure and facilities damaged by the severe weather events in the period 13 December 2013 to 6 January 2014 based on estimates of costs provided by Local Authorities to the Department of the Environment Community and Local Government (DoECLG).  This allocation included up to &euro;19.6 million for repairs of existing coastal protection and flood defences, to be provided through the Vote of the OPW.</p></reply>

The allowance is paid to the parliamentary leader of a qualifying party in relation to expenses arising from the parliamentary activities, including research, of the party.  Payments are made in respect of members of the party elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and members elected/nominated to Seanad &Eacute;ireann at the last preceding general election or a subsequent bye-election or, in the case of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, nominated to it after the last preceding general election.  The legislation also provides that payments may be made to a member of D&aacute;il or Seanad &Eacute;ireann who is elected other than as a member of a qualifying party.</p><p>The conditions governing entitlement to payment of the allowance are set out in the Act.  The primary restriction in the Act on the use of the allowance is that it may not be used in respect of election expenses.  The allowance is non-taxable and is paid monthly in arrears into a bank account specified by the beneficiary of the allowance.  It is not claimed in the same manner as expense allowances.  The legislation provides that each party leader must prepare a statement of expenditure for the allowance, to have it audited by an independent auditor and furnish it with the auditor's report to the Standards in Public Office (the Commission) Commission.  Based on the accounts submitted, the Commission is required to make a report in relation to the use of the Parliamentary Activities Allowance and cause a copy of the report to be laid before the Oireachtas.</p><p>I have no plans to discontinue payment of the allowance.  However, following a review of the allowance and a consultation process with leaders of qualifying political parties, qualifying independent members and with the Standards in Public Office Commission, I provided for certain amendments to the allowance under this year's Act.  The Act provides for a reduction of 10% in the rates of the allowance, representing an estimated full year Exchequer saving of &euro;0.84 million.  Furthermore, with effect from 1 July of this year, the same audit and reporting provisions that apply to parliamentary leaders will now also apply to independent members in receipt of the allowance.  For the first time, Independent Members will have to record and account for expenditure from the allowance, all of which is to be expended in respect of parliamentary activities, including research.</p><p>The total amounts paid to each qualifying independent member from 9 March 2011 to date are set out in the tables below.

The PPP element of the stimulus plan was the first to be launched and is being delivered by a range of Government Departments and Agencies across the roads, education, healthcare and justice areas, working in conjunction with the National Development Finance Agency.  The largest PPP in the July 2012 Stimulus announcement was the N17/N18 Gort to Tuam road and I am pleased to report that the contracts on this project were signed in April this year and construction of the project is now underway.  In addition, seven of the announced projects have issued to market and the procurement process is in progress.

In relaton to the June 2013 package, the roads element was completed at the end of last year, construction has commenced on the Local Authority Energy Efficiency works and seven of the 28 schools projects are under construction, with 17 more at tender stage and the remaining four at pre-tender stage.</p><p>In relation to the National Lottery Licence funded projects, a full list of the projects and programmes included in this package are available on my Department's website (<i>www.per.gov.ie</i>).  Most of these projects involve construction works; however, three involve non-construction related capital investment: the National Trading Online Voucher Scheme, National City of Culture and seed capital investment for a Book Rental Scheme for Primary Schools.  The funding from the Lottery Licence for the three non-construction related projects comes to a total of &euro;16 million.  Looking at the package as a whole, eight projects are at planning or tender phase and nine have commenced construction or are being rolled out.  The most recent announcement was made in May of this year and most of the projects involved in that package are still at the early phases of planning.  As with the National Lottery Licence funding, a list of the projects and programmes included in this latest package is available on my Department's website.  Further details on individual projects and programmes can be obtained from the relevant Ministers and their line Departments.</p></reply>

The implementation of the Act requires two further elements to ensure the legislation will operate as intended.  The first; a comprehensive code of practice for the conduct of adjudication, has been the subject of consultation with key stakeholders. The final draft of the code of practice was circulated to stakeholders in March.</p><p>  The second element requires the establishment of a panel of adjudicators and a chair of that panel to be appointed by the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The chair of the panel will appoint an adjudicator where parties to a payment dispute (that has been referred to adjudication under the Act) fail to agree on an adjudicator between them.  Detailed proposals for the structure for the panel, its set up and operation are complete.  However it was recently decided to retain responsibility for the administration of the Act within my Department.  This poses challenges in respect of this Department's role, through the Office of Government Procurement, in publishing the public works contracts which are also covered by the Act.</p><p>  Officials are currently considering what further steps may be taken to ensure that potential conflicts of interest do not arise should a payment dispute under a public works contract be referred to the chair of the panel for the appointment of an adjudicator.  Once this aspect is resolved stakeholders will be invited to respond to the proposed structure for the ministerial panel of adjudicators.  Once the subsequent appointment process to the panel is complete the Act will be commenced.</p></reply>

The PPPs are being delivered by a range of Government Departments and Agencies across the roads, education, healthcare and justice areas, working in conjunction with the National Development Finance Agency.  The largest PPP in the July 2012 Stimulus announcement was the N17/N18 Gort to Tuam road and I am pleased to report that the contracts on this project were signed in April this year and construction of the project is now underway. In addition, seven of the announced projects have issued to market and the procurement process is in progress. These are:</p><p>- Schools Bundle 4</p><p>- Schools Bundle 5</p><p>- Grangegorman DIT - Central and East Quads</p><p>- Courts Bundle</p><p>- Primary Care Centres Bundle</p><p>- M11 Gorey Enniscorthy</p><p>- N25 New Ross Bypass</p><p>These projects are on course to reach financial close and commence construction later this year and in 2015.

It has since been decided that these can be better delivered through traditional Exchequer investment and I understand that these will issue to market very shortly.</p><p>Finally the Deputy may recollect that the 2012 Stimulus announcement also signalled the reactivation of two existing PPP projects that had previously been stalled owing to the economic crisis and the difficulties in international financial markets.  Both of these projects have progresses well since then.  In the first of these the Schools Bundle 3 project   contracts were signed in November 2012, construction is now practically complete, and all 8 schools facilities will be available for use this September.  The second project involving a roads bundle comprising an N11 development and the upgrade of the N7 (Newlands Cross) junction saw contracts signed in April 2013; construction is progressing well, with the N7 element due for completion by end this year and the N11 element due for completion in Autumn 2015.</p></reply>

In addition to the measures outlined in that reply, a further effective pension cut applies, with effect from 1 September 2013, in the case of persons who receive two or more Public Service pensions which have a combined value in excess of &euro;32,500.  This further pension cut is based on applying the "Public Service Pension Reduction" (PSPR) to the combined value of the multiple Public Service pensions held by such a person, rather than to each such pension individually.  This aggregation of pensions for PSPR purposes reduces the overall Public Service pension income of affected pensioners, including significant numbers of pensioners who receive both a TD pension and a Ministerial pension.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-17a.648.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061700071#WRK07400"><p>The Public Service Agreements (PSAs) covering the period 2010 -16 (the Croke Park and Haddington Road Agreements) provide for agreed redeployment arrangements to apply in the Civil Service and in other parts of the Public Service.  Under the PSAs, redeployment generally takes precedence over all other methods of filling a vacancy and supersedes any existing agreements on the deployment of staff.  The Deputy should note that the redeployment arrangements are not voluntary per se but provide a mechanism to allow staff to be moved as result of rationalisation, reconfiguration or restructuring of public bodies.  Redeployment operates through a Resource Panel system, which is managed by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) for the Civil Service and Non-Commercial State Sponsored Bodies (NCSSBs) under their aegis. It also manages cross-sectoral assignments where necessary.</p><p>  The Resource Panel contains details of the posts identified by organisations for redeployment in these sectors on the basis of changing business needs or ongoing management of the Employment Control Framework (ECF) ceilings by public service bodies.  Where an organisation has business reasons to redeploy staff, and has identified the number of posts involved and the location of the surplus, it seeks volunteers for inclusion on the Resource Panel.  If the number of volunteers falls short of the surplus, Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) is applied, as appropriate.  Assignments from the Resource Panel are made on the basis of "best fit" for the vacancy in the location, on foot of a comparison by the PAS of the knowledge, skills, competencies and career experience of those on the Resource Panel with the requirements for the available post.  The assignment decision is progressed directly between the sending and receiving organisations involved.  While the assignee may appeal the redeployment decision to an independent adjudicator, the assignee must take up the position offered in advance of the adjudication process.</p><p>  In cases where none of the public service organisations in a geographical area have notified details of surplus staff at the grade or at equivalent grades to the PAS for inclusion on the Resource Panel, or where there are insufficient numbers on the Resource Panel in the relevant geographical area, the PAS may seek volunteers from among staff who are outside that area.</p><p>  Some 12,388 staff are recorded as redeployed to end December 2013.  There were 67 surplus posts notified to the Redeployment Panels at end May 2014: for the Civil Service (35); for NCSSBs (32).  A significant portion of requests to date to fill positions have been for staff with specific qualifications and/or experience not represented on the panels or readily available in Departments and bodies.  Another significant proportion is for staff in geographic areas (particularly Dublin) where there are little or no personnel available for redeployment.</p></reply>

I would point out that Ireland has a strong body of employment rights in which are set out the means for obtaining redress where an employment relationship has ended and an employee's rights have been breached.  Complaints to an employment rights dispute settlement body may be initiated by the employee, or under certain legislation, may also be initiated by the employee&rsquo;s trade union, excepted body or others as specified in the relevant legislation.</p><p>  Employment rights that may be relevant to the former employees in this case are contained in a number of Acts and Statutory Instruments, including the Payment of Wages Act, the Protection of Employment Acts, the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts and the Redundancy Payments Acts.  </p><p>  Generally, where an employment relationship has ended and an employee is owed wages, the employee may take a case to a Rights Commissioner pursuant to the Payment of Wages Act 1991.  The claim may seek payment of arrears of wages and payments in lieu of untaken annual leave or a public holiday benefit.  </p><p>  Under the Protection of Employment Acts and the European Communities (Protection of Employment) Regulations, 2000, employers proposing collective redundancies must enter into an information and consultation process of at least 30 days duration with the employees' representatives before issuing notices of redundancy.  Where the employees' representatives do not receive the specified information or there is no 30-day consultation period, an employee or the employees' representatives may make a complaint to a Rights Commissioner.  Additionally, I have asked for a NERA inspection to ascertain whether the provisions of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 have been complied with.   </p><p>  The European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 provide that all the rights and obligations of an employer arising from a contract of employment, other than pension rights, existing on the date of a transfer (as defined in the Regulations), are transferred to the new employer on the transfer of the business or part thereof.  A complaint that an employer has contravened these Regulations in relation to an employee may be presented to a Rights Commissioner.</p><p>  Under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, an employee who has a minimum of 13 weeks' service with an employer is entitled to notice of termination of employment.  The length of notice to which an employee is entitled is dependent on the length of service of the employee and can range between one week's notice for an individual with less than 2 years' service up to eight weeks&rsquo; notice for an individual with more than fifteen years' service.  Where an employer is unable to provide or does not provide the appropriate notice, then the employer may make a payment in lieu of the notice.  An employee who does not receive their minimum notice entitlements may take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p><p>  In accordance with the Redundancy Payments Acts, employees who have at least two years' continuous service with an employer are generally entitled to a statutory redundancy payment in the event of being made redundant.  Where an employer either fails to comply with his or her redundancy payment obligations or where there is a dispute regarding redundancy entitlements, claims may be referred by the employee to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.    </p><p>  If a former employee believes that one or more of his/her rights under the above, or other, employment rights legislation has been breached, he/she should consider making a complaint to the relevant employment rights dispute settlement body.  He/she may also wish to obtain professional advice on the matter.</p><p>  The Workplace Relations Customer Service Section of NERA provides information on employees' rights and how to obtain redress if employees' rights have been infringed.  It can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or via its website www.workplacerelations.ie.  The single complaint form for submitting complaints regarding breaches of employment rights is also available at www.workplacerelations.ie.</p></reply>

The Deputy should also note that the PRTLI element is often part of bigger infrastructure projects supported across the various colleges.

Such facilities are internationally recognised as an important element of public assistance for fostering entrepreneurship and technology-intensive start-ups.  </p><p>To date EI has invested approximately &euro;50m over the past ten years in the provision of campus incubation facilities across Ireland. Incubation units are currently host to over 300 companies, employing over 1,500 people.  These firms are operating in a range of sectors such as software, medical devices, digital media and green technologies.  </p><p>Enterprise Ireland also provides capital funding to the Community Enterprise Centre Programme.  The main objective of this initiative is to enhance the development of an enterprise culture through the provision of infrastructural facilities to support the establishment and expansion of micro-enterprises through local community participation in both urban and rural locations.  Enterprise Ireland estimates that in the region of &euro;1.5m will be expended on construction related projects this year.</p><p><b>IDA Ireland</b></p><p>IDA Ireland's Capital allocation for 2014 provides funding towards IDA&rsquo;s property function and grant payments.  The majority of IDA grants paid in 2014 will be in the areas of Research, Development and Innovation, Training and Employment Projects and a small number of New Industry (Capital) Projects.  These latter grants are paid in the main for construction projects by client companies. </p><p>IDA grants are drawn down by client companies on reaching the relevant grant payment milestones and targets. Commercial sensitivities and the demand led nature of payments preclude IDA Ireland from providing details of New Industry Grants in 2014 until they are drawn down by IDA clients. </p><p>In order to boost regional development and win new business IDA Ireland has signed contracts for the erection of advance manufacturing facilities in Waterford and Athlone.  Both facilities are expected to be completed by year end. As IDA Ireland's property function is almost entirely self-financing, the proposed buildings will be funded by the IDA.</p><p><b>INTERREG</b></p><p>My Department co-funds a range of Enterprise projects under an INTERREG North-South programme.  It is anticipated that approximately &euro;1.72 million of my Department's capital expenditure this year was will be incurred on INTEREG related construction projects.  This will involve the provision of various facilities to assist the development of specific enterprise initiatives in the border region.</p><p>A very significant project involves the construction of a new facility in Letterkenny, County Donegal,  (Letterkenny Institute of Technology (LYIT)), with a total cost of  &euro;4.5m and this project will significantly enhance the development of Science, Research and Innovation in the North West region.  This initiative, in tandem with a similar facility in Derry City, is a cross border project, co-funded by the EU's Regional Development Fund through the INTERREG IVA Programme.  It involves co-funding from my Department and by the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Personnel.  The new building in Letterkenny, when completed, will provide new business units and significant research space and will serve as an extension to the existing, very successful CoLab facility at LYIT, which currently houses 28 start-up companies.</p></reply>

I also participated in an event to mark the report&rsquo;s launch, with Minister Foster, on the same day.</p><p>This report looked at cross border innovation linkages across the island of Ireland and I am very pleased that it gave a very positive review of the key measures we have put in place to help drive Innovation on a cross border basis.  It noted that <i>InterTrade Ireland</i>is a rare example internationally of a cross-border entity to promote trade and innovation, which is co-funded by respective Governments.  I am very committed to the work of this cross-border body which we co-fund, with our counterpart Department in Northern Ireland, and, despite the very challenging financial climate we have faced for the last few years, <i>InterTrade Ireland's </i>innovative range of programmes for businesses on both sides of the border have been kept operational and are very successful. </p><p>It is also very encouraging that the OECD  highlighted as 'noteworthy'  other initiatives which my Department supports, such as the shared programme between Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland in relation to the provision of Innovation Vouchers; the US - Ireland Research and Development Partnership Programme and the INTERREG Cross Border Programme, which has included the funding of some innovation-oriented projects. </p><p>I have asked my officials to consider the specific recommendations contained in this report and <i>InterTrade Ireland</i>is looking at relevant actions which that body could pursue.  Some of these suggested actions involve administrative issues, which may not have resource implications; others may require financial support or potentially involve political issues, which would necessitate in-depth engagement between both administrations.  One of the key recommendations proposes that <i>InterTrade Ireland</i>should be involved as a delivery partner for the next INTERREG Programme; we are already actively pursuing whether this could be achieved.  </p><p>I would envisage further discussion on this report at a future meeting of the North South Ministerial Council. </p></reply>

FIS is designed to prevent child and family poverty and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment as compared to social welfare payments.  There are currently some 44,000 families with some 99,000 children in receipt of FIS. Expenditure on FIS is estimated to be of the order of &euro;280 million in 2014. </p><p>To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in insurable employment which is expected to last for at least three months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  Therefore, self-employed people are not eligible for FIS. </p><p>There are a number of factors that would have to be taken in to account in any consideration of extending eligibility for FIS to include self-employed persons:</p><p>- the practical difficulties in defining and controlling an alternative to the hours worked condition;</p><p>- establishing satisfactorily a self-employed person's hours of employment and certifying this on an ongoing basis;</p><p>- existing arrangements to provide income support to self-employed people on low incomes, such as jobseeker's allowance and farm assist for low-income farmers;</p><p>- the cost of extending the scheme to the self-employed would be considerable and could only be considered in a budgetary context. </p><p>Given the above, I have no immediate plans to extend FIS to the self-employed.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-17a.699.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061700072#WRL03500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 316 and 384 together.  </p><p>  In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to housing authorities.  Officials are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in piloting HAP in Limerick City and County Council with further roll out to selected housing authorities during the year.   Payments will be made directly to landlords by the housing authorities under the HAP scheme.</p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department's relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement; and payment is made to the tenant to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.  However, social welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement payment to a nominated payee such as a landlord on behalf of the tenant.  This arrangement is entered at the tenant's request and subject to the consent of the Department. Similar arrangements apply in respect of the mortgage interest supplement scheme in relation to the payment of the supplement direct to mortgage lenders. </p><p>   It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent.  Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated.  Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board&rsquo;s dispute resolution process. </p><p>  The efficiency of the rent supplement and the mortgage interest supplement schemes would be significantly affected if all payments were to be made directly to landlords/mortgage lenders, for the provision of short term support.  I therefore have no plans to amend the payment arrangements available under these schemes at this time.    </p><p>  The most recent review of maximum rent limits was completed in June 2013 with revised rent limits introduced on 17 June 2013.  For all counties, major urban population centres were tested to ensure access to housing while also ensuring value for money for the State.  Despite pressures on the social protection budget, there were increases in the rent limits in some areas, including Galway, and reductions or no change in others.  The limits for Galway reflected the respective prevailing rental markets and analysis shows that there are currently properties available within these limits.  A new rent limit review has commenced within the Department and will feed into the budgetary process.  </p><p>  I can assure the Deputy the Department's staff in the Community Welfare Service have considerable experience in dealing with customers and will continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.  Staff have discretionary powers to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant, for example, when dealing with applicants who are homeless or who are at risk of losing their tenancy.  Such cases are examined on a case by case basis having regard to the situation presented.  </p></reply>

Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the standardising of State pension age for all at 66 years and the cessation of State pension transition.  The State pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.   </p><p>  I am informed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the specific compulsory retirement age and minimum pension age provisions which affect an individual public servant will reflect his or her particular employment sector and time of original recruitment.  Public servants who must retire at age 65 can draw their public service pension at age 65.  The State pension changes have no impact on such persons where they are in the modified social insurance category.  </p><p>  Where alternatively they are in the full social insurance category their public service pensions (and contributions) are, as with many occupational schemes, integrated (or co-ordinated) with social welfare benefits.  This means the occupational pension paid is based on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State pension.  The State pension (contributory) entitlement is calculated with reference to the complete PRSI record, including contributions made while working in the public and private sectors.</p><p>  In the case of retirements of fully insured public servants at age 65, a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the rules of the public service scheme to bridge the gap until State Pension commencement at age 66 years.  This supplementary pension is only payable where the individual, through no fault of his own or her own, does not qualify for social welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate.  It is therefore necessary to claim the available social welfare benefits in order to receive a supplementary pension. </p><p>  This situation is not new and already applies to public servants with a retirement age below 65 years.</p><p>  With regard to the marriage bar, it was a condition of the employment in the public service until 1973 and is the responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.   </p><p>  However, in general, and similar to many civil and public servants, the social insurance class paid by women affected by the marriage bar was a modified rate (i.e. not the full Class A rate) which gives coverage for widow(er)'s and orphan's pensions, occupational injury benefit, bereavement grant and carer&rsquo;s benefit only.  It did not provide cover for the State pension.  The modified rate of social insurance was a condition of employment for public servants at that time.  Accordingly, even if those affected by the marriage bar had continued in employment, contributions paid at this class would not have given entitlement to a State pension (contributory) under the social welfare system.  </p><p>  The homemaker scheme, which was introduced in 1994, can make qualification for the State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged to determine qualification for the State pension. </p><p>  The homemaker disregard will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.</p><p>  If an applicant, with an insurable employment history of full-rate and modified rate occupations, paid their first full-rate contribution prior to 6 April 1991, their date of entry into social insurance is taken as the date of payment of the first (full-rate) contribution.  If an applicant has paid their first full-rate contribution on or after 6 April 1991, their date of entry is taken as the date they first commenced paying social insurance, whether at the full or modified rate.  This change, which took effect for people who paid their first full rate contribution from 1991 onwards, prevents the situation where some public servants, such as Garda&iacute; or members of the Defence Forces, could retire at 55 and avail of a Public Service pension, and then work for 10 years in the private sector and avail of a full State pension contributory from 65, in addition to the Public Sector pension.  The current system which integrates pensions is a more equitable framework.</p><p>  The State pension is a valuable asset and is based on a system of contributions.  Therefore, it is important that entitlement to State pension is based on a substantial contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over a working life.</p></reply>

This measure only affected those new CE entrants in receipt of One Parent Family Payment, Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Benefit, Widow(er)s Pension, Illness Benefit, Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension and Blind Pension.

This dual payment situation was scheduled to be phased out over a three year period ending in December 2014. This phasing out would mainly be achieved by participants either exhausting their time on CE during the 3-year transition phase (after exiting CE they would remain on their original payment only). </p><p>Alternatively, if they left CE for the standard minimum 12-month gap between schemes and returned to CE subsequently, they would be treated as a new entrant and receive CE allowances only on recommencing the CE scheme. The CE participants who have remained on the scheme continuously since before 16 January 2012 and who have retained their dual payment will be notified in November 2014 by their respective social welfare payment scheme sections that if their CE participation extends beyond December 2014, their original social welfare payment will cease as of 31 December 2014 for the remaining duration of their CE placement. Their CE allowances will be adjusted accordingly for any adult and/or child dependants. Once they exit CE after December 2014, they can return to their original social welfare payment provided they still meet the underlying conditions for the scheme in question. </p></reply>

These include Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and Respite Care Grant.  &euro;806 million is provided for these payments in 2014. </p><p>  Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the main income support.

The payment is made regardless of the carer's means but is subject to certain conditions, one of which is that the period of full-time care and attention must last for at least six months (which must include the first Thursday in June when the payment is made automatically to recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance/benefit and domiciliary care allowance). I think this condition is reasonable and I have no plans to make any changes in this regard.</p><p>  I would point out that in the case of bereavement the Department already recognises the financial difficulties arising at this time for carers as payment of carer's benefit/ allowance continues to be made for a period of 6 weeks after the date of death of the care recipient.</p><p>  I am pleased to confirm that payment of the RCG for 2014 has commenced, with automatic payments issuing to over 70,000 DSP clients earlier this month at an estimated cost of &euro;122 million for the full year in 2014.  Of course, there is no conditionality attached to how the RCG is utilised, so carers can use the grant as they wish. </p><p>  I should also mention that the RCG, with no requirement to satisfy a means test, is not available for any other social welfare group nor indeed is there an equivalent payment for carers in any other country in Europe.  </p><p>  While I am not in a position to increase the amount of the RCG, I would point out that in relation to income supports for carers generally, expenditure on such supports has increased from &euro;773m in 2012 to an estimated &euro;806m in 2014. The number of people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance over the past decade has also increased from 23,000 to over 57,000 </p><p>   Responsibility for providing respite care facilities and services rests with the HSE. </p></reply>

The purpose of the report was to gather information on pension charges levied to assess whether charges are reasonable and transparent, and make recommendations.   The report highlighted a wide range of issues in relation to pension charges and identified a number of problems. While the provision of pension schemes cannot be cost free, it is clear that there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency of charges.  </p><p>  Following the Report&rsquo;s publication and a consultation with stakeholders, it was agreed by Government in April 2013 that the recommendations contained in the report would be implemented. A group comprising the Department of Social Protection, the Pensions Authority and the Central Bank is in place to initiate actions that follow up on these recommendations.  Each has a core role to play in delivering on the recommendations contained in the report and work is progressing in this regard.  </p><p>  In line with the report&rsquo;s recommendation to monitor the implementation of the Consumer Protection Code, the Central Bank recently published findings of a review of annual pension statements.  This review found the vast majority of firms were in compliance with the code.  Where the Bank identified a small number of firms where the format of annual statements were not as required, the firms concerned were required to submit implementation timelines for full compliance.  </p><p>  Work is also ongoing in relation to other recommendations of the report such as consideration of a single standard measure that would assess all charges as well as investigation of the drivers behind take up of PRSAs.  </p><p>  In parallel, my Department is involved in complementary EU negotiations in relation to a review of the IORPs (Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision) Directive which lays down basic requirements for occupational pensions and their supervision.  It is anticipated that agreement would result in improvements for consumers in the areas of member information regarding charges, trustee competencies, scheme governance and risk management.</p><p>  In addition, progress on the issue of charges will be supported by recent actions to restructure the Pensions Authority and strengthen governance and regulation and give consumer representatives a greater input into pensions policy. I have previously highlighted that the first task of the new Pensions Council will be to monitor the implementation of the recommendations in the Report on Pension Charges and advise if further actions are needed. </p></reply>

The increasing numbers of families in receipt of FIS is testament to the effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s information strategy for the scheme and the significant improvements in customer service and processing times for FIS customers. </p><p>The Departments web site www.welfare.ie has full information on the FIS scheme and provides typical family scenarios to aid understanding and provide comparisons.  This information is also available in all the Department local offices, CICs and information offices.  </p><p>In addition a series of road-shows have also been held around the country designed to inform employers about the wide range of employment support services provided by the Department, including FIS.  Case Officers in each locality will specifically use FIS as an incentive to move people from the long-term Live Register to employment.</p><p>Furthermore, the Department launched a Benefit of Work ready reckoner in December last year.  The ready reckoner gives an indication of the difference between a person&rsquo;s potential in-work payment, including FIS, and current out-of-work payments.  </p><p>The Department will shortly be launching a poster campaign in its Intreo centres and local offices to further promote FIS. </p><p>In conclusion, I am satisfied that the FIS scheme is being  promoted and evidence shows that it is fulfilling its role in assisting employees to take up employment opportunities and to remain at work.</p></reply>

This has, inter alia, served to raise employer awareness about initiatives, such as JobsPlus and JobBridge, designed to encourage recruitment from the Live Register.  These activities have provided both employers and jobseekers with information on the range of services and supports available and more importantly have resulted in the direct placement of unemployed jobseekers into employment.</p><p>In addition, significant work is currently being undertaken by the Sub-Group to develop a Charter, which commits employers to prioritising recruitment of candidates from the Live Register and to working with unemployed jobseekers and jobseeker support organisations to assist in developing the skills and competencies required to find employment.  It is intended that the Charter will initially be signed by the 50 largest companies in the State who will then be able to use the skills of the unemployed/long- term unemployed.  The Charter is an important flagship initiative which will be supported by the Intreo service.</p><p>More generally, the Council has also worked closely with the Department in developing an Employer Engagement Strategy which will be a cornerstone of the Pathways 2014.</p><p>The Council has also set up an Evaluation/Metrics Sub-Group tasked with devising a systematic evaluation strategy for Pathways and ensuring that Pathways outcomes are monitored in a meaningful way. The Sub-Group is comprised of leading labour market economists from Ireland and abroad.</p><p>Additionally, in April the Council published its Interim Report which outlined the extent to which the targets set on key action points in Pathways have been met.  </p><p><b>Key Objectives for the Remainder of 2014</b></p><p>The Council has several objectives for the remainder of 2014. These are to:</p><p>- monitor and advise on the development and implementation of Pathways to Work 2014;</p><p>- focus on rigorous evaluation of programmes in order to ensure that the limited resources available are being put to best use and delivering the best outcomes for all;</p><p>- build on the very positive engagement with employers in recent months and harness the undoubted goodwill of many employers towards hiring from the Live Register.  This will include the launch of the Employer Charter in July;</p><p>- take an active role in the monitoring and implementation of the Youth Guarantee;</p><p>- play an important role in monitoring the implementation and performance of JobPath. Specifically, the Council will be seeking clarity in terms of how JobPath, Intreo and other related services are &ldquo;joined up&rdquo; and integrated. </p><p><b>Targets for the Implementation of Pathways to Work for the Remainder of 2014</b></p><p>The targets for remainder of Pathways to Work for 2014 are contained in the table provided below. The Council will play a key role in the monitoring of the performance of the Pathways to Work strategy against these targets.<table><tr><th>Measure/Target</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>Move 75,000 long-term unemployed at start of 2012  into employment by end 2015. </td><td>22,500</td></tr><tr><td>Increase the exit rate of people on the  live register  for two years or more by 50%  (to 40%)  by the end of 2015 </td><td>Exit rate target  = 35%</td></tr><tr><td>Reduce the persistence rate (the rate at which short term unemployed people become long term unemployed)  to 25%</td><td>28%</td></tr><tr><td>Increase % of vacancies filled with involvement of Department of Social Protection Employment Services  to 15% by end 2015</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Provide Group Information/ Engagement sessions to jobseekers</td><td>All new JobSeekers plus 20,000 LTU</td></tr><tr><td>Conduct initial one-to-one guidance interviews with jobseekers</td><td>All new eligible jobseekers plus 20,000 LTU</td></tr><tr><td>Fill all additional places on Community Employment, T&Uacute;S, Jobbridge and the Local Government Social Employment Scheme</td><td>33,000 active places <br /><br /><br />17,500 starters<br /><br /><br />Of which 16,000 LTU</td></tr><tr><td>Roll-out &lsquo;One-Stop-Shop&rsquo;  intreo offices </td><td>17 new Intreo offices<br /><br /><br />(60 offices in total)</td></tr><tr><td>Make a range of F&Aacute;S, Further Education and Higher Education Programmes available to meet the needs of the long term unemployed</td><td>62,747 places available to long term unemployed </td></tr></table></p></reply>

They must also have an average net weekly family income below a certain amount for the individual family size.  FIS is then calculated at 60% of the difference between the average net weekly family income and the income limit for the family size concerned.</p><p>Once the level of FIS payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment.  Claimants who apply for a further 52 weeks have their income re-assessed and their FIS entitlement re-calculated accordingly. </p><p>There has been a steady growth both in the number of families supported by FIS over recent years and associated expenditure as set out in the following table.</p><p>Expenditure on the FIS scheme is estimated to be &euro;281.7 million in 2014, up &euro;20 million on 2013.<table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Number in payment  (approx.) </th><th>Expenditure  (&euro; Millions) </th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>28,875 </td><td>204.5</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>32,310</td><td>223.6</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>44,160</td><td>261.5 (provisional) </td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>44,405 (@ 30/4/14)</td><td>281.7 (Revised Estimate)</td></tr></table></p><p>The Department avails of every opportunity in its engagement with employers and jobseekers to build awareness of the availability of FIS and how this payment may benefit potential employees with children.  The increasing numbers of families in receipt of FIS is testament to the effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s information strategy for the scheme and the significant improvements in customer service and processing times for FIS customers. </p><p>With the increased customer base on FIS and the continued increase in  FIS new claim the Department  in order to maintain good customer service and ensure the efficient use of its resources  proposes to continue payment of FIS for a further 52 weeks at the existing rat in the cases of some  renewals where the Department&rsquo;s data indicates that entitlement has not varied from the previous year.  As it is possible that there could be other changes in circumstances of which the Department may not be aware, claimants are being asked to contact the Department if they feel that their circumstances have changed.  In these cases, the Department will carry out a full review of circumstances and issue a revised decision where warranted. </p></reply>

This process is further enhanced by the continued roll out of the Intreo service nationwide which includes a single integrated decision-making team that integrate and streamline the processes formerly undertaken by the different agencies amalgamated into the Department, including the CWS.

These reviews underpin the Government's multi-annual budgetary framework and are conducted periodically to re-set Departmental expenditure ceilings in line with emerging Government priorities. The reviews are currently ongoing and will be considered by Government later this year with a view to underpinning expenditure ceilings for 2015 and beyond, as well as clarifying policy options and informing prioritisation decisions arising from the expenditure ceilings. Clearly, the capital allocation for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta for 2015 will be informed by the outcome of those reviews and within the framework of the Budgetary and Estimates processes later in the year.</p></reply>

The extent of the problem varies from area to area within the Park and, having regard to the very dynamic nature of this invasive species, the targeted management programme is routinely monitored and adjusted with a view to ensuring optimum efficacy.     In the past, large tracts of the Park including ancient Oak woods were heavily infested with this robust and vigorous invasive plant which, if left unchecked, can grow in dense thickets and replace native shrub, exclude native vegetation, and constrain native woodland regeneration.  </p><p>  Since 2011, nearly &euro;500,000 has been invested in this work and for this year I have allocated a further &euro;100,000 to Killarney National Park for the management of this plant. Approximately 3,000 of the 10,000 hectares in the Park were, to some extent, affected by Rhododendron infestation. My Department's management programme has made significant inroads into the problem and now approximately 2,000 of those hectares, involving some 40 different sites, are under effective control. </p><p>  Ultimately, the plan is to clear all Rhododendron from Killarney National Park. The annual Rhododendron management programme is intended to create conditions in the Park that are conducive to the protection and re-establishment of native species and, particularly, our native woodlands. </p><p>  The work involved is difficult and resource intensive and is carried out by outside specialist companies, staff of my Department, and by volunteer groups under staff direction and supervision.  My Department is committed to continuing this important challenging work into the future.</p><p>  In this regard, I would like to recognise the past and continuing important contribution of volunteer groups to this work, and also to acknowledge the innovative work of my Department&rsquo;s staff in Killarney National Park who have been instrumental in developing new methods to increase the effectiveness of our efforts to control this plant.</p></reply>

It is in this context that my Department is developing the heritage-led Historic Towns Initiative in collaboration with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Heritage Council.  A pilot programme for this initiative in Westport, Youghal and Listowel operated through 2013 and will conclude in 2014.  My primary objective with this pilot is to ensure that the participating towns of Westport, Youghal and Listowel have access to, and an understanding of, appropriate guidance to assist them in best conserving their heritage assets and, in so doing, underpin the sustainability of their community and local economy.  It is my hope that meeting these goals will also, by extension, significantly enhance the visitor experience in these towns, thus helping to maximise the potential positive contribution of tourism to each of these towns and their respective hinterlands.   </p><p>  Each town has set up a local Historic Towns Initiative working group consisting of representatives of local government, businesses, community groups and other stakeholders. The local groups are responsible for drawing up a vision for their town with specific objectives supported by a clear action plan.  Funding was allocated by my Department and by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to the towns for projects in 2013 and again by my Department in 2014.  Projects funded under the initiative include public realm enhancement works, heritage interpretation works and conservation works to heritage structures.</p><p>  All projects undertaken on foot of the initiative in the pilot towns are governed by the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  The responsibilities under the Act as regards development proposals to planning authorities remain the same and are not affected by the Historic Towns Initiative. There is currently no statutory designation directly associated with the Historic Towns Initiative.</p></reply>

Head 6 of the proposed Bill provides for an amendment to section 13 of the Act. This involves including a new subsection in section 13(2) stating that the posts within public bodies that require an Irish language competency be specified in language schemes.  This amendment reflects the Government decision of 30 October 2013 to replace the practice of awarding bonus marks for Irish language proficiency in civil service recruitment and promotion competitions with a new competency-based system. Under this new system, Irish language competency will be a requirement for specified jobs in the civil service. In addition, it should be noted that the workforce plans of Government Departments and Offices will in future specify the posts/areas of work which require staff that can function in both official languages.  </p><p>  I should also point out that, in accordance with section 13(d) of the Official Languages Act 2003, public bodies, when preparing their language schemes, are required to ensure that the particular Irish language requirements associated with the provision of services in Gaeltacht areas are met.</p></reply>

I and Government colleagues have consistently been supportive of the proposal by Shannon LNG to construct a LNG terminal near Ballylongford, Co Kerry. The LNG facility would provide additional security of supply to Ireland in that it would bring diversity to Ireland's supply sources and would bring connectivity for the first time to the global LNG market. The prospect of such a facility is therefore a potentially positive step for the island of Ireland.    The timing of an investment decision by Shannon LNG is a commercial decision for the company.

The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has oversight of the process for connecting generators, both renewable and non-renewable, to the national grid.This is generally referred to as the Group Process Approach, which has been implemented to date through a series of gates, with Gate 3 being the most recent. Smaller projects (less than 5 MW) can connect outside of the gate process.   All parties applying to connect to the national grid apply to the system operator, either the Transmission System Operator (TSO), EirGrid, or the Distribution System Operator (DSO), ESB Networks. Applications are processed in accordance with the terms of the Gate. The relevant System Operator will then issue a Connection Offer to eligible parties. Following the signing of a Connection Agreement, projects are connected to the grid. </p><p>The CER expects to publish a public consultation paper on the post Gate 3 scenario later this year.

The market has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in each County including Counties Cork and Kildare can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual commercial operators. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and</p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. </p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. </p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. </p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention. I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This list is available on my Department's website, . Currently, a total of 108 areas in County Cork and 18 areas in County Kildare have been identified as requiring an intervention. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. I expect that this mapping exercise will be concluded in the autumn. </p><p>I would point out that the EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard, I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 103 fibre-based broadband networks in County Cork and 39 such networks in County Kildare, including in the area of Maynooth by July 2016.</p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end implementation strategy for the State led intervention. It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed implementation strategy. EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised. This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

I have appointed an independent panel of experts, chaired by Mrs Justice Catherine McGuinness, to examine the Grid West and Grid Link projects. The Independent Expert Panel has held five meetings between 10 February 2014 and 10 June 2014. At its meeting on 2 May 2014, the Panel finalised and approved the terms of reference for comprehensive, route specific studies and reports of fully undergrounded and overhead options for each of the Grid West and Grid Link projects, including assessments of potential environmental impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors. The terms of reference were published on 7 May 2014 and are available on my Department's website.  The studies and reports will be undertaken or commissioned by EirGrid in accordance with those terms of reference set by the Panel who will also oversee EirGrid&rsquo;s study and reporting process. In due course, the Panel will provide an opinion to me on the completeness, objectivity and comparability of the studies and reports undertaken or commissioned by EirGrid and will oversee the publication by EirGrid of the two studies and reports prior to EirGrid proceeding to public consultation on the two projects.</p><p>  I also asked the Panel to consider what, if anything, it can do with regard to the North South Transmission Line project, and it has considered that issue. Although the North South project was not covered by the Government&rsquo;s decision, having discussed my request, and in the light of the finalised terms of reference for the studies and reports of fully undergrounded and overhead options for each of the Grid West and Grid Link projects, the Panel decided that it would provide an opinion to me on the compatibility of the methodologies to be employed on the Grid West and Grid Link projects with what has already been done on the North South Transmission Line project.</p><p>  I understand that the Panel wrote to EirGrid shortly after its May meeting to convey its requirements in regard to Grid West, Grid Link and the North South project and that EirGrid is attending to those requirements.</p><p>  I am advised that EirGrid, in response to the Panel's enquiry regarding the compatibility of the methodologies, has provided a detailed submission to the Panel. This submission was discussed by the Panel at its meeting on Tuesday last. I understand Eirgird made a detailed presentation at that meeting and that the Panel requested Eirgrid to provide it with additional written material. The Panel will continue its work at its next meeting which is provisionally scheduled for 30 June 2014. </p></reply>

TG4 is funded by way of a combination of direct exchequer Grant-In-Aid, television licence fee receipts and commercial revenue. Both Public Service Broadcasters are funded on an annual basis. In regard to the actual mechanism for helping to determine the level of the licence fee, this is set out in Section 124 of the Broadcasting Act 2009. In particular it allows for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) to recommend in a report to me, as Minister, an annual licence fee modification.</p><p>  This recommendation is based on an annual review of the extent to which both Public Service Broadcasters have fulfilled their commitments in respect of the public service objects stated in their annual statement of performance commitments for that financial year and the adequacy or otherwise of public funding to enable the corporations to meet those public service objects.   The recommendation from the Authority informs any decision I, as Minister, may take in conjunction with the Government on adjusting the current level of television fee or otherwise.</p><p>  In addition to the statutory requirement for annual reviews of the public service broadcasters, section 124(8) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 requires the BAI to also carry out a long term forward looking 5-year review on the adequacy or otherwise of the funding of public service broadcasters. The first 5 year review was undertaken by the BAI in 2013 and will assist in informing any policy decisions I may take on the future public funding of public service broadcasters.</p></reply>

The decision must be taken by resolution of the Council and must be notified to the Revenue Commissioners by 30 September in order to apply for the following year. </p><p>  There are certain factors that local authorities are legislatively bound to take into account when deciding whether or not to vary their LPT rates for a given year (expected income &amp;amp; expenditure, accumulated assets and liabilities and the economic impact in their local area). The decision is not one that can be taken in isolation as it will have a direct impact on the level of funding available to local authorities and, therefore, on their ability to discharge their statutory responsibilities. The financial implications of any decision to vary must be considered.</p><p>  The power to vary has been given to local authorities to further increase their autonomy. Elected members are already responsible for finalising the annual budget of the local authority &ndash; it is a reserved function &ndash; and the power to vary LPT will enable them to directly influence the level of Local Property Tax income they have to meet their expenditure requirements in the future.</p><p>  I will make regulations in the coming weeks to set out the process for local authorities who wish to vary their LPT base rates, including the factors that they must consider and the type of public consultation that they should undertake as part of that process.</p></reply>

The Strategy contains 75 Actions in total and my Department, together with the Housing Agency, will be involved in the delivery of over 30 of these Actions. Under Action 8 of Construction 2020, a Social Housing Strategy is to be published by Q3 2014; to assist in its development, the Housing Agency has invited submissions by 31 July 2014. Further information is available at the following web link:</p><p>It is clear that the present and foreseeable economic context in which we must address social housing need is such that innovative, and indeed challenging, solutions must be found which will harness new funding streams. While the local authorities will continue to have the lead role in addressing social housing need, in their capacity as statutory housing authorities, the growing role of the not-for-profit sector, as represented by the Approved Housing Bodies, and other potential investors must also be further developed. My intention is that the Strategy will be both challenging and innovative, and will provide the basis for an enhanced approach to social housing provision in Ireland. It with contain clear measurable actions that are to be taken to increase the supply of social housing and, most importantly, reduce the number of people on waiting lists over the next five years.</p><p>Action 9 of Construction 2020provides that the Review of Part V of the Planning and Development Acts, which <i>inter alia</i>deals with affordable housing and social housing gain from private development, will be completed in Q2 of 2014. It is anticipated that any legislative changes required on foot of the review will be incorporated into the General Scheme of a Planning Bill, which is currently in preparation.</p><p>With the benefit of the recent injection of &euro;50 million for social housing from the Government&rsquo;s May 2014 stimulus announcement, on top of the original housing budget of some &euro;587 million, I now expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 6,000 new housing units. The number and method of delivery of social housing units in future years is determined in the course of the annual Estimates process and the Social Housing Strategy will inform the upcoming Estimates discussions.</p><p>Action 1 of Construction 2020 provides that a National Framework for Housing Supply be established on a statutory footing with an annual National Statement of Projected Housing Supply and Demand published every June. I have asked the Housing Agency to take the lead in implementing this Action; a Steering Group, including representation from the local government sector, will oversee progress and I will also close monitor progress under this Action.</p></reply>

The Council has currently 272 units of CAS accommodation funded under the Rental Accommodation Scheme, involving 30 different Approved Housing Bodies throughout the County.</p><p>  A specific issue has arisen in Claremorris concerning existing RAS and Local Authority tenants that have been nominated by Mayo County Council into a new development. The Council has requested information from the Voluntary Body concerned to support the justification for the level of rents being charged by the Body in respect of that development, as the housing authority needs to satisfy itself that best value for money is being obtained and that a fair and equitable rent is being applied.

These Committees, comprising public-private socio-economic interests, will have responsibility for local and community development programmes on an area basis. They will develop, co-ordinate and implement a more coherent and integrated approach to local and community development than heretofore, with the aim of reducing duplication and overlap and optimising the use of available resources for the benefit of citizens and communities.</p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s Local and Community Development Programme is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State. The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281m over that period.  It is being implemented by the Local Development Companies (LDCs) on a transitional basis for 2014 with a budget of &euro;47m pending the roll out of a new Social Inclusion Activation Programme in January 2015. </p><p>  The new Programme, the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP), is one of my key priorities and its budget for next year will be decided in the 2015 Estimates process. As a key intervention for the harder to reach, the Programme&rsquo;s target groups are:</p><p>    -  Children and Families from Disadvantaged Areas</p><p>    -  Lone Parents</p><p>    -  New Communities (including Refugees/Asylum Seekers)</p><p>    -  People living in Disadvantaged Communities</p><p>    -  People with Disabilities</p><p>    -  Roma</p><p>    -  The Unemployed (including those not on the Live Register)</p><p>    -  Travellers</p><p>    -  Young Unemployed People from Disadvantaged areas</p><p>  In accordance with the Public Spending Code, best practice internationally, legal advice and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients; the Programme is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently underway. </p><p>The public procurement process is a competitive process that is open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations, such as the National Collective of Community Based Women's Network (NCCWN) and the National Traveller Partnership (NTP), that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme. Joint applications are encouraged and organisations of varying sizes (for example smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations) are invited to submit joint applications.  Applicants at stage one of the tendering process must demonstrate that they meet the criteria for the delivery of services in the Lot(s) applied for. Partner Candidates have a role in the delivery and implementation of the programme. All such Partner Candidates must be identified in the Qualification Questionnaire and a contracting arrangement may be required between the Lead Candidate and any Partner Candidates. Candidates may rely on the resources of other entities in order to establish the suitability requirements on condition that they can prove to the satisfaction of Pobal that they will have these resources at their disposal when necessary. </p><p>  All proposals received will be assessed in accordance with the assessment criteria notified with the tender documentation and the contract or contracts will be awarded on the basis of that assessment. Pobal is assisting my Department and the LCDCs in the preparation of the tender documentation and the assessment criteria.</p></reply>

Following this, my Department will conduct a two-stage process to select Local Development Strategies providing the opportunity to develop partnerships with full and comprehensive consultation thus maintaining the integrity of a Community Led Local Development approach.</p><p>  My Department will issue an open call inviting all entities that meet the eligibility criteria to be considered as Local Action Groups (LAGs) to express an interest in being selected to develop Local Development Strategies (LDS) for the 2014-2020 Programme. The eligibility criteria will be drawn up in such a way to ensure that the best LAGs possible are selected to develop strategies including conformity with EU requirements in terms of LAG makeup, capacity to undertake the work and financial capacity to deliver the programme.</p><p>  It is intended to select a single strategy in each area and therefore in cases where more than one strategy is submitted the groups involved will be asked to come together in partnership to jointly prepare and agree a single strategy in order to ensure that the most comprehensive and coherent strategies come forward for consideration and approval by my Department. I expect that the programme will be operational in early 2015.  Once the LDs are submitted to my Department, they will be reviewed by an Evaluation Committee, on foot of which allocations will be recommended.</p></reply>

The statement also announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes on the basis that these had been symptoms of, rather than solutions to, an overheated property market.  The policy statement reaffirms the State&rsquo;s commitment to supporting access to home ownership for lower to middle income households and the current range of paths to home ownership will remain in place in that regard.</p><p>There are two types of house purchase loan available from local authorities: standard annuity loans targeted at lower income first time buyers and those under the Home Choice Loan scheme which are available to qualifying middle income first time buyers affected by the &ldquo;credit crunch&rdquo;.  The terms and conditions governing the operation, including eligibility terms, of annuity mortgages and the Home Choice Loan are set out under various Regulations such as the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009, the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009, and most recently in the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012. These are available on my Department&rsquo;s website: .</p><p>It is not the intention of the Home Choice Loan scheme &ndash; or of any other Government intervention in the housing sector &ndash; to incentivise people into the market. It is designed only to facilitate credit worthy households who have been affected by conditions in the mortgage market.  As such, the scheme is a temporary one which will be withdrawn once conditions in credit markets return to normal patterns. Recent data published by the Central Bank would indicate that that point has not yet been reached.  To ensure effective targeting of limited resources, local authority loan finance continues to be available to first time buyers only.  The option currently available for non-first time local authority homeowners wishing to relocate is to seek home loan facilities from one of the commercial lending institutions.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s 2011 Housing Policy Statement also announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2013.  Details regarding the review   are available on my Department&rsquo;s website:</p><p>Dublin City Council did not make a submission as part of this public consultation.</p><p>In 2013, I asked the Housing Agency to conduct a stand-alone review of the shared ownership scheme, including identification of the main difficulties and recommendations for mitigating measures. Dublin City Council has contributed to this review and its input has been given careful consideration. While I have received an initial draft of the review from the Agency a number of issues have been identified that need further detailed financial analysis. For example, full information on the status of each local authority&rsquo;s loan book is required in order to accurately determine the implications of any possible solutions to shared ownership issues for local authority debt management generally.  This substantial data collection project involving my Department, the Local Government Management Agency and the local authorities themselves is under way. It will be a number of months before sufficient data has been collected in order to complete the requisite analysis to enable the completion of the review.</p><p>Pending full conclusion of this review, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities setting out some of the options and interim actions that might be explored to alleviate the difficulties of those in shared ownership distress such as allowing use of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and room rental for Shared Ownership mortgage holders. It is accepted that these proposals are not a complete solution to the issues that arise for such mortgage holders but are intended as an interim measure pending outcome of the review.</p><p>I fully recognise that shared ownership home owners, amongst others, have been affected by issues such as unemployment and possible negative equity. In such cases, borrowers should actively engage with their lenders, whether a commercial financial institution or a local authority, to seek to avail of one of the options available to provide sustainable solutions to distressed mortgages. Any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme will be made in the context of both reviews.</p><p>The mortgage arrears resolution process, already in place in respect of commercial mortgages, is now being implemented across all local authorities. In cases of acute mortgage distress, homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now in place to deal with personal insolvency. On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears, the Government launched a Mortgage to Rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012. This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body and the family becomes a tenant of the approved housing body. Eligibility requirements are in line with other forms of social housing support.  The scheme for local authority borrowers in arrears, which was piloted in two local authority areas, Westmeath County Council and Dublin City Council, has now been rolled out nationally.</p></reply>

In December 2013 I allocated a further &euro;4 million among the LAGs who had seen the greatest reduction in the May 2013 revision and also to the Gaeltacht areas. In this regard, Longford was allocated an additional &euro;172,105 and Westmeath an additional &euro;217,105.  The revised allocations available to Longford Community Resources and Westmeath Community Development are &euro;7,198,679 and &euro;9,015,451, respectively.

In recognition of the lower average motor tax paid in respect of vehicles taxed on the basis of CO<sub>2</sub>emissions compared to vehicles taxed on the basis of engine capacity, whilst at the same time maintaining the incentive for purchasers of new vehicles to buy low emission vehicles, differential increases were applied in recent budgets. The level of increase applied to vehicles taxed on engine capacity, the basis of taxation for pre-2008 cars, was less than that applied to newer vehicles taxed on the basis of CO<sub>2</sub>emissions. The average increase in motor tax for passenger vehicles taxed on engine capacity was 7.5% in Budgets 2012 and 2013, compared with increases in 2012 ranging from 7.5% to 54%, and in 2013 ranging from 4% to 25%, for vehicles charged on the basis of CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions.  In Budget 2013, 4 new bands below 140g CO<sub>2</sub>/km, as well as a zero band for electric vehicles, were introduced to facilitate the continued incentivising of low emission vehicles   and the maintenance of the tax base.</p><p>The vehicle fleet is progressively replaced by cars taxed on the basis of CO<sub>2</sub>rather than engine capacity.  At 31 May 2014, 31.4 % of the passenger vehicle fleet was taxed on the basis of CO<sub>2</sub>emissions and the proportion of the fleet taxed on this basis is increasing by approximately 5 percentage points per year.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from each customer in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.</p><p>Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulation s 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied is wholesome and clean. Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations.</p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with these Regulations.  In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in the Regulations, the water supplier will investigate the cause in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health exists , with the Health Service Executive, to ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken. This may include the prohibition or the restriction (e.g. a boil water notice) of the supply by the water supplier. The EPA publishes an annual report on the quality of drinking water supplies in Ireland, which sets out details on the numbers of water restrictions and boil water notices. Copies of these reports are available in the Oireachtas library or from the EPA website (<i>).</i></p><p>I intend to use my powers under the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 to issue a Water Charges Policy Direction to the CER in relation to a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including where the quality of water services provided by Irish Water to customers is impaired or where services are reduced or restricted. Neither hard water nor the substances associated with hard water, such as lime, calcium and magnesium, require the restriction of a supply.  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 requires the CER to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers of Irish Water. This is similar to the CER&rsquo;s statutory role in respect of the gas and electricity sectors. I fully expect that the CER will consider compliance with statutory standards by Irish Water in the discharge of its functions.</p></reply>

The regulations do not address any issues relating to assistance and therapy dogs; however I acknowledge that the restrictions imposed for safety reasons, are likely to be a factor in determining suitability as assistance and therapy dogs.  As with many matters of public policy, there is a balance to be struck between the importance of public safety and any difficulty arising in the suitability of certain breeds as assistance and therapy dogs. The vast majority of dog breeds are not affected by restrictions arising from the Control of Dogs Regulations 1998, and given the public safety considerations, I am satisfied that the current breed restrictions a re appropriate.</p></reply>

General purpose grants are a contribution from my Department towards meeting the cost to local authorities of providing a reasonable level of services to their customers.   </p><p>The information requested is set out in the table below which details the total general purpose grant allocations in 2014 from the Local Government Fund for all local authorities in each county.  The amount to be paid to local authorities from the Local Government Fund for general purpose grants in 2014 is &euro;28 2m; this figure recognises the removal of water related costs from local authorities to Irish Water in 2014.   </p><p>Local authorities&rsquo; cost and income bases vary significantly from one another and calculating an appropriate distribution of these grants is complex. General purpose grants are structured to bring about equalisation over time; that is a position of balance where the financial needs of local authorities are met by their resources and they are able to provide an appropriate level of service to their customers.  In determining these grants a number of factors are taken into account including the overall funding available for this purpose, the estimated cost to each authority of providing a reasonable level of services to their customers, the income each authority should generate from local sources and the necessity to provide each authority with a baseline allocation that supports its financial stability.   <table><tr><th>County</th><th>GPG 2014<br /><br />&euro;</th><th>2011<br /><br />Population Census</th><th>GPG <br /><br />Per capita<br /><br />&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td>5,352,469</td><td>54,612</td><td>&euro;98.01</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>8,458,415</td><td>73,183</td><td>&euro;115.58</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>2,646,284</td><td>117,196</td><td>&euro;22.58</td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>11,495,809</td><td>519,032</td><td>&euro;22.15</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>22,720,760</td><td>161,137</td><td>&euro;141.00</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin </td><td>9,770,529</td><td>1,273,069</td><td>&euro;7.67</td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>14,132,810</td><td>250,653</td><td>&euro;56.38</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>11,043,837</td><td>145,502</td><td>&euro;75.90</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>9,686,924</td><td>210,312</td><td>&euro;46.06</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td>9,356,019</td><td>95,419</td><td>&euro;98.05</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>7,631,324</td><td>80,559</td><td>&euro;94.73</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>8,282,319</td><td>31,798</td><td>&euro;260.47</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick </td><td>14,625,159</td><td>191,809</td><td>&euro;76.25</td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td>8,119,493</td><td>39,000</td><td>&euro;208.19</td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>8,243,835</td><td>122,897</td><td>&euro;67.08</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>17,492,594</td><td>130,638</td><td>&euro;133.90</td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>8,799,199</td><td>184,135</td><td>&euro;47.79</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>10,247,882</td><td>60,483</td><td>&euro;169.43</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td>6,663,642</td><td>76,687</td><td>&euro;86.89</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>9,107,439</td><td>64,065</td><td>&euro;142.16</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>9,993,352</td><td>65,393</td><td>&euro;152.82</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary </td><td>22,755,110</td><td>158,754</td><td>&euro;143.34</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford </td><td>16,524,431</td><td>113,795</td><td>&euro;145.21</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>10,115,479</td><td>86,164</td><td>&euro;117.40</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td>11,888,576</td><td>145,320</td><td>&euro;81.81</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td>6,846,310</td><td>136,640</td><td>&euro;50.10</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The primary purpose of the legislation is to re-unite the original account holders with their moneys, including all interest due. In addition, the legislation provides that disbursements from the fund may be made for charitable purposes or for purposes of community benefit.   </p><p>The Dormant Accounts Disbursement Scheme for 2013-2016 was approved by Government in December 2013 and sets out the objectives to be achieved by making disbursements from the fund.  The 2012 Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act also provides for the preparation of an action plan to give effect to the disbursement scheme.  My Department has been consulting with relevant Government Departments and Pobal in this regard with a view to the Action Plan being completed in the coming weeks. Once the Plan is adopted, it will be possible to commence implementation of measures under the Plan.  The assessment criteria and the application procedures for Dormant Accounts will be published as will a list of the projects ultimately funded.</p></reply>

The new scheme will be broadly similar to the two incremental purchase schemes currently in operation, relating to newly-built local authority houses and local authority apartments respectively. </p><p>I expect that the Bill will be enacted by the summer, following which I will prescribe the commencement date and the detailed terms of the scheme. </p><p>There are currently two types of house purchase loan available from local authorities: standard annuity loans targeted at lower income first time buyers and loans under the Home Choice Loan scheme which are available to qualifying middle income first time buyers.     </p><p>The terms and conditions governing the operation of annuity mortgages are set out under various Regulations such as the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009, the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009, and most recently in the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012. These are available on my Department&rsquo;s website:<i></i></p><p>The Regulations prescribe that the amount of a loan shall not exceed &euro;200,000.<b></b>Loans shall not be<b></b>available in the case of a single borrower, where the borrower&rsquo;s annual gross<b></b>income is more than &euro;50,000;<b></b>or in the case of a joint application, where the combined income of the<b></b>borrowers is more than &euro;75,000.   </p><p>The Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009 provide for the issuing of written guidance in the form of a credit policy for the processing of loan applications and the making of loans by all local authorities. The credit policy, introduced with these Regulations, underpins local authority lending and ensures prudence and consistency in approach.  As part of the loan application procedure, the Housing Agency provides an underwriting and support service to all local authorities.  This shared central service processes loan applications, carries out credit checks and issues a recommendation to the local authority on each loan application in accordance with the credit policy.  The final decision on loan approval is a matter for each local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis.  Accordingly, the local authority issues the loan and the Housing Agency provides an underwriting and support service to the local authority during the loan application process.   </p><p>House purchase loans are not, as a general rule, available to those in receipt of unemployment/social welfare benefits.  However, where there is a primary income of a permanent waged/salaried nature, and where the secondary income is from the Department of Social Protection, then long term social welfare payments can be considered, provided the long term nature of the payment is confirmed by the Department of Social Protection or other relevant Government Department.</p></reply>

Building on this, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 reinforces the primacy of the elected council within the local government system, and provides a legislative basis for a stronger and more explicit statutory expression of the powers of elected members and the duty of the Chief Executive to comply with policy as set down by the elected members, together with measures to strengthen the capacity generally of the elected council to oversee the business of the authority. </p><p>The change from Manager to Chief Executive is an important aspect of clarifying, in a more modern sense, the appropriate roles of the executive in implementing the policy of the council, with the elected members acting as, in effect, the board of directors of the authority.  In that context, elected members now   have the power of decision over the appointment of the individual recommended by the Public Appointments Service for the Chief Executive post in their authority, while retaining the independence of the selection procedures of the Public Appointments Service. </p><p>The powers of the elected members in overseeing the implementation of policy by the Chief Executive have also been strengthened, including specific provision for   -</p><p>-  The requirement on the Chief Executive to submit monthly management reports;</p><p>-  The requirement on the Chief Executive to report, and if requested review, the actions taken or planned to implement the directions of the council in their reserved functions, and the power to require the Chief Executive to indicate the changes in the actions intended to implement a reserved function where the elected members give reasons why they consider the actions already taken or planned are not sufficient;</p><p>-  The requirement that the Chief Executive advise on the review of any policy, or the implementation of any policy, approved as a reserved function;</p><p>-  The requirement on the Chief Executive to report on, and if requested review, his/her exercise of executive functions;</p><p>-  A strengthened Corporate Policy Group (CPG), with the Cathaoirleach and Strategic Policy Committee (SPC) Chairs being joined by a representative of each municipal district where not otherwise on the CPG;</p><p>-  The requirement on the Chief Executive to give advice and respond to requests for information to all working levels of elected members below the full council (municipal district, committees); the requirements apply to the full council only at present;</p><p>-  The requirement to present draft policy proposals to the council, or the relevant SPC as appropriate, in a timely manner;</p><p>-  The requirement on the Chief Executive to have regard to views of elected members as policy is being developed by them, rather than only when it is fully formed;</p><p>-  Inclusion in the Corporate Plan of all policy positions of the council (which are reserved functions) not otherwise captured by policy statements. </p><p>The Local Government Reform Act 2014 also creates some important new reserved functions to be discharged by the elected members, including the adoption of integrated local economic and community development plans, and service delivery plans.  The role of the elected members is also being strengthened in the context of the new system of municipal districts including in the context of the draft local authority budgetary plan.</p></reply>

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  The Water Services Act 2013 provide for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake this metering programme.   </p><p>  Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that it was always anticipated that in the course of installing a meter, pre-existing leaks and other latent defects due to the age or condition of the water pipes would be discovered.  It is important to note that these leaks are not caused by Irish Water&rsquo;s contractors.  The meter installation programme gives Irish Water a strong starting point for mains rehabilitation by enabling the discovery of pre-existing leaks and helping to target more effective investment in leak repair. Where a leak is identified on the public water mains, as was the case in this instance, the repairs are undertaken by the local authority, acting as agents for Irish Water, as agreed under the Service Level Agreements.  The cost of these repairs is part of the operating costs of Irish Water.  In the case outlined, an existing leaking water main ferrule was encountered whilst excavating outside the property.  This was reported by the metering contractors and Fingal County Council, working on behalf of Irish Water, visited the location of the leak and the repair was made on 14 May 2014. </p><p>The Government has decided to introduce a &ldquo;first fix free policy&rdquo; to assist householders who may have leaks on their property.  The scheme is estimated to cost some &euro;51 million to the end of 2016. Details of the scheme and the conditions applying will be announced by Irish Water shortly.</p></reply>

The amendments will provide that the third party may refer a complaint to the PRTB where they have attempted to resolve the issues with the landlord alone, rather than with both landlord and tenant which they must do under the Act currently. In addition, the amendments will provide that an owners&rsquo; management company, a residents&rsquo; association or a neighbourhood watch scheme may bring a third party complaint to the PRTB.</p><p>The <i>Programme for Government</i>includes a commitment to establish a tenancy deposit protection scheme. On foot of this commitment I asked the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) to commission research on such a scheme and to report back to me with recommendations in that regard. The subsequent report assessed a number of different options for delivery of a scheme and, following consideration of these options, I secured Government approval for the establishment of a scheme based on a custodial model.</p><p>Legislative provisions for the deposit protection scheme, together with the anti-social behaviour amendments, are currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and it is my intention to introduce the amendments at Committee Stage of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 in the Seanad shortly.</p></reply>

As part of this process, my Department wrote to the Department of Health in September 2013 inviting any input that they might have on the health aspects, if any, of wind farms.       </p><p>  Preliminary feedback was received from a Deputy Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of the Department of Health on 11th November 2013, which indicated that wind turbines do not represent a threat to public health. This feedback was based on a 2009 literature review conducted by the Australian Government&rsquo;s National Health and Medical Research Council. </p><p>  The Deputy CMO subsequently wrote to my Department on 11 April 2014 to advise that Australia&rsquo;s National Health and Medical Research Council have recently updated their evidence in relation to this matter. In that letter, the Deputy CMO states &lsquo;This review again supports previous advice that there is no reliable or consistent evidence that wind farms directly cause adverse health effects in humans.&rsquo;  The Deputy CMO also refers to the limited number of peer reviewed articles and research in this area and that Australia&rsquo;s National Health and Medical Research Council may recommend further high quality research. My Department will continue to liaise with the Department of Health, particularly in relation to the findings of any further international peer reviewed research on this subject. The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has also been made aware of this ongoing dialogue in the context of the implementation of their renewable energy policy (including wind energy). </p><p>  My Department published draft revisions to the Wind Energy Development Guidelines on 11th December 2013 and commenced a period of public consultation. A stringent absolute outdoor noise limit (day and night) for future wind energy developments has been proposed in these draft revisions to Guidelines. This takes into account the 2009 World Health Organisation&rsquo;s findings in relation to night time noise, when people are generally sleeping, and the recent review of international practice on wind noise undertaken by Marshall Day Acoustics. </p><p>  Submissions were received from 7,500 groups and individuals during the public consultation period, which are currently being considered by my Department. Following consideration of these submissions, my Department intends to consult further with the Department of Health prior to finalising the revised Wind Energy Development Guidelines. </p></reply>

Following the enactment of the legislation, a statutory pilot phase will commence in Limerick and the six other local authorities identified for participation in Wave 1 of implementing HAP.  These are South Dublin County Council, Cork County Council, Waterford City and County Council, Kilkenny County Council, Louth County Council and Monaghan County Council. </p><p>  The introduction of HAP will bring about a major change in the way in which social housing support is provided in this country. A review of both the administrative and statutory pilot phases will be carried out prior to commencing a wider roll-out on a phased basis to the remaining local authorities commencing in 2015. The review process of both phases will be instrumental in identifying the on-going resource requirements and any necessary changes to the scheme in advance of general roll-out.</p></reply>

Accordingly, both lands that have been transferred to the Housing Agency and local authority held lands suitable for development will be the first sites considered in any future targeted social housing building programme. My Department&rsquo;s annual Housing Land Availability Survey (HLAS) gathers information from local authorities to inform the publication of the amount of zoned residential land in their areas that is currently serviced. It is currently estimated that there is in excess of 25,000 hectares of undeveloped residentially zoned land nationally, which equates to a capacity for over 500,000 new homes (based on a national average of 20 units per hectare). This capacity is considered to be sufficient to meet the housing requirements nationally for in excess of the next ten years. In line with the commitments under the Construction 2020 Strategy  , a Housing Supply Co-ordination Task Force for Dublin has been established with an immediate focus on addressing supply-related issues in that area. </p><p>Under Action 8 of Construction 2020, a Social Housing Strategy is to be published by Q3 2014. To assist in the development of the Social Housing Strategy, the Housing Agency has invited submissions by 31 July 2014. This invitation for submissions is available at the following weblink:</p><p>Action 9 of Construction 2020 provides that a Review of Part V of the Planning and Development Acts, which, <i>inter alia</i>, deals with affordable housing and with social housing gain from private development, will be completed by the end of Q2 2014.  It is anticipated that any legislative changes required on foot of the review will be incorporated into the General Scheme of a Planning Bill, which is currently in preparation.   </p><p>I am acutely conscious of the difficulties caused by rising rents and of the problem of sourcing suitable accommodation, especially in Dublin and other urban centres, with growing evidence of increasing rents affecting more vulnerable tenants such as those in receipt of rent supplement. I have asked the PRTB to carry out a focused piece of research that will explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector and to report back to me with policy recommendations in the coming weeks.   </p><p>On 30 April 2014, the Government approved the publication of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 which when enacted, will provide for the introduction of the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme. HAP will provide a new framework for the provision of rental assistance and will, in as much as it can, facilitate the removal of existing barriers to employment by allowing HAP recipients remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. </p><p>The statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments carried out in 2013 show s that there were 89,872 households on local authority waiting lists as at 7 May 2013. The Summary is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:</p><p>I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 6,000 new housing units. The number and method of delivery of social housing units in future years is determined in the course of the annual Estimates process and will be informed by the Social Housing Strategy currently in preparation, which will set out clear objectives in respect of delivery over the next five years.   </p><p>Earlier this year, I signalled a return to modest levels of new social housing construction with an announcement of 1,000 new housing starts over the 2014-2015 period. The Government also recognises the importance of a wider response to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms. </p><p>In the 2014 Estimates, funding for housing, at over &euro;587 million, was effectively maintained at 2013 levels. This includes a &euro;50 million capital stimulus to support construction and related programmes, primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million to recommence a public house building programme. As part of the Government&rsquo;s additional &euro;200 million stimulus package for the construction sector, announced in May 2014, a further &euro;50 million is also being provided for social housing delivery. </p><p>In March 2014, I announced the approval of some 56 social housing construction projects with an overall value of some &euro;68 million under the Local Authority housing construction programme for 2014-2015. This will deliver 449 new units of accommodation for people on the housing waiting list. &euro;20 million of the May 2014 stimulus announcement will be made available for further new local authority projects, details of which I intend to announce shortly.</p><p>Earlier this year I also announced details of a new measure with funding of &euro;15 million which will be invested in bringing 952 vacant and boarded-up local authority houses back into productive use. &euro;20 million of the additional May 2014 stimulus will be used to fund the refurbishment of an additional 1,000 vacant units. </p><p>I have also announced details of the allocations to local authorities under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme for the construction and acquisition of housing for persons with specific categories of housing need over the 2014-2015 period. Some &euro;46 million is being set aside for this programme which is intended to deliver in the region of 416 new homes, of which 216 will be new build at a cost of &euro;25 million. &euro;10 million of this is being provided for the immediate acquisition of some 66 properties to address homelessness in the Dublin area. </p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  </p><p>The CER has considerable economic regulatory experience in the energy sector in relation to price setting mechanisms and customer protection. As part of its water regulatory functions, the CER is undertaking   a robust analysis of Irish Water&rsquo;s costs and this will include the use of benchmarking as a method of incentivising efficient business operations. The CER will operate in an open and transparent manner in carrying out its functions and making decisions in relation to the setting of water charges. </p><p>The Government has decided, following consideration of proposals in relation to the funding model for Irish Water, to provide a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply. The Government has also decided to provide for an additional free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as child benefit, such that water charges will in effect only apply to adults in such households. </p><p>The Act requires Irish Water to put in place an investment plan setting out where it considers investment in infrastructure is necessary for the effective performance of its functions. In developing investment plans, Irish Water are required to take account of a range of other policy considerations including river basin management plans and local area plans.  Irish Water has published its Proposed Capital In vestment Plan for 2014 to 2016 and it is available on its website ().</p><p>Irish Water are proposing to prioritise investment where it can deliver the most urgently needed improvements in drinking water quality, leakage, water availability, wastewater compliance, efficiencies and customer service.  Irish Water propose s to deliver or progress over 380 projects under the Plan which has been submitted to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) for consideration in the context of setting water charges.</p></reply>

I have increased the level of funding available for the grants by 12% in 2014.   Every local authority has increased funding for grants compared to their initial allocation for 2013.  The detailed administration of these schemes, including the assessment, approval and payment of grants to applicants under the various grant measures, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.   </p><p>  In January 2014, some changes to the terms and conditions of the grant schemes were notified to local authorities. These changes are intended to spread the benefits of the schemes as widely as possible and to ensure fairness and value for money in their operation.

My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy, provision of training support, issue of guidance on operational and other related matters and the provision of capital funding. </p><p>  The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires which occur as well as the fire protection measures in place.   The fire services in the cities of Dublin, Cork, and Limerick are staffed on a full-time basis; Galway, Waterford, Drogheda and Dundalk have a combined full-time and retained service; while fire services in all other communities are provided by the retained system, which operates on a call-out basis when required. </p><p>  In February 2013, I published Keeping Communities safe (KCS), which , as national policy, is intended to keep fire safety and fire services in Ireland in line with international best practice.  KCS includes, inter alia, the rationalisation of structures to deliver effective fire services. This entails fire services remaining within local authorities, but service delivery is to be reshaped from the current 30 fire services to 21 &ndash; 14 single service delivery units and 7 shared services. </p><p>  KCS is based on a risk management approach, which addresses the critical elements of fire prevention and fire protection within buildings a s well as response. In that vein, each fire service is currently undertaking an initial risk categorisation process for its functional area. In order to provide a comprehensive and effective fire service to the community, Section 26 of the Fire Services Act provides that local authorities adopt fire and emergency operations plans, indicating the provision made in respect of organisation, appliances, equipment, fire stations, training, operational procedure and any such matters as may be relevant. The risk categorisation process referred to above will help inform local decision making in this regard.</p></reply>

This has entailed a number of significant measures which includes further rationalisation of Army Barracks and the recent re-organisation of the Defence Forces, both Permanent and Reserve.   Arising from the comprehensive review of expenditure in 2011, the Government decided to stabilise the strength of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) at 9,500 personnel. Resulting from the revised strength ceiling, a major re-organisation of the Permanent Defence Force was initiated.  Key aspects of the reorganisation included the consolidation of three under-strength Army Brigades into two full strength Brigades, the consolidation of under-strength units into a smaller number of full strength units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and the associated re-deployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational units.</p><p>  A major reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) was implemented in 2013. The RDF is now organised alongside the Permanent Defence Force within a more efficient single force structure.</p><p>  A White Paper on Defence is due to be completed and submitted to Government for approval later this year. Working Groups comprising of civil and military representatives are considering future operational demands and the defence capabilities required to meet projected future operational requirements, including requirements to aid the civil power. This work will underpin recommendations regarding defence provision for the next decade. I do not intend to pre-empt or second guess the outcome of the White Paper at this stage.</p></reply>

For the last three years, my Department has included a Farm Safety message with the Single Payment application packs, which were distributed each year to over 130,000 farmers.  This was a joint initiative between my Department, the Health and Safety Authority and the Farm Safety Partnership Committee and led to each of those farmers receiving an individual reminder of the importance of farming safely, and the potentially fatal consequences of not doing so.  In 2013 that Farm Safety message was entirely focused on safe slurry handling with the message that &ldquo;ONE LUNGFUL OF SLURRY GAS CAN KILL&rdquo; and also included the list of Safe Agitation Guidelines provided by my Department.</p><p>  A number of other steps have been taken over recent years in collaboration with other State and industry organisations to raise awareness of the problem of farm accidents and to educate farmers and their families on the dangers associated with working in this industry.</p><p>  For example, in November 2012, I launched the pilot Farm Safety Mentor Programme, which is an initiative by Irish Rural Link with the support of the HSA to enable farmers to become farm safety ambassadors in their own community.  In April of this year, I launched the DVDs produced as part of the Programme, and they will now be used by the Farm Safety Mentors and others to help raise awareness of the dangers of slurry gas.</p><p>  The HSA also produced an excellent DVD in recent times containing testimonials from individual farmers who provide an emotional telling of their experiences of farm accidents which led to either fatalities or serious injury.  This DVD has been widely circulated and is included in all training courses undertaken by my Department.</p><p>  Teagasc and the HSA distributed a leaflet entitled &ldquo;Safe Slurry handling&rdquo; at the ploughing championships in September 2013 which details the Safe Operating Procedures for the agitation of slurry and details the dangers of slurry gas.  My Department&rsquo;s specification for bovine livestock units and reinforced tanks (S.123) gives detailed advice in relation to the safe agitation of slurry, and safe design of tanks.</p><p>   Since taking office, I have continuously worked to increase awareness of safety issues among farmers which I believe is the key to changing the way we all think about farm safety on Irish farms.  We must be continuously aware and vigilant of all the dangers on Irish farms and pursue the goal of preventing accidents and therefore saving lives and minimising serious injuries of all types.</p></reply>

Live exports serve a dual purpose as a means of satisfying legitimate market demands for live animals and providing alternative market outlets for farmers. </p><p>  Despite concerns about the trade in live cattle, total exports to date this year are 140,000 head, of which 24,000 went to the UK, an increase of some 3,370 head or 16% up on the comparable period in 2013. Of this 24,000, some 17,000 went to Northern Ireland which is an increase of 10% on the same period in 2013.</p><p>  However, the potential to grow the live trade to the UK even further is constrained by the buying specifications operated by the British retail chains in relation to cattle born in this country and exported live for finishing and processing in that market. The retailers&rsquo; long-standing policy is to market British and Irish beef separately. This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country; i.e. born, reared and slaughtered in the same country. In addition, logistical difficulties arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant. Under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcases have to be deboned in a separate batch, packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor. This therefore decreases the attractiveness of animals born or reared in the Republic.</p><p>  While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised this issue with British retailers over the years, they are unlikely to reverse their marketing policy in the short term. Nevertheless Bord Bia, will continue to pursue all opportunities to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner.  In addition Bord Bia actively supports the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity. </p><p>  I will continue to engage with my Northern counterpart, Ms Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, on issues relevant to producers including cross-border trade. However according to the report produced by Mr. Michael Dowling for the Beef Roundtable discussions on 3 June last it is unlikely that the retailers&rsquo; position will change in the short term.</p></reply>

There are two main measures which facilitate the inter-generational transfers of farms by relieving the capital tax burden for both the transferor and the transferee: retirement Relief&rsquo; from Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is available where an individual, who is at least 55 years, disposes of the whole or part of their qualifying assets, either by sale or gift. Although the relief is commonly known as retirement relief, a claimant does not have to retire in order to qualify. For parent to child transfers, an individual aged 55 to 65 years can claim relief on the full consideration amount without limit. Relief for those aged 66 years or more can be claimed on the consideration amount up to a limit of &euro;3 million.  Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisition Tax (CAT) operates by reducing the market value of &lsquo;agricultural property&rsquo; by 90%, so that the tax payable is calculated on an amount substantially less than the market value. It is available to those qualifying as a &lsquo;farmer&rsquo; at the valuation date, i.e. an individual whose &lsquo;agricultural property&rsquo;, after the gift or inheritance, is at least 80% of their total assets.   There are other measures that assist inter-generational transfers: stamp Duty Consanguinity Relief on Non-residential Transfers&rsquo; provides for a reduced stamp duty rate of 1% applicable to transfers between certain close relations.

This initiative was intended to provide a useful forum for all the main players in the industry to engage positively and present constructive ideas on positioning the sector to address the challenges and prepare for the opportunities that lie ahead.</p><p>  The discussions at the second roundtable included presentations from ICBF, Bord Bia and Teagasc with the main focus on the presentation by Mr. Michael Dowling, who had updated his work on the implementation of the Beef Activation Group report.  Bord Bia&rsquo;s presentation gave an update on the additional marketing work that it will undertake in key markets for Irish beef including the UK, Netherlands and Germany with the extra &euro;0.5 million allocated for this purpose.  ICBF&rsquo;s presentation showed the contribution that better breeding can move to improving profitability for Irish beef farmers. Teagasc focused on the work it is doing to educate farmers on efficient production to increase output per unit and ultimately the farm&rsquo;s operating margins. All of the presentations are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and I have called on all interested stakeholders to study them and communicate any suggestions for further work to my Department. </p><p>  In his report, Mr Dowling recommended among other items that consideration be given in particular to the following main points: Improved transparency and timely  communication on price and market  specification between particularly suppliers and processors; a formalised mechanism for ensuring that research, breeding and education remains consistent with evolving market realities; the potential for Producer Organisations recognised under the EU&rsquo;s Common Market organisation rules to play a role in building scale for farmers in the supply chain and building more professional relationships with the processing sector; the possibility for more formalised contract arrangements between factories and their suppliers.</p><p>  On the question of transparency, my department has already made a number of improvements to its website in order to make price information more user friendly for farmers. This is a key step along the road to developing a Beef Pricewatch app for mobile phones and tablets. The Dowling report also calls on processors to ensure that communication with farmers on any changes to market specifications takes account of the normal production cycle. </p><p>  In addition I am making arrangements to ensure that Teagasc, Bord Bia and ICBF engage to ensure that advice, education and breeding policy remains consistent with evolving market realities. </p><p>  Furthermore my Department is examining the possibility of legislating for the recognition of producer organisations in the beef sector, and will shortly be launching a consultation with key stakeholder groups in this regard. </p><p>  Of course the key objective of this forum was to provide a vehicle, but not the only vehicle, to facilitate positive engagement between stakeholders in the beef sector, including processors and farmers. It is clear that the relationship between these parties is one of mutual dependency and there may be significant benefits for both suppliers and processors from extending the use of more formalised supply contracts where this is possible. </p><p>  On questions of price, these are matters for the market, and for negotiation between the contracting parties. However, it  is clearly the case that the best interests of the industry will be served by honest engagement, transparency, clear communications, and by a recognition of the legitimate concerns of each of the parties. While there is a responsibility on farmers to improve efficiency and reduce costs behind the farm gate, it is equally the case that their clear vulnerability to sharp changes in market conditions must be recognised, and that the relationship between parties along the beef supply chain must be carefully managed with this in mind, if supply is to be maintained and the beef sector is to perform to its potential in the future.  </p><p>  At this juncture I would urge the stakeholders to reflect carefully on the proceedings at the first two meetings of the beef forum, and on the Dowling report, and to take time to engage with each other on its recommendations in order to find mutually satisfactory solutions to the current issues.</p></reply>

The aim of this review is to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place to facilitate the growth and development of the greyhound racing industry into the future.  The review encompasses the policy, governance and regulatory framework and the financial situation of Bord na gCon. The report documenting the findings of the review will assess the current situation with regard to Bord na gCon and will make recommendations as to any changes required to best place the industry to meet the challenges that lie ahead in a very dynamic and challenging environment. This review is progressing very well but more detailed investigations were considered appropriate by the external consultants conducting the review on a number of specific issues that arose as part of the analysis undertaken. The consultants have agreed to undertake this additional analysis at no extra cost to the Exchequer. It is anticipated that a draft report, including the additional analysis, will be completed by the end of this month.  On receipt of the draft report, my Department will have to review and consider the contents and any action required prior to publication.</p></reply>

These include mandatory inspections of hares and coursing venues in advance of the commencement of an event. Greyhounds involved in coursing are subject to the provisions of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and the Code of Practice for the care and welfare of greyhounds, published by Bord na gCon.</p><p>The ICC has assured the Department that it goes to great lengths to ensure the highest standards are adhered to during coursing.  The ICC's rules and regulations (Rule 106) accommodate the postponement of meetings if the weather is unfavourable i.e. snowfall, frost or waterlogged ground, which may affect the welfare of both greyhound and hare. </p><p>The ICC has demonstrated its willingness to cancel / postpone meetings in the face of adverse weather conditions, For example, one coursing meeting was cancelled on 23 November 2013 due to heavy frost, and this would be a routine practice for all clubs affiliated to the ICC. Also meetings were postponed over the Christmas (2013) period due to other unfavourable weather conditions.  During extreme weather conditions, it is also the practice of clubs to provide additional food for hares living on hare preserves protected by coursing clubs.  </p><p>The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2012, has responsibility for the issuing of an annual licence to the ICC and its affiliated clubs to capture live hares. These licences currently have a total of 26 conditions attached to them.  The conditions of these licences cover a range of items, including veterinary supervision at coursing meetings and a number of requirements attaching to the welfare of hares.</p><p>The ICC ensures that a veterinary surgeon and a control steward are present at all coursing meetings.  In addition to this, veterinary staff from my Department and rangers from the National Parks and Wildlife Service (part of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht) carry out random inspections during the coursing season to monitor compliance with the licences and the rules governing animal welfare.  </p><p>As a further control, a Coursing Monitoring Committee was established during the 1993/94 coursing season and comprises officials from my Department and representatives from both the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the ICC who monitor developments in coursing. In that regard the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in with the welfare of hares and greyhounds alike in mind.</p><p>A very high proportion (99.4%) of the hares captured for hare coursing were returned to the wild at the end of the 2013/2014 season  <i>. </i></p><p>The systems that are in place are, in my view, effective and are working well.</p></reply>

On a regulatory level, local authorities have responsibility under the Control of Horses Act, 1996 for dealing with straying and abandoned horses. My Department makes a contribution to local authority towards implementation of the Act and in this regard local authorities were paid over &euro;3m in 2013 to assist with horses and to support their efforts towards re-homing of horses found abandoned.  My Department also assists animal rescue/welfare organisations in their work in horse welfare activities. These organisations involved in horse welfare had their ex-gratia funding significantly increased in respect of 2014.</p><p>  I have also indicated that my Department will also work on initiatives to assist horse welfare including facilitating stallion castration programmes in an effort to reduce indiscriminate breeding and unwanted foal births. Assistance can also be provided to local authorities for urban/traveller horse projects which promote horse welfare through provision of training programmes in horse management and welfare. </p><p>  New regulations on transfer of ownership of horses, which come into effect on 1 July next, combined with the new regulations on equine identification, will improve the ability of the various state agencies to trace ownership of horses. The regulations place obligations on both the person transferring ownership and the person to whom ownership is transferred to maintain up to date ownership records. </p><p>  My Department will continue to work with other Departments and other relevant agencies, including animal welfare groups in an effort to ensure that the welfare of animals is protected and the new Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013. I am confident that the new Act, along with the recent legislation on the registration of equine premises, equine identification and transfer of ownership will help to reduce abandonment of horses and facilitate a more effective implementation of horse welfare legislation.</p></reply>

Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application.</p><p>  The numbers of asylum seekers residing in direct provision has reduced significantly over the last five years. At the end of December, 2013 there were 4,360 residents in direct provision compared with 6,494 at the end of December, 2009. This represents a reduction of 2,134, or 33%, in the number of residents in direct provision in that period. Compared to the numbers residing in direct provision at its highest point in April, 2005 (8,080), there has been a reduction of 46% or 3720 persons in the intervening nine years.</p><p>  The operation of the Direct Provision system is kept under review and I acknowledge that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed.  I have no desire for applicants to remain in the protection system any longer than the minimum period it takes to process their case.  The Direct Provision system is not ideal but it is a system which facilitates the State in providing a roof over the head of those seeking asylum or seeking to be allowed, on humanitarian grounds, to stay in the State.</p><p>  The Direct Provision system is inextricably linked to the surrounding international protection process.  By its very nature, the processing of applications for international protection is a solemn and complex task which does not always lend itself to achieving speedy outcomes.  The time needed to determine the outcome of any legal proceedings also impacts on the length of the process.  A substantial proportion of cases in the High Court relate to judicial review proceedings taken or decisions reached in the international protection arena.</p><p>  A key priority for this Government is legislative reform aimed at establishing a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State . Such reform would substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements by removing the current multi-layered and sequential processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more straightforward and timely fashion.  In consultation with my officials, I am reviewing the work done to date in respect of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill and will then decide on how best to progress the implementation of the Government's priorities, in particular to expedite those relating to the establishment of a single application procedure.</p></reply>

It is intended that the Bill be enacted by the end of this year and that the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority come into operation early in 2015.</p><p>  Provisions relating to multi-disciplinary partnerships have been a key structural reform objective of the Bill in its initiation and approval by the Government as a General Scheme for drafting. This has remained the case in the Bill's publication in 2011 and in its completion of Committee Stage earlier this year when key amendments were introduced including a number of further enhancements to the regulation of the Bill's new legal business models which include multi-disciplinary partnerships. These new legal business models are intended to provide more competitive business structures for the delivery of legal services to consumers and enterprise alongside those more traditional legal service models that will remain in place. The relevant provisions now stand in Part 8 of the Bill having been in Part 7 of the Bill prior to Committee Stage amendment. I expect to table a number of further amendments to this Part of the Bill along with those other amendments I will be bringing forward for Report Stage. It should be noted that the new legal business models provided for in the Bill, including multi-disciplinary partnerships, will be commenced under the terms of the Bill, only following the completion of the relevant public consultation and reporting processes that will be conducted by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</p><p>  It should be recalled that the Legal Services Regulation Bill gives continued legislative expression to the commitment in the Programme for Government to &quot;establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints&quot;.This commitment had, in turn, a long lineage going back as far as reports of the Fair Trade Commission in 1990 and of the Competition Authority in 2006, both of which had criticised the limitations on the forms of business model that can be used by Irish legal practitioners. The Bill is also an ongoing stated objective of the Action Plan for Jobs, the Medium Term Economic Strategy 2014-2020 and the National Reform Plan, respectively. Having been a key undertaking of the EU/IMF/ECB Troika Memorandum of Understanding the Bill is, in succession to the Troika programme, now the subject of a Country Specific Recommendation being negotiated under the EU Semester Process which provides that Ireland should take action during the period 2014-2015 to, &quot; Reduce the cost of legal proceedings and services and foster competition, including by adopting the Legal Services Regulation Bill by the end of 2014, including its provision allowing the establishment of multi-disciplinary practices, and by seeking to remove the solicitor's lien. Monitor its impact, including on the costs of legal services. Take executive steps to ensure that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority is operational without delay and that it meets its obligations under the legislation, including in terms of publishing regulations or guidelines for multi-disciplinary practices and the resolution of complaints.&quot;</p><p>  Detailed preparation of the Bill continues on this basis including in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of the Parliamentary Counsel. As Minister, I am engaged in an ongoing process of consultation with the professional bodies and other stake-holders. Along with officials of my Department, therefore, and as part of the ongoing preparations for Report Stage on 17 July, I am giving detailed consideration to these latest views and to those further submissions on the Bill that continue to be received. It is the intention that the Government's amendments to the Bill for Report Stage will be circulated sufficiently in advance for their consideration by stake-holders.</p></reply>

If the mother does not agree to make the statutory declaration, he may apply to court for an order under section 6A of that Act (as inserted by the Status of Children Act 1987) making him a guardian of the child. It should be noted that the vast majority of such applications are successful.</p><p>  The General Scheme of the Children and Family Relationships Bill, published on 30 January 2014 for consultation, proposes to enable a broader range of non-marital fathers to have automatic guardianship in respect of their children.   The General Scheme proposes that fathers who cohabit with the mothers of their children for a year before the birth of their child will automatically be guardians of those children.   The aim is to support those fathers who have a committed relationship with the child's mother.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, to which the General Scheme was referred for pre-legislative scrutiny, has recommended reviewing the duration of cohabitation required for automatic guardianship.  I am currently considering this recommendation.</p><p>  Questions concerning access to a child generally arise only where there is a dispute between the parents and they are not living together. The preferred option is that the parents should agree - perhaps through mediation - arrangements concerning custody of and access to the child. Where they are unable to reach agreement, the parents may apply to court for orders concerning custody and access.  Under section 3 of the 1964 Act, the court must decide the question having regard to the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. The General Scheme of the Children and Family Relationships Bill proposes that the child's best interests should be the paramount consideration in decisions concerning access.  I believe that what is proposed in the General Scheme rightly focuses on the child's needs concerning access, while aiming to promote meaningful relationships between a child and both parents, where appropriate and possible. </p></reply>

Matters relating to the provision of education services and related issues are for the Department of Education and Skills.  I can say, however, that the Australian Institute of Business (AIB) withdrew their accreditation from Eden College last year after a series of irregularities in the delivery of their programmes by the College, including very serious allegations of assisting students to cheat in the AIB exams.  Similar revelations of exam cheating by Eden College London were made by a BBC Panorama investigation in February. Furthermore, regarding examinations in Eden College, the observed level of academic progress by students on the Bachelor of Business Administration Degree (BBA) was extremely poor.  Press reports at the time of Eden's closure noted that  pass rates for the various modules ranged from 11% to 32%.  This may be accounted for by non-attendance at lectures, a practice facilitated by the alleged willingness of Eden College to supply international students with false attendance letters.  It is also the case that a substantial number of students enrolled on the course were never registered with the accrediting body for examination purposes.  It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, with some exceptions, the BBA degree programme operated at Eden College was more about providing a means of facilitating residence in Ireland than a path to academic achievement.</p><p>  The BBA accredited by the AIB is no longer offered by any teaching centre in Ireland.  Indeed as I understand the situation, the AIB have now withdrawn accreditation from all of their teaching centres in the Irish market.  However, given that the BBA is structured on a flexible modular basis and may be completed as a correspondence course from any location, students can return home and complete their degree in their country of origin.  This may be the most suitable option for those students who have not fulfilled the conditions of their immigration permission, i.e. to attend their courses, to engage in full time study and to make suitable academic progress.</p><p>  In a small minority of cases where the students have made considerable academic progress already and have shown themselves to be well motivated the possibility of alternative programmes in Ireland is being explored, subject to the time limits applicable to a student's stay in Ireland.</p></reply>

The development of the consolidated and reformed legislation, including consideration of the Convention provisions, will be progressed as soon as possible having regard to the need for consultations and other legislative priorities in the Department.</p><p>  Article 52 of the Convention addresses the availability of emergency barring orders. Such orders are available to victims of domestic violence in Ireland under the Domestic Violence Acts, 1996 and 2002.  They are known as Interim Barring Orders and are available to the categories specified in statute. Legislation leaves a small minority of cases which would need to be included in order to fully  comply with Article 52 of the convention.</p><p>  The Department is aware of potential legal issues in relation to this. These will fall to be considered in the context of the government commitment to introduce consolidated and reformed domestic violence legislation.  While some constitutional sensitivities have been flagged this would not be unusual in any significant legislative project, such as the domestic violence legislation. </p></reply>

It is of critical importance that both Ireland and the United Kingdom work closely together to enhance the protection of the CTA. In this regard, my predecessor agreed a programme of action with the then UK Minister of State for Immigration, Mr. Damien Green MP as set out in the Joint Statement on the Protection of the CTA. It was signed by both sides in Dublin on 20th December, 2011. The programme of action covers cooperation in the areas of visa arrangements, information sharing, use of e-Borders technology and operational matters. Both countries are committed to working together on visa and border matters to prevent abuse of our immigration systems and to facilitate the legitimate traveller.</p><p>  I have also met recently with the UK Home Secretary on the margins of a Justice and Home Affairs Council to discuss progress on CTA matters, including cooperation on visa matters and in that regard yesterday I announced one of the successes of our cooperation, the &lsquo;British Irish Visa Scheme&rsquo; between Ireland and the United Kingdom. This will allow tourists, business visitors etc. will be able, for the first time, to visit both Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a single visa. As matters stand, many overseas tourists and business visitors who wish to visit both Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland, need separate Irish and UK visas. From the autumn, China and India will be the first countries to benefit from this groundbreaking scheme and will be able to travel freely within the CTA using either an Irish or UK visa.</p><p>  The Scheme which was proposed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department will enable both countries&rsquo; immigration systems to work in tandem to promote and facilitate legitimate travel within the CTA, while also strengthening the external borders of the Area. Further roll-out of the scheme to other countries will be agreed between INIS and the UK Home Office through the CTAF, with the objective of worldwide roll-out being completed by the end of 2015, and it is expected to provide a major boost to tourism and international business. The scheme marks an historic development in the relationship between Ireland and the UK and in the operation of the Common Travel Area which has existed between the two countries since 1922.</p><p>  The scheme builds on the success of the Irish Short-stay Visa Waiver Programme introduced by the Government in July 2011.</p><p>  In relation to the North South Ministerial Council, immigration is not a function which has been devolved to the Northern Ireland Executive and so does not form part of the Council's framework. That said, there has been and is very regular contact at ministerial and official level with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice and his officials through which all aspects of North-South police cooperation are discussed, including those aspects relevant to immigration and the Common Travel Area.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis.  The agreement does not provide for reimbursement to, or in respect of, a particular individual. The payment made in any one year is based on an estimate of the number of persons falling within categories eligible for reimbursement and for whom each country is liable and an estimate of the average cost of providing healthcare treatment.  The amount payable is agreed following compilation of the necessary data and discussions between the two administrations.  Payments are made in advance and are subject to final settlement once all necessary statistical and financial information is complete.  Total payments in any one year can relate to both final settlements in respect of previous years' liabilities and advance payments in respect of the current year.  The net amounts received by Ireland from the United Kingdom in respect of reimbursement of healthcare costs provided under Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 for the years in question are:</p><p>  2009 - &euro;286m;    2010 - &euro;320m;    2011 - &euro;270m;    2012 - &euro;220m;    2013 - &euro;220m</p><p>  By far the largest part of the payments made on an annual basis relates to the provision of healthcare to pensioners of one country residing in the other country.  The estimated number of pensioners for whom each country is liable has been based on a sample survey undertaken by both administrations every three years.  The most recent sample survey was completed in 2008 and the United Kingdom accepted liability for 40% of its pensioner caseload residing in Ireland, equating to 43,600 persons.  Both administrations have since agreed in principle to work towards a form of pensioner registration which will form the basis for calculating pensioner reimbursement costs in the future and agreed interim arrangements for determining pensioner liability, based on previous survey results trends.</p></reply>

Under the legislation, determination of an individual&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE. The 1970 Health Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and their family, having regard to their overall financial situation and reasonable expenditure. </p><p>The legislation is clear that qualification for a medical card is means-tested. Medical cards are not awarded  - nor have they ever been - on the basis of a particular illness or disease. Medical cards are not issued 'automatically'  - or irrespective of means  - even if an applicant is suffering from a serious medical condition or a life long condition. </p><p>While there is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with specific illnesses, or with a disability, the HSE has discretion to award a medical card to avoid undue hardship, having regard to person&rsquo;s or the family&rsquo;s overall financial situation, even where the person&rsquo;s income exceeds the income guidelines.    The HSE is obliged to operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Health Act, while also responding to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card.  </p><p>However, the Government has decided to develop a new policy framework for eligibility for the award of medical cards to take account of on-going medical conditions. The HSE has established an Expert Panel to examine the range of conditions that should be considered as a basis of eligibility and has been asked to make an early report to Government.</p><p>In this context, the HSE has suspended reviews of medical cards where discretion had been exercised to take account of medical circumstances, pending the outcome of this process. This includes people who are currently in the appeals process. The HSE has extended eligibility of the individuals concerned, who are in the process of being advised in the normal way. </p><p>The Government is examining how best to address the situation of persons with serious medical conditions who had been issued with a medical card on a discretionary basis, but who have already completed the review process (and appeal process, as relevant) and who are not eligible to retain that card. The Government is examining the most effective and timely way of progressing such change. </p><p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine the specifics of this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p><p>The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended. It has established a dedicated contact service for members of the Oireachtas specifically for queries relating to medical cards and GP visit cards, which the Deputy may wish to use for an earlier response.

Patients, in conjunction with their Irish based public referring hospital consultant, have the ability to apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the state through model form E112. The treatment must not be available within the State or not available within a time normally necessary for obtaining it.  Applications to TAS are processed and a determination given in accordance with the statutory framework prior to a patient travelling to avail of treatment. A decision is made on each application in accordance with this legislation and guidelines and on the basis of a review by clinical experts. Approved applicants/patients' hospital treatment costs are covered through the issue of form E112 (IE) for the specific identified episode  of care. Once a patient is discharged from a specific episode of care abroad, their care immediately reverts to their Irish based consultant.</p><p>The TAS allows for an Irish based medical consultant to refer a patient that is normally resident in Ireland for treatment, in a public hospital, in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland, where the treatment in question meets the following criteria:</p><p><i>(a)The application to refer a patient abroad has been assessed and a determination given before that patient goes abroad.</i></p><p><i>(b)Following clinical assessment, the referring Consultant certifies the following:</i></p><p><i>- They recommend the patient be treated in another EU/EEA country or Switzerland;</i></p><p><i>- The treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs;</i></p><p><i>- The treatment is a proven form of medical treatment and is not experimental or test treatment;</i></p><p><i>- The treatment is in a recognised hospital or other institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner;</i></p><p><i>- The hospital outside the state will accept EU/EEA form E112 (IE).</i></p><p>Each application to the HSE TAS is reviewed individually on its own merits and there are no restrictions, regarding age or otherwise, on a person making an application to the HSE TAS for review and decision. Previous approvals or declines are not used as an influencing factor on subsequent applications. Each application is for an individual episode of care unless otherwise specified by the consultant on the application form. Each application to TAS is processed and given a formal written decision. If that decision is one of decline, the reason for that decision is clearly outlined and the option of an appeal is afforded. </p><p>I understand from the Deputy that this individual is in the care of the National Rehabilitation Hospital. I am advised by the HSE's Treatment Abroad Scheme Office that where it is envisaged that further care outside the State is required this would be subject to a referral, in respect of that treatment abroad, from the relevant consultant responsible for this individual's care.  I am further advised that as yet no referral for treatment abroad has been received by the Treatment Abroad Scheme Office in respect of this individual and that this position has been advised to the Deputy in replies to previous Parliamentary Questions. Until such time as a fully completed application, completed by both the individual and her Irish-based referring consultant, is received by the Treatment Abroad Scheme Office no determination on treatment abroad can be made.</p></reply>

In addition, the manufacturer did not include an economic model as part of their submission and failed to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of this therapy. Consequently, the NCPE was unable to recommend reimbursement of the product under the community drug schemes. The report is available on the NCPE's website (). </p><p>  The NCPE report is an important input to assist the HSE in its decision making process and informs further discussions between the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug. The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of high cost new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. The HSE is now carefully considering all the issues which arise in relation to the proposed benefits and costs of this medicine and expects to reach a decision in the near future. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-17a.1560.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061700085#WRY02100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 631 and 636 together.</p><p>The cost to the HSE of drugs and medicines supplied under the GMS, Drug Payment and Long Term Illness schemes amounted to 1.61 billion in 2013 and is projected to be &euro;1.56 billion in 2014.</p><p>The State has introduced a series of reforms in recent years to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure. These have resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines. Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average per items reimbursed is now running at 2001/2002 level. </p><p>A major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012. The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nine EU member states.  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs.</p><p>A new agreement was also reached in October 2012 with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry.  Under this Agreement, the maximum price the HSE paid for generic products was 50% of the initial price of an originator medicine.  Recent negotiations with the APMI have resulted in additional price reductions being agreed. From 1 May 2014, the maximum price the HSE will pay for generic products will be 40% of the initial price of an originator medicine.  This will result in the price differential between off-patent drugs and most generic equivalents increasing from 5% to approximately 20%.</p><p>It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;148 million in 2014.</p><p>The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 introduced a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. </p><p>Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. It is expected that referencing pricing will save approximately &euro;50 million in 2014.</p><p>In the case of  drugs and medicines which are paid for by the HSE, prices are set in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 or the terms of the framework agreements between the Department of Health and the HSE and the representative bodies for pharmaceutical manufacturers in Ireland. However, neither the Minister for Health nor the HSE has any power to set the prices of drugs and medicines purchased by private patients.  However, I would be disappointed if all pharmacists were not passing on the benefits of lower prices to patients. </p><p>The HSE advises the public that if they are being charged prices which exceed the reimbursement price listed on the HSE website (), plus a dispensing fee of between &euro;3.50 and &euro;5, then they should discuss the differential with their pharmacist to ensure they get the best possible price for the medicine concerned. </p><p>In addition, measures have been taken to increase price transparency among retail pharmacies. In March of this year the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland issued guidelines to pharmacists on procedures and minimum standards of information to be provided to customers, including a requirement to provide an itemised receipt of purchase of medicines. </p></reply>

It is my intention that medical card holders will continue to receive the same range of benefits under UHI as they currently receive.  In terms of future funding arrangements, services included in the standard UHI package will be purchased by the insurers.  Insurers will be funded by the premiums paid directly by individuals to their chosen insurer and by the subsidies provided by the Government on behalf of those who qualify.  Services in the overall health basket but outside of the UHI standard package will continue to be funded by a combination of Exchequer and out-of-pocket payments as at present.</p></reply>

In line with the Programme for Government, the Freedom of Information Bill, due to be enacted later this year, provides for a general right of access to records held by public bodies.  It sets out that in applying exemptions, the right of access should only be set aside where the exemptions very clearly support a refusal of access. This is intended to overcome any uncertainty inadvertently caused by the Supreme Court judgment in the Rotunda case referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>When dealing with requests for records from parents or guardians or requests relating to deceased persons, my Department and the HSE must abide by the Freedom of Information and Data Protection Acts.  S.I. 387 of 2009 deals with this issue and the Minister for Finance issued a Guidance Note (), to assist staff in the HSE and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, in this regard.</p><p>The Department of Finance Freedom of Information Central Policy Unit advised public bodies that requests for personal information under the Freedom of Information Acts should be taken as a request under the Data Protection Acts and when considering refusing access, should check that such refusal is permitted under the Data Protection Acts and vice versa.</p><p>I am referring the remainder of the Deputy's question to the HSE for direct reply. </p></reply>

This advantageous arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole. </p><p>  However, persons aged 70 or older who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds may also have their eligibility assessed under the means tested medical card scheme where they face particularly high expenses, e.g.   nursing home or medication costs. This assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses and the qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over -70s gross income thresholds.   </p><p>  Furthermore, persons aged over 70 years may still be eligible for a medical card on a discretionary basis where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.</p></reply>

The first prosthesis and two bras are provided free of charge to all such people throughout the country.  </p><p>  Variations exist across regions in regard to the longer-term provision of bras to post-mastectomy patients.  Therefore, it is not an issue of one approach applying in the Cork/Kerry region and another applying across the rest of the country.  </p><p>  As outlined previously, a national group has been established in the HSE to review practices in the area of aids and appliances.  As part of this work it will develop a national policy on the provision of prosthesis bras, as well as hairpieces, for cancer patients.  It is anticipated that the Group will complete its work in the first half of 2015.</p></reply>

Under the legislation, determination of eligibility for a medical card  - an appeals thereon - is the responsibility of the HSE and, as I have no role in this process,  it would be inappropriate for me to interfere.</p><p>  If, however, the medical card held was originally awarded after the exercise of discretion, the Deputy will be aware of the recent decision of the Cabinet committee on Health that a policy framework should be drawn up in a manner in which medical conditions could be fully taken account of in the assessment of eligibility for a medical card. The HSE has established an Expert Panel to examine the range of conditions that should be considered as a basis for eligibility.</p><p>  In the context of the work of the Expert Panel, the Director General of the HSE suspended further reviews of medical and GP visit cards where discretion had been exercised to take account of medical circumstances, pending the outcome of this process. This includes people who are currently in the review or appeals process.</p></reply>

The health capital allocation for the Health Group of Votes for 2014 is &euro;390.159 million of which the HSE's allocation is &euro;374.159 million.   This includes &euro;40 million for the Executive's information systems and related services.   The remaining &euro;334.159 million which includes &euro;8 million to be generated from the proceeds of the disposal of surplus assets is allocated to the Executive's construction and equipping projects.</p><p>Details of the construction and equipping projects currently underway are published on the HSE's website at <i></i>.

While I have approved the HSE's Capital Plan 2014-2018 - year 2014, the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is awaited.  In relation to the HSE's capital expenditure on construction related projects for the years 2008 to 2013 and to end May 2014, your question has been referred to the Executive for direct reply.</p><p>My Department's 2014 capital allocation is &euro;16 million which includes provision of circa &euro;7.522 million in respect of construction related projects.</p><p>With regard to construction related projects funded by the Office to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMYCA), the attached spreadsheet shows the capital expenditure outturn for the relevant years.  Due to the short time frame it is not possible to extract this information from archived records and definitively determine construction related projects.  The National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) was announced by the Minister for Finance in Budget 2006.  The NCIP is an Exchequer funded successor Programme to the EU co-funded Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP).  Both the EOCP and NCIP were designed to improve the availability and quality of childcare options, primarily through capital grant-aiding the construction and refurbishment of childcare facilities and through current support grants for community services.</p><p>Details of expenditure on construction related projects for agencies under the aegis of the Department including the OMYCA are shown in the following spreadsheet.<div><b>Department of Health - Vote 38</b><br /><i>Agencies under the aegis of Dept.</i><br /><i>Expenditure on construction related projects since 2008</i></div><table><tr><th><div><b>Year</b></div></th><th><div><b>&euro;m</b></div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>2.71</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>1.01</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>0.30</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>0.00</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>0.00</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013</div></td><td><div>2.53</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>to date 2014</div></td><td><div>1.23</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Although it was decided that the HSE would retain responsibility for processing the locations through the planning process, this process ran in parallel to the normal long preparatory PPP period that is common to all PPP projects.  Nevertheless this project is still on target for delivery in late 2016 / early 2017.   As at end May 2014, planning permission has been awarded at eight locations.</p><p>The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) published a Prior Indicative Notice (PIN) / Pre-Qualification Questionnaire in the OJEU on 19 December 2013.  Four submissions were received by the closing date   which was 10 March 2014.   It is expected that 10-14 sites (indicative number 12 based on affordability) will be delivered as part of a single PPP contract with the remaining centres to be delivered by the HSE using other procurement means.   Information can be located at the following web address -  <i></i>.  Health care services to be delivered at the PPP locations will include General Practitioner (GP) services and in addition a number of centres will include a wider range of community based services, for example, dental services, community mental health services, child and adolescent mental health services, early intervention teams, and doctor on call services.   </p><p>The development of primary care is central to the Government's objective to deliver a high quality, integrated and cost effective health care system.

All HSE dental clinics prioritise emergency care for children up to 16 years of age, treatment for special needs patients and screening of children aged from 11 to 13 years, including referral for orthodontic services where necessary. The HSE provides orthodontic treatment to patients based on their level of clinical need. An individual's access to orthodontic treatment is determined against a set of clinical guidelines called the Modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need, including those with defects of cleft lip and pallet, are provided with treatment. Oral and maxillofacial surgery is also provided in hospitals. Other services, including screening of children 6 to 8 years, are provided but may be deferred in clinics where there is pressure on resources.</p><p>  The Dental Treatment Services Scheme provides access to dental treatment for medical card holders over the age of 16. The service is provided by contracted dentists. The HSE prioritises for treatment patients with special needs, high risk patients and those who have greater clinical needs. A free oral examination every calendar year and free emergency dental treatment with a focus on relief of pain and sepsis are available to all eligible patients, regardless of their medical condition.  This includes 2 fillings per year, all extractions, including surgical extractions, and a number of complex treatments. </p></reply>

Under the arrangements effected by the Act, a revised, simple system of assessment for eligibility was made available to those 70 years of age and over, based on the significantly higher gross income limits rather than the standard net income thresholds. This advantageous arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole.</p><p>  In the main, persons in the over-70s age cohort do not have the same outlays and expenses as those under 70 years of age who are assessed on a means basis. Under the standard  means tested medical card scheme, allowance may be made for rent/mortgage, travel to work and child care costs.  Generally, for the over 70s, mortgages have been cleared, children have been catered for and they would not have travel to work related costs. </p><p>  However, persons aged 70 or older who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds may also have their eligibility assessed under the means tested medical card scheme where they face particularly high expenses, e.g., nursing home or medication costs. As I have outlined, this assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses and the qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over -70s gross income thresholds.  </p><p>  Furthermore, persons aged over 70 years may still be eligible for a medical card where discretion is exercised where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.</p></reply>

Under its provisions, persons residing in Ireland who are attached to the social security system of another member state, are entitled to receive health care services in Ireland at the cost of that member state provided they are not subject to Irish social security legislation. Persons in this category, which includes persons attached to the UK social security system, are entitled to full eligibility and receive a medical card as evidence of their entitlement. </p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates under the legislative framework of the Health Act of 1970, as subsequently amended. In the interest of probity, the HSE is obliged to ensure that a person&rsquo;s eligibility is correctly recorded in line with the eligibility legislation and the national guidelines. The HSE aims to ensure that every person who is entitled to a medical card or a GP visit card is given the opportunity to avail of his or her entitlement. As part of the HSE's ongoing process of periodic review to determine continuing eligibility, where a person who holds a medical card under the EU Regulations, there is only a requirement to demonstrate to the HSE that they continue to qualify under the EU Regulations. </p><p>  The information requested on the number of persons on UK pensions and payments from the UK Government here that are in receipt of medical cards is not readily available. However, Ireland operates a bilateral healthcare reimbursement agreement with the United Kingdom, in respect of health services provided under EU Regulations, covering such persons as temporary visitors between the two countries, pensioners of one country and their dependants residing in the other country, and the dependant families of persons employed in the other country.  Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis. </p><p>  By far the largest part of the payments made on an annual basis under the agreement relates to the provision of healthcare to pensioners of one country residing in the other country.  The estimated number of pensioners for whom each country is liable has been based on a sample survey undertaken by both administrations every three years.  The most recent sample survey was completed in 2008 and the United Kingdom accepted liability for 40% of its pensioner caseload residing in Ireland, equating to 43,600 persons.

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered under the LTI Scheme.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has established an expert panel to review eligibility for medical cards. There are no plans for such a review of the LTI Scheme. </p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p></reply>

The public hospital statutory in-patient charge is &euro;75 in respect of each day during which a person is maintained, up to a maximum payment of &euro;750 in any twelve consecutive months. There is also a charge of &euro;100 for attendance at Accident &amp;amp; Emergency departments unless, inter alia, the person has a referral letter from their General Practitioner.  </p><p>  Patients can also opt to go privately to their Consultant and public hospital and are therefore liable for the fees of all consultants involved in their care and the private patient charges in public hospitals.  The HSE is responsible for the administration of the primary care schemes, including the drug payment scheme, therefore, the HSE has been asked to examine the specific query raised by the Deputy concerning the drug Daxas and reply direct to  him as soon as possible. </p></reply>

The Director General of the HSE informed my Department that day that he had requested a team from the HSE&rsquo;s Internal Audit Unit to conduct a report on the matter. </p><p>  In the course of its investigations HSE Internal Audit was assured by the CEO that he had made the decision to source D&amp;amp;F Health Partnership based on their suitability for the project, and that the Chair had no role in this.  This was consistent with the documentation examined by the Internal Audit Team.  The investigation found that while Mr. Daly had disclosed to the Board that he was a former employee and former Director of D&amp;amp;F Health Partnership, he failed to disclose that he continued to hold a 50% shareholding in the company.  The investigation also established that the procurement of services was not in accordance with HSE National Financial Regulations. </p><p>  On 22 May 2014 the findings of the audit were presented to the Director General of the HSE, who informed my Department and wrote to both Mr. Daly and the CEO to make clear that any further breaches of procurement rules would be unacceptable and that Mr. Daly should have made it clear to board members that he retained a 50% shareholding in the company concerned.  The letter to the Chair of the Board also requested that the Chair take immediate steps to ensure that a register of members&rsquo; interests is established and maintained at the hospital group so that potential conflicts of interest are avoided.  </p><p>  My Department and the HSE are focused on implementing the Government&rsquo;s reform programme for acute hospitals to deliver better outcomes for patients.  The progress made to date by the West North West Hospital Group demonstrates that the establishment of acute hospitals into a small number of groups, each with its own governance and management, will provide an optimum configuration for hospital services to deliver high quality, safe patient care in a cost effective manner.</p></reply>

Tax stamps will remain a fixture on tobacco products following the introduction of standardised packaging and therefore the legislation is unlikely to have a significant impact on Revenue&rsquo;s work in relation to illicit trade in cigarettes.</p></reply>

In this context, the HSE has suspended reviews of medical cards where discretion had been exercised to take account of medical circumstances, pending the outcome of this process. This includes people who are currently in the appeals process. The HSE has extended eligibility of the individuals concerned, who are in the process of being advised in the normal way.  The Government is examining how best to address the situation of persons with serious medical conditions who had been issued with a medical card on a discretionary basis, but who have already completed the review process (and appeal process, as relevant) and who are not eligible to retain that card.

However the issue of licences based on exchange for a third country licence has delayed matters.  My Department is aware of this, and has been in communication with the embassy in Ottawa in order to explore ways of overcoming this. Negotiations are also at an advanced stage with Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador.  </p><p>  Reaching such an agreement is not only a matter of facilitating the exchange of licences by Irish residents in Canada or by Canadian residents in Ireland. Rather it also involves both sides ensuring that the people licensed to drive in the other jurisdiction are properly qualified.  As a result, when Ireland makes agreements of this kind with other jurisdictions, we require, as a standard component of the agreement, that we will not accept licences issued by the other jurisdiction if those licences were in turn derived from an exchange with a third country with which we do not have an exchange relationship.</p><p>  I am keen to see exchange agreements reached with the Canadian provinces as soon as possible. </p></reply>

There is no separate allocation for the Local Improvement Scheme.  Instead, local authorities may use up to 15% (up from 7% in 2013) of their initial Discretionary Grant towards local improvement schemes should they wish to do so.  The local contribution for these schemes at a 20% monetary contribution towards the total cost of the project is the minimum required contribution. </p><p>  Details of the 2014 regional and local roads grants were communicated to local authorities on 24 January and I note that Kerry County Council was allocated a Discretionary Grant of &euro;3,264,800. This means that the Council can allocate up to &euro;489,720 of this grant heading to the local improvement scheme if it so wishes. Furthermore, it is open to local authorities to supplement the percentage of their Discretionary Grant that they can use for the local improvement schemes with their own resources. As the Local Improvement Scheme is managed locally, it is a matter for the local authority to manage its own waiting lists and to prioritise works according to resources. </p><p>  As I outlined in my response to the Deputy in PQ  52621 of 10 December 2013, County Councillor Allowances (CCAs) would not be considered eligible as a local contribution, as this would mean that all the funds for the project were coming from either the central exchequer or local authority resources and no community contribution was being made.</p><p>  Some local authorities want the LIS. Others prefer to put the money into public roads. I think this decision is best made locally by the councillors themselves.</p></reply>

This is in line with EU requirements set out in 2006, but more stringent than the amended standards set out in Directive 36 of 2012.  However, under the Directive 36 of 2012, it is open to Member States to adopt, as a minimum, the standards set out in the amended Directive, or to apply more stringent requirements. On the basis of advice received, I have chosen to adopt a more stringent position by continuing to apply the minimum eight-ratio requirement.</p><p>  The principal reasons why I have chosen this approach are road safety related:</p><p>  - It cannot be safely assumed that a person who passed their driving test some years ago in a four forward gear economy vehicle could be expected to be proficient at controlling a multi-geared heavy goods or high capacity passenger carrying vehicle.</p><p>  - The risk to the safety of road users from drivers of HGVs or buses whose competence has not been tested in the vehicles they are driving is potentially catastrophic. </p></reply>

Resolution of the funding difficulties in the IAS scheme, where there is a deficit of over &euro;760m, is primarily a matter for the Trustees, the companies participating in the Scheme, the members and the Pensions Authority.  The deficit in the scheme has arisen over the years as the companies and the members did not put enough into the scheme to match the benefits that were expected.  </p><p>  The provisions of the Bill  in relation to the IASS do not prejudice in any way the discussions that are taking place among the parties on finding a solution to the problems in the pension scheme or the work undertaken by the Expert Panel established by the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Ibec and ICTU aimed at finding a solution to the industrial relations issues relating to the IASS.   The Panel presented its final report on 16 June.   Now that the Panel's work is complete, I would urge all parties to the Scheme to give the report very careful consideration, use its recommendations as the basis for timely constructive engagement, and to achieve a resolution in the best interests of all parties.  The recommendations in this report represent the last best chance to resolve this long-standing problem, and give people certainty about their future pension entitlements.   </p><p>  The aim of the provisions in the Bill is to ensure that any legislative blockages to solutions arrived at by the parties are removed.  Without providing for these changes in the Bill, the recommendations of the Expert Panel, or indeed any solution agreed among the parties, will be incapable of being implemented by the employers and the trustees.</p></reply>

The issue of the HGV road user levy introduced on April 1 2014 in the UK, including Northern Ireland, has been discussed at the North South Ministerial Council.  It has been acknowledged in these discussions that this issue is an excepted matter under the exclusive authority of the UK government in Westminster.   </p><p>  A cross-Departmental working group has been established, following consultation with my colleague Phil Hogan, Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, to examine the feasibility of introducing a pay-as-you-go road tax scheme for HGVs in Ireland.  The group is due to report to Government by the middle of this year with its recommendations.  One of the options under review is a common road charging regime, where a single charge is applied but payers can use roads in more than one country.  There is precedence in Europe with the Eurovignette for a common road charging regime to be established.  We may look to this example and seek to establish a common regime between the UK and Ireland.   </p><p>  While there are many issues surrounding the introduction of a common regime and it requires the support of the UK Government, I believe that such a regime may have merit given our circumstances.  Therefore, my officials have begun exploratory discussions with their UK and Northern Ireland counterparts on this potential long-term solution.  A common regime would be of benefit to HGV operators north and south of the border, rather than having two different regimes that would impose significant regulatory burdens on them.</p></reply>

The provisions of the Bill, including the provisions for non-compliance, together with an Explanatory Memorandum, is available for download from the Oireachtas website under the Oireachtas Business/Bills and Legislation section.</p><p>  The Bill provides that the National Transport Authority may prescribe the maximum charge that may be imposed in non-statutory clamping places, which includes hospitals, for the removal of a clamp and for the relocation of a vehicle.

The NEYAI  aims to improve quality and practice within early years services for children (0-6 years) and their families living in disadvantaged areas.  It does this through interagency collaboration and by developing innovative community-based models to respond to local needs.  NEYAI works across a number of thematic areas with a strong focus on S&iacute;olta - the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education (CECDC, 2006), and Aistear - the Early Childhood Curriculum Framework (NCCA, 2009).  Both of these are seen as fundamental to the growth and development of quality in the provision of early years care and education.</p><p>The rights of the child are the primary focus of NEYAI, as it aims to ensure that each child is given the opportunity to reach his or her full potential and that obstacles to the realisation of this goal can be addressed in policy and practice.  All projects are now moving into their final phase of implementation and are exploring legacy, sustainability and related dissemination activities to ensure policy engagement, in conjunction with the NEYAI Learning Community and at individual-project level.  The NEYAI Initiative is now coming to a close, but the Projects have different end dates &ndash; two concluded in April, four will conclude in July and five in August. </p><p>On the 23<sup>rd</sup>of May last, the NEYAI National Conference presented the final NEYAI National Evaluation report.  The findings from both the national evaluation report and each of the projects local evaluations will be taken into account, as part of the development of the National Early Years Quality Support Service.  This new national initiative will be a dedicated service provided on a national basis.  The objective of the National Early Years Quality Support Service is to enhance the quality of practice in early childhood care and education settings and developing their capacity to provide high quality early education and care experiences for children and their families.  This will be achieved by effective coordination of state funded support services available to this sector, one of which will be a new specialist support service.  A recruitment process for a National Manager for this service is currently underway.</p><p>The <b>Area-Based Childhood (ABC) Programme</b>is an innovative initiative announced in the Programme for Government which will run from 2013 &ndash; 2016.  It reflects the Government's commitment to adopt an area-based approach to help reduce child poverty by improving outcomes for children.  The ABC programme targets investment in evidence-informed interventions to improve the long-term outcomes for children and families living in areas of disadvantage.  It aims to break <i>&ldquo;the cycle of child poverty within areas where it is most deeply entrenched and where children are most disadvantaged, through integrated and effective services and interventions&rdquo;</i>in the areas of child development, child well-being, parenting and educational disadvantage.   </p><p>The ABC Programme is being jointly funded by my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies.  The total amount of funding available in the period 2013-2016 will be &euro;29.7m.  50 applications, from among the most disadvantaged areas of the State, were received from consortia wishing to participate in the ABC Programme.  On 27 November last my Department announced that 13 areas had been approved for entry into the new ABC Programme.  These included the three existing projects which participated in the forerunner Prevention and Early Intervention  programme (PEIP) in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale which had already been approved for entry into the new ABC Programme. </p><p>Pobal and the Centre for Effective Services are managing the programme on behalf of my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies.  Four sites have recently been 'fast tracked' and are ready to proceed to contract stage.  The remaining sites have been asked to submit further proposals by the end of June.  The overall aim is to have all of the new sites contracted by end 2014.</p></reply>

In 2014, current funding of some &euro;49.780m is available to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  This includes provision of &euro;9.948m under the Youth Service Grant Scheme for some 30 national and major regional organisations, including For&oacute;ige and Youth Work Ireland, to support the development of their services for young people.  In 2014, funding of &euro;86,779 has been provided under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme to two projects in county Longford - County Longford Youth Service, which is part of Longford Community Resources Ltd (&euro;74,651),<font color="#FF0000"> </font>and Longford Youth Service (&euro;12,128).  In addition, &euro;9,733 has been allocated to the Education and Training Board under the 2014 Local Youth Club Grant Scheme to support youth work activities at a local level.  </p><p>In 2013, a capital allocation of &euro;1.55m was made available by my Department for the provision of new youth cafes.  Pobal assisted my Department with the application process.  Some 95 applications for support under this scheme were received by Pobal.  Following the completion of the evaluation process some 30 proposals for new youth cafes projects around the country were approved for funding.  An application for funding was received in respect of the youth project in question, however, the application was deemed ineligible on the grounds that the project was not establishing a 'new' youth caf&eacute;.  The application and the outcome of the process were discussed at a meeting with representatives of the youth project in January of this year and the position was confirmed to the group.</p><p>In 2014, an allocation of &euro;.5m in capital funding has been provided to my Department for small capital projects in the youth services.  Details of the scheme will be announced in the coming months.  However, there is no capital funding scheme available to my Department at this time for large scale projects such as that envisaged by the youth project in question.  Given the challenging budgetary position that my Department, along with all Government departments, is managing at this time, it is not anticipated, that this situation will change in the immediate future.  </p><p>I met with the proposers of the youth project on a recent visit to Longford.  I was impressed with their commitment and the quality of their work to support youth people in Longford town and county.  Youth cafes offer young people a safe, alcohol and drug free space for recreation, non-formal learning and youth focused activities.

Approximately 68,000 children are availing of the provision in the current academic year.  The free pre-school provision represents an annual investment of approximately &euro;175 million and this funding has been maintained despite the challenging budgetary situation.</p><p>The introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current one-year provision.  This additional funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the pre-school provision is key to good outcomes for children.  The Pre-School Quality Agenda that is being progressed by my Department, and which involves a range of actions in key areas aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime, is a key building block for any further extension of universal childcare provision.</p><p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures,</i>the national policy framework for children and young people 2014-2020, recognises the value of early childhood care and education in supporting children's early cognitive, social and emotional development, and the Government is committed to the introduction of a second free pre-school year within the lifetime of the framework once the required quality standards are achieved and subject to the availability of resources.  My Department and I will be keeping this commitment under review in the context of the progress of the Pre-School Quality Agenda.</p></reply>

In 2013 the Centre received funding of &euro;19,000 from HSE Children and Family Services.  The work of the Centre is primarily with children who have a speech and language delay/disorder who are referred from Early Intervention Teams in the HSE.  The Centre was advised of the reduction in 2014 funding in March this year.  </p><p>The Child and Family Agency has advised that the reasons for the reduction in funding are as follows:<blockquote>- Cost containment as per the national cost containment requirements which has been applied across the sector;<br /><br />- In working towards the national strategic direction of the new Child and Family Agency, there is a requirement to commission services in line with the Meitheal model and to prioritise the development of Child and Family Support networks, targeting children and families who meet the threshold for the services of the Agency, i.e. child protection and welfare;<br /><br />- The work of Ballinasloe Therapeutic Learning Centre is primarily with children who have speech and language delays/disorders and responsibility for the provision of such services lies with the HSE.</blockquote>The Centre has informed the Child and Family Agency that from September onwards, they will continue to see individual children and families for 8 hours per week who are in child protection and welfare services in the local area.  However, they will have to cease offering the 8 hours per week group speech and language therapy supports.  The Agency has advised that the Centre has applied for a National Lottery grant of &euro;2,460 to cover summer programmes in July 2014.  It has been agreed that the Agency will fund the summer programme should the National Lottery grant application be unsuccessful.  The Family Support Services Manager in the Child and Family Agency will meet with Ballinasloe Therapeutic Learning Centre during the summer to assist in programme planning and the provision of supports on the future direction of the organisation in line with Child and Family Support Network and existing services in the area.   </p><p>It should be noted that Ballinasloe Family Services, which is separately funded and operated by the Agency, has recently had an increase of one full time staff as a result of redeployment, thereby increasing the capacity to deliver child welfare and family support services in the area.</p></reply>

However, it is a matter for each sovereign State to decide the manner in which they choose to implement the Hague Convention, including any restrictions in relation to age, having regard to the principles of the Convention.  The decision to deem a person suitable and eligible to adopt is a matter for the Adoption Authority of Ireland and is taken under criteria outlined in Section 34 of the Adoption Act, 2010.  These criteria include that an applicant or applicants be of good health and of an age so that he or she has a reasonable expectation of being capable throughout the child's childhood of providing the necessary health, social, educational and other interventions for the child, and having financial means to support the child.</p><p>  The expiration of declarations is covered under Section 41(1) of the Adoption Act, 2010.  The section provides that a declaration of eligibility and suitability expires after 24 months from the date of issuance of the declaration or after a further period of not more than 12 months that the Adoption Authority may specify.  I understand that at the time of drafting of the legislation it was felt that this provided an adequate period following the initial assessment of applicants to complete an adoption.  Given the changing landscape of intercountry adoption, this may no longer be the case.  I am currently examining a number of proposals in relation to amendments to the Adoption Act, 2010.   However, any change to the length of validity of a declaration must be weighed up against the necessity to ensure that an applicant's current situation in relation to their suitability to adopt is taken in to account in the adoption process.</p></reply>
