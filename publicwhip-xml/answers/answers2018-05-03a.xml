Central to this approach is the concept of &lsquo;claim and commitment&rsquo;.  Jobseekers have a right to claim an income support from the State but also have a responsibility to commit to engaging with the employment services offered by the State whether those services are provided directly by the Department&rsquo;s own staff or by staff contracted through the Local Employment Services or JobPath and working as agents of the Department.</p><p>The concept of rights and responsibilities is reflected in legislation.  The Social Welfare (Consolidated) Act 2005, as amended, specifies that participation in activation meetings is mandatory, therefore jobseekers in receipt of a jobseekers payment are required to engage with the Department&rsquo;s activation services whether, as I have indicated, the service is provided internally by an Intreo case officer or, externally by any of the contracted providers.Therefore once a jobseeker is referred to JobPath, they must engage with the service.  All jobseekers who have been unemployed for more than a year are eligible for selection for the JobPath service and clients are chosen by means of a random selection process. </p><p>This is in the best interests of the jobseekers themselves as evidence internationally is that job search assistance and employment counselling is the most effective form of support in terms of improving employment outcomes.  Data published by the Department indicates that employment outcomes among those who engage with the JobPath service are higher than those who have not been referred to the service.  In addition independent research among JobPath participants indicates a high level of satisfaction with the service.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced that clients of my Department who are engaged with the JobPath will from 1 June have the option of applying for CE and T&uacute;s placement while continuing to engage with JobPath<b>.  </b>This will ensure that jobseekers can benefit from the job-seeking support of JobPath while also availing of a part-time work placement via T&uacute;s or CE<b>.  </b>This should address some of the concerns raised with me and also further improve employment outcomes.</p><p>I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Department has also engaged with the Revenue Commissioners and this engagement is continuing.  More generally under the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984, a company is regarded as being insolvent if: the company is placed into receivership; a winding-up order has been made; or a resolution for the voluntary liquidation of the company has been passed.</p>  <p>  The Act does not cover what is known as &lsquo;informal&rsquo; insolvency where employers cease trading without engaging, as required by law, in any formal wind-up process or where creditors, including employees, do not seek or pursue a liquidation and distribution of assets through the Courts.  This is the situation which applies to the company referred to by the Deputy.  </p>  <p>  The Department is continuing to review the situation of informal insolvency.  There are many difficult and complex company and employment law matters to be considered.  The Department is considering legal advice on the matter and the possible impacts that any potential policy developments could have on existing legislation.  In addressing this we must find a sensible and proportionate approach that does not inadvertently diminish employee rights or impose an unnecessary cost to the exchequer by facilitating a process whereby employers can avoid their obligations to staff.</p>  <p>  The Department is consulting with a range of concerned bodies, including the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Revenue Commissioners on these issues. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department continues to engage with the two reviews of employment and company law which were initiated by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation on foot of the Clery&rsquo;s closure.  </p>  <p>  There are also a number of legal cases under consideration by the Courts at the moment, the outcome of which will have a bearing on this matter. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-03a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018050300046#WRB01000"><p>At the outset, I would like to express my admiration for the work of the St Vincent de Paul in assisting vulnerable people in our society.  My department works very closely with Vincent de Paul in addressing many issues in relation to vulnerable people, including food poverty.  The Department administers the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD), which provides food and basic consumer products to people most at risk.  My Department&rsquo;s FEAD budget for 2018 is &euro;8m, of which &euro;4.5m will be allocated to ongoing food distribution with the remainder allocation to the distribution of material assistance in the areas of homelessness, school kits and new migrants.   In 2017, though a network of charitable partnership organisations, the Department distributed almost 1,000 tonnes of food to over 80,000 people in communities throughout the country, either in the form of food parcels or as meals prepared by charitable organisation.  In 2017, FEAD assisted 26 St Vincent de Paul conferences or regions through the provision of food from the three FoodCloud Hubs depots in Tallaght, Cork and Galway.  The total value of food collected and distributed by these organisations was in excess of &euro;650k consisting of 205 tonnes across 23 food product ranges available through the FEAD Programme.</p>  <p>  In addition, the School Meals programme provides funding for a breakfast for all children and lunch for up to 90% of children in DEIS schools for the entire school year from September to June.  For the first time in many years, breakfasts are also now available to some schools outside DEIS.  Funding towards school meals is being provided in over 1,580 schools and other organisations, supporting over 248,000 children at a cost of some &euro;54 million in 2018.</p>  <p>  The primary role of the social welfare income supports provided through my Department is to sustain an adequate standard of living and to prevent poverty, including food poverty.  The Irish social welfare system is, generally, relatively successful in this role.  In 2016, the most recent year for which the relevant data are available, social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 33.6 per cent to 16.5 per cent, representing a poverty reduction effect of 51 per cent.  Ireland was the best performing EU member state in this regard, and this reflects the Government commitment to protect core weekly welfare rates during the recession.</p>  <p>  The CSO publishes two items from the Survey of Income and Living Conditions relating specifically to the consumption of food. </p>  <p>  First, in 2016, 2.3% of the population were &ldquo;unable to afford a meal with meat, chicken or fish every second day&rdquo;.  This was down from 4.2% in 2013, when the effects of the recession were most felt.  </p>  <p>  The figure of 2.3% for 2016 was the third lowest among the EU Member States in that year, and compares with an average of 8.6% for the EU overall. </p>  <p>  Second, 5.6% of the population were &ldquo;unable to afford a roast once a week&rdquo;.  This is a decrease from the 2013 figure of 8.1%.  No EU data are published for this indicator.</p>  <p>  Difficulty in meeting food and other regular ongoing needs may result from a family encountering exceptional once-off expenditures.  In this regard, under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. </p>  <p>  The Government has provided over &euro;36 million for exceptional payments in 2018.   Any persons who consider that they have an entitlement to an exceptional needs payment should contact my Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for addressing poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2017.  </p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, is currently developing a successor plan for the period 2018-2021.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-03a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018050300046#WRB01300"><p>The Government recognises the need for the social protection system to provide flexible and effective supports for persons who encounter mental health difficulties.  Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is a model of supported employment that facilitates people with mental health difficulties to move into mainstream, open labour market employment.  Under the IPS model, a person is viewed as capable of undertaking competitive paid employment, if a suitable work setting can be found and appropriate supports provided.   This approach provides a useful addition to the range of employment supports for persons with disabilities provided by my Department.   The Department has recently participated as a partner organisation in the Integrating Employment and Mental Health Service (IEMHS) IPS pilot project, led by the HSE which ran between 2015 and 2017.  </p>  <p>  The aim of this project was to demonstrate how the existing HSE and Employability service could practice the IPS model for clients with severe and enduring mental health issues.  </p>  <p>An evaluation report, Steps into Work, was published on the 8th   February last and found that through improved cooperation between mental health services and employment support services, improvements could be achieved in the health and employment outcomes of people with mental health difficulties. </p>  <p>  My Department is now collaborating with the HSE and the EmployAbility service to extend this pilot programme on a nationwide basis in partnership to enable employment specialists to be put in place across the country. </p>  <p>  I look forward to seeing the results of this interagency collaboration specifically in terms of better health and employment outcomes for persons with mental health difficulties.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-03a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018050300046#WRB01600"><p>Unemployment blackspots are small areas identified in the Census of Population in 2016 as having particularly high levels of joblessness.  In general, they are small residential areas within larger urban areas, with a significant number within the city of Limerick. The approach adopted by my Department is that the services delivered by Intreo are focused on unemployed individuals rather than on areas.  This means, therefore, that those areas where unemployed individuals are most concentrated will also be the areas that receive a greater share of income support payments and activation and employment services.  The focus of those services is to support unemployed people living in, for example, the relevant parts of Limerick to access and prepare for jobs in the wider labour market of the greater Limerick area.  This involves substantial co-operation between my Department and other public authorities, particularly those engaged in education and training under the Department of Education and Skills.   These areas in Limerick will also have benefitted from the general improvement in employment conditions in the Mid-West region where unemployment, as shown in the Labour Force Survey, has fallen from a peak of 16.6% in late 2012 to 6.6% by the end of 2017.  Numbers in employment in the region have increased from 153,700 to 178,500 over the same period.</p>  <p>  While data from the Labour Force Survey is not available at the county level, trends in the Live Register can give an indication of underlying trends in local unemployment.  Overall, the Live Register in Limerick has fallen by almost 54% in the 5 years to February 2018, well above the reduction of 44% nationally.  In the year to February 2018, the Live Register in Limerick has fallen by 1,674 people, or 16%, again surpassing the national trend of 13%.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment since 2012 is twofold:</p>  <p>  Firstly the Action Plan for Jobs, which is led by my colleague the Minister for Business Enterprise and Innovation,  sets out to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs.  This policy now includes a specific regional Action Plan for the Mid-West Region that has seen over 16,500 jobs created in the region in the last two years.  Successful implementation of this Plan is targeted at the creation of 23,000 extra jobs in the region by 2020.  The Plan aims to achieve this through building on key sectors of potential for the region like Aviation, Lifesciences, Engineering, Internationally Traded Services and Tourism.</p>  <p>  Secondly, through Pathways to Work, my Department ensures that as many new jobs and vacancies as possible are filled by people taken from the Live Register.  Under this policy, as I have said, employment services and activation supports are heavily concentrated on the areas of highest unemployment, including those in Limerick.</p>  <p>  To date, the policies being pursued under the Action Plan for Jobs and under Pathways to Work have been effective in reducing unemployment, both nationally and in Limerick and I am confident that they will continue to do so.</p></reply>

Services are provided through this Branch Office network in areas which are not directly served by a Department operated Intreo Centre.  Each Branch Office is privately operated and managed by a Branch Manager under a contract for service with the Department. My Department is anxious to ensure that the services provided by the Department&rsquo;s Intreo Centres and Branch Offices are aligned so that all customers nationwide are provided with broadly similar services.   On foot of this, my officials engaged in discussions with the Branch Managers Association (BMA), a representative group of Branch Managers who presented the views of its members, under the chairmanship of an agreed facilitator regarding the Department&rsquo;s proposals for a new service delivery model.  </p>  <p>  Talks between the Department and the BMA concluded on 29th March.  Non-binding recommendations were issued by the facilitator to both parties on 4th April and both sides have agreed to accept these recommendations. </p>  <p>  These recommendations, together with previous recommendations from the facilitator in December 2017 on the revised remuneration model, provide a framework within which services will be delivered on behalf of the Department by Branch Managers.</p>  <p>  Letters to each individual Branch Manager detailing the service delivery changes required by the Department and the revised remuneration model issued on 26 April 2018.  Once a Branch Manager accepts these proposals in writing, the new remuneration proposal, back dated to 1 January 2018, will be put in place for that individual Branch Manager.</p></reply>

These are referred to as qualified child increases (IQCs).  IQC payments do not of themselves constitute a specific social welfare scheme and entitlement to the appropriate primary adult payment must be established in the first instance.  These payments provide targeted assistance that is directly linked with household income and thereby support low-income families.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2018, the rate of qualified child increase was increased by &euro;2 from &euro;29.80 to &euro;31.80 per week, an increase of 6.7% and the first such increase since 2010.  The increase came into effect at the end of March 2018 at a cost of &euro;28.5m in 2018 and &euro;37m in a full year.   The qualified child increase is one of a number of social welfare scheme provisions available to families on low incomes, including the Working Family Payment (formerly Family Income Supplement), the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance and the Back to Work Family Dividend.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the research by the organisation mentioned and the findings relating to additional costs associated with adolescents.  Research also shows that parents of younger children incur higher childcare costs than those with children aged 12 years and over.  A targeted increase to children aged 12 years and over, while welcome to families with children in this category, would not be of any benefit to parents with younger children.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, from an operational perspective significant administrative resources would be required as in effect a two-tier system is being introduced, which is not possible to cost or estimate accurately at present.  Such a proposal would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

Currently there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions and no further liability on the employer where contributions cease.</p><p>However, over the last number of years the Government has amended pension legislation to protect the pension sector and to ensure fairer and more equitable outcomes for all scheme members.The wind up priority order was amended by the Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act in 2013.  The changes to the wind up priority order essentially de-prioritises a portion of pensioner benefits in the manner in which the resources of a scheme are distributed on the wind up of a pension scheme.  These changes make more resources of the scheme available in the initial distribution of assets to active and deferred scheme members.</p><p>The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012 required a DB scheme to hold additional funding in the form of a &lsquo;risk reserve&rsquo; by 2023.  This function of this &lsquo;risk reserve&rsquo; is to provide some protection and long term stability for scheme members against future volatility in financial markets.</p><p>The introduction of the Pensions Insolvency Payments Scheme reduced the cost of purchasing pensions for trustees where the employer has become insolvent, offering special payments in cases where a DB scheme is winding up.</p><p>The General Scheme of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017 (now the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017), was published in May 2017 and contained a number of key measures relating to DB pension schemes.</p><p>The amendments will provide for a 12 month notification period where an employer is seeking to cease making contributions to a scheme.  The provisions will also provide that, where a scheme is in deficit and a funding proposal is not been put in place in a timely manner, the Pensions<b></b>Authority may direct steps to be taken to ensure that the scheme meets the funding standard.</p><p>These provisions are quite technical and complex.  Work to finalise them is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in position to bring forward the amendments at Committee Stage at the end of May or early June.  With the cooperation of the Oireachtas the Government intends to pass this legislation before the summer recess.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The most recent data shows that, nationally, unemployment has fallen from a peak of 15% in 2012 to 6.1% by March 2018.  Within the South East region, which includes Wexford, unemployment has fallen from a peak of 19.0% in 2012 to 7.3% by Quarter 4, 2017 with numbers in employment increasing from 184,700 in Q4 2012 to 226,400 by Q4 2017.While data from the Labour Force Survey is not available at the county level, trends in the Live Register can give an indication of underlying trends in local unemployment.    Overall, the Live Register in Wexford has fallen by almost 43% in the 5 years to February 2018, close to the reduction of 44% nationally.  In the year to February 2018, the Live Register in Wexford has fallen by 1,625 people, or almost 14%, again closely in line with national trends.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment since 2012 is twofold:</p>  <p>  Firstly, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs.  This policy now includes a specific regional Action Plan for the South East Region that has seen over 8,000 jobs created in the region in the last two years.  By 2020, the Plan aims to facilitate the creation of an additional 25,000 jobs in the region and bring the unemployment rate in the region to within 1% of the national average.</p>  <p>  Secondly, through Pathways to Work, my Department ensures that as many new jobs and vacancies as possible are filled by people taken from the Live Register.  Under this policy, employment services and activation supports are heavily concentrated on the areas of highest unemployment, including those in Wexford.</p>  <p>  Currently, there are 11 Activation Case Officers in the Intreo service in Wexford.  This is an increase of one in comparison to January 2017, when there were 10. Prior to the roll-out of Intreo, there were 8 Activation Case Officers in Wexford, including former FAS personnel and DSP Jobs Facilitators. </p>  <p>  The Case Officer capacity is supplemented by referrals to Turas Nua under the Job Path programme and to Wexford Local Development which operates the Local Employment Service (LES) on behalf of the Department.  Wexford Local Development is contracted to provide intensive supports to 960 customers and employs 8 mediators to support LES operations. </p>  <p>  A total of 9,114 customer engagements were scheduled by Activation Case Officers in 2017 in addition to their work with employers.  Local records indicate that approximately 5,300 referrals to Turas Nua took place over the course of the year.</p>  <p>  To date, the policies being pursued under the Action Plan for Jobs and under Pathways to Work have been effective in reducing unemployment, both nationally and in Wexford and I am confident that they will continue to do so.</p></reply>

Crucially, unlike the proposed Homemaking Credits which was proposed in 2010 as part of the National Pensions Framework, the HomeCaring Credit will apply to periods both before and after 1994, as for most people reaching pension age between 2012 and 2019, such periods, where they had them, occurred before 1994, and provisions restricted to periods after then are of little or no benefit to them.</p>  <p>  This approach will make it easier for many post-2012 pensioners affected by the 2012 rate band changes who are currently assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  A person who reached pension age after 1st September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Up to 10 years of other credits, for example, awarded when on Jobseekers or Illness Benefit, may also be used, subject to the total credits not exceeding 20 years.</p>  <p>  Legislation has to be drafted and enacted to enable implementation of these arrangements and IT solutions in line with this legislation must be developed.  Accordingly, it is planned that the reviews will commence before the end of this year, with the first payments being made in the first quarter of 2019.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The main social welfare schemes available from my Department for unemployed persons are the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and benefit schemes which provide income support for people who have lost work and are unable to find alternative full-time employment.  Both schemes provide significant support to individuals so that they can work up to 3 days a week and still retain access to a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.</p>  <p>  The current days-based system can provide additional income supports to jobseekers including actors who are casually employed or working part-time.  For instance an individual can earn a little over &euro;20,190 per year and still retain a small jobseeker's allowance payment, while the equivalent threshold for an individual with a qualified adult is almost &euro;34,700 if they are both working.   My Department also operates a fast-tracking process for customers who sign-off on their jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claim to take up work for a period of up to 12 weeks.  In these cases, the claim is not closed.  </p>  <p>  Rather, payment is suspended temporarily for the duration of the work or training course.

The social welfare payments that allow persons aged under 66 to a free travel pass include disability allowance, invalidity pension, carer&rsquo;s allowance and partial capacity benefit.  While medical evidence will be required to determine eligibility for these schemes, it does not, of itself, entitle a person to free travel.

Legislation provides that sanctions / penalties in the form of reduced payments may be imposed by the Department&rsquo;s Deciding Officers where recipients of jobseeker payments fail, without good cause, to comply with activation measures. Activation measures include the requirement to attend group information meetings, and / or individual meetings for the purpose of assessing a person&rsquo;s education, training or development needs, and / or availing of suitable education, training or development opportunities, or specified employment programmes, which are considered appropriate to a person&rsquo;s circumstances.  Reduced rates are only applied where a jobseeker fails, without good cause, to engage as requested with the Department&rsquo;s employment services including contracted services, having received at least two warnings.   The Jobseeker can appeal the Deciding Officer&rsquo;s decision for reduced rate penalties and for a 9 week disqualification, through the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).  </p>  <p>  According to the latest available data the number of jobseekers referred to the Jobpath service in Galway city and county who had a penalty rate applied between November 2015 and 8 April 2018 was 490.

Long term unemployed jobseekers who are not engaged with any other activation scheme or service are referred by my Department to the JobPath service to receive intensive individual support, including relevant training and educational programmes which will assist them in finding full-time sustainable employment. The Deputy will appreciate that the welcome reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes.  Long-term unemployment is expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecasted fall in overall unemployment.     In the context of the economic recovery, my Department undertook a review of the work programmes in 2016.  While the primary focus was on CE, the review also looked at other employment programmes such as T&uacute;s.  </p>  <p>  Arising from the review, the Government agreed to implement changes to the qualifying conditions for CE in order to broaden access to a wider range of people.  These new rules were implemented from July 2017.  The qualifying age was reduced to 21 years.  In addition while, in general, all placements will now be for one year only, if a CE participant is undertaking training to achieve a major  award, their time can be extended by up to 2 year to allow them to complete the training which will enhance their overall employment prospects.  This allows for 3 years continuous participation on CE.  Those over 55 years of age can also remain on CE for three years.  In addition, the reference year for CE participation was moved from 2000 to 2007 which ensures that more people can re-qualify for the programme.  Overall, these changes improve the way the schemes operate and will allow more people who are long-term unemployed to access them.  I continue to keep this whole area under review so that these schemes provide real and valuable support to both individuals and communities.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I recently announced that from June 2018, customers currently engaged with the JobPath service and those who may be referred in future will have the option of applying for CE and T&uacute;s placement while continuing to engage with JobPath.  </p>  <p>  This has a number of benefits both for the vital services provided at a local level by participants on CE and T&uacute;s programmes and directly for my Department&rsquo;s customers.  It maximises the assistance and services for people who are long-term unemployed through a combination of a quality work placement and personalised job seeking support provided through the JobPath service.  I want to make sure that their valuable contribution to their local communities will continue, and that they continue to benefit from the personalised, case-managed activation support of the JobPath service.</p>  <p>  The Government is very mindful of the large number of work programme places involved in service delivery and other valuable services around the country.  While it is difficult to predict the number of persons who will avail of this option to participate on CE and T&uacute;s, while at the same time maintaining their engagement with JobPath, I anticipate that it will assist in the filling of vacancies on both programmes.  There is no additional cost implication with the introduction of this measure.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.  In particular it will benefit people whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a full-time caring role.  Crucially, unlike the proposed Homemaking Credits which was proposed in 2010 as part of the National Pensions Framework, the HomeCaring Credit will apply to periods both before and after 1994, as for most people reaching pension age between 2012 and 2019, such periods, where they had them, occurred before 1994, and provisions restricted to periods after then are of little or no benefit to them.</p>  <p>  This approach will make it easier for many post-2012 pensioners affected by the 2012 rate band changes who are currently assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  A person who reached pension age after 1st September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Up to 10 years of other credits, for example, awarded when on Jobseekers or Illness Benefit, may also be used, subject to the total credits not exceeding 20 years.</p>  <p>  Legislation has to be drafted and enacted to enable implementation of these arrangements and IT solutions in line with this legislation must be developed.  Accordingly, it is planned that the reviews will commence before the end of this year, with the first payments being made in the first quarter of 2019.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These were further extended in subsequent budgets and now apply to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients under 26 years of age. This is a targeted, non-discriminatory, measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency by incentivising them to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;198.    To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage in inter-agency responses to homelessness through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit in Dublin and engagement with Tusla, the HSE and non-Government organisations in providing the necessary support to all vulnerable people including young people who are experiencing homelessness or are in insecure situations.

As part of this strategy, the Department is engaged in the delivery of integrated Intreo centres, which provide a full range of services, including the Community Welfare Service (CWS), generally available in one location. Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, my Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  The Government has provided over &euro;36 million for exceptional payments in 2018.   The ENP scheme is demand led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.

The main purpose of these Agreements is to protect the pension rights of people who have worked and paid social security contributions in Ireland and the countries with which Ireland has such agreements. This is achieved by allowing reckonable social security contributions paid in one or more of these countries to be aggregated with Irish full-rate social insurance contributions for the purposes of qualifying for certain contributory payments in Ireland or in these countries.

The Public Services Card (PSC) does not store biometrics.  While the card does store the person&rsquo;s photograph and it appears on the card, it does not store the biometric or arithmetic template of that photograph. Nor is the biometric or arithmetic template of the photo stored in the PSI dataset or shared with other public bodies. My Department uses facial image matching software to strengthen the SAFE<b></b>registration process. To date, just under 3.26 million PSCs have been produced. The normal digital photograph in JPEG format is captured during the SAFE<b></b>registration process and is inputted into and stored in this facial image matching software. It is then modelled and searched against the Department&rsquo;s photo database to ensure that the person in the photograph has not already been registered using a different Personal Public Service Number or a different identity dataset. </p><p>The software compares photographs by converting the image into an arithmetic template based on the individual&rsquo;s facial characteristics and checking it against the other image templates already held in that software&rsquo;s database from other SAFE<b></b>registrations. It is a similar approach to that taken by the Passport Office in its systems when processing passport applications/renewals.  </p><p>The arithmetic models behind the photographs are never stored on the PSC or in the Public Service Identity dataset. They are stored only in the facial image matching software&rsquo;s database held in the Department&rsquo;s own secure datacentres. </p><p>The Department does not ask for or collect biometric data from our customers e.g. fingerprints or retinal scans. Neither does it use advanced facial mapping cameras when taking the photo as part of the SAFE registration process.  The process involves the digital photos collected being passed through a piece of facial matching software to detect and prevent error or suspected fraudulent activity. </p><p>It is also important to note that the application of this technology has detected a number of cases of serious identity fraud, some of which have been successfully prosecuted through the courts on indictment, with significant custodial sentences being imposed. .</p><p>I should also emphasise that my Department takes its responsibilities in relation to data protection and protecting the data of its clients very seriously.  The Department has data protection and information security policies, standards, procedures and guidelines in place governing the use of its computer systems and customer data.  </p><p>Access to the Department&rsquo;s applications and associated information is restricted to authorised individuals and for the purpose intended. Access is based on the principles of &lsquo;need-to-know&rsquo; and &lsquo;need-to-use&rsquo;.  Access to the facial matching system is managed by a designated system administrator(s) who creates and manages system access accounts for authorised users.  These access rights are allocated based on the specific requirements of a user&rsquo;s role whereby an individual staff member is permitted the minimum access rights required to complete their  assigned tasks.  There is full and comprehensive logging of all actions and events that occur in the system.The Department has a dedicated security function in place and works closely with Government Networks and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to ensure that networks and systems are protected from unauthorised access, malware and viruses.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It replaced the former smallholders&rsquo; unemployment assistance payment.  In line with the then existing arrangements for unemployment assistance (including smallholders) and pre-retirement allowance, the income of farm assist recipients was exempt from class S PRSI for self-employed workers.</p>  <p>  Recipients of farm assist who had previously paid Class S social insurance had the option of paying voluntary contributions to maintain their social insurance record, provided they satisfied the qualifying conditions.  Since 1st January 2007, the exemption from class S PRSI has been removed and those receiving jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and farm assist are subject to Class S PRSI as self-employed contributors on their self-employed income, provided their annual income is &euro;5,000 or more.   There are currently no plans to amend legislation regarding the State pension (contributory), to award a maximum rate payment to pensioners who had such a period during 1999-2006 when they were exempt from paying PRSI contributions.</p>  <p>  However, a person aged over 66 with limited PRSI contributions over the course of their life may claim a State pension (non-contributory) if they have an income need, and this entitlement is not based on payment of social insurance contributions.  The maximum weekly rate is &euro;232, i.e. over 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.  While it is means-tested, there are very significant disregards which are to the benefit of claimants, and a significant majority of such pensioners are paid at the full rate.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It sets out under Strand 4, &lsquo;Measures to Support the Operation of Defined Benefit Schemes&rsquo;, that the Government is committed to advancing the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.The General Scheme of the Bill was published in May 2017 and contained a number of key measures relating to Defined Benefit (DB) pension schemes.  The measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes.The intent of these amendments is to find a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes at short notice without fulfilling their obligations and measures which would put a full and immediate debt on employer for schemes they sponsor. </p><p>The amendments will provide for a 12 month notification period where an employer is seeking to cease making contributions to a scheme and this will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting.  The provisions will also provide that, where a scheme is in deficit and a funding proposal has not been put in place in a timely manner, the Pensions<b></b>Authority may direct steps to be taken to ensure that the scheme meets the funding standard.</p><p>These provisions are quite technical and complex.  Work to finalise them is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in position to bring forward the amendments at Committee Stage at the end of May or early June.

The most recent figures for March 2018 are 28.4 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.4 weeks for a summary decision.</p>  <p>  The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeal officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the higher courts and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  </p>  <p>  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p>  <p>  In addition, a number of new appeals officers have joined the appeals office over the past year, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.  This changeover in staff has led to a slightly longer time to conclude appeals in 2017 and so far in 2018.  However, the Chief Appeals Officer has advised that she is hopeful that processing times will improve over the course of 2018.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that an appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal and that any favourable decisions are backdated to the original date of the claim.</p></reply>

This requirement also applies to the small number of adult passport applicants, whose passport was issued before 1 January 2005 and has been reported as lost, stolen or damaged and those whose passport expired more than five years ago.  If an applicant falls in to one of the above mentioned categories of applicant, their application must include a copy of their PSC. I am informed by the Passport Service that the most recent passport issued to the individual referred to expired more than five years ago and hence a copy of the individual&rsquo;s PSC is required to be submitted with their renewal application.   A key principle behind the concept of the PSC is that the delivery of services is more efficient when a person&rsquo;s identity does not have to be authenticated at every transaction. With specific reference to the issuance of passports, the introduction of the PSC requirement has allowed the Passport Service to dispense with requirements for certain additional documentation and reduces the overall volume of documentation that Irish citizens must submit when applying for a passport.  The PSC requirement is now a key resource in the Passport Service&rsquo;s efforts to combat fraud and identity theft and uphold the integrity of the Irish passport.</p>  <p>  With reference to the legal basis for the Minister to request a copy of an applicant&rsquo;s PSC, Section 7(1)(b) of the Passports Act 2008 (as amended) requires that the Minister be satisfied as to an individual&rsquo;s identity before issuing an Irish passport to that person.  Sections 7(2) and 7(3) allow the Minister to seek such documentary evidence and information as may be needed to establish and verify an applicant&rsquo;s identity.</p></reply>

The ruling is being fully considered by the Government.   It is important to note that, although the Court dismissed the Government&rsquo;s application for a revision, nothing in the ruling alters the Court&rsquo;s original 1978 judgment that the men suffered inhuman and degrading treatment, in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>  <p>  The question of seeking a referral of the ruling to the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights is a decision for the Government, taking account of advice from the Attorney General.  There is a window of three months after the judgment by the Court for a referral.</p>  <p>  No decision has yet been reached on this matter.  The ruling needs to be considered fully and carefully and that is now being done.</p>  <p>  My thoughts at this time are with the men who were subjected to the appalling treatment and who have had to deal with long-lasting adverse effects in the decades since.  I met with a group of the men and close family members of some of the other victims and their legal representatives on 24 April, in order to hear their views and experience. </p>  <p>  They are understandably disappointed with the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in March.  I listened very carefully to their views on this ruling, and those of their legal representatives.  I also noted that any further information or views that they may wish to provide as the Government considers the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights should be provided to my Department as soon as possible and this will be considered fully. </p>  <p>My Department has maintained contact on an ongoing basis with the legal representatives of the men and their families as appropriate, since the Government submitted an application in 2014 for a revision of the 1978 Ireland v UK case.  This contact will be maintained in the period ahead.</p></reply>

Ireland condemns the use of the death penalty in all circumstances, and I welcome that these death sentences have been commuted.  I am, however, deeply concerned about the renewed use of capital punishment in Bahrain since 2017, which was extremely disappointing since Bahrain had not used the death penalty since 2010. The continued imposition of death sentences throughout 2017 and 2018 remains a cause for grave concern.  This move is a backwards step in Bahrain&rsquo;s efforts to improve its human rights record, and only serves to reinforce the concerns that I have recently expressed in this House about the deteriorating human rights situation in Bahrain.   Ireland is unequivocal in its stance on the death penalty.  We oppose its use in all circumstances, and in particular in cases where there are allegations of unfair trials preceding its implementation.  The abolition of the death penalty is one of Ireland&rsquo;s international priorities, and my Department regularly conveys our stance on this issue to all countries where the death penalty is still in use.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about human rights issues in Bahrain are regularly conveyed to the Bahraini authorities, including through the Bahraini Embassy in London and through Ireland&rsquo;s (non-resident) Ambassador to Bahrain. In February of this year, officials from my Department met with the Ambassador of Bahrain in Dublin, and raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the human rights situation in Bahrain.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have also raised our concerns about Bahrain in relevant human rights fora.  At the Human Rights Council in Geneva in March 2018, Ireland made reference to Bahrain in our national Item 4 statement, highlighting our grave concerns over the ending of the defacto moratorium on use of the death penalty, and &ldquo;reaffirmed our strong and unequivocal opposition to capital punishment in all circumstances and for all cases&rdquo;. Ireland also supported an EU statement under Item 4 (Human Rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention) which reiterated calls on Bahrain &ldquo;to maintain its commitments as to the respect of freedom of speech and human rights defenders.&rdquo; Officials from my Department had previously raised ongoing human rights concerns with Bahrain in the context of its Universal Periodic Review, which took place in Geneva in May 2017.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the situation in Bahrain, and will continue to call on the Bahraini Government to make good on their stated commitment to make progress in the area of human rights, including in relation to the death penalty.</p></reply>

For example, larger companies are required to apply transfer pricing standards to the documentation which is required to support a claim for relief under the KDB. While SMEs will need to have records to support any apportionments made, the administrative burden placed on them is lower in recognition of their status. </p><p>In addition, while larger companies may only claim relief in respect of searched and examined patents or copyrighted software, smaller companies may be able to claim relief in respect of a third category of assets.  That third category is essentially assets which are patentable, but not patented.  In order to make a claim in respect of these assets, the company must apply to the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks for certification that the assets are eligible. </p><p>Last year, the Oireachtas passed the Knowledge Development Box (Certification of inventions) Act 2017 which provides for that certification.  Companies cannot claim the tax relief associated with these assets until they receive certification from the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks.  The Patent Office has published detailed guidance on applying for this certification</p><p><i></i></p><p>I have been advised by the Patents Office that they have not received any applications to date in relation to the KDB certificate for SME&rsquo;s.  However, I would note that the KDB certificate has only been available to firms since last year, through the introduction of the KDB (Certificate of Inventions) Act 2017, and firms may yet be considering applications for the certificate.  Furthermore, firms of all sizes can avail of the KDB scheme through the usual patent process.</p></reply>

There is currently 4 full time equivalent staff in this team.</p><p>In relation to the number of applications open for 0-3 months and for 3-6 months, owing to the way Revenue tracked correspondence it is not possible to provide this information for files dealt with prior to August 2017.  As set out in my replies to Parliamentary Question Nos 128 and 129 of 19 April 2018, an open item may be the subject of ongoing correspondence with Revenue during that period.  The length of time it is open refers to the length of time from when the application was made to when it is fully dealt with.  </p><p>All files are dealt with in date order.  However, where additional information is requested from a taxpayer they are given a 14 day window and if they reply within that window they remain at the top of the queue, rather than being returned to the end of the queue, as would happen if a strict date order approach was taken. </p><p>The following table sets out the age distribution of cases open at the end of each month:</p><p><table><tr><th>Month</th><th>No. open items</th><th>Open 0-3 months</th><th>Open 3-6 months</th><th>Open 6+ months</th></tr><tr><td>August   2017</td><td>164</td><td>133</td><td>31</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>September   2017</td><td>186</td><td>165</td><td>21</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>October   2017</td><td>277</td><td>227</td><td>50</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>November   2017</td><td>189</td><td>152</td><td>37</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>December   2017</td><td>187</td><td>170</td><td>17</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>January   2018</td><td>189</td><td>83</td><td>103</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>February   2018</td><td>188</td><td>63</td><td>119</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>March   2018</td><td>180</td><td>75</td><td>96</td><td>9</td></tr></table></p><p>There are two stages to the EII relief and both require an application at the appropriate time.  Therefore the figures of outstanding cases constitute a combination of the original application for the main relief (30/40s) and the follow-on application (10/40s) relating to the increase in employment. </p><p>Of the open cases at the end of January, February and March 2018: </p><p>- 80% are EII1 applications (the initial 30/40 relief) and </p><p>- 20% are EII1As (the 10/40 relief which may be claimed after 4 years). </p><p>In each of the months, approximately 150 EII1 applications were outstanding and approximately 30 EII1As (these figures are approximate on a monthly basis as records are updated in batches). </p><p>The breakdown as regards cases in which additional information was required is as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th></th><th></th><th>New     Applications not yet reviewed*</th><th>Further   information required     and  requested &ndash; no response received*</th><th>Further   information required,   requested and received*</th></tr><tr><td>EII</td><td>80%     of open cases</td><td>40%</td><td>50%</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>EII1A</td><td>20%     of open cases</td><td>85%</td><td>8%</td><td>7%</td></tr></table></p><p>* Expressed as a percentage of EII1 / EII1A claims as appropriate</p><p>There are also two stages in the working of each of these applications &ndash; an initial screening for completeness of application and the case-working of the application for certification.  At both stages, further information may need to be requested, and during the casework stage specific queries emerge that require further correspondence.</p><p>Of the new applications screened to date, less than one percent are fully complete for processing.  Revenue expects this to improve as applicants begin using the new detailed application form designed to address the problems evidenced in the application process.</p></reply>

The tax commenced on 1 May 2018 and applies to first supplies in the State of sugar sweetened drinks. Sugar sweetened drinks are water and juice based drinks, in ready to consume or concentrated form, that contain added sugar and have a total sugar content of 5 grams or more per 100 millilitres in their ready to consume form. </p><p>The tax applies on a volumetric basis at one of two rates, dependent on the total sugar content of the ready to consume form of the sugar sweetened drink. A rate of &euro;16.26 per hectolitre applies to drinks with a total sugar content of 5 grams or more, but less than 8 grams, per 100 millilitres. A higher rate of &euro;24.39 applies to drinks with a total sugar content of 8 grams or more per 100 millilitres. </p><p>A sugar sweetened drink contains added sugar if sugar is combined with other ingredients in its production or manufacture. If no sugar has been added, such as in the production of a pure fruit juice, then the drink does not contain added sugar and is not liable to SSDT. Where sugar has been added, the basis of assessment of the drink is the total sugar content of the drink in its ready to consume form. This means that a drink containing both naturally occurring and added sugar is assessed for the tax by reference to the total amount of sugar it contains in ready to consume form. </p><p>Where a sugar sweetened drink that contains added sugar is first supplied in the State in a concentrated form, such as a cordial or squash, the tax will apply if the total sugar content of the drink prepared from the concentrate is 5 grams or more per 100 millilitres. </p><p>Certain drinks, such as alcohol-free beers and wines, drinks based on soya, cereals, nuts or seeds, or drinks that contain milk fats and those labelled as food supplements, are excluded from the tax. In addition, any drinks excluded from EU food labelling obligations on the basis of their small scale production are not liable to the tax. For reasons of clarity, a legislative amendment will be brought forward in this year's Finance Bill to ensure that some of these exempt categories are exempt from the tax only where they deliver calcium levels comparable to dairy.  </p><p>Comprehensive details regarding the operation of the tax are provided on the Revenue website at</p><p><i></i><i>.</i></p></reply>

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data supplied by schools, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.</p><p>A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at</p><p><i>www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/DEIS-Identification-Process.pdf</i>.</p><p>It is important to note that schools included in DEIS with effect from September 2017 are those whose level of disadvantage has been identified as those schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage among their pupil cohort. Schools which have not been included at this stage are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new identification model. </p><p>It is also important to note that this is the first step in a process and the fact that a school has not been included now does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should the assessment indicate a level of disadvantage that warrants additional supports. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, an update of the identification model is currently underway. This will take account of updated school data as provided by schools for the current school year combined with the Pobal HP Index of Deprivation, based on CSO Small Area Population statistics derived from the 2016 National Census. It is envisaged that this process will be completed in the coming weeks.</p><p>Should this exercise reveal that any school, including the school referred to by the Deputy, which did not qualify for DEIS in 2017 meets the criteria applicable to schools with the highest concentration of disadvantage based on the updated information, then additional schools may be included subject to available resources.</p></reply>

By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. </p>  <p>  Further additional temporary Language Support is also provided, as necessary, to schools that have high concentrations of pupils that require language (EAL) support. At primary level, these allocations are made on the basis of appeals by schools to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board and at post-primary level to the Post Primary Staffing Appeals Board.</p></reply>

Momentum 1 cost in the order of &euro;17m and Momentum II cost almost &euro;19m.  The cost of another round of Momentum with 20% greater numbers than Momentum II would be &euro;22.8 million.

This scheme is additional to other capital funding schemes that are operated by the Department such as the additional accommodation scheme, Emergency Works scheme i.e. for projects of such urgency that they would prevent some or all of the school from opening, and Minor Works schemes.  </p><p>The Summer Works Scheme (SWS) is a multi-annual Scheme.  Over 1,650 schools, nearly 50% of schools, applied for inclusion under the current round of the scheme which reflects a very high demand.  </p><p>To date, almost &euro;80 million has been approved under the current round of the Scheme, in respect of 635 school projects, 464 primary and 171 post-primary schools,  for Gas, electrical upgrades, mechanical, sanitation and roof improvement works..  Details of the successful school applicants, are published on the Department's website <i>www.education.ie</i>. </p><p>In relation to the Summer Works Scheme 2018, over &euro;25 million will be spent on summer works projects in 2018.  This expenditure will enable the remaining approved improvement works for 178 schools nationwide to be completed. These works will be carried out by the schools themselves on a devolved basis mainly over the summer months, so the disruption to students, teachers and other school staff will be kept to a minimum.</p><p>Furthermore, the Department intends to engage with the relevant education partners in relation to giving schools a better lead-in period for planning and delivering projects under the summer works scheme from 2019 onwards.  While the Summer Works Scheme is hugely successful in enabling small scale refurbishment works to be done on a devolved basis, the Department considers that the operation of the scheme could be improved by providing a better lead-in period for schools rather than in Quarter 2 as in previous years.This will also help ensure that works done under the Summer Works Scheme fit better with any wider refurbishment/energy retrofit plans that may be done at schools under the increased funding provided in the National Development Plan. The engagement with education partners will commence shortly and will assist in developing a better timeline for the planning and delivery of summer works projects for 2019 onwards.</p></reply>

In response to an increase in complaints from consumers about car rental, in 2015 the European Commission and national consumer authorities in EU Member States, including the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, engaged through a common position with the five leading car rental companies with a view to securing better compliance with EU consumer protection legislation. The five companies - Avis, Europcar, Enterprise, Hertz and Sixt - account for around two-thirds of all private car rentals in the EU. As a result of this engagement, the joint action was concluded in January 2017 following changes made by the companies to a number of their commercial practices, including some of the practices referred to in the details supplied by the Deputy. The companies undertook that car rental prices should include all unavoidable charges, that information on additional insurance should be  clear, that consumers should always be given the option to get and return a car with a full tank and that procedures for inspection of vehicle damage and for handling of damage claims should be clear and fair. The European Commission and the national consumer authorities agreed that they would continue to monitor the car rental sector closely. I am aware that since the agreement with the main car rental companies there have been further complaints about practices in the sector in respect of matters such as overcharging for repairs. This underlines the need for continued monitoring of the sector by national consumer protection authorities and the European Commission. </p>  <p>  I have referred the details provided by the Deputy to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for consideration. Those details refer among other things to a charge by one car hire company for the use of a credit card for the purpose of a collision damage waiver.  As the Deputy may be aware, surcharges by traders for the use by consumers of the most commonly used credit cards have been prohibited since January 2018 under the Regulations that give effect to Directive (EU) 2015/2366 on payment services.

The EGFSN plays a key role in identifying current and future skills needs of enterprises and advising the government on these needs. The EGFSN carries out research, analysis and horizon scanning in relation to emerging skills requirements at both thematic and sectorial levels. The reports draw on statistical input and analysis from the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in Solas and consultation with education and enterprise experts as part of their studies.</p>  <p>  Over the last 20 years, the EGFSN has undertaken analysis and forecasting of skills availability in a range of sectors. In the last number of years these studies have included sectors as diverse as the Marine/Maritime economy; freight, transport, logistics and distribution; biopharma and the hospitality sectors. These reports include a horizon scanning exercise and generate forecasts for skills demand in the given sectors. The timeline of these reports is typically over a 5 year period to ensure accuracy in forecasting demands. The EGFSN has the opportunity to commence a follow up study if it is required.</p>  <p>  Current government and enterprise strategies also have a strong skills focus and in many cases, reflect the findings and recommendations of EGFSN reports. My Department works in collaboration with the Department of Education and Skills to ensure that the education system is producing the right talent pool to ensure the success of enterprise in Ireland. The National Skills Strategy reflects this goal as it aims to ensure the quality of our workforce. My Department's enterprise strategies, such as the Action Plan for Jobs and Enterprise 2025 Renewed, also have dedicated focus aimed at addressing the skills needs of enterprise. Actions in these strategies include but not limited to, the roll-out of the Skills for Growth Programme, developing training initiatives to develop in-company capability and the aim to address the need for new skills post-Brexit in the areas of customs, logistics and risk management.</p>  <p>  Through the work of the EGFSN, ongoing engagement with the Department of Education and Skills, and monitoring and implementation our robust enterprise policies my Department will continue to monitor skills demands and address any potential skills needs as appropriate.</p></reply>

The Group has a broad sectorial membership including representatives from the business community, education and training providers, trade unions, and a small number of Government Departments and agencies. The Group&rsquo;s mandate is to carry out research, analysis and horizon scanning in relation to emerging skills requirements at thematic and sectorial levels. Its follow up work involves engagement with the Department of Education and Skills, Higher Education Authority, SOLAS and other relevant bodies to produce an agreed action plan to address the skills needs identified. </p>  <p>  Recently completed and ongoing work being undertaken by the EGFSN includes analyses of skills needs or skills implications relevant to the food and drink sector, design, high level ICT, trade related skillsets in the context of Brexit, the early childcare sector, and digitalisation.</p>  <p>  As part of the new National Skills Architecture, the EGFSN presents its findings to the National Skills Council, chaired by the Minister for Education and Skills, which, together with additional skills and labour market intelligence provided by the Regional Skills Fora, Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS, and information on Employment Permit trends, provides a mechanism for mediating demands on resources in a manner that facilitates the prioritisation of investment in identified skills needs, and enhancing the responses by education and training providers to provision and delivery of those needs.</p>  <p>  The research of the EGFSN and the SLMRU also informs my Department&rsquo;s Economic Migration Policy Unit. This Unit has the responsibility for the employment permits system which is managed by the operation of the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List and the Ineligible Categories List. The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA migrants to fill skills shortages. The objective is balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and the shortage is a genuine one. The rationale underpinning the inclusion or omission from the occupation lists is informed by EGFSN, the SLMRU and is augmented by a consultation process that includes calls for submissions. This process is regularly reviewed to ensure that it is operating efficiently. </p>  <p>The analysis of the Expert Group on Future Skills has been reflected in the overarching strategies for the education and training system published in recent years. These include Ireland&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy 2025, and the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019,   including its associated annual implementation plans, both of which have been developed by the Department of Education and Skills. </p>  <p>This analysis has also informed the development of my own Department&rsquo;s framework policy for enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025- Ireland&rsquo;s National Enterprise Policy 2015-2025, its recent refresh, Enterprise 2025 Renewed, and the instrument for the annual implementation of the objectives set out in Enterprise 2025,   the Action Plan for Jobs, which seeks to create the optimum conditions for job creation within the economy, including through ready availability of relevant skills and talent.</p></reply>

The whole of Government effort to deliver on these objectives is supported by the annual Action Plan for Jobs.</p>  <p>Enterprise 2025 together with Innovation 2020 and the National Skills Strategy 2025   provide coherent, complementary and mutually reinforcing strategies focused on developing, retaining and attracting talent. </p>  <p>  Ireland's enterprise policy is delivering - we now have 2.1 million people at work and an unemployment rate of below 6%. The CSO reports that in the year to April 2017, net migration for Ireland, at +19,800 was at the highest level since 2008. This is a factor of both an increase in immigrants of 2.8%, from 82,300 to 84,600 and a decrease in emigrants from 66,200 to 64,800.  </p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies have a range of initiatives to connect with Irish emigrants (and others) and outline the careers and entrepreneurial opportunities in Ireland.  These include:</p>  <p>  - My officials undertaking a comprehensive review of the employment permits system to ensure that it remains fit for purpose in a changing environment</p>  <p>  - Since 2016, my Department has funded TechLife Ireland- a partnership with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Irish Technology industry to promote and brand Ireland as a top destination to pursue a career in technology and attract top tech professionals to Ireland each year. Industry is playing an important role in supporting the initiative and driving its development.</p>  <p>  - IDA Ireland actively promotes Ireland as a location for new investment that offers a high quality of life for mobile talent; and Enterprise Ireland has specific targets to attract entrepreneurs to Ireland with a focused marketing programme underway in international markets.</p>  <p>  - Science Foundation Ireland encourages leading researchers to move to Ireland raising Ireland's profile as a location for research excellence and career advancement. </p>  <p>  In terms of retaining non-Irish graduates after qualifying, the Government has extended the Third Level Graduate Scheme, for non-EU/EEA students at level 9 and above of the National Framework of Qualifications. The new permission will double the &lsquo;stay back option&rsquo; for masters and PhD students from 12 months to 24 months. This allows eligible graduates who have studied in Irish higher education institutions and whose award is granted by a recognised Irish awarding body at Masters or PhD level to remain in Ireland for two years to seek employment. It also ensures that our enterprises can retain skilled talent for a period of time post qualification.</p>  <p>Earlier this year the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade published a report on Addressing Challenges Faced by Returning Irish Emigrants  .  This independent report was commissioned with the goal of identifying solutions to disproportionate or unnecessary administrative burdens affecting Irish emigrants wishing to return to live in Ireland.  The findings of this report will help inform the Government's ongoing work on making returning to Ireland as easy as possible.</p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 Renewed is focused on driving growth over the longer term that is sustainable, driven by export led growth and underpinned by talent and innovation. Our objective is to deepen the resilience of our enterprise base and to deliver quality employment. We continue to put the appropriate actions in place across Government to ensure we attract, retain and develop the skills we need to realise our ambition.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-03a.351.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018050300051#WRG02800"><p>The State's economic migration policy is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy.  It is vital that the employment permits system is responsive to changes in economic circumstances and labour market conditions. In order to orient the flow of skilled migrants into the country to meet skills and labour demands that, in the short term, cannot be met by the resident labour force, it is necessary to review the highly skilled and ineligible lists on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s review of the highly skilled and ineligible lists is predicated on a formalised and evidence-based process.   An EU-wide study in 2015 showed that Ireland is ahead of most EU member states in terms of linking market intelligence to labour migration policy.</p>  <p>  The review of the lists is an evidence based process undertaken twice a year, informed by the annual publication of the National Skills Council&rsquo;s National Skills Bulletin and the Vacancy Overview Report, which is also an annual release.  In addition, an extensive internal consultation between officials of my Department and Solas, reviews of relevant sectorial reports or other pertinent releases are undertaken and a public consultation process with Government Departments, agencies, industry and social partners are invited to provide observations. Revised lists are included as schedules to Employment Permits Regulations which are laid before these Houses. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the biannual updating of the lists is the culmination of continual consideration by my Department  of labour market needs and the approach taken has been developed to ensure the sourcing of skills required for economic and social development without undue disruption to the State&rsquo;s labour market. </p>  <p>  However, in the light of the changing macroeconomic context, my officials are currently engaged in an overarching review of the employment permits system to ensure that it remains a good fit to support the State&rsquo;s skills and labour requirements where these can&rsquo;t be met from the resident and EEA labour pool. I expect this review to be completed by the end of June.</p></reply>

While this has been an appropriate approach in the period of recovery, in recent months, as we approach full employment, difficulties are arising in some sectors, as employers seek to fill lower skilled and lower paid occupations with consequent potential for constriction of growth due to labour deficits in particular sectors. Recognising the changed economy and labour market, my Department is undertaking a review of the economic migration policies underpinning the current employment permits system.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that our current policies are fully supportive of Ireland&rsquo;s emerging labour market needs, be they skills or labour shortages in certain sectors. </p>  <p>  In undertaking any adjustment in the orientation of the system, the interest of the 233,100 people on the live register in Ireland and the 18 million unemployed in the EU 28 must be remembered, and a balance must be maintained which does not further disadvantage these job seekers.  </p>  <p>  The scope of the review is wide ranging and incorporates all aspects of the current employment permits system. It is being overseen by an Inter-Departmental Group chaired by my Department and comprises the Departments of Justice &amp;amp; Equality, Employment Affairs &amp;amp; Social Protection, Education &amp;amp; Skills, Public Expenditure, Housing, Planning &amp;amp; Local Government, Health, Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine, Tourism, Transport &amp;amp; Sport and SOLAS.  The review, which is well underway, includes a public and stakeholder consultation as well as an EEA and international benchmarking exercise. </p>  <p>  I have requested that a report setting out a framework and recommendations for short and long term actions to be taken be submitted to me by end of June 2018.</p></reply>

As a result, equipping the workforce with the skills required for the jobs of today and those of tomorrow is a strategic priority for the Government. Meeting the growing skills needs of industry through investment in education and training is central to our continued economic success. </p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) is an independent, non-statutory body, which includes representatives from the business community, education and training providers, learner-support groups, trade unions and a number of Government Departments and agencies. It identifies the skills required by enterprise across occupations and sectors, as well as providing information to education and training providers to allow them to support the alignment of programmes with employers&rsquo; needs. My Department provides the EGFSN with research and secretariat support. </p>  <p>  The EGFSN has ongoing work and upcoming publications for 2018 concerned specifically with skills and labour shortages in Ireland. This includes skills forecasts across sectors such as Food and Drink; Design; Freight Transport, Distribution and Logistics; Childcare; and ICT. </p>  <p>  In April 2017 the EGFSN published the &lsquo;Update on Future Skills Needs in the Food and Drink Sector&rsquo;.  This report assesses skills needs in the food and drink sector in Ireland and makes twelve recommendations aimed at addressing any gaps that might currently exist, under the headings of work-based learning; internships, mentoring and apprenticeships; languages and international selling; and coordination.  These recommendations are currently being implemented and their progress is being monitored by my Department on behalf of the EGFSN.</p>  <p>  &lsquo;Winning by Design: An introduction to the design skills required for firms to be innovative and competitive in global markets&rsquo; was published in November 2017. The report addresses the broadening of design skillsets in response to the growing demand from industry for cross-disciplinary design skills. This includes a Design Skills Action Plan to enhance and develop design in Ireland. These actions are currently being monitored and their progression is reported to the EGFSN.</p>  <p>  Upcoming publications for 2018 include a refresh of the ICT Skills Demand Forecast previously undertaken in 2013. &lsquo;Forecasting the Future Demand for High Level ICT Skills in Ireland, 2017-2022&rsquo; aims to assess the annual demand scenario forecasts for ICT Practitioner skills. This is broken down for Computer Engineering and Electronic and Electrical Engineering, by NFQ Levels 6-10 within the ICT Sector and other sectors of the economy. This forecast will provide an overview of ideas and recommendations elicited from stakeholders on how to boost the quantity, quality and diversity of ICT Practitioner skillsets and competences in Ireland, over and above those currently pertaining.</p>  <p>  The EGFSN will also deliver &lsquo;Addressing the Skills Needs Arising from the Potential Trade Implications of Brexit Report&rsquo; in 2018. This study examines the skills needs arising from the potential trade implications of Brexit, with a strong focus on qualifications, skillsets, competencies and workforce roles relevant to the diversification of trade at enterprise level, and the movement of trade across international borders, at both enterprise level and in the wider Freight Transport, Distribution and Logistics sector. Eight interventions will be recommended to address the skills issues identified in this study. </p>  <p>  Another example of the EGFSN&rsquo;s upcoming work on meeting growing skills demands and the changing skillsets of the Irish workforce is the report on &lsquo;Skills for the Digital Economy&rsquo;, which will emphasise the importance of the constant reskilling and upskilling of the workforce in creating a resilient economy. The report will focus on how different roles and different sectors will be impacted by digitalisation and will develop a synopsis of approaches to upskilling the existing workforce. This report is currently underway and is expected to produce a series of key findings and recommendations. This report will add to the body of work completed by the EGFSN since its inception in relation to filling skills gaps using our current labour market.</p>  <p>  Through the ongoing work and publications outlined above the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, supported by my Department, will continue to ensure that an adequate and appropriately skilled workforce remains readily available in Ireland to meet the emerging challenges of a modern, growing economy.</p></reply>

Before deciding whether to reimburse a medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available.</p>  <p>  The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) of medicinal products for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The NCPE is currently conducting an HTA on Osimertinib (Tagrisso).

An update is  also provided on all 48 recommendations of the Plan and on progress to date.</p><p>Establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases  was one of the principal recommendations in the Plan.  The Programme is responsible for assisting with mapping and developing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise- nationally and internationally; and developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.</p><p>In line with the National Rare Diseases Plan, the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health, encouraged designated centres of expertise in Ireland to apply for membership of European Reference Networks (ERNs) during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks.  Three of these centres are now represented on ERN network.</p><p>Membership of ERNs will bring opportunities for engaging in research relating to Rare Diseases in keeping with the National Rare Diseases Plan.  Further centres are expected to apply for membership or affiliated membership of ERNs when the next call takes place in early 2018.</p><p>The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) was a key recommendation of the Rare Disease plan.  The office provides current and reliable information about rare diseases to the general public, health care professionals, researchers and policy makers.  The National Rare Diseases Office is responsible for updating Orphanet Ireland.  Orphanet is the international rare disease reference and information portal funded by the EU.  The office also manages the National Rare Diseases Information Line (a Freephone service) and provides online information about rare diseases on their website.</p><p>A number of recommendations about access to appropriate drugs and technologies were contained in the plan.  One chief recommendation in this regard refers to the HSE developing a Working Group to bring forward appropriate decision criteria for the reimbursement of orphan medicines and technologies; and that the approach should include an assessment system similar to that for cancer therapies established under the National Cancer Control Programme.  The HSE Acute Hospitals Division has developed the terms of reference, required membership and reporting relationship for this committee.  A Chairperson has now been identified and the Group met in March 2018 to start the process of identifying interested stakeholders and considering the remit of the Committee in relation to the assessment of drugs for rare diseases.</p><p>One of the recommendations of the National Plan for Rare Diseases was that the Health Identifiers Bill and the Health &amp;amp; Patient Safety Bill be published.  The former was published in 2013 and enacted in 2014.  The Individual Health Identifier part of the project is now being implemented by the HSE. A revised and much expanded General Scheme of a Health Information and Patient Safety Bill was approved by the government in November 2015 and published on the Department's website.</p><p>Two recommendations referred to training in rare diseases for healthcare professionals.  The Department of Health has contacted formally the various healthcare representative and professional bodies about implementing these recommendations.  The National Rare Diseases Office developed eLearning modules for healthcare professionals. These modules are available on HSE website.</p><p>The issue of rare diseases and of the creation of an all-island patient register has been raised in the context of on-going discussions at North-South meetings.  It is also anticipated that the Model of Care for Rare Diseases will set out recommendations for rare disease registries.  This model of care is in development by the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases.

As provided for by the Health (Amendment) Act 2013, the current public hospital statutory in-patient charge for public in-patient and day-case services is &euro;80 per day, subject to a maximum of &euro;800 in any period of twelve consecutive months. </p>  <p>  This nominal charge represents a contribution towards the overall cost of in-patient services and applies irrespective of the type of accommodation provided during an in-patient stay. There are a number of exemptions to this charge including where a person has a medical card, where a woman is receiving services in respect of motherhood and where a child is not more than six weeks old.</p>  <p>  The Health Insurance Act 1994, (Minimum Benefit) Regulations 1996 (as amended), provide the prescribed minimum payments for an insured person availing of in-patient services in a public hospital, in line with the amount of the charge payable for such services under the Health Act 1970 (as amended). In this context, all health insurance companies are required to cover the statutory public in-patient charge. However, it is at the discretion of individuals as to whether the charge should be paid by their health insurer on their behalf or if they wish to pay for it themselves.</p></reply>

Funding was provided to support extension of the existing cath lab operating hours to 12 weekly sessions per week, or by 20%, as recommended in the Herity Report. Recruitment efforts to support this service extension are ongoing.</p>  <p>  In the interim, a mobile cath lab service has also been provided. The mobile cath lab was deployed in October 2017 for an initial period of 20 weeks which has now been extended to allow further time for the recruitment effort. </p>  <p>  In regard to cost, the HSE has previously advised that the estimated cost of the temporary additional service was &euro;800,000 for the initial 20 week period. In regard to the cost of such a service for a full year, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly as soon as possible.</p></reply>

GPs holding a permanent GMS contract who received the Rural Practice Allowance of &euro;16,216.07 immediately prior to the introduction of the new Regulations who do not meet the new qualifying criteria continue to receive the payment on a personal basis, provided they retain their contractual commitment to the remote rural area.</p>  <p>  As at 1 May 2018, there are 251 practice units in receipt of rural supports under the RPSF.  176 practices receive the full financial allowance of &euro;20,000 and 20 practices receive the modified allowance of &euro;10,000.  The full year cost of increasing the existing allowance to &euro;25,000 and the corresponding modified allowance to &euro;12,500 for these practices would amount to approximately &euro;930,000.  It must be emphasised that this estimate does not take account of any future increase in the number of qualifying practices.  In addition, any increase in the financial allowance under the new RPSF would only apply to those practices that qualify under the new criteria, therefore these calculations have excluded the 55 GPs who currently receive the old financial allowance of &euro;16,216.07.</p></reply>

To this end, the Programme has developed a detailed Implementation Plan which I was pleased to launch in October 2017.  The Plan is presented under the Strategy's four strategic priorities and details how each of the 77 actions will be implemented.</p>  <p>  The Programme has estimated that full implementation will cost in the region of an additional &euro;80 million revenue funding over the lifetime of the Strategy.  Work to identify the precise capital funding requirement is ongoing.  The Strategy will be implemented on a phased basis over the coming years and therefore the funding requirement will vary from year to year.  In that context, the Implementation Plan will inform the annual Estimates process each year.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I can confirm that additional funding of &euro;4.15 million is being provided to the Programme this year to progress implementation of the Strategy.  The Programme's priorities for 2018 include: improving quality and safety, establishing community midwifery teams and increasing access to anomaly scans.  An online resource for maternity care will also be developed.</p></reply>

This contribution becomes payable on their death. Collection and recovery of repayable amounts of the Ancillary State Support is a function of the Revenue Commissioners, acting as a collecting agent for the HSE.  Where the HSE has advanced monies by way of Ancillary State Support it calculates the amount due in relation to such support and gives notice of that amount and particulars of how it is calculated to the relevant accountable person.</p>  <p>  The HSE notifies Revenue of amounts that become due for collection and in all circumstances Revenue makes contact with the relevant person before any collection activity is initiated.  Where there are personal or financial difficulties, Revenue will always work with the person, provided there is meaningful engagement.  While there is no provision for instalment arrangements under Ancillary State Support, if the accountable person wishes to pay by instalment arrangement then these payments are accepted by Revenue. Late payment interest charges may apply in such circumstances.  I would therefore urge family members of the deceased to engage directly with the Revenue Commissioners on this matter.</p>  <p>  There is also an option, in certain cases, to defer or postpone the  repayment of a loan amount based on the principal residence.  This is called &lsquo;Further Deferral&rsquo; and its  purpose is to ensure that certain individuals, for whom the asset is their principal residence, will not need to worry about selling or re-mortgaging the asset in order to repay the Nursing Home Loan.  Instead, such individuals can defer repayment of the Loan for the duration of their lifetime.  A person wishing to apply for a further deferral, or a representative acting on their behalf, must apply for such a deferral, not later than 3 months after the death of the applicant.  In compelling circumstances, an application may be made up until 6 months after the death of the applicant.  The application should be made on the form specified by the HSE. </p></reply>

One enrolment period at the start of the pre-school year will help streamline the administration process and will make it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year. This will also make it simpler for parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children.</p></reply>

According to CSO estimates, 10% of children in Ireland from infancy to 12 years of age receive childcare services from childminders, au pairs or nannies, often in combination with other forms of parental and non-parental childcare.  This equates to approximately 88,000 children. </p>  <p>On 26 March this year, Childminding Ireland launched their report 'Pathway to a Quality Support and Assurance System for Childminding in Ireland  ', which contains a number of recommendations drawn up by a working group with representation from across the sector.  My Department is giving this report careful consideration and will devise an action plan for childminders which will guide the future policy direction for childminders in the sector.</p></reply>

Currently service providers receive &euro;64.50 per child per week.  If a service has been approved for higher capitation the weekly payment increases to &euro;75 per child. Pre-school settings employing an Inclusion Co-ordinator under the LINC programme will receive an increase of &euro;2 per child per week in the rate of ECCE capitation payable.</p>  <p>  Higher Capitation is paid for individual ECCE Sessions where the ECCE Room leader holds a qualification recognised as meeting the minimum contract requirements for ECCE. LINC will be paid to settings employing an Inclusion Co-ordinator who has graduated from the LINC Programme and has agreed to take on the role and responsibilities of an Inclusion Co-ordinator.</p>  <p>  The ECCE capitation paid to Early Years providers will increase by 7% in September 2018.  This increase will result in the following:</p>  <p>  - Standard rate &ndash; increases from &euro;64.50 to &euro;69</p>  <p>  - Higher rate &ndash; increase from &euro;75 to &euro;80.25</p>  <p>  Therefore, for the current programme year, 2017/18, the full year cost of a child attending ECCE 5 days per week for 38 weeks in a standard capitation room is &euro;2,451.  This increases to &euro;2,850 per child in a higher capitation room. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department have committed to the continuation of the Programme Support Payment in 2018.  We are currently working with Pobal to finalise the details of how these funds will be administered to childcare providers.  As soon as there is further information in this regard  providers will be alerted via PIP.  There will likely be an announcement on this in the coming weeks.  This funding is to acknowledge the administrative work that childcare providers undertake in order to provide the ECCE programme.</p></reply>

My department also consulted with the artists and writers professional bodies.  It was decided that the initiative would apply to members of Visual Arts Ireland (VAI) and the Irish Writers Centre (IWC).A key feature of the initiative is that it acknowledges the status of self-employed artists and writers and gives them a 12 month window to focus on building up their work before they become subject to labour market activation.  Therefore, they are exempted from labour market activation, which is mandatory for most recipients of a jobseekers payment, for a period of twelve months.  Naturally there are safeguards in place to ensure that claimants are professional visual artists and writers and, in addition, applicants must satisfy all of the usual qualifying conditions for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</p><p>There were 42 artists and writers on the scheme in April.  The figure of 42 does not imply that there are only 42 professional visual artists or writers in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  It simply means that there are 42 recipients of the payment who are availing of the pilot arrangements and therefore they are not party to the activation process for 12 months.  A total of 54 artists and writers have availed of the scheme to date.</p><p>The general population of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients is not classified as to their occupation or profession so it is not possible to say how many writers or visual artists are in receipt of jobseekers payment.  The arrangements for the exemption scheme will be reviewed later this year.</p></reply>

It sets out under Strand 4, &lsquo;Measures to Support the Operation of Defined Benefit Schemes&rsquo;, that the Government is committed to advancing the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 to respond to the ongoing difficulties in DB schemes and to increase protections for members as well encouraging employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and managed.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the General Scheme of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017 (now the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017), was published in May 2017 and contained a number of key measures relating to DB pension schemes.  These proposed provisions will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting.  They seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions.  The measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes.</p>  <p>  These provisions are quite technical and complex.  Work to finalise them is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in position to bring forward the amendments at Committee Stage at the end of May or early June.  With the co-operation of the House, the Government intends to pass this legislation before the summer recess.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Legislation provides that sanctions/penalties in the form of reduced payments may be imposed by the Department&rsquo;s Deciding Officers where recipients of jobseeker payments fail, without good cause, to comply with activation measures. </p>  <p>  Activation measures include the requirement to attend group information meetings, and/or individual meetings for the purpose of assessing a person&rsquo;s education, training or development needs, and/or availing of suitable education, training or development opportunities, or specified employment programmes, which are considered appropriate to a person&rsquo;s circumstances.   Reduced rates are only applied where a jobseeker fails, without good cause, to engage as requested with the Department&rsquo;s employment services including contracted services, having received at least two warnings.</p>  <p>Refusal to sign a Personal Progression Plan would not automatically lead to the application of a penalty rate.     Refusal to sign and also failure to agree an action plan with their Case Officer/JobPath Provider, without good cause, will incur a penalty rate as outlined in SW legislation.  The Penalty Rate may be lifted at any time if the person engages in the activation process.</p>  <p>  The Jobseeker can appeal the Deciding Officer&rsquo;s decision for reduced rate penalties and for a 9 week disqualification, through the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).</p></reply>

The programme helps break the cycle of unemployment and improve a person&rsquo;s chances of returning to the labour market.  A number of new conditions were introduced on CE in July 2017 to further support progression and broaden access to CE to a wider range of people. </p>  <p>  In general all CE placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years will be for 1 year &ndash; however CE participants, working towards a major award, can seek to extend participation by up to two years to enable then to reach the required standard of qualification. In addition, those over 55 years of age can remain on CE for three years.</p>  <p>  An overall lifetime limit of 6 years will apply to all CE participants (changed from 3 years for those under 55 years).  A person may re-qualify for CE after 12 months of being in receipt of a qualifying payment, provided they have not reached their 6 year limit.  Persons in receipt of a qualifying disability-linked social welfare payment will be eligible for an overall lifetime limit of 7 years.</p>  <p>  Participation on CE is intended to be for a temporary fixed-term.  These placements are not full-time sustainable jobs.  Overall participation limits are in place to ensure that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from the scheme.  </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s priority in supporting work programmes is to provide access to good quality work experience and training qualifications to support the progression into employment of jobseekers and other vulnerable groups.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In the case of carers, legislation provides that a carer may be entitled to an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person and an annual carer&rsquo;s support for each care recipient. This reflects the practical needs of households where a person may be caring for more than one member of the family at the same time. </p><p>The person receiving care may also be receiving other income supports from my Department.</p><p>The current personal rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance is &euro;214 per week and if caring for more than one person this increases to &euro;314 per week.  An annual non means tested carer&rsquo;s support grant of &euro;1,700 is also paid, in respect of each care recipient, on the first Thursday in June. </p><p>Legislation also provides that carers can continue to receive carer&rsquo;s allowance at half the weekly rate if they are in receipt of another weekly social welfare payment. They are also entitled to free travel and if residing with the care recipient may also receive the household benefits package.</p><p>The income supports that carers receive from my Department are among the highest rates in the social protection system and the income disregard and means test for carers is the most generous in the social welfare system. </p><p>I hope that this answers the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</p></reply>

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The most recent figures for March 2018 are 28.4 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.4 weeks for a summary decision.</p>  <p>  The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeal officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the higher courts and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  </p>  <p>  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p>  <p>  In addition, a number of new appeals officers have joined the appeals office over the past year, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.  This changeover in staff has led to a slightly longer time to conclude appeals in 2017 and so far in 2018.  However, the Chief Appeals Officer has advised that she is hopeful that processing times will improve over the course of 2018.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that an appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal and that any favourable decisions are backdated to the original date of the claim.</p></reply>

Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is a means-tested social assistance payment whereas jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is a contribution based social insurance scheme.  To qualify for JB a person must have at least 104 weeks qualifying PRSI contributions paid since they first started work. </p>  <p>  Both the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes provide significant support to individuals so that they can work up to 3 days a week and still retain access to a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  The current days based system can provide significant income supports to jobseekers who are casually or part-time employed.  For instance an individual can earn a little over &euro;20,000 per year and still retain a small jobseeker's allowance payment, while the equivalent threshold for an individual with a qualified adult is almost &euro;34,700 if they are both working.  </p>  <p>  In addition, to the two jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes the back to work family dividend (BTWFD) scheme allows JA or JB recipients who have been jobseekers for 12 months or recipients of the one-parent family payment to retain their full increase for qualified children (IQC) for the first year in employment, tapering to 50% in the second year.  To be eligible for the dividend there must not be any other claim in respect of the children concerned, other than child benefit.</p>  <p>  My Department provides a comprehensive suite of income supports, including illness benefit (IB), invalidity pension (IP), and disability allowance (DA) for those who are unable to work due to an illness or disability.  IB is paid if a person cannot work because they are sick or ill. To qualify for IB a person needs 104 paid PRSI contributions.  IP is a weekly payment to people who cannot work because of a long-term illness or disability and are covered by social insurance.  To qualify for IP a person must have at least 260 weeks qualifying PRSI contributions paid since they first started work.   Disability allowance is a means tested payment available to people with a disability.</p>  <p>  The combination of schemes available provides considerable income support for individuals who have part time employment by allowing them retain access to a social welfare payment.    </p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, long term unemployment continues to fall.  The most recent data show that unemployment has fallen from a peak of 15% in 2012 to 5.9 % in April 2018.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an<i></i>independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants. </p><p>The Act provides that landlords must apply to register the tenancy of a dwelling with the RTB within one month of the commencement of the tenancy. The RTB actively pursues landlords for non-registration. Failure to register tenancies can result in prosecution with fines of up to &euro;4,000 and/or six months imprisonment. </p><p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Shared Service Centre (SSC) provides a highly effective transactional service on behalf of Local Authorities, including data-sharing with the RTB in relation to active HAP tenancies.

The dwellings to which the Act does not apply are set out in section 3(2) of the Act.  Where the owner of a dwelling, residing in that dwelling, lets a room, that letting is not considered to be a tenancy within the meaning of the Residential Tenancies Act. HAP support is available to tenants in rent a room scheme arrangements. In these cases, the RTB does not have any function and there is no registration requirement.</p></reply>

It will also fund services in relation to regeneration and programmes to upgrade existing housing (energy efficiency improvements, adaptation grants, housing for travellers, pyrite, etc.)  The balance of the funding will go towards meeting the needs of over 17,000 additional households to be supported through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Scheme and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) in 2018, as well as existing households already supported through those schemes, and will also fund housing supports and services in relation to homelessness.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's specific query regarding projected spend on a quarterly basis, it is difficult to provide information to sub-programme level, given that it is affected by timing factors.
