At the meeting and in our press conference after it, we both repeated our desire to keep the Common Travel Area arrangements in place and agreed to continue working together to this end.  We also discussed the necessity of ensuring the continued free flow of trade on the island and I made clear to the Prime Minister that in my view any reintroduction of a border would would have very negative consequences.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the United Kingdom have always cooperated closely on jointly securing the external border of the Common Travel Area (CTA) and we intend to continue to do so in the future.  In this regard, we will continue to maintain and enhance cooperation with the UK in relation to general immigration and border enforcement, recognising of course that Ireland will remain a committed member of the European Union and will continue to uphold the right of free movement for all EU citizens after the UK leaves the Union.</p>  <p>  First Minister Sturgeon and I held a meeting last November following the British Irish Council Summit in Cardiff.  Minister Flanagan also met with her during her subsequent visit to Dublin.  I have not had direct contact with her recently but there is ongoing engagement, at diplomatic and official level, with the Scottish Government, including through the Consul General's office in Edinburgh and our Embassy in London.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-15a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021500080#WRB00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 53 together.</p>  <p>  The College of Commissioners adopted the European Defence Action Plan on 30 November last.  This Commission proposal has yet to go through the wide ranging and extensive EU procedures before any part of it becomes a reality.</p>  <p>  The aim of the Plan is to explore how EU policies and instruments can ensure that the EU&rsquo;s industrial and skills base will be able to deliver required defence capabilities in view of current and future security challenges.  As part of this Plan, the Commission has proposed the creation of a European Defence Fund.  In addition, the Plan aims to offer supports to SMEs, start-ups and other suppliers to the defence industry.  There are also proposals in the Plan to increase transparency in relation to Defence procurement under the existing EU Procurement Directives.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Defence Fund is to promote research and innovation and contribute to the strengthening of the European defence technology and industrial base, and to further stimulate the development of key defence capabilities.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach attended the European Council meeting in Bratislava on 15 December last, where a number of issues including economic and social development, migration, security, Russia and Ukraine, and the situation in Syria were on the agenda.  Specifically, in relation to the European Defence Action Plan, the European Council welcomed the Commission&rsquo;s proposals as its contribution to developing European security and defence policy.  The Council stressed the importance of fully involving Member States in the proposals that will be brought forward.  In addition, the Commission was invited to make proposals in the first semester of 2017 for the establishment of a European Defence Fund. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan proposes that the European Investment Bank may have a role to play in relation to financing certain parts of the European defence supply.  The Action Plan notes that the EIB group may already finance investments in research and development by European companies where civilian and dual use technologies are concerned with a view to subsequent commercialisation in civilian applications.  The Commission&rsquo;s Communication also noted that any expansion in the EIB&rsquo;s current activities in the area could take place within the limitations of the Treaties and subject to the agreement of the EIB&rsquo;s Governing Bodies.   </p>  <p>  The most recent European Council in December, invited the European Investment Bank to examine steps with a view to supporting investments in defence research and development activities.  I expect that the EIB will now take forward this examination. </p>  <p>  For certain member States in the EU, defence is a significant contributor to their economies, representing an EU industry of &euro;100 billion with 1.5 million direct and indirect employees.  Ireland does not have an issue with funding of defence research.  As I have stated previously to the House, for Ireland to have a well-equipped and capability driven defence forces we must support the funding of defence research.  And as we are all aware, Ireland may not have a defence industry but this does not stop Ireland tapping into this funding through our well established dual-use companies and technologies.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the proposals in the Action Plan fully acknowledge and reaffirm that Defence remains a Member State prerogative.  Decisions about expenditure, military capabilities, Research and Technology are matters for Member States.</p></reply>

I have reviewed the Report in detail and have also received a briefing from the University of Limerick (UL) researchers who undertook the project.</p>  <p>  The Survey findings clearly point to challenges for the Defence Forces, particularly in the areas of leadership, communication, organisational culture, the working environment and active management of personal expectations.  However, many positives emanated from the Survey, especially in relation to the commitment of personnel to the values and mission of the Organisation, high levels of work satisfaction, pride in the Organisation and positive views on culture and work support.  Indeed, the UL researchers point out that the findings of the Report and the recommendations are interconnected and caution should apply to reading any one particular finding in isolation. </p>  <p>  The responses to the issues raised in the Report of the Climate Survey will involve the engagement of all levels of management within the Organisation.  Both RACO and PDFORRA were briefed by the UL researchers on their findings and conclusions.  Following that briefing, I met with the Representative Associations to hear their views and listen to their concerns in relation to the Report.  It was agreed at the meeting that the Representative Associations would be fully engaged in the response to the Report and proposed Action Plan through the IMG framework, where they could put forward their views on appropriate responses.</p>  <p>  Follow up work to the initial findings in the Survey was conducted by the UL researchers via focus groups with a view to establishing qualitative elements behind the quantitative findings of the Climate Survey.</p>  <p>  73 Focus Groups were conducted throughout the Defence Forces.  The Focus Groups were grouped by rank (Private, Junior NCO, Senior NCO, Junior Officer, Senior Officer), based on the findings of the Climate Survey research and were held at every permanently occupied Post /Barracks in the Defence Forces and on the Golan Heights where a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force are deployed to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF).</p>  <p>  I have been advised that a very significant volume of raw data has been gathered for analysis.  UL have informed the Defence Forces that the Focus Group analysis will be provided in Q2/Q3 2017.</p></reply>

As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force targeted recruitment takes place so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels.     </p>  <p>  I am informed that Air Corps personnel are an attractive employment source for other airlines and air service providers given their experience and training. </p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to address the personnel requirements of the Defence Forces.  In the case of the Air Corps, there are 28 cadets, in 3 classes, undergoing the various stages of the Air Corps cadetship to become pilots.  There are currently 8 Air Corps cadets in the final stages of their training with commissioning of these cadets likely to take place in Quarter 4 of this year.  In addition, a Cadet recruitment campaign is due to commence before the end of Quarter 1, 2017 with a view to the commencement of training in September 2017.  Four personnel will complete their Air Traffic Control training between May and September this year.  The Air Corps is currently inducting a further Air Traffic Control Course, and it is anticipated that up to eight (8) will be selected for training, qualifying in May 2018 and May 2019.  A new NCO promotion competition, to fill the ranks of Sergeants and above, including those in the Air Corps, has been launched.  It is anticipated that promotions from this competition will commence in Quarter 3 2017.  The 2017 Air Corps Apprenticeship competition is due to commence shortly and it is planned that following this process, 25 new Air Corps apprentices will be inducted in late September 2017 to commence their training.</p></reply>

Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  On each occasion that the support of the Defence Forces is required, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issues a form C70 to the Defence Forces to request their assistance.</p><p>Since 5 February 2003, the Garda&iacute; have requested support from the Defence Forces at Shannon Airport on occasion.  The cost of the presence of Defence Forces at Shannon Airport, performing aid to civil power duties with regard to United States of America military aircraft landing at Shannon airport in 2016 and to date in 2017 is &euro;201,491.79 for 432 deployments.  The following table details a breakdown of this figure.<table><tr><th>Month (2016) </th><th>No. of Deployments </th><th>Costs &euro; </th></tr><tr><td>January </td><td>36 </td><td>15,457.23 </td></tr><tr><td>February </td><td>27 </td><td>13,896.72 </td></tr><tr><td>March </td><td>39 </td><td>15,492.39 </td></tr><tr><td>April </td><td>47 </td><td>15,101.14 </td></tr><tr><td>May </td><td>33 </td><td>15,422.07 </td></tr><tr><td>June </td><td>39 </td><td>15,007.38 </td></tr><tr><td>July </td><td>22 </td><td>15,293.15 </td></tr><tr><td>August </td><td>26 </td><td>15,340.03 </td></tr><tr><td>September </td><td>35 </td><td>14,960.50 </td></tr><tr><td>October </td><td>46 </td><td>15,574.13 </td></tr><tr><td>November </td><td>22 </td><td>14,808.14 </td></tr><tr><td>December </td><td>24 </td><td>15,316.59 </td></tr><tr><td>January (2017) </td><td>26 </td><td>15,340.03 </td></tr><tr><td>February (2017 to date) </td><td>10 </td><td>4,482.29 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>432 </td><td>201,491.79 </td></tr></table></p><p>The costs relate to security duty allowance paid to members of the Defence Forces, rations and fuel.  The cost of ATCP operations are met entirely from the Defence Vote.  There is no separate budget line as decisions are taken in respect of these operations on a case by case basis.  Therefore, the information on the proportion of the total spend on ATCP operations that are spent on these ATCP deployments in Shannon is not readily available.</p><p>For security reasons it would not be appropriate to disclose the details regarding the number of personnel assigned to each deployment.</p><p>The issue of overflights by foreign military aircraft and the use of Shannon Airport by foreign military aircraft is the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Successive Governments have made overflight and landing facilities available at Shannon Airport to the United States for well over 50 years.  These arrangements do not amount to any form of military alliance with t he US and are governed by strict conditions, applied to ensure compatibility with our traditional policy of military neutrality.</p><p>I am satisfied that there is ongoing and close liaison between both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces, and between my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality regarding security matters generally, including the Defence Forces ATCP roles.</p></reply>

With regard to the protected disclosures submitted in respect of health and safety issues in the Air Corps these were each delivered to my Department by hand in late 2015 and January 2016 and as such their receipt would have been acknowledged in person at the time they were submitted.  In addition, supplementary correspondence has been acknowledged as it was received.  The disclosures received were from current and former members of the Defence Forces.   </p>  <p>  Legal advice was sought at an early opportunity on how best to progress certain elements of the disclosures related to matters which were, and still are, the subject of litigation.</p>  <p>  It was decided that an external reviewer should be appointed.  I believe that in this instance it is important that I get a clear and independent view of the issues raised by those who have made disclosures.</p>  <p>  With some difficulty, an appropriate individual was identified and I appointed him in July 2016 to carry out a review of the disclosures.  However, in the event, he was ultimately not in a position to carry out the review. </p>  <p>  In September 2016, I appointed an alternative independent third party to review the allegations made in the outstanding disclosures and those making the disclosures were informed of this fact.</p>  <p>  In late November 2016, the interim recommendations and observations from the independent third party were submitted to me, and in December, I asked that these be passed to the military authorities for immediate action and response.</p>  <p>  On 7 January, 2017, the Department received a response from the military authorities outlining the actions underway and this has been forwarded to the independent reviewer for consideration.  I understand that the reviewer has reviewed this material, and has initiated a number of meetings in order to finalise his review. </p>  <p>  In addition to the three protected disclosures mentioned above, my Department has received a further 3 disclosures which having been assessed, were deemed protected disclosures under the provisions of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  Of these, two have been resolved and the third is ongoing.  In addition, I am in receipt of a disclosure received on 27 January 2017 which is currently being assessed.</p></reply>

On 21 June 2016, the Government approved continued participation in the UNDOF mission for a period of twelve months up to June 2017.  The Defence Forces are making a valuable contribution to this important mission.

The Ombudsman has full independence and autonomy in the discharge of his statutory functions.  The function of the Ombudsman is to act as the ultimate point of appeal for, and administrative investigation into, complaints made by members and former members of the Defence Forces against another member or former member of the Defence Forces, or against a civil servant of the Department of Defence.</p><p>Under the provisions of section 5 of the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004, certain actions are excluded from investigation by the Ombudsman.  The main categories of exclusion are:</p><p>(a)  where a complainant has already initiated legal action in respect of the matter complained of;</p><p>(b)  the matter is or has been the subject of a military legal investigation and the complaint materially concerns the substantial matter, as opposed to administrative delay;</p><p>(c)  the matter relates to or affects security or a military operation;</p><p>(d)  any matter relating to the terms or conditions of employment in the Defence Forces within the scope of the existing statutory schemes of Conciliation and Arbitration;</p><p>(e)  any matter concerning the organization, structure and deployment of the Defence Forces;</p><p>(f)  any matter concerning the remission of punishments or forfeitures awarded under the Defence Act, 1954 or the administration of military prisons;</p><p>(g)  if the complaint was made outside the specified time; or</p><p>(h)  if the complaint relates to a matter which occurred before the commencement of the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004.</p><p>In the 2015 Annual Report of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces published in December 2016, the Ombudsman recommends that elements of the exclusions provided for in section 5 of the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 should be reviewed.  In particular he questions why, in circumstances where maladministration is a primary consideration for an Ombudsman, should any administrative aspect of most, if not all, of the excluded matters be outside his jurisdiction.  He also questions whether those exclusions are necessary and reasonable in circumstances where his powers are limited to the making of recommendations to the Minister.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the State&rsquo;s oversight of the role and administration of the Defence Forces is very often dealt with separately to that of the main element of the public services.  Where this occurs, the State has set up specific military related parallel structures as evidenced by matters such as bargaining on pay and conditions, military law and its related ancillary structures.  The Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 provides for the investigation of military administrative grievances separately to those of the general public service.  While parallel structures exist for military personnel, they are dealt with in no less favourable way, having regard to their unique duties, than their civilian counterparts.  The exclusions set out in Section 5 of the 2004 Act reflect in large the exclusions set out in the Ombudsman Act 1980.  That said, my Department is reviewing the proposals put forward by the Ombudsman as part of an overall review of the Redress of Wrongs system in the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

No. 312 of 2014, became applicable with effect from 1 May 2015.   Lifetime Community Rating introduced a late entry loading on health insurance premiums for those aged 35 and older taking out private health insurance for the first time.  No loading is applied to an insured person if, on 1 May 2015, the person had a continuous period of cover in an in-patient indemnity health insurance scheme prior to that date.  The primary purpose of introducing Lifetime Community Rating is to encourage people to purchase private health insurance at a younger age.</p>  <p>  The regulation governing the Lifetime Community Rating loadings applies equally to all citizens of the State irrespective of the nature of any health care provided by their employer.  It is a matter, therefore, for each citizen to decide whether they wish to take out private health insurance in order to avoid additional loadings for taking out insurance after the age of 34. </p>  <p>  Commissioned Officers are currently provided with private health care by the State, i.e., they can be referred by the Defence Forces for private/semi-private treatment in civilian hospitals or private consultants&rsquo; rooms, where it is deemed necessary. </p>  <p>  Meetings have been held between officials of my Department and the Department of Health on 30 April 2015 and 8 January 2016 to discuss the position of Defence Forces personnel with regard to the Lifetime Community Rating regulations.  The Department of Health considers that the arrangements in place for Defence Forces personnel do not comply with health insurance legislation or its key principles of community rating, open enrolment, lifetime cover and minimum benefit.  The Department of Health has forwarded to the Health Insurance Authority the concerns relating to members of the Defence Forces regarding Lifetime Community Rating. </p>  <p>  The Health Insurance Authority, the statutory regulator for the Irish private health insurance market, has commenced a review of the operation of the Lifetime Community Rating regulations.  It has invited submissions from stakeholders and interested parties via a consultation paper.  The concerns relating to members of the Defence Forces have been included in the consultation paper.  The closing date for receipt of submissions is 3 March 2017.   </p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the Health Insurance Authority has issued the consultation paper.  I can confirm that my Department will be making a submission to the Health Insurance Authority as part of the review process reflecting the position of the Defence Organisation.</p></reply>

Irish participation in the humanitarian mission in 2015 and 2016 resulted in the rescue of over 15,600 migrants.  The deployment of Irish Naval vessels during these months, when the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean was at its highest, was the most effective use of limited resources.   </p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the deployment of Defence Forces contingents overseas are considered on the basis of capacity to achieve the mission mandate, resource availability and sustainability.  The Naval Service operation in the Mediterranean is considered in the context of existing demands on the Naval Service having regard to their domestic role in fishery protection and as the principle seagoing agency of the State.  As the Deputy will appreciate, within a defined resource envelope, an appropriate balance must be struck between the domestic operational demands on the Naval Service and potential overseas deployments.  On the basis of such considerations, in 2016, it was decided to deploy three vessels to the Mediterranean for tours of approximately 12 weeks each, similar to that which was deployed in 2015. </p>  <p>  The question of deployment to the operation in the Mediterranean in 2017 is currently being considered in the context of the ongoing situation in the Mediterranean and the overall EU response thereto, the demands on the Defence Forces, our overseas commitments and available resources.</p></reply>

Air transport for these patients is currently provided in three ways: Air Corps fixed-wing and rotor-wing aircraft; Irish Coast Guard rotor-wing aircraft; and private air ambulance providers.</p>  <p>  As one of the components of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps contributes to all roles assigned by Government including responsibilities relating to the provision of Aid to the Civil Power and maritime security tasks.  Like other elements of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps also undertakes other roles in accordance with agreed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).   </p>  <p>  In this context, the Department of Defence has an SLA with the Department of Health and the HSE for the Air Corps to use its fleet of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to transport patients and medical teams between hospitals within Ireland and abroad, on an as available basis.  In accordance with the SLA, this availability is dependent upon the availability of suitable aircraft, the availability of flying crews and the suitability of weather conditions.  The terms of the SLA do not provide for the Air Corps to deliver a dedicated, 24/7 transport service. </p>  <p>  This approach was maintained in the White Paper on Defence (2015) which stated that the Air Corps will continue to provide an emergency inter-hospital transfer service in support of the HSE on an as available basis.  This means that fixed or rotary wing aircraft are not required to be on standby for this purpose.  However, if such aircraft and personnel are available when requested for a mission, they can be deployed.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that the level of availability of Air Corps aircraft for inter-hospital transfer tasks has reduced.  This is largely because the Air Corp has experienced retirements of highly experienced personnel which is outstripping the recruitment and training of replacement personnel.  This has led to a shortage of experienced pilots which has reduced the number of available flying crews.  Due to these crew shortages, aircraft availability for the inter-hospital air ambulance service is reduced. </p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to address the H.R. challenges for the Defence Forces.  In the case of the Air Corps, there are 28 cadets, in 3 classes, undergoing the various stages of the Air Corps cadetship to become pilots.  In addition, targeted recruitment will continue in 2017.  A new NCO promotion competition, to fill the ranks of Sergeants and above, including those in the Air Corps, has been launched.  Promotions from this competition will commence in Q3 2017.   </p>  <p>  My officials will continue to keep the Department of Health and the HSE fully informed of the situation in the Air Corps.  The Department of Health, the HSE, the Department of Defence and other key stakeholders are working together to optimise availability of air transport within current arrangements and to identify longer term options.</p></reply>

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning priorities planning process.</p>  <p>  In this regard, Budget 2017 secured a capital spending allocation of &euro;74 million, representing an increase of &euro;7 million on the 2017 Defence allocation contained in the 2016-21 capital investment programme.  This allocation will facilitate the investment necessary to ensure that the Defence Forces have the equipment and infrastructure to deliver on all their roles as set out in the White Paper.</p>  <p>  The Army will continue to retain all-arms conventional military capabilities, and the principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas.  There is focus on the essential force protection provided by armoured vehicles, and in this regard a maintenance and upgrade programme has commenced for the current fleet of 80 Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) which will seek to ensure viability of the fleet out to 2030.  A small number of armoured logistical and utility vehicles are also being procured for force protection. </p>  <p>  The Air Corps will see the Cessna fleet replaced with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks.  The aircraft specification is currently being prepared and it is expected that the tender competition will be initiated and advertised on the e-tenders website in the near future.  The two CASA 235s Maritime Patrol Aircraft are due for replacement in 2019.  The CASAs will be replaced with consideration of their replacement with larger more capable aircraft to enhance maritime surveillance and to provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks.   </p>  <p>  The current Naval Service Ship replacement programme has already seen the replacement of three Naval Service vessels.  The White Paper underpins the ongoing replacement of the Naval Service fleet.  An agreement was reached in June 2016 for the provision of an additional ship for the Naval Service to be built to the same specifications as the three newest vessels.  This ship is scheduled for delivery in mid 2018. Future Naval Service capabilities are being planned as part of the White Paper project planning process which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current provisions, together with the courses of action in the White Paper, will continue to ensure that the Defence Forces is suitably equipped, in line with international best practice, to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Military Authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force, as of the 31 December, 2016 was 9,126 personnel, comprising: - Army: 7,332 personnel, - Naval Service: 1,090 personnel and - Air Corps: 704 personnel.</p>  <p>  The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services.  Plans are being put in place to run a new General Service recruitment competition in the coming weeks.  The intake of Cadets into the Permanent Defence Force is normally carried out on an annual basis, taking into consideration the operational requirements of the Defence Forces and the resource envelope allocated to Defence.  It is planned to launch the 2017 Cadetship competitions shortly.  Direct Entry Competitions are also held as required from which specialist appointments are filled.  General Service recruitment and recruitment of further apprentices is also planned for 2017.   </p>  <p>  I am advised by the military authorities that their planned target is to induct approximately 860 new entrants to the Defence Forces across all services and competition streams in 2017.  In 2016, 690 new entrants were inducted (590 General Service and 100 Cadets).</p>  <p>  With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, it is intended to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</p></reply>

No. 383 of 2016, I commenced those provisions of Part 1 and Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 as necessary to get the new Authority up and running, particularly in terms of its membership and appointment.  On 29 September 2016, I signed the Order appointing 1 October 2016 as the official &ldquo;establishment day&rdquo; of the Regulatory Authority as provided under section 7 of the 2015 Act - S.I. No. 507 of 2016 refers.  In conjunction with these initial steps the nomination, approval and appointment procedures for the members of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority set out in Part 2 of the 2015 Act were also completed.  This has included the required resolutions approving such appointment having been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  Dr. Don Thornhill has also been appointed as Chairperson of the Regulatory Authority in accordance with the Act. </p>  <p>  The Authority, which has eleven members including a lay majority and lay-Chairperson, held its inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016 and has been meeting monthly since then with its most recent meeting having taken place on 19 January 2017.  Initial office accommodation has been provided for the Authority by my Department along with the secondment of an officer at Assistant Principal level in support of its start-up phase.  Funding support of &euro;1 million has also been provided to the new Authority by my Department in December on a strictly recoupable basis as the new Authority will be self-funding by levy.  In the building up of capacity and resources to become fully operational, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has recently appointed a person to fulfil the duties of its Chief Executive on a solely interim basis to drive the initial start-up phase.  At the same time this will enable the Authority to prepare the way for the public recruitment of a full-time Chief Executive in the coming months having had the opportunity to more clearly identify its existing and future management needs and capacities in real time. </p>  <p>  As part of the commencement of Part 2 of the 2015 Act, the Law Society, the Bar Council and the Honourable Society of the King's Inns have furnished the Legal Services Regulatory Authority with copies of their professional codes as required within one month of the Authority's establishment under section 23(6)(a).  On 5 December 2016, under S.I. No. 630 of 2016, I also commenced sections 118 to 120 of the 2015 Act.  These provisions set statutory delivery deadlines for the completion of public consultations and reports by the new Regulatory Authority on the specified matters concerned.  These relate to Legal Partnerships, Multi-Disciplinary Practices and certain restrictions on barristers in relation to direct access on contentious matters and the holding of clients' monies.  The working focus right now is on the managed roll-out of the Authority's remaining functions in tandem with the phased commencement during the year of the various remaining Parts and provisions of the 2015 Act. </p>  <p>  The current focus includes the phased commencement of respective sections or Parts of the 2015 Act such as those dealing with the introduction of a more transparent legal cost regime, the establishment of a Roll of Practising Barristers and the separate introduction under the Act of Pre-Action Protocols.  It also includes the transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator which is a substantial structural reform of an office of the High Court and for which I have also introduced and commenced additional supporting measures under the Courts Bill which was enacted on 28 December 2016.  Following these steps the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced. </p>  <p>  These are substantial tasks involving detailed preparation for which I know the new Authority, with the direct engagement of its interim Chief Executive, is actively building up its working resources in the short term.  My Department and the new Regulatory Authority will, therefore, continue to liaise closely to ensure that we can successfully coordinate the identification of necessary steps and commencement, from my side as Minister, and delivery, by the Authority as the new independent statutory regulator, of the various provisions concerned.</p></reply>

Tusla has advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are represented on the National Steering Committee for Sexual Abuse Services which has been established to facilitate and promote integration and coordination of the key stakeholder agencies in the development of sexual abuse services for children in Ireland.  I understand that other agencies involved in this process are Tusla, the HSE, the Children's Hospital Group, the Probation Service and the CARI Foundation. </p></reply>

This will significantly reduce the length of time that persons spend awaiting a decision on their protection application.

Such training is based on national experiences as well as best practice approaches developed internationally by agencies such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO).  The training includes interviewing skills techniques which encompass awareness of the needs of vulnerable groups such as children and victims of torture and of other types of degrading treatment.  Training on cultural awareness as well as the effect of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other psychological issues is also provided.  Caseworkers are also trained to deal sensitively with applicants from different cultural backgrounds in the assessment of their applications including when conducting interviews.  It is also the policy to ensure that each individual international protection applicant is treated with courtesy and professionalism at all times. </p>  <p>  Training is provided by in-house trainers and, from time to time, by outside experts such as the UNHCR, Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and the Centre for the Care of  Survivors of Torture (SPIRASI).</p>  <p>  Members of the Office for the Promotion and Integration Office (OPMI), Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), and the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) have received anti-racism and diversity training.  In addition, senior members of staff within the relocation side of the IRPP have received child protection training from Tusla (the Child and Family Agency) and training in dealing with unaccompanied minors and victims of human trafficking through the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  It is also worth noting that in advance of any refugees being resettled or relocated, staff of the IRPP carry out research into the ethnic and cultural aspects of the new communities before they arrive and also consult with the new refugees on aspects of their culture which might differ from our norms in order to prepare the receiving community for their arrival.</p>  <p>  The HSE has also developed a suite of training programmes for persons working with refugees which includes modules dealing with persons experiencing trauma  and sexual violence.  This training also includes a specific module on 'minding your own health' for staff working in reception centres and for those working with  refugees in the receiving communities. </p>  <p>  To ensure that applicants in Direct Provision centres are treated with sensitivity to their cultural and psychological needs, RIA, along with COSC (the National Organisation for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence) engaged in a working group with a number of non-governmental organisations including Akidwa and the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre to develop a RIA policy around incidences of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and harassment within Direct Provision Centres.  Prior to the implementation of this policy in 2015, a number of two-day training programmes were delivered to centre staff by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre in conjunction with Women's Aid.  The agreed policy is now operational in all centres and is available on the RIA website.</p>  <p>  The training needs of all staff working with vulnerable migrants are kept under continual review in order to ensure that the Department and its agencies working in the area are fully equipped to deal with the various challenges that emerge when dealing with diverse cultural mores.</p></reply>

This is in the context of passenger numbers at Dublin Airport reaching record levels last year with almost 28 million passengers using the airport.  On the rare occasions that passengers may experience delays this can be for a variety of reasons including congestion arising in the terminal building due to the number of passengers disembarking from flights at peak daily periods, delayed flights due to weather conditions, or other factors including the conducting of enhanced checks on passengers or current building works in one of the immigration areas which has reduced the space available. The Irish immigration authorities have an excellent relationship with the DAA and work closely together to address queue management issues where they arise. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the protection of our borders is a matter of the utmost priority and that checks undertaken on passengers must be thorough and appropriate.  Issues may arise that require further processing and checks of individual passengers but every reasonable effort is made to minimise the impact on travellers.  In this context, and in line with developments in other EU Member States, my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to progress a broad series of initiatives to strengthen border security.  For example, since November 2016 an automated connection to INTERPOL&rsquo;s Lost and Stolen Travel Documents database was rolled out to all international airports and seaports.  In the first eight weeks of operating systematic checks against this Database over 700,000 documents were searched, with a number of people having been refused entry to Ireland on the basis of an alert on the system having been triggered.  This has not had any significant impact on immigration processing times. </p>  <p>  Later this year the Irish immigration authorities will begin to process Advance Passenger Information on flights into the State from outside the EU and preparations are also under way to implement the EU Directive on Passenger Name Records (PNR).  These systems will provide further protection for our borders against crime, terrorism and illegal immigration threats.  In addition, I expect to be in a position to award a contract for the provision of automatic border control (ABC) gates in the next few months and to begin installation at Dublin airport later in the year.  This facility will be available for EU nationals with e-passports to effectively self-immigrate through the airport.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) will this year take on the front line checks in Terminal 2 at Dublin airport (they already carry out this function in Terminal 1 and the Transit area of Terminal 2) which will release further Garda&iacute; for core policing duties.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, 838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed by the Commissioner that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.  This accelerated recruitment is complemented by substantial investment in resources that will support the delivery of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 which sets key strategic objectives for Roads Policing and will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s road policing plans over the next 5 years. </p>  <p>  The 2017 Garda Policing Plan has indicated a commitment to increase the number of personnel dedicated to traffic duties by 10% to reflect the increasing numbers of personnel across the entire organisation.  Given that there was no recruitment for a period of five years it will take some time before there are fully trained officers available to replace the number of personnel that have retired across the entire organisation, including traffic.  However, the Commissioner has confirmed that the personnel requirements of the Garda Traffic Corps is currently being assessed to identifying the most vulnerable areas in regard to serious traffic collisions and the level of compliance to Road Traffic Legislation.  Combined with this data I am informed that the Assistant Commissioner, Roads Policing and Major Event/Emergency Management is currently assessing the capacity of Divisions and Districts to identify and target areas where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could accelerate the deployment of personnel to traffic in 2017.  The filling of the vacancies identified will be conducted on a structured basis and will be further enhanced with the recently renewed recruitment campaigns to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  Road traffic legislation is, of course, also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.  As roads policing is the duty of every Garda member, this duty is not reserved for Garda members of the Traffic Corps.  Similarly, members of the Traffic Corps are required to engage in the core activity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na concerning the prevention and detection of crime.  </p>  <p>  The Road Traffic (Fixed Charge Offences &mdash; Cyclists) Regulations 2015 (S.I. No. 331 of 2015) provide for the issuing of Fixed Charge Notices (FCNs) to cyclists.  I have requested details of the number of FCNs issued to cyclists in 2016, from the Garda Commissioner and I will arrange for this to be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as this is to hand. </p></reply>

These include accommodation (where necessary), medical care and planning, psychological assistance, material assistance, legal aid and advice, security advice, vocational training and education.  </p><p>  The Government recognises that Human Trafficking is a hidden crime, and that victims may be reluctant to make themselves known to authorities.  In making determinations as to whether a person is a suspected victim of human trafficking, An Garda S&iacute;ochana takes into account any information provided by NGOs.  In circumstances in which persons have no legal basis to remain in the State, the Administrative Immigration Arrangements for the Protection of Victims of Trafficking provide for the granting of a 60 day recovery and reflection period.  This may be followed by a 6-month renewable temporary residence permission, where the trafficked person wishes to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other relevant authorities in any investigation or prosecution in relation to the alleged trafficking. </p><p>  Ireland's approach to the issue of Human Trafficking is further set out in the Second National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Human Trafficking in Ireland which was published in October 2016.</p></reply>

Having served 15 years in prison, he was released in 2007 in the context of a carefully structured and tightly controlled temporary release programme to live in the community under the supervision of the Probation Service, while subject to strict conditions and a schedule of weekly appointments in the prison.</p>  <p>  In December 2008, the application to travel to Egypt was communicated to the Irish Prison Service by the person&rsquo;s supervising Probation Officer in the community and was fully supported and recommended by the Probation Officer.  The application to travel was approved, which included a condition that all travel arrangements and comprehensive contact details while abroad be disclosed to the Irish Prison Service in advance of the travel date.  </p>  <p>  The granting of permission for a life sentenced prisoner to travel with family on a holiday is regarded as an essential step in the re-integration process, particularly in the context of resocialisation and normalisation.

Taking account of the situation in the Middle East, and the plight of the refugees, I announced that Ireland would accept 520 persons for resettlement over an 18-month period to the end of 2017.  This was almost double the figure proposed for Ireland by the European Commission and was delivered a year ahead of the Commission deadline.  In addition, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 520 refugees from Lebanon in  2017, most of whom are of Syrian origin.  260 refugees have already been selected during a selection mission to Lebanon in October 2016 and are expected to arrive in Spring 2017.  Most of these refugees are also Syrian.  A further selection mission to Lebanon will be arranged in the coming months to select the remaining refugees due to come to Ireland in 2017 under the resettlement programme.</p><p>In relation to the EU Relocation Programme, Ireland has to date taken in 241 people from Greece.  In November, IRPP officials travelled to Athens and interviewed a group of 84 people who once cleared for travel, are expected to arrive over the next two weeks.  An IRPP mission to interview 80 people took place in Athens from 12 &ndash; 16 December.  A further mission has already taken place in January which interviewed 61 people.  An IRPP team are currently on the ground in Athens interviewing another group of over 90 asylum seekers.  The intention thereafter is to sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its commitments to Greece within the time frame envisaged by the  Programme.<table><tr><th>Country</th><th>&lsquo;D&rsquo; join family visas refused for visa applicants<br /><br />2016</th><th>D&rsquo; join family visas refused for visa applicants<br /><br />2017 to date</th></tr><tr><td>Afghanistan</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Iraq </td><td>16</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Jordan </td><td>4</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Lebanon</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Syrian Arab Republic</td><td>24</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Turkey </td><td>5</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Yemen</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Legal proceedings in relation to a number of similar such applications are currently before the courts, and accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that I am somewhat limited in what I can say on the matter.  However, I can say that there has been an exponential increase in the number of such applications and with it increasing concerns around potential abuse of the Directive in relation to such cases.

Replacing the 3 penalty points with a 3-month disqualification is considered appropriate and proportionate in line with the other disqualification periods provided for in Section 29.  This option would allow for the continuation of the administrative option for penalising drink driving offences but would result in <i>all</i>drink driving offences under section 29 receiving a disqualification of 3 &ndash; 6 months.  I support Minister Ross's intention to amend section 29 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, which should assist us in ensuring more effective enforcement of road traffic offences and making our roads safer.  My Department will continue to assist the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport  in bringing these changes forward.</p></reply>

There are excellent relations at official and political level in relation to enhancing the operation of the Common Travel Area and we are committed to that continuing.  </p><p>In that regard, a central feature of the operation of the CTA has been that each State enforces the other's conditions of landing for non-EEA nationals, thus protecting each other's borders.  In addition, cooperation extends across a number of other areas including the sharing of information and at an operational level on enforcement.  For example, on the information front, earlier this year new arrangements to allow for the sharing of Advanced Passenger Information between Ireland and the UK in order to further enhance the integrity of the Common Travel Area were introduced.  The development of the British-Irish Visa System was facilitated by this arrangement and indeed could not have happened without the electronic sharing of information such as biometrics. </p><p>The practical impact of Brexit on the operation of the CTA is being considered between officials of the Department and the UK Home Office, including at meetings of the Common Travel Area Forum jointly chaired by the Director General of the INIS and his UK counterpart.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-15a.192.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021500084#WRF02500"><p>Since my appointment as Minister for Justice and Equality, I have overseen a significant programme of reform in Garda oversight and accountability. </p>  <p>  The establishment of the Policing Authority represents one of the most significant and progressive reforms to the justice sector over recent years and the recent transfer of the appointment function in relation to the senior ranks is a particularly important signal of this reform.  </p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) has a hugely important role in ensuring that public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is safeguarded.  I am committed to ensuring that we have in place the most effective possible mechanism for the investigation of complaints.  GSOC has been operating for 10 years now, and I believe it is time to examine fundamentally the legislative provisions relating to the manner in which complaints are made to and dealt with by GSOC.  Accordingly, it is my intention to seek Government approval to prepare Heads of a Bill to amend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to enable GSOC to carry out its functions more effectively and efficiently and help continue to ensure proper accountability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in providing a service to the public.</p>  <p>  The Garda Inspectorate performs a very valuable service in seeking to ensure that the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is maintained.  The Garda Inspectorate report 'Changing Policing in Ireland', published in December 2015, is a comprehensive report into all aspects of the administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Last July the Government approved my proposals for a Five Year Reform and High Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which combines the Government&rsquo;s response to the report of the Garda Inspectorate and the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government to increase the visibility, effectiveness and responsiveness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In this regard it sets out an overall vision of a Garda workforce of 21,000 comprising 15,000 Garda&iacute;, 2,000 Reserves and 4,000 civilians to be to be achieved incrementally over five years in tandem with the delivery of reforms.  The delivery of this overall vision is supported by the provision in Budget 2017 for the recruitment of 800 trainee Garda&iacute;, up to 500 additional civilian staff and 300 Reserves.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, published in June 2016, is the vehicle for the implementation of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s wide range of recommendations aimed at her organisation.  I have asked the Policing Authority to monitor implementation of these agreed recommendations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to report to me on progress on a quarterly basis. </p>  <p>  I believe the new Code of Ethics, prepared by the Policing Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in conjunction with a range of stakeholders, is an important milestone.  I also welcome the commitments in the Policing Plan 2017 to embed this Code into the day to day thinking and actions of the organisation. </p>  <p>  Both I and the Government are committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to provide a modern, efficient and accountable policing service and I have every confidence that the new structures which have been put in place are a significant contribution to that.</p></reply>

I am not aware of any taxis or hackneys dedicated solely to servicing the transport needs of the disabled i.e. all such vehicles also accept fares from able-bodied passengers.  </p>  <p>  Any tax concessions for this group of vehicles would inevitably lead to pressure for the extension of the relief, on competitive grounds, to all taxis and hackneys and this would be impossible to control.</p>  <p>  In this regard, it should be recognised that tax reliefs have proved at times to be a blunt, inflexible and expensive means of providing assistance and achieving policy aims which might be more effectively achieved through regulatory or direct expenditure means.  VRT on vehicles helps to broaden the tax base and provides an important source of Exchequer revenue.  I am regularly asked to introduce tax reliefs for one purpose or another, but to accede to all such requests would lead to an immediate narrowing of the tax base, therefore, I have no plans to reduce or eliminate VRT on taxis including those specially adapted for those with disabilities. </p></reply>

The 2013 Report on the Licensed Moneylending Industry published by the Central Bank showed that there were around 360,000 customers of licensed moneylenders with outstanding loan amounts in the region of &euro;200 million at that time.  I understand that it is the intention of the Central Bank to prioritise a review of the Moneylenders Code with a view to issuing a consultation paper on this in Q4 2017. </p>  <p>  The legislation does not prescribe a limit in respect of the number of loans a consumer can have with an individual licensed moneylender at any point in time.  Before entering into a loan a licensed moneylender has a statutory duty under Regulation 11 of the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements Regulations) 2010 to assess the creditworthiness of a consumer, using sufficient information.  In addition, the Moneylenders Code sets out a range of provisions in respect of a licensed moneylender's engagement with its consumers.  For example, the Moneylenders Code requires a licensed moneylender (a) to act fairly, with due skill and care, in the best interests of its consumers, (b) to disclose the high cost nature of loans by way of a prescribed "Warning" statement and (c) not to offer unsolicited pre-approved credit facilities.  The Moneylenders Code also sets out requirements in respect of how complaints should be handled and requires licensed moneylenders to notify consumers of their right to refer unresolved complaints to and provide the contact details of the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p></reply>

By law, financial institutions must ensure that information they hold or give to anyone else, including the Irish Credit Bureau, about an individual is correct and up to date.  A person who discovers errors in their credit report should ask the lender to correct these details.  If they are not satisfied with the actions of the lender and they fail to resolve the matter through the internal complaints mechanism, they could consider making a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO) about the lender.  The FSO does not deal with complaints about the Irish Credit Bureau.  Alternatively the matter could be referred to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.</p>  <p>  Steps are now under way for the establishment of a mandatory credit reporting system on a statutory basis.  The Credit Reporting Act 2013 provides that the Central Bank of Ireland shall establish, maintain and operate a statutory central credit register.  Under the Act there will be an onus on credit information providers to take reasonable steps to verify that the information it obtains from its customers for the purposes of the register is accurate and complete.  Also, in addition to the protections and rights available under the Data Protection Acts, borrowers will also have the right to obtain their credit report at any time and they will also be entitled to request the correction of any information on the register relating to them where it is inaccurate, incomplete or not up to date.  As previously indicated, the Central Credit Register is being implemented on a phased basis with phase 1 focusing on lending to consumers and phase 2 focusing on lending to businesses.  Data submission by lenders for phase 1 will commence after 30 June 2017.  </p>  <p>  I should also state that the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO) is independent in the performance of his statutory functions.</p>  <p>  However, I have been informed by the Financial Services Ombudsman that he has adopted a new model of Dispute Resolution since February 2016.  This new model involves considerably more interaction with the parties, particularly in terms of speaking with the parties at an early stage of the process and attempting to resolve their complaint through mediation.  I understand that this approach is delivering a faster, more efficient and effective service and that the majority of complaints are now being resolved through this means.  The Financial Services Ombudsman aims to complete 80% of complaints, resolved through mediation, within a 3 month period.  </p>  <p>  If a settlement is not reached through mediation, the complaint will be progressed to investigation and adjudication.  This is a more formal and lengthy process as all the evidence must be gathered, exchanged and considered in accordance with fair procedures.  The adjudication process is more formal than the dispute resolution process and will occasionally require an oral hearing where evidence is taken under oath.  The Ombudsman has informed me that the length of time taken to adjudicate will depend on the number of exchanges that take place between the parties.  Typically this can take about 4-6 months.  The Ombudsman's aim is to issue a finding within 3 months of when the exchanges between the parties are complete (in 90% of cases).</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-15a.236.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021500086#WRH00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 and 122 together.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive overhaul of the legal and regulatory framework in the financial sector has been pursued at both domestic and at an EU level since the financial crisis.  A whole raft of new European regulations have strengthened controls over the banking system and have resulted in an overhaul of regulation, supervision and resolution regimes. </p>  <p>  The Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation which came into force in 2014, brought about significant enhancements in the quality and quantity of capital that banks are required to hold and the setting of minimum liquidity requirements. </p>  <p>  The Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Single Resolution Mechanism have transformed the framework for dealing with failing banks and are designed to provide a financial safety net and a means for recovery and resolution with minimum disruption to the sovereign. </p>  <p>  The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is now responsible for the prudential supervision framework for euro area banks.  Building on the single rulebook, the SSM transfers key supervisory tasks for significant banks in the euro area to the European Central Bank.  Daily banking supervision is now conducted according to a detailed ECB supervisory manual including frequent and intrusive onsite inspections. </p>  <p>  This new regulatory framework is supported by the presence of new European institutions, such as the Single Resolution Board, to address weaknesses in the institutional structures and to improve cross-border cooperation, ensuring consistent enforcement of rules and systemic oversight. </p>  <p>  While the reform of our statutory code for the financial services sector has been and continues to be driven by comprehensive reforms brought forward at EU level, a number of significant domestic legislative reforms have been undertaken towards building a strengthened domestic regulatory framework for the financial services sector which complements the strategically important reforms at EU level. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 created a single fully-integrated Central Bank of Ireland with a unitary board, the Central Bank Commission, chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank.  The unitary Central Bank structure gives the Commission members a more complete remit over prudential regulation and financial stability issues.  The Central Bank has demonstrated its willingness to use its macro prudential, micro prudential and enforcement powers to strengthen capital and liquidity positions, business model resilience and governance arrangements of the banks operating in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 introduced a more assertive supervisory approach and overhauled the Central Banks powers across a wide range of areas and throughout the regulatory life cycle of firms.  It strengthened the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely assertive prudential interventions.  The Act also provided the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of financial services legislation in line with international best practice.</p>  <p>  The 2013 Act provides the Central Bank with early intervention powers including the power to issue directions to regulated entities and their related undertakings to address emerging problems, including where the entity has become or is likely to become unable to meet its obligations to its creditors or its customers, or where it is not maintaining or is unlikely to be in a position to maintain adequate capital or other financial resources.  </p>  <p>  The 2013 Act also gave the Central Bank extensive powers to make regulations including in relation to areas identified as weak points in the post crisis analysis such as risk management, consumer protection, audit processes and lending, including lending to 'restricted persons' such as those who work within the bank or family members.</p>  <p>  Measures have also been introduced to address cultural change and behaviour in banking.  In 2011, the new Fitness and Probity regime was rolled out by the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.  The regime provides for new powers to be exercised by the Central Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has put in place a pre-approval process for persons who apply for relevant positions, known as Pre-Approval Controlled Functions, in regulated firms, to ensure that they meet the required standards of fitness and probity.  If concerns arise that a person or persons in Controlled Functions in a regulated firm do not meet the required standards of fitness and probity, they may be investigated by the Central Bank and could ultimately be prohibited from carrying out a Controlled Function in their firm, or any other regulated firm.  These powers enable the Central Bank to ensure that the people in senior roles are capable, competent and act with integrity. </p>  <p>  The 2013 (Supervision and Enforcement) Act also provides that if, in the opinion of the Bank, a person has engaged, is engaging or is about to engage in a contravention the Bank may apply to the Court for an order restraining the person from engaging in the conduct. </p>  <p>  At present, a one year on report is being prepared for Minister of State Murphy on the findings and recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  This report will set out the actions taken to date in relation to the Committee's Report and whether further actions are necessary for consideration by Government and/or other bodies.</p></reply>

This included a number of changes to the framework that applies to bonus payments (including salaries and discretionary pension benefits) to staff of relevant institutions.  The aim of these changes is to prevent a re-emergence of the issues we have seen in the past of short-term targets being the focus of institutions due to the remuneration policies implemented for staff resulting in significant risk taking.</p><p>The Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV) introduced a remuneration framework to deal with excessive risk taking. </p><p>The framework includes a number of criteria to prevent a return to the excesses of the past.  These include requirements on individuals within a relevant entity whose professional activities have a material impact on their risk profile, known as 'material risk takers'. </p><p>These material risk takers include senior management, risk takers, staff engaged in control functions and any employee receiving total remuneration that takes them into the same remuneration bracket as senior management and risk takers</p><p>The remuneration paid to these material risk takers must consist of the following structure:</p><p>- a substantial portion, and in any event at least 50%, of any variable remuneration should consist of equity-linked or other non-cash instruments;</p><p>- a substantial portion of the variable remuneration component, and in any event at least 40% to 60% (the latter in the case of a variable remuneration component of &quot;a particularly high amount&quot;) should be deferred over a period of not less than three to five years;</p><p>- the variable component of the total remuneration shall not exceed 100% of the fixed component of the total remuneration of material risk takers;</p><p>- shareholders, owners or members of the institution, acting by a qualified majority can approve a higher maximum level of the variable component provided that this level does not exceed 200% of the fixed component of the total remuneration; and</p><p>- the relevant competent authority in Ireland, the Central Bank of Ireland are to be informed of recommendations to shareholders and of the result of any shareholder vote, which shall not conflict with institutions' obligations to maintain a sound capital base.</p><p>- In addition the regulatory regime requires greater transparency on bonuses paid by banks with disclosure requirements relating to the number of individuals earning over &euro;1 million per annum. </p><p>The introduction of the framework in 2014 and enforced by the relevant competent authorities across Europe is designed to ensure the excessive risk taking culture and short term focus on targets seen prior to 2008 is not repeated.  This is being achieved by the framework outlined above on the structure of bonus payments by the relevant institutions and the increased disclosure requirements as introduced under CRD IV.</p></reply>

I have said before that open market competition represents the best method of driving better rates, offers and choice in financial services for customers.  This can be fuelled both by competition between existing lenders and that introduced by new entrants.  In this regard, as part of a range of competition measures agreed with the European Commission under their respective EU-Restructuring plans AIB and Permanent TSB are required to provide funding to a public awareness campaign (such campaign to be facilitated by Ireland through an appropriate state body) to raise awareness and promote customer switching.  As such my Department is currently managing a contract for the provision of the first phase of a public awareness campaign which is due to go live on a variety of media channels in Q1 2017.  This is being funded in its entirety by the two banks. </p>  <p>  In addition, we must be careful that we do not deter new entrants from coming in, meaning that, ultimately, consumers have less choice and will end up paying a higher price or, worse, having no access to credit at any price. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that initiatives to improve competition in the market have already been introduced, such as the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  The SBCI continues to make low cost, flexible finance available to SMEs across all sectors of the economy and all regions of the Country.  To the end of September 2016, over 10,600 SMEs, operating across all business and economic sectors of the Irish economy, have benefited from &euro;458 million of SBCI loans.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government also sets out a number of important and practical measures which can be taken to improve the position of variable rate mortgage holders.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has been asked to work with the Central Bank to set out options for Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and to improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.  This work has commenced and draft options are expected to be available for discussion within the coming months.  In addition, the Central Bank has commenced a programme of research into switching in the mortgage market which will, inter alia, inform its consideration of the need for a mortgage switching code. </p>  <p>  On the subject of competition in this sector, the Deputy will be aware that I welcomed the announcement on 9 February that KBC Group had carried out a strategic review of the bank's operations in Ireland and confirmed its long standing commitment of almost 40 years to the Irish market.  I understand that Ireland will be designated as one of the group's core markets, alongside Belgium, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary.  The Bank said that it will pursue a "fully-fledged sustainable growth strategy based on implementation of a 'Digital First' customer-centric strategy."  It is worth highlighting that KBC Bank Ireland has 15 branches and provides important competition in the Irish domestic banking market.  KBC said that it believes that "Ireland is a sound and attractive market which presents opportunities and in which we wish to play a more active role".  I welcome this independent acknowledgement of the progress made under this Government.  The bank also referred to "significant improvements in cost competitiveness in recent years, a stronger trend in domestic spending augmented by favourable demographics, a supportive fiscal stance and a favourable borrowing environment" in explaining its reasons for remaining in Ireland. </p>  <p>  This is another strong sign of the recovery in Ireland and shows confidence by KBC Ireland in the Irish economy.  The fact that KBC is committed to remaining in Ireland ensures continuing competition in the Irish banking market which is good for consumers.  Such commitment is also a mark of the recovering market and of its continuing growth potential into the future.</p></reply>

As a result, as the Deputy is aware, I introduced a provision in Finance Act 2016 that enables me to exclude by Ministerial Order any specified agricultural sector where the business structures or models employed result in a systematic excess of flat-rate addition payments over input costs borne by flat-rate farmers within that sector.  </p></reply>

This effort is being led by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in conjunction with Ministers and officials from other Departments, as well as the Local Authorities and a range of other stakeholders.</p>  <p>  A variety of actions included in this plan aim to assist in improving rural towns and making rural Ireland a better place to live.  These include the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, under which funding of up to &euro;12 million per annum is available to revitalise rural towns and villages, while there is also a commitment to develop and pilot an initiative to encourage increased residential occupancy in town and village centres.</p>  <p>  There are currently no specific tax incentive schemes for the refurbishment and upgrading of buildings in town centres or villages.  EU State Aid rules make it difficult to introduce tax reliefs that target specific geographic areas while excluding others.  In this regard, the Deputy may be aware of the difficulties that my Department encountered in obtaining state aid approval from the European Commission for the Living City initiative.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) provides for an income tax credit for homeowners or landlords of residential property, who carry out repair, renovation or improvement works on their property.  It provides for tax relief by way of an income tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure. Qualifying work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 (including VAT).  The maximum qualifying cost for the purpose of the incentive is (&euro;30,000 including VAT), which equates to a maximum tax credit of &euro;4,050.  The tax credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is paid for.  The Deputy may be aware that I extended the scheme for a further two years in the recent Budget.</p></reply>

There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity.</p>  <p>  Each ETB will then prepare a report for the Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.</p>  <p>  In the subsequent implementation phase, where the level of demand for multi-denominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that.  There will be a role for the existing patron/landowner in consulting with local community and school interests and taking into account proposals from different prospective multi-denominational patrons.  It is envisaged that transfers will largely be by way of voluntary transfer of live schools by existing patrons.</p>  <p>  This new process for supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families is based around principles of transparency and cooperation.  Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, both with the ETBs&rsquo; in the initial phase to establish evidence of demand by consulting pre-school parents and subsequently through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body.  In that process, the existing patron will also take into account proposals from all prospective multi-denominational patrons that wish to be considered.  I would urge all parties to engage in this process constructively, with a view to reaching solutions to meet parental preferences.</p>  <p>  In addition to progressing the reconfiguration of existing school provision to provide greater choice to parents nationwide, the Government is committed to ensuring that parental preferences will continue to be key to patronage decisions on new schools established in areas of demographic growth.  When it is decided that a new school is required to meet demographic needs in an area, my Department runs a separate patronage process to decide who will operate the school.  It is open to all patrons and prospective patrons to apply for patronage of the school under this process and the level of parental preference for each patron in addition to the extent of diversity already in the area, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process.</p></reply>

My Department is currently assessing the applications received.  This assessment stage involves very detailed work, including geo-coding each parental preference received to establish if they represent a parent of a child living in the school planning area the school is set up to serve.  Following completion of this detailed analysis, my Department will prepare detailed assessment reports in relation to each of these new schools based on the applications received.  These will then be submitted to the New Schools Establishment Group for their consideration.  Following completion of Group's work, they will submit a report with recommendations to me for my consideration and final decision.</p>  <p>  As with other school planning areas nationwide, the demographic data for the Dublin 6 area is being kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated child benefit data and updated enrolment data and also the impact of ongoing and planned capacity increases in these, and adjoining, school planning areas.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that I recently announced new plans aimed at providing more multi-denominational and non-denominational schools across the country, in line with the choices of families and school communities and the Programme for Government commitment in this area.</p>  <p>  This will involve the Education and Training Boards in the initial phase, as the State&rsquo;s local education authorities, identifying areas where there is likely to be demand for greater diversity and they will work with pre-school services to establish evidence of this demand among the cohort of pre-school parents.

The matter was discussed by the Oireachtas Committee for Children and Youth Affairs on 25th January 2017.  My Department will of course consider any findings or recommendations the Committee may make on this matter.</p>  <p>  My Department issued circulars to all primary and post-primary schools in 2005 to highlight the potential health hazard of overweight schoolbags and to outline a range of local measures that could be put in place to help alleviate the problem.</p>  <p>  The report of the Working Group on the Weight of School Bags, commissioned in 1997, recognised that many of the solutions to this issue belong at local school level and made various recommendations in this regard, such as optimum use of storage facilities, developing pupil organisation skills and timetabling.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that positive action has been taken by many schools on these issues.  Actions consist of a range of measures, including the provision of lockers and in the case of second level school the arrangement of the timetable into double class periods, active liaison with parents and the co-ordination of homework by subject teachers.</p>  <p>  Ultimately it is a matter for each individual school to determine which particular measures are most suited to its individual circumstances and to how the school concerned organises teaching and learning.</p>  <p>  The use of digital resources by teachers and students in schools is increasing.  While conventional textbooks are still widely used, a number of schools have introduced or are considering introducing e-books and other digital resources to enhance students' work in school and at home.  Schools can use the book grant scheme to purchase a range of digital resources relevant to the curriculum.</p>  <p>  It should be also be noted that Scoilnet.ie, the Department funded website, supports Primary and Post-Primary teachers in sharing and finding useful resources for the classroom, including the Britannica School website, and other valuable online content and resources to assist in teaching and learning.</p>  <p>  On 5 December 2016, I published the General Scheme of an Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill 2016.  The Government have approved the draft outline of a new law, which will require every school to consult with parents and students, and publish and operate a Parent and Student Charter.</p>  <p>  The publication of this draft legislation will fulfil a key commitment in the Action Plan for Education to improve information and complaint procedures for parents and students relating schools.</p>  <p>  The draft legislation defines the principles that will guide how schools will engage with students and parents.  Some of the issues which schools will be required to deal with under the charter include:</p>  <p>- Inviting feedback from students and parents and</p>  <p>- Providing better information about School Management and School Policies.</p>  <p>  Following consultation with our education partners, including the National Parents Council (Primary), National Parents Council (Post Primary) and the Irish Second-level Students Union, I will finalise national guidelines on a Parent and Student Charter.</p>  <p>  The draft Bill will now go to the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p></reply>

I am in favour of leaving the decisions on what is offered to the discretion of the school, and of students having as broad a range of options to choose from as possible.</p>  <p>  Because the total number of full subjects which can be done for assessment in junior cycle is ten, it is likely that schools will retain most or all of their current subjects in their junior cycle.</p>  <p>  Currently, over 90% of students choose History, although it is compulsory only in voluntary secondary schools, not much more than half our post-primary schools.  Curriculum choice is important in motivating students to learn and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle.</p>  <p>  Schools across all sectors offer History. History teachers attract students to their subject through their own love and passion for History, and by engaging the natural curiosity of their students in, for example, the lives of people, the origins of the modern world and in objects and documents from the past.  History is generally the 5th most popular subject in the Junior Certificate examination.</p>  <p>  I have every confidence that, through the implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle the place of History will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum.  A new specification for Junior Cycle History is being developed by the NCCA.  This involved extensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public, which finished recently, during which over 200 submissions were received.  The new specification will be available for implementation in all schools from September 2018.</p>  <p>  The Leaving Certificate History syllabus attracts about 25% of the total cohort of students.  The aim is to make the new specification for Junior Cycle History more attractive, so young people can see it as a realistic option, rather than focusing on learning content by heart.  Many people believe that uptake in senior cycle could be improved if the junior cycle History was made more attractive, more relevant and perhaps less of a race against time.</p>  <p>  In the new Framework for Junior Cycle, all schools are expected to provide opportunities for students to achieve 24 statements of learning over the period of junior cycle.  These statements include valuing local, national and international heritage and understanding the importance of the relationship between past and current events, the forces that drive change, and understanding the origins and impacts of social, economic and environmental aspects of the world around them.  Even where students do not take History as a full subject, it is to be hoped that opportunities to achieve such statements through other forms of historical study can be provided to them.</p>  <p>  The minimum time allocated for subjects such as History will be 200 hours over the three years of junior cycle, or the equivalent of three 40-minute periods per week over three years.  For many schools, this will lead to an increased time provision for History as a subject, and it will no longer be nominally linked to Geography as previously.</p>  <p>  This new minimum time stipulation for History as a subject should allow not only for a deepening of a student's historical knowledge but also of his or her ability to analyse, interpret, write and develop historical skills more thoroughly.

SCPA is utilised, in the main, where as yet unfilled vacancies exist in NEPS staffing provision locally or where staffing resource is lost through extended leave (maternity, sick or carer&rsquo;s leave).</p>  <p>  For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, there follows a list of schools in Dublin who currently derive this service through the above-mentioned SCPA scheme rather than through a NEPS psychologist.  In the case of these schools, NEPs psychologists may no longer be assigned to those schools as a result of retirement, resignation or transfer to another NEPs region.</p>  <p>  The Public Appointments Service (PAS) maintain regional recruitment panels of qualified personnel to fill these vacancies.  During 2016, despite my Department's best efforts the panels did not produce recruits for NEPS in relation to all vacancies, the panels were therefore closed.</p>  <p>  A new national recruitment competition was put in place last Autumn by PAS to fill all vacancies within all NEPS Regions.  The resulting interview process associated with this competition was recently completed and recruitment panels for each NEPS region, including Dublin, will now be formed.  PAS will finalise the processing of the candidates, including Garda vetting, and propose each candidate in series to my Department Human Resources Section for contract negotiations and formal job offer.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the process will produce new NEPS psychologists for assignment to schools, including that to which the Deputy refers in his question, by the end of the current academic year.</p>  <p>  However it is important to point out that in cases where NEPS service is not available through staffing vacancy or temporary absence of staff, as described above, the schools affected continue to have access to a psychologist through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments to undertake pupil assessment work.</p>  <p>  I would also confirm that all schools are able to access full NEP supports in the event of a critical incident irrespective of their having ongoing access to an assigned NEPS psychologist or not.</p></reply>

These schools include a new primary school which will open in September 2017 to serve the area of Dublin to which the Deputy refers.</p>  <p>  When it is decided that a new school is required to meet demographic needs in an area, a separate patronage process is conducted to decide who will operate the school.  It is open to all patrons and prospective patrons to apply for patronage of a school under this process.  Parental preferences for each patron and for Irish-medium or English-medium provision, together with the extent of diversity currently available in the area, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.</p>  <p>  The patronage process for the four primary schools is ongoing.  The closing date for receipt of applications was 6th January last and my Department is currently assessing the applications received.  This assessment stage involves very detailed work, including geo-coding each parental preference received to establish if they represent a parent of a child living in the school planning area the school is set up to serve.  Following completion of this detailed analysis, my Department will prepare detailed assessment reports in relation to each of these new schools based on the applications received.  These will then be submitted to the New Schools Establishment Group for their consideration.  Following completion of Group's work, they will submit a report with recommendations to me for my consideration and final decision.</p></reply>

The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2013 and 2015 as set out in Section 3 of the Circular applies to all other teachers employed in such schools.  The circular is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and can be accessed at:</p><p>In addition, a comprehensive FAQ document is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website:</p><p>As is the norm with public service collective agreements, the Lansdowne Road Agreement was negotiated with trade unions which are recognised as representing staff in the public service (including teachers).  It is normal practice in the public service that the decision of the trade union recognised as holding representative rights for a particular grade or sector will determine the position for all relevant staff in that grade/sector.  This context does not allow for acceptance or rejection of collective agreements by staff on an individual basis.</p><p>Accordingly, there is no proposal at this time to treat teachers separately based on the fact that they are not a member of a trade union.  However, since the announcement of the ASTI ballot result my Department has received a number of queries from both ASTI members and teachers who are not members of a trade union about union membership.  Therefore, having regard to the circumstances of the dispute with the ASTI, this is an issue that I will keep under review going forward.</p></reply>

Special classes are for students who have a recommendation for a special class placement in their professional reports.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support students with Special Educational Needs, including Autism.

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. </p>  <p>  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally.  It currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 27 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools.</p>  <p>  The staffing arrangements includes the provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolment for the following September.  In the current school year, three developing posts were provisionally sanctioned to the school referred to by the Deputy.  The enrolment achieved by the school on 30 September 2016 was sufficient to retain two of these posts.  The school submitted a staffing appeal to the October 2016 meeting of the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.  This appeal was refused on the basis that the grounds of the appeal did not warrant the allocation of an additional post under the terms of the published staffing arrangements.  The Primary Staffing Appeals Board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final.</p>  <p>  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.  Depending on the circumstances of the school, e.g. fluctuating enrolment, accommodation available, there may be a variation in the size of the classes in the school.  School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any one class is kept as low as possible, taking into account all of the above factors.   </p>  <p>  Given that the staffing schedule operates to a general average of one classroom teacher for every 27 pupils, if a school has a large class it generally also has a small class.</p></reply>

Part V units are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme to ensure that units delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time. </p><p>My Department does not hold information on the number of households that have applied to purchase Part V housing through the tenant purchase scheme.

Higgins.  A public artwork that responded to the historical heritage of the Museum and incorporated the text of Pearse's last poem, 'The Wayfarer', was also unveiled on this date.  Carved on 21 pieces of Donegal sandstone and laid along a circular path, the poem now forms a centrepiece in the Walled Garden.</p><p>South Dublin County Council has carried out improvement works on Grange Road and Sarah Curran avenue comprising traffic calming, provision of cycle facilities, footpath upgrade, design of open space with new pedestrian and cyclist entrance into the park and the installation of a sculpture.</p><p>Follies within the park have been restored over the past 3 years.

It applied in the same way from that time to all new pensions awarded up to end-February 2012, which was the expiry date of a &quot;grace period&quot; during which the 2010 public service salary cuts were not reflected in new-award pension calculations.  The PSPR table applying to all of these pensions, as commenced on 1 January 2011 was as follows:<table><tr><th>Annualised amount of public service pension</th><th>Reduction</th></tr><tr><td>Up to &euro;12,000</td><td>Exempt</td></tr><tr><td>Any amount over &euro;12,000 but not over &euro;24,000</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>Any amount over &euro;24,000 but not over &euro;60,000</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>Any amount over &euro;60,000  </td><td>12%</td></tr></table>  </p><p>On 1 January 2012 an adjustment affecting a very small number of pensions was introduced by way of a new top rate of PSPR, of 20%, applied to that portion on any PSPR-affected pension in excess of &euro;100,000.</p><p>On 1 July 2013, additional PSPR-based pension cuts were imposed as part of the further retrenchments of public service pay and pensions legislated under FEMPI 2013.  These additional cuts were confined to higher-value pensions, defined as those with a pre-PSPR value exceeding, at least, &euro;32,500, and were implemented in two ways.</p><p>First, the existing PSPR rates, which applied to qualifying pensions awarded up to up to end-February 2012, the &quot;grace period&quot; expiry date, were increased for all pensions with pre-PSPR values above &euro;34,132.</p><p>Second, post-February 2012-awarded pensions greater than &euro;32,500, which up to then had been exempt from PSPR, were subjected to a new group-specific PSPR rate regime, featuring lower rates than those applied to earlier-awarded pensions.  The low-rate regime in respect of these pensions reflected the fact that, unlike earlier-awarded pensions, those pensions reflected actual rather than grace period-protected salary rates.</p><p>These 2013 changes effectively instituted three separate PSPR rate tables, differentiated by pension size relative to a threshold value, and by date of pension award.  Commencing 1 January 2016, PSPR as applied by reference to these three tables is being significantly reversed in three stages under FEMPI 2015.  This reversal is proceeding in three stages over the 2016 to 2018 period as follows:</p><p>On 1 January 2016, increases in the annual pension thresholds for PSPR application were activated.  These exemption threshold increases fully removed PSPR from a significant number of pensions with relatively lower values, while those pensions which continued to be impacted by PSPR received a boost of &euro;400 per year.</p><p>On 1 January 2017, additional PSPR amelioration, acting principally via further exemption threshold increases, fully removed PSPR from another significant tranche of public service pensioners, while at the same time boosting those pensions which remain affected by PSPR, in most cases, by up to &euro;500 per year.</p><p>On 1 January 2018, the third phase of PSPR amelioration will ensure that all PSPR-impacted pensions with values up to &euro;34,132 will be fully restored, meaning that PSPR will no longer affect such pensions, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR will get a boost of, in most cases, &euro;780 per year.</p><p>Over the 2016-2018 implementation period of these FEMPI 2015 PSPR changes, the PSPR exemption threshold will progressively expand as follows: In 2016, all pensions up to &euro;18,700 were exempt from PSPR; from 1 January 2017, all pensions below &euro;26,000 are now exempt from PSPR; and from 1 January 2018 all pensions up to &euro;34,132 will be exempt from PSPR.</p><p>This means that, when fully rolled-out from 1 January 2018, these PSPR amelioration steps will ensure that most public service pensioners are not affected by PSPR.  All public service pensions with pre-PSPR values of up to &euro;34,132 will be fully exempt from PSPR from then on, while those pensioners not fully removed from the reach of PSPR will, in the majority of cases, benefit by &euro;1,680 per year.  The cost of these changes is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018.</p><p>In the past, the ocupational pensions received by public service pensioners were generally adjusted in line with changes in the wages or salary of the pensioner's grade at retirement.  Sometime referred to as &quot;pay parity&quot;, this non-statutory linkage lapsed in 2010 when pensions were left unchanged notwithstanding salary cuts at the beginning of that year affecting all public servants.  This pension protection, albeit tempered from 2011 in some cases by the imposition of PSPR, has worked to the benefit of pensioners, as indeed have the &quot;grace periods&quot; in respect of new-award pensions which accompanied the public service salary cuts in 2010 and 2013.  PSPR is also being reduced at a faster pace and to a greater degree than the ameliorisation of the pay reductions.</p><p>In light of these developments, the issue of how to adjust the post-award value of public service pensions through appropriate pay or other linkages will be considered by Government in due course.</p></reply>

This will focus on boosting cultural provision and participation in communities and harnessing the goodwill and engagement generated by the 2016 commemorative programme.</p><p>The core proposition of this programme is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal well-being and achievement. The programme is based on five pillars:</p><p>-  Enabling the creative potential of every child</p><p>-  Enabling creativity in every community</p><p>-  Investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure</p><p>-  Establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production</p><p>-  Unifying our global reputation</p><p>The aim of Pillar 1 of the Creative Ireland Programme is to enable the creative potential of every child.  The Department of Education and Skills and Arts Council will be key partners in implementing this pillar.  My Department has commenced discussions with that Department and the Arts Council on the delivery mechanisms for this pillar and it is intended that a national plan will be in place by the end of 2017.</p><p>The second pillar &ndash; Enabling creativity in every community &ndash; will be implemented primarily through our local authorities.  This is because local authorities are the primary instruments of community engagement and second, local authorities have a particular capacity for local programme delivery, especially in the context of citizen engagement. </p><p>I have asked local authorities to establish a Culture Team bringing together arts officers, librarians, heritage officers, museum curators, archivists and other relevant personnel which will be led by a Director of Services, with a nominated person as 'Creative Ireland Co-ordinator'.  The primary role of the Culture Team will be to develop a Culture and Creativity Plan, reflecting the overall structure and aims of the national strategy programme, and then to drive public participation in creative cultural activity in each local authority area.</p><p>I have made a specific allocation of &euro;1 million to the local authorities towards the implementation of the 2017 Creative Ireland Plans out of the overall funding of &euro;5m which I secured in Budget 2017 to underpin this new initiative.  I am currently considering the overall allocations under the Creative Ireland Programme and will make further announcements in this regard in due course.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The Scheme was amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 which increased the level of asset contribution from 5% to 7.5% per annum.  This applied to new entrants to the Scheme after the enactment of the amendment and was required in order to ensure the sustainability of the Scheme in light of the increasing population of older people in Ireland.  There are no plans to change the level of asset contribution back to 5% per annum.</p>  <p>  A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  It is important to note that a person's principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the three year cap.  The Scheme has a number of other important safeguards built into the financial assessment which ensures that:</p>  <p>  - Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care;</p>  <p>  - An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his/her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater.  This is in recognition of the fact that, although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing;</p>  <p>  - If an applicant has a spouse/partner remaining at home, he/she will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;</p>  <p>  - If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;</p>  <p>  - Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account for the financial assessment, including health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence;</p>  <p>  - A person&rsquo;s eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drug Payment Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or residence in a nursing home.</p>  <p>  In addition to these safeguards, where an applicant&rsquo;s assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate.  This is known as the Nursing Home Loan (Ancillary State Support), the purpose of which is to ensure that a person does not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care.  A nursing home resident can apply for this deferral at any stage.</p>  <p>  When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  A number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including recommendations relating to the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  This work is currently underway and the IFA has made a submission in this context to the Interdepartmental Group which is overseeing the implementation of certain recommendations contained in the Review.  The proposals put forward by the IFA are currently being considered.  Once all of the relevant Review recommendations have been considered, any amendments required to the Scheme will be identified.</p></reply>

The State Claims Agency has confirmed to my officials that the growth in related activity and costs around maternity and other related claims is in line with the maturity of the Scheme.  Separately the actual cost of claims resolved year on year is related to the actual number of claims that are resolved and the number of those that are resolved on a Periodic Payment Order basis versus a lump sum basis.  Because of the high value of a proportion of clinical claims, a small number of such claims in any one year can significantly impact the total spend.</p><p>In respect of the settlement of claims it is difficult to accurately predict whether each claim will be settled or adjourned, and when settled, whether settlement will be by means of a Period Payment Order or a lump sum.  More stability will be introduced into the claims system when the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill, which will legislate for Periodic Payment Orders, is enacted in the coming months, as this will encourage the settlement of all catastrophic injury claims through Periodic Payment Orders.</p><p>In reply to question No 45 of 1 February last I had noted that 13 cerebral palsy cases in which Periodic Payment Orders (PPO) were agreed between 2010 and 2013 were returned to Court on subsequent returnable Court dates.  Because PPO legislation was not enacted some cases settled as lump sums instead of continuing as PPOs.</p><p>In relation to the actuarial predictions for maternity damages cases from 2006 to 2013 inclusive, the State Claims Agency has informed my officials that it first sought a separate actuarial estimate/prediction for these damages for the year 2009, as the Scheme had matured sufficiently at that time such that actuaries could generate such estimates/predictions.  This was also the first time that the estimate/prediction exceeded &euro;50m.  The figures for the years in question are as follows:<table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Actuarial Estimated Spend - &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>106</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>128</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>154</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Strategy is a cross cutting area of public policy and service delivery, which requires a coordinated response to tackling the drug problem, involving the statutory, community and voluntary sectors. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to putting a new drugs strategy in place this year.  A Steering Committee has been established to advise me on a new strategy with a view to developing an integrated public health approach to substance misuse, which is defined as the harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illegal drugs.  </p>  <p>  While the format of the new Strategy has not yet been agreed by the Steering Committee, the Strategy will be based on a health-led approach to the drug problem and build on progress achieved under previous drug strategies.  Significant progress has been made in developing the evidence-base for the new Strategy.  This includes a review of systematic evidence reviews of various interventions to tackle the drug problem.  The Steering Committee will consider the various issues highlighted in the evidence review, including harm reduction measures such as drug testing.  The nature of such an initiative would require further investigation and elaboration.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the Steering Committee is continuing with its deliberations and is expected to submit its final report to me by the end of March.  I hope to be in a position to bring my proposals to Government on the new Strategy thereafter.</p></reply>

The NTPF published waiting list figures provide an up-to-date and verified picture of patients actively waiting for a date for Inpatient/Daycase and Outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  In 2014 the NTPF guidance to hospitals regarding waiting list management advised that hospitals needed to keep a record of patients pre-admission and awaiting planned procedures.  The NTPF has been in a position to provide to my Department Pre-Admit patients data since 2011 and Planned Procedures data since 2014.</p>  <p>  Indeed, the NTPF regularly reviews its process to ensure best practice and it is currently commissioning a research project examining updated international best practise around publication models and methodologies.  I look forward to this work being concluded and to any action arising from its recommendations being taken.</p>  <p>  Last Thursday I committed to asking the NTPF to work towards the publication of the Pre-Admit and Planned Procedures Waiting Lists.  In this regard, the NTPF will review and advise on clinically appropriate time bands for these two different categories of patients.</p>  <p>  Finally, last week, I also announced that the NTPF will audit the practices in the hospitals highlighted by the individual cases featured in the RTE documentary.</p></reply>

Some 6,300 farmers received an allocation of entitlements under the 2015 National Reserve.  There was no National Reserve in 2016 as all available funding had been utilised under the 2015 scheme.  In order to provide for a National Reserve in 2017 funding is required to replenish the Reserve.  EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that funding for the replenishment of the National Reserve may be obtained by means of surrender of entitlements that remain unused by farmers for two consecutive years and by claw-back derived following the sale of entitlements without land.  It is envisaged that funding derived from these two sources in 2017 will be very limited.  The Regulations also provide for the application of a linear cut to the value of all farmers&rsquo; entitlements to replenish the National Reserve.  Under the National Reserve priority access for an allocation of entitlements is given to the two mandatory categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo;.  </p>  <p>  Consultation between Department officials and the Direct Payments Advisory Committee, comprising members of the main farming organisations and advisory bodies, takes place annually as part of the decision making process for the National Reserve.  Decisions relating to the availability of a 2017 National Reserve can only be made following determination of available funding and the consultation process involving the Direct Payments Advisory Committee.  The consultation process in relation to the National Reserve in 2017 has commenced and decisions relating to the availability of a 2017 National Reserve will made following the conclusion of the consultation process and the determination of available funding.</p></reply>

It also covers important biological aspects of land based salmon production.  The Report states that its main aim is to assess the viability of land based salmon production in RAS under Irish conditions.  This includes detailed information of capital expenditure and operational costs as well as the market situation for salmon.  The report concludes that the capital cost of setting up a large scale RAS unit is very high and that there are still technical difficulties to be overcome to achieve reliability in land based facilities.</p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme, a new Aquaculture &lsquo;Knowledge Gateway Scheme&rsquo; was launched in 2016.  I have provided BIM with a budget of &euro;8.2 million for that Scheme over the course of the Programme.  In close collaboration with aquaculture enterprises and researchers, the Scheme aims to develop knowledge, innovation and technology in the aquaculture sector to ensure its sustainable development.  An important part of the focus of the Scheme will be the applied research and development on RAS identified in the National Strategic Plan.  This may take the form of applied research undertaken by BIM on behalf of the sector, but BIM will also welcome applications from universities or other public research institutions.  </p>  <p>  To incentivise the establishment of RAS aquaculture enterprises, I recently increased grant rates for RAS projects under the EMFF Sustainable Aquaculture Scheme to the maximum possible 50% rate.  The Scheme supports the capital cost of establishing, modernising and improving aquaculture sites.  This 50% support rate recognises the higher capital costs associated with RAS developments and can greatly assist in enhancing the viability of such enterprises.</p></reply>

One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers.  The Scheme, which was developed in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), makes &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%. </p>  <p>  Distributed through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, the Scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.  I can confirm that the loans are for amounts up to &euro;150,000 for up to six years.  The loans are flexible with interest only facilities of up to three years.  However normal lending criteria apply and the terms and conditions of each individual loan is agreed between the financial institutions and the applicants according to their individual circumstances. </p>  <p>  For information, the Credit Review Office provides an independent review process for SMEs, sole traders and farm enterprises that have had requests for credit refused or had existing credit facilities reduced or withdrawn.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services has not been fully demonstrated.</p><p>This commitment by Government to deliver the NBP has also served as a catalyst for industry in bringing forward investment in new infrastructure in towns, villages and rural areas of Ireland.  Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband  from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>The Broadband Intervention Strategy sets out a detailed service specification that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of at least 30 megabits per second download and 6 megabits upload to all citizens, be capable of providing for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with consumer demand and ensure the availability of high quality wholesale services to allow retail competition to develop.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered. </p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process.</p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Donegal.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to Based on information provided by commercial operators and represented on our broadband map, coverage in this area is mixed.  65% of the area of Lisfannon Business Park in Lisfannon, Buncrana, Co Donegal falls within the BLUE area i.e. within the commercial operator(s) coverage area.  The remaining 35%, falls within the AMBER area and will be covered by the State Intervention.</p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  My Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.</p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. </p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>Insofar as the issue of cost is concerned, this network will be made available to service providers on a wholesale basis and it is the intention that the wholesale prices for comparable services within the intervention area will be no more than the average published wholesale prices that prevail in other more competitive areas of the country or, in the absence of such published prices, prices already set or approved by the Regulator, ComReg.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.</p><p>In this regard, I and Minister Humphreys established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce in July 2016.  The findings of this Taskforce recommends practical actions that can be taken to remove barriers to and improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland.  The Taskforce report is available at the following link: . </p><p>Minister Humphreys has established two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services.  Since July, there has been significant progress made in discussions with the key stakeholders including local authority management representation, Government Departments and State agencies, as well as interaction with ComReg and telecoms operators.</p><p>I have signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with the allocation of spectrum in the 3.6GHz band, in early 2017.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.  </p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p></reply>

I therefore have no statutory authority to regulate charges or ComReg in the exercise of its independent regulatory functions.</p>  <p>  However, I have asked ComReg to provide comment on the Deputy's question. </p>  <p>  Calls made within the EU account for the vast majority of roaming calls made by Irish mobile customers.  Prices for calls made within the EU are capped under EU Regulation 2015/2120.  Those caps will be reduced even further from 15 June 2017 with the introduction of EU Roam Like At Home rules.  The EU market is fully regulated. </p>  <p>  ComReg estimates that non-EU roaming accounts for less than 3% of all roaming calls made by Irish mobile customers.  The average surcharge applied to Irish customers in this context in 2016 was &euro;0.98 per minute.  This average price is a function of commercial agreements which individual EU-based mobile operators have with non-EU based mobile operators.  Such international commercial agreements occur in an unregulated market.  The overall EU average is &euro;0.69, however this EU overall average encompasses a range of charges, including for example, surcharges as high as &euro;2.10 per minute for Malta-based customers and &euro;0.24 for Lithuania-based customers when roaming outside the EU.</p>  <p>  The collection of this type of data for monitoring purposes by ComReg and other EU National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) is a requirement of the current EU roaming regulations.  The Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) of which ComReg is a member, coordinates the regular collection of that data across all EU member states, on the basis of self-reporting by individual operators to each NRA.</p></reply>

In order to avail of the small public service vehicle rate of tax, which at &euro;95 annually is a concessionary rate, the owner is required to submit a current public service vehicle licence when applying for a motor tax disc.  The public service vehicle licence is a paper based process and consequently it is currently not possible to facilitate the taxing of small public service vehicles through the online motor tax service.</p>  <p>  In this regard, as custodians of the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) and the online motor tax infrastructure, my Department is continuing to work closely with the National Transport Authority, who are the regulatory authority for the licensing and regulation of small public service vehicles, with a view to enabling these vehicles be taxed online.</p></reply>

The implications of the current insurance difficulties faced by those in the taxi sector are of concern to me and the Government.</p>  <p>  The Working Group established last year by the Minister for Finance to review the factors which are influencing the increase in cost of motor insurance considered issues raised by particular sectors including taxi drivers in relation to both the availability and cost of SPSV insurance.</p>  <p>  In its Report, published by the Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan TD and Minister of State for Financial Services, Eoghan Murphy TD on 10 January 2017, the Working Group states that the starting point for its consideration of the issues in relation to the overall motor insurance area, including the taxi sector, is that it is not possible for it to make recommendations on pricing as this is primarily a commercial matter for insurers.  The Working Group indicated to all stakeholders throughout the process, that there is no immediate solution to the issue.  However, the Working Group believes that the implementation of the Report's 33 recommendations and 71 associated actions will lead to greater stability in the pricing of motor insurance and will help prevent the volatility that we have seen in the market in the past (both up and down) and should also better facilitate potential new entrants to the market.</p>  <p>  My Department, together with the appropriate bodies, will work towards implementing the recommendations in the Report that are relevant to the taxi industry within the required timelines.</p></reply>

Specifically that Act places a duty on employers to ensure as far as reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare of their employees.  This duty includes the assessment of the risks at that place of work and the implementation of the necessary controls to minimise these risks so that the safety and health of the employees is ensured.  The duties also include, amongst other things, the provision of information, instruction, training and supervision necessary to ensure as far as reasonably practicable the safety, health and welfare at work of his or her employees.  There is a further requirement for the employer to have regard to the general principles of prevention, including the provision of appropriate personal protective equipment where risks cannot be avoided, eliminated at source or controlled through collective protective measures.</p>  <p>  Section 2 (5) of the 2005 Act, states that for the purposes of the relevant statutory provisions, a person who is training for employment or receiving work experience, other than when present at a course of study in a university, school or college, shall be deemed to be an employee of the person whose undertaking (whether carried on by him or her for profit or not) is for the time being the immediate provider to that person of training or work experience, and &ldquo;employee&rdquo;, &ldquo;employer&rdquo; and cognate words and expressions shall be read accordingly.  The 2005 Act does not place any restrictions on those who are training at work but requires as indicated in section 2(5) that they there must be regarded as employees and therefore the relevant duties of an employer apply.</p>  <p>  The provisions of the Act apply to all places of work and there are no plans to reduce this coverage</p></reply>

The core objective of the Plan is, through the delivery of 90 collaborative actions, to increase employment in the region by 10-15% to 2020, resulting in the delivery of 66,000 additional jobs to the region in that period.  The first Progress Report was published last December and reflects the good work made to date, with an implementation rate of 94%.</p><p>South West Dublin is part of the Dublin Regional Enterprise Strategy which was developed by the four local authorities of the Dublin region.  This Strategy builds on the work of the Dublin Action Plan for Jobs and provides a coherent and coordinated approach to promoting enterprise, employment and entrepreneurial activities in the Dublin region for 2017-2019.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland-supported companies in Dublin employ 70,365 people including 7,579 new jobs created in 2016.</p><p>In 2016, projects and initiatives supported by Enterprise Ireland in the constituency of Dublin South West include:</p><p><b>Supporting Innovation</b>: Enterprise Ireland, in partnership with the Institutes of Technology, has established a nationwide network of <b>15 Technology Gateways</b>one of which is the MiCRA Gateway in Institute of Technology Tallaght.  This Gateway provides solutions for companies in the in-vitro diagnostics, environmental, food and pharmaceutical sectors.</p><p><b>Supporting Start-Ups</b>: In 2016 Enterprise Ireland awarded four Competitive Start Funds to new start-up companies based in Dublin South West.  In addition, five companies of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s High Potential Class of 2016 came from South Dublin. </p><p><b>Fostering Entrepreneurship</b>: Thirteen entrepreneurs participated on the New Frontiers Programme in IT Tallaght in 2016.  Three of the companies emerging from this programme became Enterprise Ireland clients.  In addition, the Student Enterprise Awards, co-funded by Enterprise Ireland, is run annually in the Institute of Technology Synergy Centre Tallaght.</p><p><b>Driving Regional Enterprise Development</b>: The South Dublin LEO, collaborating with the other Dublin LEOs received funding under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Competitive LEO Funding Scheme, for a project targeted at the Dublin food producer cohort and focuses on the creation of an online video education platform to enhance knowledge, improve skill sets and develop producer competencies.</p><p>In 2016, IDA Ireland supported companies in Dublin employed 82,622 people.  Within this, 9,000 new jobs were created.</p><p><b>Foreign Direct Investment</b>: There is an increasing trend of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) locating in larger urban areas.  Dublin is an international-scale city and, as such, has a key role in attracting investment.  It is critical that the planning and development of Ireland&rsquo;s capital city creates a world-class urban area that continues to attract not only international investment but also international talent.</p><p>Currently, IDA positions Dublin and the Mid East in the market place as an investment location with a strong ecosystem of both indigenous and multinational companies operating across a diverse range of sectors.  Complimentary to and supporting this footprint of export orientated enterprise is the large educated population of talent available to companies, physical, educational and digital infrastructure and a business environment that is competitive and fit for purpose.</p><p>Dublin is now an internationally renowned cluster for Technology and Financial Services companies but is also home to a number of other companies such as the large Life Sciences such as Pfizer, Takeda, Amgen and Bristol Myers Squibb all of whom leverage the abundance of infrastructure and utilities available in the capital to run their operations.  Dublin as an investment location will always be the key economic driver for the East of the country. </p></reply>

These individuals are outstanding in their fields of expertise and have also made significant contributions to developing the research ecosystem in Ireland or have demonstrably assisted researchers in Ireland in either academia or industry.

Higher Education Institutes accounted for &euro;198 million or, 59% of the total. Companies won &euro;104 million or, 31%, with &euro;74 million of this going to SMEs.  This result indicates that Ireland is on track to achieve its national target of securing &euro;1.25 billion over the lifetime of Horizon 2020.</p>  <p>  The full implications of the UK vote to leave the EU for the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation have yet to be determined. Exit negotiations will not commence until Article 50 has been triggered by the UK and will probably take the maximum allowed period of two years to complete.  Given that the UK Government has committed to triggering Article 50 during March, the earliest likely departure date for the UK is March 2019.  There will be no change in the situation regarding the UK&rsquo;s entitlement to participate in Horizon 2020 during that period.  This point has been confirmed by the EU Commissioner for Research and Innovation, Carlos Moedas. </p>  <p>  In August 2016 the UK Government announced that the UK Treasury will underwrite the payment of EU funding to all UK organisations bidding for Horizon 2020 projects while the UK is still a member of the EU, even when specific projects continue beyond the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU.  This guarantee provides a measure of certainty both to UK applicants and their prospective partners in other member states.</p>  <p>  Ireland's international collaborative links in Horizon 2020 are well diversified across the EU: only 13% of Ireland's collaborative links are with the UK.  In addition, less than 5% of the funding won to date has come from UK led projects.  Therefore, Ireland does not have a critical reliance on the UK as a partner in Horizon 2020 in order to secure funding.</p>  <p>  In the light of these considerations, it is unlikely that the UK's departure from the EU will have a significant impact on Ireland&rsquo;s success in securing funding from Horizon 2020.</p></reply>

SFI co-funds with Wellcome, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), and the Royal Society and more recently has agreed collaborative arrangements with the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Centre (EPSRC).  SFI also fosters collaborations between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the US through the US-Ireland Partnership programme.  This programme invites researchers in Ireland, Northern Ireland and the US to work together on research projects that are then co-funded by SFI and the Health Research Board in Ireland, the Dept. of the Economy in Northern Ireland and the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation in the US.  These collaborative arrangements are bilateral/trilateral and are, therefore, not impacted by Brexit.  A key objective for SFI is to strengthen its research funding partnerships including with the UK with the goal of supporting further and stronger scientific collaboration.  This will help to ensure that the Irish research community is well-positioned for all post Brexit scenarios. Funding from SFI for pre-existing awards is not impacted by Brexit.</p></reply>

This is a key commitment for my Department in the Programme for Government and also makes a contribution towards the Government&rsquo;s broader commitment to continue to strive for full inclusion of LGBT people in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Better Outcomes Brighter Futures, The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014 &ndash; 2020 and The National Youth Strategy 2015 &ndash; 2020 provide a framework within which the National LGBT Youth Strategy will be developed with a focus on appropriate measures to ensure that young people identifying as LGBT are supported in achieving their full potential.  The LGBT Youth Strategy will build on the National Youth Strategy (2015) which aims to enable all young people to realise their maximum potential by respecting their rights, hearing their voices and addressing their concerns. </p>  <p>  The five national outcomes that we want for all our children and young people are that they: </p>  <p>- Are active and healthy, with positive physical and mental well-being.</p>  <p>- Are achieving their full potential in all areas of learning and development.</p>  <p>- Are safe and protected from harm.</p>  <p>- Have economic security and opportunity.</p>  <p>- Are connected, respected and contributing to their world</p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy identifies Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender young people as a specific group to be considered in the context of focused provision for marginalised young people; the National LGBT Youth Strategy will identify the additional measures that are required to ensure that young people identifying as LGBT can achieve the same outcomes as all children and young people.</p>  <p>  In December 2016 I announced the establishment of an Oversight Committee with an Independent Chair.  The LGBT Youth Strategy Oversight Committee met for the first time earlier this month in my Department.  The Committee is comprised of officials from relevant departments and agencies along with stakeholders from the LGBT community and headed by an Independent Chair.  This includes representatives from various government departments, Tusla, Sport Ireland, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, BeLonG To, the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network and the Transgender Equality Network Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is important to me that the voices and the experiences of young people are front and centre in forming the strategy &ndash; and a consultation will be a key part of the work.  The strategy will be informed by youth and stakeholder consultation, situation analysis to include review of current policy, strategy and service provision and relevant existing data.</p>  <p>  The consultations will target young people, both those identifying as LGBT and those not in order to ensure the voice of young people is respected and contributes to this strategy.  The consultations will also seek to include those working with young people on a regular basis and the general population at large.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to ensure that the consultation process and completion of the strategy are progressed in a timely fashion throughout 2017. </p></reply>

I will be providing, for the first time, an additional payment for providers at the end of the ECCE year to take account of the administrative work they are required to complete - some providers refer to this as 'non-contact time'.  This will be equivalent to seven days' ECCE payment at the peak (post-April) enrolment.  I will also be providing a similar payment to providers of the CCS and other targeted childcare schemes.  &euro;14.5million is provided for these payments.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, I have secured funding for Capital projects for Early Years and after-school childcare provision.

Tusla is putting in place a project office and increasing the number of staff on this team.  The additional staff will include a senior social work practitioner, social workers and social care staff.  I understand that Tusla is examining how best to manage the required psychological support for the young people, including the recruitment of a psychologist into the team.  I have been assured that residential accommodation being sourced will be homely in nature and in line with national standards.  </p>  <p>  I have committed to making sure that this service is properly resourced, and that the high standard of the current service continues.  The estimates of the cost involved will be kept under review as the situation evolves.  I am closely monitoring the emerging situation to ensure this humanitarian effort will be successful. </p>  <p>  Tusla's most recent estimate is that an additional &euro;8 million in a full year will be required to expand the Separated Children Seeking Asylum team.  The estimate is likely to be reviewed as more information about the individual needs of the young people become known.  The therapeutic needs can only be determined once the children have been assessed after arriving here.  The estimated legal costs will depend on the complexity of the care order that is required and may be an overestimate overall.  As the children will arrive on a phased basis it is expected that the cost in 2017 will be considerably less than &euro;8 million. </p></reply>

Air transport for these patients is currently provided in three ways: Air Corps fixed-wing and rotor-wing aircraft; Irish Coast Guard rotor-wing aircraft; and private air ambulance providers.  </p>  <p>  As one of the components of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps contributes to all roles assigned by Government including responsibilities relating to the provision of Aid to the Civil Power and maritime security tasks.  Like other elements of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps also undertakes other roles in accordance with agreed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).   </p>  <p>  In this context, the Department of Defence has an SLA with the Department of Health and the HSE for the Air Corps to use its fleet of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to transport patients and medical teams between hospitals within Ireland and abroad, on an as available basis.  In accordance with the SLA, this availability is dependent upon the availability of suitable aircraft, the availability of flying crews and the suitability of weather conditions.  The terms of the SLA do not provide for the Air Corps to deliver a dedicated, 24/7 transport service. </p>  <p>  This approach was maintained in the White Paper on Defence (2015) which stated that the Air Corps will continue to provide an emergency inter-hospital transfer service in support of the HSE on an as available basis.  This means that fixed or rotary wing aircraft are not required to be on standby for this purpose.  However, if such aircraft and personnel are available when requested for a mission, they can be deployed.   </p>  <p>  I can confirm that the level of availability of Air Corps aircraft for inter-hospital transfer tasks has reduced.  This is largely because the Air Corp has experienced retirements of highly experienced personnel which is outstripping the recruitment and training of replacement personnel.  This has led to a shortage of experienced pilots which has reduced the number of available flying crews.  Due to these crew shortages, aircraft availability for the inter-hospital air ambulance service is reduced. </p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to address the H.R. challenges for the Defence Forces.  In the case of the Air Corps, there are 28 cadets, in 3 classes, undergoing the various stages of the Air Corps cadetship to become pilots. In addition, targeted recruitment will continue in 2017.  A new NCO promotion competition, to fill the ranks of Sergeants and above, including those in the Air Corps, has been launched.  Promotions from this competition will commence in Q3 2017.   </p>  <p>  My officials will continue to keep the Department of Health and the HSE fully informed of the situation in the Air Corps.  The Department of Health, the HSE, the Department of Defence and other key stakeholders are working together to optimise availability of air transport within current arrangements and to identify longer term options.</p></reply>

The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve, is underpinned by an analysis of training needed to meet operational output requirements and capability development needs.  A long term strategy is adopted with current planning horizons out to 2021.  In addition the White Paper on Defence sets out a developmental path for the Reserve and confirms that the primary role of the Reserve is to augment the PDF in crisis situations.</p><p>For the current year, Subhead A.5 provides for a budget of &euro;2.15 million in 2017 of which &euro;2.068 million is allocated for a total of 26,000 Paid Training Mandays for members of the Reserve. Of this figure, 25,250 Mandays will provide a minimum of seven (7) days annual paid training for all effective members of the Reserve.  It will also provided for fourteen (14) days paid training for all additional personnel recruited to the Reserve in 2017 and provide for career and specialist courses for selected members of the Reserve in line with Reserve priorities.  This provision is sufficient having regard to the existing strength of the RDF and the voluntary nature of Reserve training.  The remaining 750 Mandays are allocated to provide for Reserve Defence Force Representative Association (RDFRA) business.</p><p>In order to facilitate the voluntary nature of Reserve Service, training continues to be organised both in and out of normal working hours and at weekends.  Reserve training is also organised during academic and traditional holiday periods, in order to maximise attendance of Reserve personnel. </p><p><font color="#001401">  In the Army Reserve, recruits undergo varied training in areas such as combat first aid, military law and tactical training.  A major part of Recruit training is training in the Steyr 5.56mm Assault Rifle.  After recruit training is complete, personnel are then trained in the operation of basic radio communications, map reading, Nuclear, Biological &amp;amp; Chemical warfare defence and the Light Machine Gun. Each Corps also carries out specialist training in its particular field.  For example, the Infantry and Cavalry Corps train in weapons and tactics and the Corps of Engineers train in engineering tasks, such as demolition, construction and mine warfare.</font><font color="#001401"> </font></p><p><font color="#001401">  In the Naval Service Reserve, the two main courses undertaken as a recruit are Sea Survival and Damage Control &amp;amp; Fire Fighting. NSR personnel also undergo training in the operation of various crafts operated by the Naval Service, such as Motor Training Launches and Rigid Inflatable Boats.  As in the Army Reserve, NSR personnel are trained in the use of the Steyr 5.56mm Assault Rifle.  NSR personnel also receive full training in VHF Radios, including voice procedure at sea and operation of the VHF systems.  Courses are also run for NSR personnel on the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System.</font><font color="#001401"> </font></p><p>I am satisfied that the extensive and professional training provide to the RDF is a key motivating factor which will encourage more people to join it. </p></reply>

Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.</p><p>The Defence Forces retains a wide range of specialist skills which can be deployed in such circumstances, including for terrorist incidents.  The Operations Directorate in Defence Forces Headquarters manages the necessary cross-service coordination in responding to both emergency and security issues.  These arrangements have proved effective in all emergencies encountered to date.  There is ongoing and close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters, including ATCP deployments and a wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies.  Regular coordination and liaison meetings also take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues. </p><p>The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment are available for deployment in response to any security and other emergencies that may arise.  Within the Defence Forces, both the Ordnance Corps and the Army Ranger Wing specialise in providing an immediate response to emergency incidents that might require their highly specialised capabilities. </p><p>  The Ordnance Corps consists of a number of Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams which are on standby 24/7 to respond when a request for assistance is received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with suspect devices. </p><p>  The Army Ranger Wing is an integral unit of the Defence Forces whose roles include provision of specialist ATCP support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The need for a high level of preparedness to deal with any requests for Special Forces operations is inherent in the unit&rsquo;s mission.  Members are trained to the highest levels of motivation, physical fitness and skill at arms for their specialist role.  The ARW is on standby 24/7 to be called upon to undertake duties in any part of the country. </p><p>  I can confirm that the Defence Forces keep their operational plans and response capabilities for dealing with a wide range of threats under constant review.  It is my priority as Minister with responsibility for Defence to ensure that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible. </p></reply>
