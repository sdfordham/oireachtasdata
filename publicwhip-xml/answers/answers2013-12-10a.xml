I am also aware of calls for the Government to consider granting such status in the context of international conventions to which Ireland is a party.  I have, against that background, previously undertaken  to give serious consideration to the issue.</p><p>  Travellers, of course, have the same civil and political rights as other citizens under the Constitution.  Moreover, the key anti-discrimination measures, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977, the Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Acts specifically identify Travellers by name as a group which are protected.  The Equality Act 2004, which transposed the EU Racial Equality Directive, applied all the protections of that Directive across all of the nine grounds contained in the legislation, including the Traveller community ground.  All the protections afforded to ethnic minorities in EU directives apply to Travellers because the Irish legislation giving effect to those EU directives explicitly protects Travellers.</p><p>  The commitment I made to give the issue of recognising Travellers as an ethnic minority further consideration led to a Conference on the subject of Ethnicity and Travellers: An Exploration being convened by the National Traveller Monitoring and Advisory Committee with support from my Department in September 2012.  That  Conference provided an opportunity for various aspects of the issue of ethnicity to be discussed and built on earlier discussions within the framework of National Traveller Monitoring and Advisory Committee on the issue.  That Committee, as the Deputy will be aware, brings together all of the national Traveller organisations as well as senior officials from relevant Government Departments including officials from my own Department.   The report from that Conference now forms part of the ongoing consideration of the issue.</p><p>  My Department has in parallel been engaging with other Government Departments on the issue by way of the identifying any possible implications arising from the recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group.  Those consultations are continuing  and I expect them to be brought to a conclusion shortly.  Those consultations will ensure that I have a full analysis of all aspects of granting of ethnic status to Travellers in framing any proposals on the matter that I may wish to bring to Government.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-10a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121000052#WRB00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 83, 96 and 351 together.</p><p>  Under the Solicitors Acts 1954 to 2011 the Law Society is the designated authority responsible for the regulation of the solicitors' profession in the State.  As part of that function, particularly under Part IV of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994 dealing with the 'Protection of Clients', the Law Society is obliged to continue to maintain and administer the Solicitors Compensation Fund.  Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Law Society that any client of a solicitor has sustained loss in consequence of fraud or dishonesty on the part of that solicitor or any clerk or servant of that solicitor arising from that solicitor's practice as a solicitor within the jurisdiction of the State, then, subject to the relevant provisions, the Society is required to make a grant to that client out of the Compensation Fund.  It is also provided that before a practising certificate can be issued to a solicitor, the solicitor in question must have paid the annual contribution to the Fund and the issuing of a practising certificate can be withheld until the payment has been made.</p><p>  As such, the Compensation Fund and its attendant inspection procedures under which, I am informed, around 400 inspections were carried out by the Law Society last year, provide an important protection against acts of fraud and dishonesty that may be perpetrated by solicitors in the handling of clients' monies.  As Deputies will be aware, the Fund has been relied upon in a number of high profile cases in recent times.  In the five years of 2008 to 2012, I am advised  the Fund paid out a total of &euro;17.7 million in claims.  The total in claims actually made for that same period was nearly &euro;48 million.  There was a 9% increase in the 266 claims made against the Compensation Fund in 2012 over the previous year's 244 claims though this remains much less than the peak of 672 claims received in 2008.  The net assets of the Solicitors Compensation Fund were valued at &euro;18 million as at 30th June 2013.  In the six months up to that date 165 claims on the Fund were received which, excluding invalid claims refused, amounted to &euro;1.16 million. The annual contribution to the Fund for 2013 is &euro;760 per solicitor.  Annual insurance cover for &euro;50 million with an excess of &euro;5 million is also in place.</p><p>  Under the Compensation Fund structures provided for under the Solicitors Acts, the Law Society is, therefore, able to respond immediately to serious financial complaints and has the right to carry out investigations, without notification, where justified by the circumstances.  The Society can also apply to the High Court for orders to protect clients' funds when serious irregularities arise.  Pay-outs by the Compensation Fund have a serious impact, including in terms of ongoing costs, across its entire solicitor membership.  To that extent, the Fund has a capacity to strongly incentivise financial compliance by solicitors in the public interest while simultaneously avoiding the imposition of an undesirable burden on the State or public resources.  It should also be borne in mind that, following the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, the Law Society is  required to investigate compliance with anti-laundering regulations.</p><p>  Against this background, I would consider it prohibitive for the State to assume the enormous and ongoing liabilities that may arise directly or indirectly from the acts of fraudulent solicitors or the operation of the Solicitors' Compensation Fund.  It would not be in the public interest to carry potential liabilities for solicitors' fraud of tens of millions of euro that would, under such an arrangement, have to be paid indefinitely out of the public purse.  However, while it is my considered view that the Law Society should retain responsibility for the Solicitors Compensation Fund, I am happy to report that, under the Legal Services Regulation Bill which is at Committee Stage, any matters of professional misconduct or discipline that may arise from cases of solicitors' fraud or dishonesty are, in the future, to be dealt with independently under the aegis of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority and the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal.</p></reply>

The Garda Ombudsman Commission has a hugely important role in ensuring that public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is safeguarded, and has extensive powers under the 2005 Act to enable it to carry out its responsibilities.</p><p>  With regard to the case for additional powers, I have already said that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has extensive powers, including full police powers of investigation, these include powers relating to, for example, entry and search of any place pursuant to a warrant, arrest with or without a warrant, search of a person, detention and questioning, taking fingerprints, issuing a summons and bringing of a charge against a person.</p><p>  Both the Commissioner and the Chairperson agreed on the need for the highest possible level of co-operation between the two organisations.  Revised protocols were agreed and signed by the Chairperson of the Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Commissioner on the 23rd September 2013.  These revised protocols put in place clear procedures for the timely sharing of information and more generally for enhanced co-operation.  The new protocols will support the Ombudsman Commission in carrying out investigations in the most effective and timely manner possible, to the benefit of both complainants and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na alike.  They also reflect the commitment of the Garda Commissioner to the full co-operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in these investigations.</p><p>  As I have previously advised this House, I convened a meeting  with the Garda Commissioner and the Chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission on 23 July last to discuss the need for enhanced co-operation between the two bodies to ensure the effective and efficient investigation of allegations of Garda misconduct.  I also informed the House in my earlier replies that I have established a committee chaired by a senior official of my Department, with senior representatives from the Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to act as a forum where any future emerging issues concerning the protocols can be identified and appropriately addressed.</p></reply>

The teachers' salaries are funded by the Department of Education and Skills who provide an allocation of 220 whole-time teacher equivalents.  Literacy, numeracy and general basic education provision is the priority and broad programmes of education are made available which generally follow an adult education approach.  Programmes are adapted to take account of the diversity of the prisoner population and the complex nature of prison life. Junior and Leaving Certificate courses are available.  FETAC accreditation is widely used with assessment by portfolio compilation.</p><p>  Courses and programmes offered can be broadly categorised as follows:<blockquote><b>- Basic Education - </b>including literacy, numeracy, English as a second language and communications; <br /><br /><b>- Creative Arts -</b> notably music, sound recording and production, drama, art, craft, stone work, creative writing, film production and photography. <br /><br /><b>- Technology -</b> including woodwork, woodcarving, metalwork, computer-aided design, information technology and horticulture; <br /><br /><b>- General Subjects -</b> incorporating history, languages, geography, home economics and English literature; <br /><br /><b>- Life Skills -</b> personal development, interpersonal skills, anger management, parenting, child care, addiction studies, driver theory, food hygiene, etc. <br /><br /><b>- Healthy Living</b><b>-</b> notably physical education, sports, fitness and recreational activities, health education, diet and nutrition.</blockquote>  The following table illustrates the amounts spent each year for the past seven years on the education of prisoners.  It is notable that the funding allocated to this area has been retained over the last 3 years (including the current year), despite the general budget cuts applied across the Prison Vote.  Budgets for 2014 are yet to be set.<table><tr><th>All Figures in &euro;Million</th><th>Educational Services</th></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>1.474</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>1.800</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>1.694</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>1.320</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>1.457</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1.240</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1.234</td></tr></table></p><p>An average of 38.8% of the prison population attended educational classes in 2012, the last full year for which figures are available.</p></reply>

The report complements the report prepared by Assistant Commissioner John O'Mahoney of his examination into the allegations of irregularities in the operation of the Fixed Charge Processing System.  These two reports recommended a number of changes aimed at ensuring that tighter administrative procedures are correctly followed throughout the Force in relation to the cancellation of fixed charge notices.  The report from the Professional Standards Unit did not, however, include a specific recommendation for any separate investigation of the type referred to in the Deputy's question.</p><p>  As I have previously advised, the two reports were published on my Department's website on 15 May 2013.  In publishing the reports, I welcomed their recommendations for enhanced safeguards to ensure integrity in the Fixed Charge Processing System.  In addition, in order to provide even further public reassurance as to the effectiveness of these changes, and with the agreement of the Garda Commissioner, I asked the independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to review the recommendations, to make any necessary supplementary recommendations, and to then review their implementation after 18 months.  The Inspectorate is making progress with this work and I expect to receive their report shortly.  The Inspectorate's assessment of the recommendations contained in the two reports, and any further recommendations in this area which the Inspectorate feels are warranted, will be put in the public domain via the Inspectorate's website.</p><p>  A revised Fixed Charge Processing User Manual and Procedures must await the report of the Garda Inspectorate as it will be necessary to take account of any recommendations from that source.  In the meantime the Garda Commissioner issued a directive on 30 August 2013 with revised cancellation procedures in relation to Fixed Charge Notices to all members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This directive instructed that the cancellation functionality was to be centralised to the Fixed Charge Processing Office in Thurles.  Accordingly all cancellations are now executed using the Fixed Charge Processing Office computer system and as a result the comment box on Pulse is no longer used when cancelling notices.  I also provided the two reports to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for their consideration and for advice on any further recommendations or procedural or legislative changes which are desirable in this area.  I have also consulted with my colleague the Minster for Transport in this matter.</p><p>  I am absolutely committed, as is the Commissioner, to the introduction of whatever improvements are necessary to ensure continuing public confidence in the fairness and integrity of the implementation of road traffic laws by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

I sought the observations of the Garda Commissioner on the report and its recommendations.  The Garda Commissioner's observations pointed out the many changes which had been made to the system for the management and use of Garda Covert Human Intelligence Sources in recent years.  These changes had been put in place following the report of the Morris Tribunal.  As such, many of the recommendations were already incorporated into Garda procedures, including improved training for Garda&iacute;, the development of an electronic system for maintaining records, placing emphasis on the necessity for Garda&iacute; to comply with professional standards, and strict procedures for handling and disseminating intelligence as well as coordination between specialist units.  The Commissioner also emphasised that informants are clearly instructed that they may not commit crimes or act as <i>agents provocateur.</i></p><p>  With regard to oversight, the Commissioner pointed out that, under the Garda Code of Practice for the management and use of Covert Human Intelligence Sources, robust internal auditing has been put in place together with independent external oversight by a retired Judge of the High Court.  Following the receipt of the Ombudsman Commission's report I published the most recent such report by the Judge and gave a commitment to publish future reports.  More generally, and as I have previously advised this House, I convened a meeting  with the Garda Commissioner and the Chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission on 23 July last to discuss the need for enhanced co-operation between the organisations to ensure the effective and efficient investigation of allegations of Garda misconduct.</p><p>  Both the Commissioner and the Chairperson agreed on the need for the highest possible level of co-operation between the two organisations.  Revised protocols were agreed and signed by the Chairperson of the Garda Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Commissioner on the 23rd September 2013.  These revised protocols put in place clear procedures for the timely sharing of information, including sensitive information and access to Pulse, and more generally for enhanced co-operation.  I also previously informed the House that I have established a committee chaired by a senior official of my Department, with senior representatives from the Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to act as a forum where any future emerging issues concerning the protocols can be identified and appropriately addressed.</p></reply>

For example, his 10th Recommendation was that the provision in Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 allowing for a person to be appointed to act in the best interest of the vulnerable person should be extended to women who benefit under the ex gratia scheme.  It has been decided that it would be more appropriate to introduce a specific provision in a separate piece of legislation unrelated to the 2009 Act to address the intent behind this recommendation.</p><p>  I am not in a position to say at this stage what date legislation will be introduced to provide enhanced medical services.  My officials are engaging with the Department of Health to facilitate early introduction of appropriate legislation.  Mr Justice Quirke recommended that payments provided under the ex gratia scheme should be tax free but the Deputy is correct in drawing attention to the fact that he did not make any recommendation regarding existing payments outside the scheme.  This matter is being addressed by section 77 of the Finance (No.2) Bill 2013 as amended in the Select Committee on Finance.</p><p>  Judge Quirke recommended dialogue at political level with the UK authorities to clarify whether payments under the ex gratia scheme would be disregarded in the context of either tax or means tested benefits.  Nearly 20% of applicants reside in the UK.  We have some knowledge of the situation in the UK and we have entered into a dialogue with the UK authorities on the matter.  Judge Quirke recommended that the same should apply to women living in other jurisdictions.  About 2-3% of applicants reside outside Ireland and the UK.  Notwithstanding the very small numbers, I am open to considering entering a dialogue as regards these other jurisdictions but there are complications because of lack of information on how such payments may be treated and the fact that some involve federal states where responsibility for taxation and benefits may be split.</p></reply>

At that time there were approximately 22,000 applications awaiting decision, many of which had been waiting for 3 years or longer.  Notwithstanding the significant increase of almost 60% in the volume of valid applications received - from 12,500 in 2010 to just under 20,000 in 2012 - some 68,000 decisions on valid naturalisation applications have been made since I came into office.  In the past year I have decided over 30,000 applications and issued certificates of naturalisation to some 28,000 applicants.  Quite clearly, this has also resulted in a huge reduction in processing times, with over 70% of standard applications now being decided within 5 months.  This is a major reform given the 115% increase in valid application levels since 2008, when processing times were more than 4 times longer.  At present, there are approximately 8,500 applications pending a decision.  It is my intention that we will continue to build on this success in 2014 and to further reduce the time taken to reach a decision for most applications.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, as well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is also a major step for the State as it confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State, but also at European Union level.  It is therefore vital that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b> All applications are processed with a view to establishing whether the applicants meet the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation, such as good character and lawful residence, and are submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.  In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p><p>  This successful tackling of the backlog of citizenship applications has no direct impact on the direct provision system as persons in direct provision have not yet had their protection applications determined.  If a person is successful in a protection application, he or she may apply for a certificate of naturalisation when they are in a position to meet the statutory residency requirements.  It is my objective to speed up the protection determination process to the greatest possible extent, consistent with natural justice and asylum law, to keep the number of persons housed in this system as low as humanly possible.</p><p>  In conclusion, the Deputy may wish to note that the greater majority of successful naturalisation applicants are not asylum seekers and in fact are migrants who came to Ireland for work and other related reasons.</p></reply>

This declaration is separate from any declaration required under the provisions of Ethics in Public Office Act 1995.  Where, during the course of the year covered by the declaration, a conflict of interest not previously declared arises, members and staff must submit a revised declaration which should include details of the interest.  In this way the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission are in a position to act promptly in relation to any conflicts of interest which may arise.</p><p>  The Protocols agreed and signed by the Chairperson of the Garda Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Commissioner on the 23rd September 2013 contain general principles governing the appointment of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as Investigating Officers which are aimed at avoiding any conflict of interest which may prejudice the outcome of a case.  It seems to me that there are sufficient safeguards in place to deal with situations where a conflict of interest may arise, but of course the legislative provisions relating to the Ombudsman Commission are kept under general review.</p></reply>

In view of the fact that Garda Richard Fallon was carrying out his duties as a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, his murder was also a direct attack on the institutions of this State.</p><p>  The Serious Review Crime Team of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is carrying out a review of this case.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Serious Review Crime Team have met with members of the Fallon family, most recently in April this year, to update them on developments in their inquiries.

They are not accountable to the Minister for Justice and Equality for their performance of this statutory function.</p><p>  The activities of revenue sheriffs in discharging this function are governed by a Code of Practice which is published on the web site of the Revenue Commissioners (www.revenue.ie).  The Code contains provisions governing contact between the revenue sheriff and taxpayers, as well as a procedure for handling taxpayer complaints.  Under the Code, revenue sheriffs are required to investigate written complaints and respond as promptly as is practicable in the circumstances.  A written appeal against such a response may be lodged with the Revenue Commissioners and the Commissioners may request the revenue sheriff to carry out a review of his or her decision.  Where, following this review, the matter has not been resolved, the complaint may be referred to the Joint Standing Committee (JSC) of the Revenue Commissioners and the Sheriffs' Association for further review.</p><p>  As I stated in responses to earlier Questions from the Deputy on this matter, revenue sheriffs are subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.  This means, for example, that appropriate security measures must be taken against unauthorised access to, or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal data coming into his or her possession.  Where computer equipment containing personal data has been seized by the revenue sheriff, such data should be returned under secure conditions to the person from whom the equipment was seized unless there is a legitimate reason for non-return of the data.  Such reasons could, of course, vary depending on the specific circumstances of the case.</p><p>  I should add that enforcement of the data protection legislation is a matter for the Data Protection Commissioner.  Any complaints in relation to alleged breaches of the legislation may therefore be referred to the Commissioner for independent investigation.</p></reply>

Naturally, issues related to the victims of crime and of troubles-related incidents feature in our discussions.  The House will be aware that there is one very particular group of victims created over the course of the conflict in Northern Ireland.  There were a number of people abducted and murdered by paramilitary groups, and then buried in secret locations.  They have become known as "the Disappeared".</p><p>  The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains was established by the Irish and British Governments in 1999 as one of the actions taken in the context of the Peace Process to acknowledge and address the suffering of the victims of violence as a necessary element of reconciliation.  Its purpose is to facilitate the location of the remains of the Disappeared in order that they may be returned to their families to receive a decent burial and that the families will then have a grave at which to grieve and to remember.  These families have suffered a very particular cruelty in not only having to bear the tragedy of murder, but having been denied for so long information regarding the burial places of their loved ones.</p><p>  Previously, the then Minister of State for Northern Ireland, Hugo Swire MP, and I met with the Commission and with the group of victims' families and heard of their suffering and their concerns at first hand.  I pay tribute to the families' dignity and fortitude in the face of their suffering.  Once again, I extend my deepest sympathy to them on their loss and assure them of my continuing support for their efforts to recover their loved ones.  The Taoiseach met with the families and the Commission in July and he also assured them of the Government's continued support for them and its commitment to this humanitarian process.</p><p>  The Commission, with the continuing support of the two Governments, has worked tirelessly over the years in pursuit of its task and it continues to so do.  On the occasion of the National Missing Persons' Day event at Farmleigh last week, I met with Commissioner Frank Murray and he provided me with an update on the Commission's ongoing work.  He emphasised to me once again that the Commission is continuing its inquiries in relation to the seven persons on the Commission's list whose remains have not yet been located but that the Commission requires further information to progress its efforts.</p><p>  I am sure Deputies will join with me in encouraging anyone with information that could help to locate those still missing to give that information to the Commission without delay.  Information about the Commission and how to contact it are available on the Commission's website &ndash; www.iclvr.ie.  I would emphasise that all information provided to the Commission will be treated as strictly confidential and can only be used to locate and identify the remains.  The Commission's purpose is humanitarian.  All the families want is to give their loved ones a decent burial, to have a place to grieve and, in some measure at least, to have closure.  The Government remains committed to that aim and I call on all others to help bring it about.</p></reply>

While money laundering is an offence of itself, it would of course be reasonable to consider it closely associated with organised crime which generate significant financial gain.  Addressing organised crime in all of its guises remains a key ongoing priority for both the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and these priorities are clearly reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for 2013.</p><p>  In this regard, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement operations and strategies aimed at targeting, dismantling and disrupting criminal networks by utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies.  In addition, multidisciplinary approaches are used to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted including through the use of the proceeds of crime legislation, money laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p><p>  Specifically with regard to money laundering, the Deputy may wish to note that the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act, 2010 represents a radical overhaul of the anti-money laundering system in establishing a new framework of anti-money laundering regulation for credit and financial institutions and other &quot;designated persons&quot; in line with the 3rd EU Money Laundering Directive and the standards of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  In addition, the Criminal Justice Act 2013 made further amendments to that Act in order to align certain provisions more closely with international standards.  Furthermore, in February 2012, the FATF further revised its standards with the aim of strengthening and protecting the systems in place to deal with money laundering and terrorist financing and proposals for a 4th EU Money Laundering Directive are currently being negotiated which will take into account the revised FATF recommendations.</p><p>  In concluding, I can fully assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to vigorously pursue all persons involved in organised criminal activity including money laundering.</p></reply>

The Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 makes it an offence for any person to deliberately withhold information regarding sexual and other serious offences committed against a child or other vulnerable person.  Under section 2 of the Act, a person who knows or believes that an offence has been committed against a child and has information which he or she believes would be of material assistance in the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of that perpetrator and who fails to disclose that information to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is guilty of an offence.  That offence however is without prejudice to any right or privilege that may arise in criminal proceedings entitling a person to refuse to disclose information.  The extent to which such right or privilege may arise would be a matter for a court to determine.</p><p>  I understand that the Law Society has also taken steps to address this question in the updated and third edition of 'A Guide to Good Professional Conduct for Solicitors' which it published in October 2013.  In dealing with issues of privilege and confidentiality, guidance is provided in the new Guide for solicitors in relation to cases involving abuse or neglect of children.  This guidance anticipates that there may be exceptional circumstances involving children where a solicitor should consider revealing confidential information to a medical practitioner.  Similarly, if a situation indicates continuing sexual or other physical abuse, or ongoing neglect of a child, but there is a refusal on the part of the client to allow disclosure of such information, if the situation is sufficiently serious, a breach of the over-riding duty of confidentiality may be justified.  Under the guidance it is considered that in such cases, the solicitor should consider whether the situation is sufficiently serious to justify such a breach.</p></reply>

The Bill is, therefore, a key component of the Government's strategy to reduce the burden of legal costs on consumers and enterprise.</p><p>  The Bill, in three of the objectives it sets out in section 9 for the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, balances the focus of regulation more evenly to the benefit of consumers of legal services.  It does this in terms of 'protecting and promoting the public interest, protecting and promoting the interests of consumers relating to the provision of legal services and, promoting competition in the provision of legal services in the State'.</p><p>  Building on these key and consumer focussed objectives, the Legal Services Regulation Bill makes extensive provision, particularly in Part 9, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients.  The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles.  These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account if disputed costs are submitted for adjudication.  These cost transparency measures will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors.</p><p>  Under the Bill it will no longer be permissible to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business.  It will no longer be permissible to charge Junior Counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees.  Legal practitioners, whether solicitor or barrister, will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients.  This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions.  Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in Section 90 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated.  A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client.  When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question.</p><p>  The Bill also provides that a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will deal with disputes about legal costs &ndash; at present these are dealt with by the Office of the Taxing-Master.  The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated with greater transparency.  The Office will be empowered to prepare Guidelines and will establish and maintain a publicly accessible Register of Determinations which will include the outcomes and reasons for its decisions about disputed legal costs.  The Bill also facilitates the introduction of new business models for the delivery of legal services including alongside other services where costs efficiencies can be captured to the benefit of consumers.  In other provisions the Bill lifts existing restrictions on direct access to a barrister and on barristers who share premises or costs from advertising themselves as such a group.  The Bill also allows that a barrister in employment may provide legal services for his or her employer.</p><p>  In support of new and more open regulatory and legal costs regimes, the Bill also provides for a new and independent regulator  in the form of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority that will be bolstered by an independent complaints regime and an independent Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal.  This will provide a first port of call that is entirely independent of the legal professional bodies for members of the public who may have complaints about solicitors or barristers.  The comprehensive range of relevant reform measures contained in the Bill is intended to better empower the consumer of legal services in terms of both the standard of those services and their cost.</p></reply>

There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.</p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses.  Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  Section 2(2)(d) provides that in exercising its jurisdiction under that section, a court shall take into account and may receive evidence or submissions concerning any conviction of the accused person for an offence committed while he or she was on bail.  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.</p><p>  The criminal law takes a serious view of offences committed by persons on bail.  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served.  It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p><p>  I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences continue to be committed by persons on bail.  I share that concern and believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.

The approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.</p><p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  ISIS is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, and I very much welcomed the initiative led by the Judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information via the website.</p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that I have established a Penal Policy Review Group to carry out a review incorporating an examination and analysis of all aspects of penal policy including sentencing policies.  I expect the Group to report early in the new year and I intend to publish that report.  It might be noted that a Sentencing Council was not advocated by the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Mandatory Sentencing which was published earlier this year.  The report covers a number of complex issues and the recommendations contained in the report will be fully considered in my Department together with the report of the Penal Policy Review Group when it has been finalised.</p></reply>

In all such cases, the Deputy can be assured that we are following the debate and the issues raised very closely.  It would be technically possible for the EU Member States, acting unanimously and in accordance with their own constitutional procedures, and having followed the steps set out in Article 48, paragraphs 2 to 5 of the Treaty on European Union, to amend the EU Treaties in order to make provision for new states seceding from existing EU Member States to stay within the Union.  Whether they would wish to do so is a matter in the first instance for each Member State.</p><p>  In such circumstances for Ireland, as with other Treaty revisions, the final text of any amending Treaty would be referred to the Attorney General for advice as to whether an amendment of the Constitution (and thus a referendum) would be required to enable its ratification.</p></reply>

CSDP is an integral part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), which encompasses the EU's international obligations towards the maintenance of international peace and security. There are currently 12 civilian CSDP missions deployed in the Western Balkans, the South Caucasus, Asia, Africa and the Middle East.  One new civilian mission, EUBAM Libya was launched in May of this year.  The mandate of EUBAM Libya is to support the Libyan authorities to develop capacity for enhancing the security of their land, sea and air borders in the short term, and to develop a broader Integrated Border Management (IBM) strategy in the long term.</p><p>  During the year, it was decided to close two civilian CSDP Missions which had reached the end of their mandates: EUJUSTLEX Iraq and EUAVSEC South Sudan.  EUJUSTLEX Iraq, a rule of law training mission for magistrates and prison administrators, was launched in 2005 and will close at the end of the year.  EUAVSEC South Sudan which was launched in June 2012 to assist the South Sudanese authorities with advice on aviation security and to help reinforce security at Juba Airport, will close in February 2014. </p><p>  Ireland currently deploys eleven civilians and four members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to six civilian CSDP missions.  These deployments include: two civilians to the EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia (EUMM Georgia); two civilians and four members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX Kosovo); three civilians to the EU Police Mission to Afghanistan (EUPOL Afghanistan); two civilians to the European Union Integrated Rule of Law Mission for Iraq (EUJUSTLEX Iraq); one civilian to European Union Coordinating Office for Palestinian Police Support (EUPOL COPPS) and one civilian to the European Union Regional Maritime Capacity Building for the Horn of Africa and the Western Indian Ocean (EUCAP Nestor).</p></reply>

The document stresses that the Principles should be understood as a coherent whole which aim to enhance standards and practices with regard to business and human rights, rather than the creation of new international law obligations.

As the matter is still outstanding, it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, or to seek to influence the matters to which the Deputy refers.</p></reply>

An estimated 350,000 took part in an anti-government rally in Kyiv on 1 December to demonstrate their support for Ukraine&rsquo;s political association and closer integration with the EU.  The protests have focused on Independence Square and in the areas surrounding the Presidential Administration, the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office and Parliament.  There are also protests on a smaller scale in other parts of the country.</p><p>  The rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and are fundamental in any society.  I strongly believe that these rights should be fully respected by the Ukrainian authorities and would expect nothing less from the current holder of the Chairmanship-in-Office of the OSCE.  The demonstrations have been largely peaceful though there have been reports of provocateurs being active among the crowds.  The excessive use of force by the police over the weekend of 30 November-1 December in an effort to disperse peaceful protestors was not justified and has been, rightly, widely condemned.</p><p>  I fully support the call made in Kyiv on 4 December by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Thorbjorn Jagland, for an immediate and thorough investigation into the violence.  In that context, I welcome Prime Minister Azarov&rsquo;s apology to the people in Parliament on 3 December for the police actions and the announcement of measures to be taken against those who had used force.  While I have not spoken to the Honorary Consul, I have been kept informed of developments by Ireland&rsquo;s Prague-based Ambassador to Ukraine who was in Kyiv from 2-4 December.  She has reported to me on meetings which she attended during her visit with the Ukrainian authorities, with other resident Ambassadors and with Ireland&rsquo;s Honorary Consul.   </p><p>  As for the background to the demonstrations, I am on record as expressing our disappointment with Ukraine&rsquo;s decision to postpone the Association Agreement process while reiterating that the European Union&rsquo;s comprehensive and generous offer remains on the table.  Together with the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement this package was the most ambitious offer made to any partner by the EU.  It was also one very much in the interests of Ukraine and its people in terms of the long term benefits it would bring.</p><p>  I am encouraged that contacts are ongoing between the Ukrainian government and the EU and hope that the Association Agreement process can be resumed.  This will require Ukraine to make further tangible progress on the conditions set out by the Foreign Affairs Council last December, including in the area of selective justice.  Important progress by Ukraine had been achieved. I commend the European Parliament&rsquo;s monitoring mission, led by former President of Poland, Aleksander Kwa&oelig;nievski, and former President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, for their intensive engagement with the Ukrainian authorities over many months on all areas of concern.</p><p>  Of course, ultimately it is a matter for Ukraine to decide freely what kind of engagement it wishes to have with the EU.  In the meantime, I urge the Ukrainian government to fully abide by its international commitments to respect the rights to freedom of expression and assembly.  In this very tense and fluid situation, it is incumbent on all sides to show the utmost restraint and I would stress the importance of dialogue to help reduce the tension and to try to find an agreed way forward.</p></reply>

This is expended mainly to support the Department&rsquo;s ongoing investment in passport and ICT equipment and technology, as well as the maintenance of official premises at home and abroad.  The Passport Service is in the process of upgrading its infrastructure as part of an ongoing multi-annual investment programme.  Variance from profile is largely due to unavoidable delays in finalising the purchase of passport production equipment.  However, it is anticipated that payments of the order of &euro;1.6 million for new passport production machinery will be made shortly, with a further payment of a similar amount early in 2014.  There will also be payments in relation to certain other ICT infrastructure and works on premises abroad.

T his is simply a matter of fact.  The terms of the ongoing Israeli blockade of Gaza have been eased in a number of respects in recent years, including the removal of most items from the forbidden list, some degree of movement of building materials, a very limited opening to certain exports, and some easing of the constraints on farmers entering land near the border fence and on fishermen at sea.  The Deputy will also recall that my reply went on to state, as an important qualification of the preceding words: "...but far too little to allow the Gaza Strip to resume normal life".  This is a point I have consistently stressed at all times, but it will not help our case to refuse to acknowledge such small improvements as there have been, which are well known to all.  I am of course glad to see that Amnesty International support my consistent call for a lifting of the blockade.</p><p>  The current worsening of actual conditions in Gaza relates in large measure to factors additional to the ongoing Israeli blockade.  These are the loss of the additional supplies formerly obtained through the smuggling tunnels from Egypt, as a consequence of developments in that country, and an ongoing dispute between the Palestinian Authority and the Hamas authorities in Gaza, who have refused to pay for the fuel supplies which the PA formerly sent to them, and which were allowed through by Israel.</p><p>  I repeat my call in reply to a recent Question on this topic for all relevant authorities in the area to consider the effects of their actions on the ordinary people of Gaza, who are helpless among these conflicting forces.</p></reply>

About a quarter of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development assistance is channelled through Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs).  This reflects the strong contribution which Irish NGOs are making to the fight against world poverty and hunger, and the broad support which they continue to receive from the Irish public.  Funding is provided to support the long-term development work carried out by NGOs in developing countries, as well as emergency humanitarian assistance and development education programmes.</p><p>  Given the level of Government funding for the NGO sector, the issue of their internal governance arrangements is a matter of legitimate public interest.  It is important to note, however, that NGOs are independent organisations. The salary levels of their employees are determined by the Board of the NGO and are typically funded from a variety of income sources, including general donations from the public, bequests and official funding.  In relation to the funding provided through the Irish Aid programme, my Department appraises funding applications from the NGOs and assesses the cost efficiency and effectiveness of their projects and programmes and the basis of their expenditure decisions.  Financing agreements between Irish Aid and NGO partners include clear parameters on certain cost categories, including administration costs.  A limit of 6% of funding provided can be allocated to administration costs, with remuneration levels for senior executives being reviewed in the context of overall administration costs. </p><p>  In 2012, Irish Aid entered into agreements for a new series of programme grants with the larger Irish development NGOs for their long term development work over a four year period.  These agreements require these NGOs to follow best practice financial reporting standards for staff salaries as set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice in place in the UK. This British standard is currently used by Irish Aid, pending the establishment of the Charity Regulatory Authority.  In line with the standard, these NGOs are required to set out in their published audited financial statements the number of staff receiving salaries above &euro;70,000.</p><p>  The statistical annexes to the Irish Aid Annual Report provide a detailed analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s ODA, across a range of metrics including details of funding to non-governmental and civil society organisations. The most recent data published relates to ODA for 2012 and is available on the Irish Aid website at .  Detailed statistical analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s ODA for 2013 will be compiled early in the New Year and will subsequently be published on the Irish Aid web site.</p><p>  My Department provides funding for the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange (the <b>Fulbright Commission</b>), which is a registered charity, on an annual basis.  A grant of &euro;254,000 was provided to the Commission in 2013.  The Commission was established by the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1991 to facilitate the administration of educational and cultural exchanges between Ireland and the United States of America.  Under the Act, the approval of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ambassador of the United States is required for the engagement of an Executive Director and other administrative and clerical staff.  Terms and conditions (including salary levels) for the staff are set by the Commission itself. Details of the staff salary levels are made available to my Department.  Members of the Commission do not receive remuneration.  My Department is provided with annual financial statements of the Commission, as audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  These financial statements are also laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s <b>Emigrant Support Programme</b> (ESP), provides funding to non-profit organisations and projects to support Irish communities overseas and to facilitate the development of more strategic links between Ireland and the global Irish.  Applicant organizations to the ESP should be established as registered charities, charitable bodies or voluntary/not for profit organizations.  While the vast majority of funding under the Emigrant Support Programme (ESP) is provided to organisations overseas, almost 12% of the budget is allocated to Irish based organisations.  Recipient organisations here are typically active in providing services to returning or departing Irish emigrants or in promoting Irish heritage and sport abroad.  Organisations receiving grants under the Emigrants Support Programme (ESP) are required to submit a financial report for each programme funded and financial accounts or audited financial statement.  Full details of all funding provided by the Emigrant Support Programme can be found here: .</p><p>  Through the <b>Reconciliation and Anti-Sectarianism Funds</b>, which support cross-community outreach in Northern Ireland and the border counties, cross-border co-operation and sensitive commemorative and cultural events, my Department has awarded a total of &euro;1,751,183 so far in 2013. A table of all organisations awarded funding is set out below.  Funding is awarded only for project costs.  Salary costs are ineligible for support from the Funds.  There are mechanisms for annual reporting and accounting by recipient organisations.  Organisations in receipt of grants of &euro;10,000 and above are required to submit a tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners and those in receipt of grants of &euro;12,500 and above are required to submit independently audited accounts.</p><p><b>Departmental Funding</b><table><tr><th><b>Organisation</b></th><th><b>Amount</b></th></tr><tr><td>15 Years On</td><td>&euro;1,500</td></tr><tr><td>1825 Project</td><td>&euro;17,000</td></tr><tr><td>36th (Ulster) Division Memorial Association</td><td>&euro;20,000</td></tr><tr><td>APAC Ireland</td><td>&euro;8,000</td></tr><tr><td>ARC Healthy Living Centre</td><td>&euro;10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Ard Eoin Fleadh Project</td><td>&euro;11,000</td></tr><tr><td>Ballymac Friendship Trust</td><td>&euro;8,000</td></tr><tr><td>Belfast City Council: Shared History, Different Allegiances </td><td>&euro;4,600</td></tr><tr><td>Belfast Interface Project</td><td>&euro;10,000</td></tr><tr><td>British Irish Association</td><td>&euro;20,000</td></tr><tr><td>British Irish Joint Study on Economic Relations</td><td>&euro;43,083</td></tr><tr><td>Carrick Hill Residents Association</td><td>&euro;10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Carrickfergus YMCA</td><td>&euro;7,000</td></tr><tr><td>Centre for the Study of Irish Protestantism, Maynooth</td><td>&euro;4,000</td></tr><tr><td>Charter NI</td><td>&euro;25,000</td></tr><tr><td>City of Londonderry Grand Orange Lodge</td><td>&euro;18,000</td></tr><tr><td>Clare Youth Service</td><td>&euro;4,000</td></tr><tr><td>Coalisland Residents &amp;amp;

The system operates via an automated data exchange where Revenue electronically captures the information provided by the taxpayer and transfers it to the Department.  The data exchange between the computer systems transfers the information exactly as provided by the taxpayer and Revenue cannot validate the accuracy of the details in advance.  However, where a deduction fails or is not possible for whatever reason, the Department advises Revenue, who makes contact with the individual concerned.</p><p>  In the specific case raised by the Deputy, the person in question filed his 2013 LPT 1 Return in May 2013 and requested that payment be deducted from his widower&rsquo;s non-contributory pension.  Revenue subsequently transferred the information to the Department of Social Protection, but the Department rejected the payment request because the person in question was not in receipt of such a pension and confirmed this to Revenue in July 2013.  Revenue then made contact with the person in question and on the basis of clarifications provided by him, issued a new payment instruction to the Department in August 2013.  Unfortunately this instruction was also rejected by the Department as the case was under review at that time and was outside of the normal processing channels.</p><p>  On foot of the second rejection notice from the Department, Revenue wrote to the person informing him of the problem with the deduction at source instruction and requesting him to make alternative payment arrangements for both 2013 and 2014.  Revenue also used the opportunity to outline the various payment options available to him in preference to deduction at source.  Finally, Revenue has confirmed to me that given the circumstances of the case, a member of the LPT team will make direct contact with the person in the coming days and will explain the various payment options to him and will also offer any other assistance that might be required to help him meet his LPT obligations.</p></reply>

During the compilation of the Property Register some matching difficulties were encountered when consolidating the various Government and non-Government data sources, and in certain instances the linkage of properties to their relevant owners was not correct.  As part of its comprehensive LPT communications strategy, Revenue clearly stated that errors in the compilation of the Property Register were inevitable given the scale of the task and requested that anybody who received incorrect information on their properties should contact the LPT Helpline immediately to avoid unnecessary compliance interventions.  Revenue also clearly indicated that such interventions could include mandatory deduction at source from income, pensions, or various other Government payments in accordance with Sections 64, 65, 66 and 67 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended). </p><p>  In the specific case raised by the Deputy, I am advised by Revenue the difficulties occurred because the person in question failed to make contact with Revenue on foot of either the original issue of the LPT 1 Return in March 2013 or the subsequent reminder that issued to him in July 2013, to confirm that he is not the liable owner of the property.  The July reminder specifically advised the person of the imminent commencement of mandatory deduction at source from his pension if he did not address the issue.  Unfortunately, because the person did not contact Revenue to confirm the ownership status of the property, an instruction issued to his pension provider to commence mandatory deductions.</p><p>  Revenue subsequently received notice in August 2013 from the local authority that the person is in fact a tenant and is not the liable owner of the property.  On foot of this notification Revenue immediately instructed the pension provider to cease deduction at source and updated the Property Register to reflect the correct ownership details for the property.  I am further advised that in September 2013, Revenue also received correspondence from the Deputy confirming that he would act on behalf of the person in regard to LPT.  Revenue has assured me that a refund will issue as soon as evidence of payment is received from either the Deputy or from the person.  Such evidence will not otherwise be available to Revenue until P35s are received and processed in March/April 2014.</p></reply>

The option is available for a three year period from 27 March 2013, the date that the Finance Act 2013 was passed into law.  There are a number of reasons why, under existing policies, pre-retirement access to the main benefits from pension plans or schemes is not permitted, the principal one being that these arrangements (and the associated tax reliefs on contributions and pension fund growth) are designed to be long term savings vehicles based on the principle that the benefits will be &ldquo;locked away&rdquo; to help fund an adequate income in retirement. </p><p>  The pre-retirement access to a portion of AVCs which I introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2013 is allowed on a tax-neutral basis &ndash; the contributions were tax-relieved at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate on the way in and are taxed at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate on withdrawal.  The take-up of the measure to date has not been particularly significant.  I would remind the Deputy, however, that this is a measure which was designed to enable rather than incentivise individuals to access part of their pension savings beyond their regular or compulsory pension contributions.  It is important that individuals continue to provide for their retirement and, it would appear, most individuals with AVCs have to date decided to preserve their AVC pension savings.  For these reasons, I have no plans to extend the measure beyond AVCs.</p></reply>

C</font>rypto-currencies are not legal tender in the Euro area.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that e-commerce, including the use of virtual currencies, present a challenge to tax administrations throughout the world.  Specifically, regarding the possible use of crypto-currencies (including Bitcoin) to circumvent taxes, the Revenue Commissioners and tax administrations in other countries are actively monitoring developments.  Because Bitcoin is a combination of some factors that constitute a commodity and some that constitute a currency, the implications for taxation are varied.</p><p>  If Bitcoins are received as payments in commerce, then the same rules in place for payments received in other foreign currencies also apply.  If speculation on Bitcoin occurs, the taxation rules that would apply to any gain are applicable.  More specifically, VAT is generally chargeable on the total consideration for goods and services, including all taxes, commissions, costs and charges (excluding the VAT chargeable in respect of that supply).  This general rule is based on the EU VAT Directive.  Where the consideration does not consist of, or does not consist wholly of, and amount of money, VAT is chargeable by reference to what might reasonably be expected to be the open-market price of the good and services supplied.  The VAT Regulations require that the amount of tax included on an invoice is expressed in Euro.  The exchange rate to be used for non Euro currency transactions is either the latest selling rate for the foreign currency recorded by the European Central Bank or alternative method of determining the exchange rate that is agreed with the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  More broadly, I am advised that shadow economy activity has always been attracted to cash businesses, in large part because of the difficulties in traceability and record keeping.  Bitcoin may present a cash substitute for some tax evaders.  While it has the potential to increase instances of non-compliance, I am advised that, currently, the threat posed to the Exchequer is likely to be small.  It is probable too that for some evaders, it represents a new opportunity for existing non-compliance, rather than a new form of evasion.</p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  The USC is a charge on the gross income of individuals if their gross income exceeds the USC threshold of &euro;10,036 per annum.  It applies on a broad base with very few exceptions. </p><p>  Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief in respect of health expenses in the provision of health care incurred by an individual or an individual&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner, on their own behalf or on behalf of someone else.  Relief is provided at the standard rate except in the case of nursing home fees which are provided at the marginal rate. </p><p>  There is no relief against Universal Social Charge for health expenses.  However, it should be noted that payments from the Department of Social Protection such as the State Pension are exempt from the Universal Social Charge (USC).  In addition, individuals aged 70 and over, provided their total income does not exceed &euro;60,000, are not liable to the top rate of charge and payments from the Department of Social Protection will not be taken in to account in determining if an individual has exceeded the &euro;60,000 threshold.  </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009 was introduced to provide financial support for people assessed as needing long-term nursing home care.  The scheme is founded on the core principles that long-term care should be affordable and that a person should receive the same level of State support whether they choose a public, voluntary or private nursing home.  Since the 27th October 2009, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is the single funded means of accessing long-term nursing home care for all new entrants. </p><p>  Any contribution made by an individual in defraying expenses in the nature of maintenance or treatment in a nursing home, where that individual has received State support under section 3 of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009, is treated as health expenses qualifying for relief.  This relief is given at the marginal rate of tax but cannot exceed an amount which reduces the income tax liability for the year to nil.  As stated previously, this compares with tax relief at the standard rate for any other health expenses.  Given the additional tax relief currently available for nursing home fees I would not be in favour of providing an additional relief from USC for such fees.</p></reply>

Widening the scope of this relief to include companies could lead to calls from other business sectors for a similar tax exemption, for instance, on rental profits.  In addition, any changes to the land leasing provisions may be subject to EU State Aid approval. In any event, it is not clear to me that there is a difficulty here as companies who own land would tend not to want to lease it to those younger farmers.</p><p>  The Department of Finance is often asked to consider new tax reliefs and incentives across all sectors of the economy without a full picture of how existing reliefs are working. The wide range of existing tax expenditures for the farming sector have grown up over time, largely on a piecemeal basis. It is very difficult to assess the effectiveness of existing schemes and whether or not they maximise value for money. The most recent estimates on the tax forgone to the sector is estimated at over &euro;350 million, although there are a number of areas for which the data cannot be separated from other tax returns. </p><p>  That is one of the reasons why I announced in my Budget speech that I would be commissioning a Review of the tax reliefs available to the farming sector. This is in line with the Department of Finance policy to review all tax expenditures on a regular basis. </p><p>  The purpose of the Review will be to assess the costs and benefits of the various agriculture tax expenditures with a view to ensuring that the maximum benefit to the sector and the wider economy is obtained. The overall objective is not to change the level of Exchequer support to the sector through the tax system but rather to maximise the benefits to the economy for the existing level of State support and to ensure tax policy aligns with the objectives set out in Food Harvest 2020. Any recommendations would be considered in the context of Budget 2015. The issue of land leasing to companies is something that will be looked at in this Review. </p><p>  There will be an opportunity for farmers and all those involved in the sector to give their views, once the review process is launched in 2014. </p></reply>

The Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit will be of the same value, i.e. &euro;1,650, as the existing OPFTC and will also carry the same entitlement to the extended standard rate tax band of &euro;36,800 per annum.</p><p>  The proposed new credit, should the changes be approved by the Oireachtas, will operate differently from the One-Parent Family Credit, such that the credit will be available in the first instance, to the primary carer, that is, the single individual with whom the child resides for the greater part of the year. In addition I introduced an amendment at Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to allow the primary carer to relinquish the credit such that a non-primary carer can claim it in certain circumstances.</p><p>  If the primary claimant relinquishes the credit, a secondary claimant may claim it.  The child must reside with this individual for over 100 days in aggregate in the year, which is indicative of a level of involvement in the care of the child that is supportive of the primary claimant.  For the purpose of this limit a day can include the greater part of a day.   </p><p>  The new credit will be an activation measure and it is designed to be an in-work benefit to support the primary carer to take up, or remain in, employment. It will assist single parents or carers with the cost of childcare. Where a primary carer chooses to relinquish the credit, it will assist a non-primary carer to take up or remain in employment   The purpose of relinquishment is to ensure that if the primary claimant has insufficient income or does not wish to avail of the credit, a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for over 100 days in the year may claim it in recognition of their involvement with the child and the support they provide to the primary claimant.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this procedure of relinquishment means that two individuals could, by agreement among themselves, alternate claiming the credit with the primary claimant getting it in year one, and the secondary claimant in year two, and so on.</p><p>  Given the difficult fiscal environment it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.  </p><p>  Allocation of childcare responsibilities is primarily for parents to agree. Therefore, I have no plans to amend the legislation to allow for the splitting or apportioning of the new tax credit.   </p><p>  This new policy has been agreed by Government based on a recommendation put forward by the Commission on Taxation that the credit should be retained but that it should be confined to the principal carer only.  I am satisfied that the restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.</p></reply>

These proceeds comprise the return of our principal which is &euro;1.837 billion, a profit of &euro;62 million, and accumulated interest of &euro;151 million.</p><p>  The Preference Shares, which date back to early 2009, form part of the &euro;4.7 billion total investment made by the State in Bank of Ireland. Under the terms of the Preference Shares, the Bank was entitled, subject to regulatory capital considerations, to redeem the Preference Shares at any time. Therefore, a decision to hold onto the Preference Shares could not be made unilaterally. The step-up only crystallised in circumstances where the Bank was unable to redeem the Preference Shares before 31st March 2014. In this transaction the bank exercised its legal right to redeem up to &euro;537m of the shares at par while the State took the decision to sell the balance of &euro;1.3 billion for a premium.</p><p>  In deciding whether to support the transaction the State had to assess the probability that the Bank might opt to execute a rights issue and use the proceeds to redeem all the Preference Shares at par. In this scenario, the State would have foregone this &euro;62m profit. I was aware when making this decision that market conditions were extremely favourable at this time, enabling us to maximise the return to the State.</p><p>  Following this transaction the State will have recouped a net positive cash return of circa &euro;1.1 billion from its overall investment and support to the bank.</p><p>  This net cash return is before account is taken of our continuing equity investment in Bank of Ireland which is worth a further &euro;1.2 billion at current market prices.  This value takes account of the issuance of new shares to investors, which will see the State's equity stake fall from 15.1% to circa. 14.0%. Hence the State expects to record a significant profit from its total support of and investments in Bank of Ireland.</p></reply>

This can be broken down into 2 different categories.   The first category of &euro;52.658 million represents a balance in respect of the Department of Social Protection (DSP) with the Central Fund on 30 November 2013. This funding was advanced to provide adequate cash flow to prefund monthly Departmental scheme expenditure.</p><p>  Under Government accounting rules such advances may not be regarded as voted current expenditure until their disbursement. They may arise due to timing differences where there is prefunding at month end and matching expenditure at the start of the subsequent month. Such unspent advances issued from the Central Fund are recorded as cash equivalent assets of the Department at month end.</p><p>   It should be noted that similar balances have occurred in respect the DSP in previous years for the same reason of ensuring adequate cash flow to prefund and meet scheme expenditure as it arises.</p><p>  The second category consisting of payments of &euro;0.311 million and &euro;2.796 million are in respect of Ireland's contributions in 2013 to the General Capital Increase (GCI) and the Selective Capital Increase (SCI) of the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)). </p><p>  In common with other international financial institutions and in the context of governance reforms to strengthen the representation of developing countries, the World Bank adopted Resolutions in 2010 providing for an increase in its authorised capital in order to ensure a sufficiency of resources to respond to increased lending requirements in the light of the financial crisis. Ireland's participation in the capital increase is in line with its existing pro-rata share of IBRD capital. Under the World Bank's Procedures for Subscriptions to the GCI and SCI, the paid-in element comprises 6% of the value of the additional shareholding, of which 10% (i.e. 0.06%) is paid in US dollars and the remainder in euro. The amounts of &euro;0.311 million and &euro;2.796 million correspond to the breakdown on this basis of the 2013 instalment. In line with the subscription arrangements,  Ireland's contributions are being paid in approximately equal annual instalments in each of the years 2013 to 2016 inclusive in the case of the GCI, and 2013 to 2015 inclusive in the case of the SCI. </p></reply>

The bank has advised that its 'Receiver Strategy' for its BTL portfolio continues to be centred on a case-by-case analysis.  Appointments are made where it is deemed to be the most appropriate outcome for both the customer and the bank.  The appointment of a Receiver is currently pending on 10 BTL properties (10 accounts).  </p><p>  It should be noted that under the terms of the Relationship Framework that govern the relationship between the Minister for  Finance and the State supported banks, the respective Boards and Management teams retain responsibility and authority for determining the banks' strategies and commercial policies and conducting their day-to-day operations.  The appointment of rent receivers to properties therefore is an operational decision for the Boards and Management teams of those institutions. </p></reply>

Salary figures are net of a voluntary waiver where applicable.</p><p>  4. 2012 Chief Executive data extracted from responses to recent Parliamentary Questions.</p><p>  As I stated in earlier replies to Parliamentary Questions on this matter I can confirm that the three State supported banks responded with their individual strategies, designed to achieve the required savings, by the due date of 30 April as requested by the Government in response to the Mercer Report.  I was not prescriptive in how this was to be achieved respecting their differing State ownership and investment and paths to profitability.  I have reviewed the letters submitted and I am satisfied that the banks will deliver remuneration cost savings of 6% to 10%. </p><p>  The Bank of Ireland letter focused on changes to the defined benefit pension scheme that will affect all staff who are members of this scheme and as the deputy will be aware an agreement has now been reached with the IBOA in this regard.  The AIB proposal included the closure of the defined benefit scheme to future accrual along with other changes including an increase in working hours which were agreed with the IBOA in July.  The ptsb proposal centred on the wind-up of the defined benefit pension scheme for all staff who were members of this scheme. </p><p>  For clarity senior management in the banks have made the following contributions; in the case of Bank of Ireland the proposed pension changes affect all staff in the BSPF scheme including the Chief Executive.  AIB has taken the following specific actions to address remuneration levels: reductions in pay and benefits of higher earners ranging from 7.5% to 15% implemented in the second half of 2012 and it also should be noted that the AIB Leadership Team have all joined the bank since 2008 and receive reduced pension contributions from their predecessors.  In the case of ptsb all senior management have been negatively impacted  .</p><p>  The National Treasury Management Agency published a table of salaries by salary band at the end of 2012 on page 35 of its annual report; the table shown below splits the staff into individuals who work for NAMA and the NTMA.  It should be noted that staff in the NTMA and NAMA we subject to reductions in pay under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest ACT 2013.<table><tr><th>NTMA Salaries by Salary Band at End 2012</th><th>NTMA (ex NAMA)</th><th>NAMA</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Up to &euro;50,000</td><td>92</td><td>25</td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;50,001 to &euro;75,000</td><td>71</td><td>49</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;75,001 to &euro;100,000</td><td>52</td><td>58</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;100,001 to &euro;125,000</td><td>21</td><td>39</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;125,001 to &euro;150,000</td><td>14</td><td>31</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;150,001 to &euro;175,000</td><td>11</td><td>9</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;175,001 to &euro;200,000</td><td>4</td><td>9</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;200,001 to &euro;225,000</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;225,001 to &euro;250,000</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;250,001 to &euro;275,000</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;275,001 to &euro;300,000</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;300,001 to &euro;325,000</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;325,001 to &euro;350,000</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;350,001 to &euro;375,000</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;375,001 to &euro;400,000</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;400,001 to &euro;425,000</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;425,001 to &euro;450,000</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>276</td><td>224</td><td>500</td></tr></table>Notes:</p><p>1.

The salary shown in the table is the net amount after that waiver.  The voluntary waiver has been extended until 31 December 2013.<br /><br />(iv) The figure includes car allowances and, where applicable, benefits in kind.<br /><br />(v) The amount relates to the Bank's pension funding contribution in respect of the pension benefit they accrued in line with their contractual entitlement during 2012.<br /><br />(vi) Executive Directors are entitled to a company car or car allowance.  The Group also pays private health insurance on behalf of the Executive Directors and their families.  In addition, Executive Directors may avail of subsidised house purchase loans.  Loans to Executive Directors are on the same terms and conditions as loans to other eligible ptsb management.  The CEO took up his position at the end of February 2012.<br /><br />(vii) The CEO is a member of ptsb Defined Contribution Pension Scheme.  The Group contributes to this pension scheme and contributions are determined solely in relation to basic salary.  The Employer Pension contribution in 2012 was &euro;53,000 from the end of February 2012.<br /><br />(viii) The remuneration of the CEO is determined by the Minister of Finance after consultation with the Advisory Committee.  The CEO agreed to waive 15% of his salary following a request by the Minister of Finance and this adjustment is reflected above.  The remuneration consists of basic salary, taxable benefits (car and health insurance) and a performance related payment of up to 80% of annual salary.  The CEO waived any consideration for performance related pay in respect of 2012 (as he did previously in respect of 2011 and 2010).<br /><br />(ix) The CEO's pension entitlements are within the standard entitlements in the model public sector defined benefit superannuation scheme.<br /><br />(x) The remuneration of the CEO is determined by the NTMA CEO after consultation with the NTMA Advisory Committee.  In giving advice on remuneration, the NTMA Advisory Committee is informed by the views of the NTMA Remuneration Committee.  The remuneration of the CEO consists of a basic salary, taxable benefits and a performance related payment of up to 60% of annual salary.  The CEO was entitled to be awarded a performance payment for 2012, but in view of the economic challenges facing the country, waived his entitlement to this payment.  The 2012 salary reflects a 15% voluntary reduction.</blockquote>  As regards the CEO contracts, I received the following information from the banks.</p><p><b>AIB</b></p><p>  David Duffy was appointed as Chief Executive Officer of Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. in December 2011 on a fixed term contract of three years with an option to renew for up to a further three years by mutual agreement and a six months' notice period subject to a maximum compensation of six months' salary.</p><p><b>BOI</b></p><p>  Information regarding the appointment and remuneration of Bank of Ireland Directors, including Group CEO, are contained within the 2012 Annual Report (pages 115-134).</p><p><b>PTSB</b></p><p>  The CEO is not on a temporary contract so the detail does not apply.

For example in one institution there are 12 different pension schemes with 12 different sets of terms and conditions.  Further given the fluidity of the current employment situation in the institutions e.g. the current schemes for early retirements and voluntary redundancies, freedom of personnel to leave on notice and the individual nature of retirement packages especially at executive level (transfer in arrangements), it is not possible to forecast figures in relation to future entitlements.</p><p>  While the trustees of the schemes have actuarial models which allow them to forecast the financial state of the various schemes, these models are not available to my department and the institutions rely on their pension trustees for forecasting.  In addition to the points above, due to the small number of individuals in some institutions, even if it were possible to calculate the data, it would not be possible to release the information due to data protection constraints on personal data.</p><p>  NTMA employees are members of the NTMA defined benefit superannuation scheme or else have Personal Retirement Savings Accounts.  The pension benefits of members of the NTMA superannuation scheme prior to 1 January 2010 are based on final salary.  The pension benefits of members who joined the scheme on or after 1 January 2010 are based on career average earnings.  Unlike most public pension schemes which are funded on a pay as you go basis, the NTMA superannuation scheme is a funded scheme.  Pension entitlements are within the standard entitlements in the model public sector defined benefit superannuation scheme.  Pension contributions are not paid to individual employees &ndash; they are paid into the scheme.  The level of potential pension payments to members is dependent on length of service, based on final salary or career average earnings, with 1/80th of salary accruing for each year of service.</p></reply>

My officials met with Ulster Bank officials on 27 November after the publication of the report.  The report contained allegations about West Register and my officials were assured that West Register was involved with a very small number of Irish businesses.  There is no reference to Ireland in the report.  I understand that RBS has appointed Clifford Chance to independently review the treatment of distressed customers by the Global Restructuring Group and report early in the New Year.  I also understand that the findings will be applied across the RBS Group.</p><p>  I would refer the Deputy to the revised Code of Conduct for Business Lending to SMEs, which came into effect on 1 January 2012.  A specific focus of the Code is the treatment of borrowers in financial difficulties.  Lenders are required to provide information to SMEs in relation to the importance of engaging with the lender to address their financial difficulties, the procedures for dealing with SMEs in financial difficulties including timeframes, details of fees which may apply, the type of information they require in assessing cases and information on their right of appeal.  Lenders must assess whether an alternative repayment arrangement can be put in place and allow the SME appeal that decision and meetings with SMEs which approach them with concerns about meeting repayments.</p><p>  The banks are required to comply with the Code as a matter of law.  The Code makes it clear that anybody acting for or on behalf of a bank is subject to its provisions.  The Central Bank can invoke its statutory powers to require compliance with the Code.  A breach of the Code is a breach of a regulatory requirement and may be the subject of enforcement action by the Central Bank.  Additionally, as the Deputy is aware, the two main banks are subject to oversight by the Credit Review Office and the CRO has been active in overturning rejections by the banks of credit applications from the SME sector. </p><p>  However, the Deputy can be assured that this is an area that I will keep under review given the importance of the SME sector to fostering and supporting economic recovery.</p></reply>

Updates and changes to these pages are made exclusively by Indirect Taxes Division. </p><p>  The Taxes and Duties section of the Revenue website contains a range of information regarding VAT.  The VAT rates database, which contains details of an extensive listing of products and services, links to the applicable rate of VAT and other related information.  The VAT treatment indicated is based on current practice and is not to be regarded as a statement of law or as a substitute for consulting the legislation. </p><p>  The entire database is updated on a regular basis with rates on new goods or services or amendments to previously published rates based on changes in legislation, appeal decisions or the nature of the goods and services.  When the database is updated, the rate shown for each good and service, whether it has been changed or not, is given the same update date.  At present rates show an update date of 23 July 2013.</p><p>  The 'cowmats' entry has been on the website database since the 1990s.  The original entry read &quot;Cowmats - Supply and Install Rate 21%&quot;, which was the standard rate of VAT at the time.  In conjunction with the introduction of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 the database was upgraded to include an enhanced remarks field.  Since 2010, the entry on the database makes reference to the two-thirds rule that may apply to cowmats in very exceptional circumstances.  The entry on the database since the introduction of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 reads   <i>&ldquo;Cowmats &ndash; Supply and Fit Rate Standard Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 Ref: Section 46(1)(a) Remarks;  However, some cowmats may be regarded as fixtures e.g. mats set in wet concrete or stuck down over their entire surface qualify as fixtures, subject to the 2/3 rule.&rdquo;</i></p><p>  Section 41 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 specifies that where the value of movable goods provided under an agreement for the supply of services exceeds two-thirds of the total consideration under the agreement for the provision of those goods and the supply of the services the consideration shall be deemed to be referable solely to the supply of the goods and tax shall be charged at the VAT rate appropriate for the goods.  This is known as the two-thirds rule.  The two-thirds rule applies to construction services for agricultural buildings and non-residential immovable goods.  The two-thirds rule has been a feature of VAT since its introduction and is applied in all relevant cases.</p><p>  Revenue select cases for intervention using a risk-based approach that considers the presence of various risk indicators and other information available, with the aid of their computerised risk analysis system, REAP.  The type of intervention to be undertaken is, in any particular case, the one considered to be the most appropriate to target the specific risk identified. In many cases this may lead to a single tax head, multi tax head or single-issue audit rather than a comprehensive audit.</p><p>  Section 46 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 provides that tax shall be charged in relation to the supply of goods or services at the rates set out in that section.  Where an intervention results in the conclusion that a supplier has charged the incorrect rate of VAT, Revenue may recover the underpaid VAT by raising assessments under section 111 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010.  The recipient of a VAT invoice has an entitlement to an input credit only for the VAT shown on the invoice where the goods or services are used by him or her for the purpose of VAT-able supplies.  The issuer of an invoice which shows VAT at a lower rate than the correct rate for the transaction may seek to justify their failure to correctly operate the VAT system by claiming that a loss of revenue does not arise where the recipient of the invoice, such as a VAT registered farmer, had full recoverability for the VAT.</p><p>  Revenue has a clear responsibility to ensure the correct operation of the tax system, and the onus of proof that 'no loss of revenue' arises rests clearly with the taxpayer and the taxpayer and/or the tax adviser in any case must engage directly with their Revenue district to establish this.  The procedures in relation to 'no loss of revenue' are clearly set out in Revenue's Code of Practice.</p></reply>

QQI adopted a number of revised policies in September and also determined the related fees. Under the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act, 2012, QQI must receive the consent of both the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to the fees which it determines, and that consent was granted in October.</p><p>  With regard to the introduction of fees for Level 4 Special Purpose awards, the revised fees schedule provides that fees are to be charged for the first time for all Level 4 QQI awards, as they already are for all Level 5 or 6 awards. The fee has also been set at the same level as the relevant fee for Level 5 or 6 awards. It should be noted that in 2012 FETAC made approximately 50,000 awards at Level 4, out of a total of approximately 300,000 awards. Given the costs to QQI of certification and of the maintenance of awards standards, it is not sustainable for QQI to continue to make these awards at no cost.</p><p>  In order to give adequate notice to learners and providers, QQI has deferred the introduction of these new certification fees until 1 July 2014. Certification fees would usually be paid by learners themselves, rather than providers, and a system of waivers is in place. These waivers mean that recipients of social welfare benefits and/or Medical Card holders are exempt from fees. In addition, certain centres are exempt from fees, including Youthreach/VTOS. </p></reply>

Accordingly, commensurate with the level of funding available for the Scheme, applications were assessed on a top down basis in accordance with the prioritisation criteria outlined in the Circular accompanying the Scheme.  In addition, some applications included new build elements which were outside the scope of the Scheme while others applied for works that were of a maintenance nature and were appropriate to be funded from the school's capitation grant and/or Minor Works Grant Scheme in the case of primary schools.  In other cases, plans were in train to upgrade schools as part of major capital projects and the proposed works therefore would have been addressed as part of the capital projects concerned.</p><p>  As I advised the Deputy in my letter of 28 November, my announcement on 7th November of an additional &euro;70 million for school improvement works will facilitate schools carrying out small and medium scale building works that will improve and upgrade existing school buildings.

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. </p><p>All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/14 school year by 15th March, 2013.  The NCSE published details of all of their allocations for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/2014 school year in June of this year.  The NCSE has also now published details of the additional SNA allocations which have been made to schools since the initial allocations were made to schools in June.  The NCSE published details of these revised allocations on 21st October, 2013.  These details are now available on the NCSE website, www.ncse.ie, and detail the allocations made for each school on a per county basis</p><p>The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support.  The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>  The level of support required by pupils with special educational needs may change from year to year, in line with their changing care needs including diminishing care needs as they mature and become more independent over time, for example.  The NCSE takes these factors into account when allocating SNAs to schools.  Schools can contact the NCSE if they have enrolled children who were not considered at the time that the revised SNA allocations were made to schools, or where they are seeking a revision to the quantum of SNA support which has been allocated to them.  In general, a revision to SNA allocations will only be made in circumstances where schools have enrolled new pupils, or where schools can demonstrate that they do not have sufficient SNA posts to cater for the care needs of all of the qualifying children in their school. </p><p> I understand from officials at my Department that a response will issue to the Deputy from the National Council for Special Education by the end of this week regarding the individual case referred to him in this question.</p></reply>

There are two steps in the appeals mechanism.  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI.  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by SUSI, and remains of the view that SUSI has not interpreted the scheme correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to the Student Grants Appeals Board.  The relevant appeal form is available to download from .  </p><p>  Officials in my Department have been informed by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) that the appeals procedure is detailed on www.susi.ie and the appeals option advised in writing to all applicants in receipt of both award and refusal letters.  As the Deputy is aware there are a number of eligibility criteria that an applicant must meet to be considered for a student grant and therefore it is possible for an applicant to appeal on any or all of these grounds when they receive a SUSI decision.  When an applicant appeals to SUSI on a particular eligibility grounds and that appeal is refused by SUSI the applicant then has recourse to the Student Grants Appeals Board.  </p><p>  SUSI has also introduced an option to Request a Review of a grant decision without going through the formal appeals process and full details of this option are published on www.susi.ie.  If the applicant is not happy with the outcome of the review he/she can then avail of the appeals process.</p></reply>

During all whole school evaluations, inspectors provide individual teacher feedback and whole-school feedback highlighting good practice and aspects of practice that require improvement.  The reports arising from whole school inspections and subject inspections are published so that there is a clear record of the strengths of the school and the areas that require improvement.</p><p>  To complement these evaluation models the Inspectorate conducts unannounced incidental inspections focussed also on evaluating the quality of teaching and learning in classrooms.  Since the introduction of unannounced incidental inspections in November 2011 some 700 unannounced inspections have been conducted in post-primary schools.  The inspectorate has also commenced specific follow-through evaluations where inspectors monitor the implementation by schools of recommendations from previous inspections and it is expected that these reports will also be published from 2014.  The Inspectorate has been and continues to be engaged in an ongoing programme to review existing inspection models such as whole-school evaluation, and to develop and introduce new models of inspection and reporting on schools in line with section 13(8) of the Education Act, 1998.  </p><p>  Responsibility for addressing shortcomings in learning and teaching in a school rests primarily with the school's board of management and its leadership team in the case of voluntary secondary and community and comprehensive schools and with the school leadership team and the relevant Education and Training Board in the case of schools run under the auspices of Education and Training Boards.  This responsibility placed on schools to address any inadequacies in teaching is underpinned by the provisions of Section 24 of the Education Act and related circulars.  Procedures for dealing with professional competence and disciplinary matters for teachers are in place for all schools.  Under the penultimate stage of these formal procedures, boards of management are required to seek an independent evaluation of the work of a teachers where the board of school is dissatisfied with the professional standards of the teacher's work.  The Inspectorate has responded to all such requests from boards of management and has conducted the requisite inspection visits and provided reports to the boards of management involved.</p><p>  In the small number of schools where the Inspectorate has identified serious weaknesses in the quality of teaching and learning or in the leadership and management of schools, the Department has engaged with the patron, trustees or management of the school to ensure that the need for improvement and change is fully appreciated by the school and by those responsible for its management.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the review will identify support measures for teachers' practice that would be required to improve teaching through Irish in Gaeltacht schools.</p><p>  A key part of the review work will be an examination of relevant literature, national policies and practice elsewhere in sociolinguistic contexts that are similar to Gaeltacht areas.  These will include Welsh in Wales, Basque and Catalan in Spain, Frisian in the Netherlands, Scottish Gaelic and Maori in New Zealand.  Other strands of the review include an analysis of supply and demand for pre-school, primary and post-primary schooling in Gaeltacht areas, surveys of stakeholders, and case studies on Irish medium practice in Gaeltacht schools.  Further detail is available in the terms of reference for the Review that are available on my Department's website.

While there are no specific requirements for teachers of Irish to undergo refresher courses, all teachers have a professional responsibility to ensure that they keep their knowledge and skills up to date by evaluating their practice on an ongoing basis and engaging in appropriate continuing professional development (CPD).  This is part of the standard set out by the Teaching Council in the Code of Professional Conduct for Teachers, and it is something that society and students can reasonably expect from their teachers.<blockquote>  My Department supports teachers in this endeavour by providing a wide range of CPD opportunities.  In relation to Irish in particular there has been significant investment in CPD in recent years, such as:<br /><br />- CPD in relation to the national literacy and numeracy strategy for primary teachers and post-primary teachers, including specific provision for teachers in Irish medium schools and a commitment to offering 20 hours of CPD over the course of 5 years to certain teachers.<br /><br />- CPD for post primary teachers of Irish from 2007-2012 provided by the Seirbh&iacute;s Taca&iacute;ochta Dara Leibh&eacute;al don Ghaeilge.  This team has now been integrated with the Professional Development Service for Teachers and continues to provide CPD for teachers of Irish as part of the literacy strategy<br /><br />- CPD provided by the T&uacute;s Maith team at primary level from 2006</blockquote>- CPD for post-primary teachers of Irish in the context of the new junior cycle</p><p>  Irish specification will begin in the school year 2014/15.  At initial teacher education stage, measures to enhance the development of Irish teaching skills are key parts of the reconfiguration of primary and relevant post-primary programmes.  The 20 year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010 -2030 also contains a number of other actions relating to improving the quality of Irish Teaching.  This Government is committed to supporting the overall thrust of the strategy and will deliver on the achievable goals and targets proposed.  An update on progress on the education actions underway is available on my Department's website.</p><p>  These actions are occurring in tandem with the implementation of the National Strategy, developments in initial teacher education and reform of the Junior Cycle.  I am convinced that, in time, the measures outlined above will have a positive impact on the quality of Irish teaching in our schools.</p></reply>

I want to achieve a position where every primary schools has a book rental schemes in operation in the 2014/2015 school year.  The Department will be contacting primary schools that do not currently operate a book rental scheme early in the New Year to advise them of the application process.

However, I regret that they will not be eligible to apply for funding under this scheme.</p><p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that the Department will continue to provide a book grant to all primary schools.

I have no function in the matter.</p><p>  The &euro;270,000 funding which the Deputy refers to in his question in relation to the flood relief works in Athleague was provided by the Office of Public Works directly to Roscommon County Council under the former's Minor Flood Mitigation Works Scheme.  Local Authorities may apply for funding under the Scheme and funding of up to 90% of the cost of works/studies is available for approved projects, with the balance being funded by the local authority concerned.  The planning, procurement and progression of the works is a matter for the Council.</p><p>  I am advised that, before undertaking works, Roscommon County Council engaged a firm of consulting engineers to undertake a more detailed study and assessment of the catchment of the River Suck in the vicinity of Athleague and to recommend flood alleviation measures.  The Council did not proceed with the construction of a diversion weir and channel (bypass culvert) upstream of Castlestrange Bridge as the consultant's report concluded that this would not provide an appropriate level of flood protection in Athleague.  The Council now intends to carry out site investigations prior to the construction of the final element of the flood alleviation works - a proposed embankment along the Silver Stream.  The Council expects the site investigations to begin shortly and has confirmed to the OPW that the works being undertaken will mitigate flood risk in Athleague in line with the Minor Works Scheme application.</p><p>  Athleague is an Area for Further Assessment (AFA) under the Shannon CFRAM (Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management) study, which is ongoing.  The study will produce flood maps and a detailed flood risk management plan with recommendations on how best to address the flooding problems in the town.  These documents will be available for public consultation at draft stage. Details are available on the website www.shannoncframstudy.ie.</p></reply>

This showed expenditure is being managed within profile, although there were some pressures in the Justice and Health Groups of Votes.</p><p>  Some additional funding is being allocated by way of Supplementary Estimates to the Justice, Transport, Tourism and Sport, and Health Vote Groups:<blockquote>- A supplementary estimate of &euro;51 million has been required in the Justice Group, primarily to deal with pressures relating to Garda pay, and also to allow for certain other additional expenditure including the first of the payments to the women who were admitted to and worked in the Magdalene Laundries.  This additional requirement is partially funded by savings from elsewhere in the Justice Vote group which amount to at least &euro;23.5 million.<br /><br />- As previously indicated, the HSE will require a supplementary estimate of &euro;219 million in 2013.  However, &euro;20 million of this amount will be offset against savings made in the Department of Health.  The position in relation to the Health estimate has been closely monitored and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform continues to work closely with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure that the appropriate measures are being undertaken to contain Health expenditure.<br /><br />- A supplementary estimate of &euro;50 million was required for the Department of Transport in respect of local road maintenance projects in order to carry out much needed surface restoration and road reconstruction works.  This funding will be provided from the stimulus package funding I announced earlier this year.<br /><br />- A small number of supplementary estimates are also required to allow for some movement of financial allocations but which, between them, will have an exchequer neutral effect.</blockquote>  The additional expenditure related to these Supplementary Estimates is being funded from the savings that will be arising by year end across the remaining Vote Groups.  Details of the actual end year position for all Votes will be clear at that point.</p></reply>

The rationale for the new scheme was the need to reduce the unsustainable cost of sick leave for the public service overall which is to be achieved through a substantial reduction in the period of time for which paid sick leave will be available from one year at present (comprising six months at full pay and six months at half pay &ndash; subject to certain conditions) to six months (i.e. three months full pay and three months half pay).</p><p>  The issue of transitional arrangements and specifically how employees who are on sick leave at the time of commencement of the new scheme as well as the approach taken to employees&rsquo; prior sick leave record was addressed by the Labour Court in its recommendations.  It was recommended by the Labour Court that anyone who is on sick leave at the time of the introduction of the new scheme will continue to avail of the current sick leave scheme and will be provided with access to six months full pay and six months half pay (over a four year rolling period) for the duration of that particular illness.</p><p>  In relation to the issue of retrospection it was agreed by the Labour Court that an employee&rsquo;s sick leave records over the last four years will, as is currently the case, be used to determine whether an individual has access to sick pay or not.  In the case of a non-critical illness there will, however, be a reduction in the number of days sick leave absences in the preceding four year period above which there will be no entitlement to paid sick leave &ndash; other than Temporary Rehabilitation Pay - from 365 days to 183 days.  The new sick leave arrangements were agreed under the Croke Park Agreement and did not form part of the Haddington Road Agreement.  The parameters of the new sick leave scheme are contained in the Labour Court Recommendation and the scheme will be implemented in accordance with this recommendation.</p></reply>

Significantly reduced recruitment, the ongoing substantial fall in numbers of public servants and higher numbers reaching the maxima of scales has reduced the cost of increments.

As the Deputy will be aware, capital spending has general characteristics which influence the allocation draw-down pattern.  Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year.  Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure.  The profiling of capital expenditure is carried out by individual Departments on the basis of the likely timing of payments related to capital projects and programmes which they deliver.</p><p>  While gross capital expenditure was 13.9% behind profile at the end of November, information supplied by Departments indicates that the majority of their remaining capital budgets will be spent by year end.  The spending pattern is in line with trends from previous years which show that the bulk of capital expenditure takes place towards the end of the year.  Where it is not possible to spend their capital allocation in full by year end, Departments may apply to carryover unspent capital (up to a maximum of 10% of their Voted capital allocation) into the next year.  Any underspends in the capital budget which are not carried over into 2014 will be returned, as a saving, to the Exchequer.</p><p>  In the context of the requirement to meet our deficit targets and restore our economic sovereignty, each Department must ensure that the Vote level allocations are adhered to and that both capital and current expenditure are managed from within the overall allocation for the Vote.  My Department actively monitors all expenditure during the year to ensure that our deficit targets are met.</p></reply>

While this estimate for labour intensity is used as a general rule of thumb, it is important to note that the amount of employment generated by capital expenditure depends on how that expenditure is invested.  For example, the purchase of new rail rolling stock would typically generate little direct employment in Ireland as such stock is generally produced abroad.  Furthermore, different types of public construction project have different levels of labour intensity.  For example, smaller scale projects such as school building and repair, or smaller local and regional road-works, tend to be more labour intensive than major national infrastructural projects.</p><p>  The Exchequer capital framework for the period 2012 to 2016 was set following a Government-wide review of the public capital programme conducted in 2011.  The focus of that review was the identification of infrastructural investment that can aid economic growth, generate sustainable jobs in the medium term, and address urgent social requirements.  Much of the capital programme for the five year period of the Framework is geared towards smaller, more labour intensive projects.  It is also noteworthy that investment in enterprise supports has the highest direct employment impact.  Accordingly, the capital Framework made a point of protecting supports to the enterprise sector primarily through agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.</p><p>  Since the capital plan was launched in 2011, the Government has been able to announce a number of increases to its infrastructure investment through the introduction of a new PPP pipeline and the use of the proceeds from the State asset and Lottery licence transactions.  This additional investment is expected to support significant numbers of jobs across the country.  The previous analysis of each sector indicates that the investment in the PPP Pipeline may support in the region of 13,000 direct jobs and many more indirect jobs.  In addition to this, it is envisaged that the additional Exchequer funding of &euro;150 million, which I announced in June of this year, can support up to 3,000 jobs.  These initiatives will of course also create much needed social and economic infrastructure and aid economic recovery.  The Exchequer projects, in particular, involve mostly smaller scale capital works which are known to be labour intensive.</p><p>  It is my intention that a review of the public capital investment framework will be undertaken in 2014 in parallel with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.  Following this, a new five year capital envelope will be set.  Of course, employment creation will be a key consideration in the setting of the new envelope.</p></reply>

The specific rules under which the carryover facility operates are set out in Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 06/2013 which is available at . </p><p>  Departments are required to report to my Department on a monthly basis in relation to progress on carryover spend as part of their overall monthly expenditure reporting requirements.  Reports received at end November indicate that &euro;99 million of the total capital carryover of &euro;107.2 million into 2013 had been spent by Departments.  A breakdown of carryover by Department into 2013 and spend to end November is set out in the following table.</p><p>  As set out in the legislation governing capital carryover, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform must make a Ministerial Order specifying the definitive amounts of capital carryover by subhead no later than 31 March of the year into which carryover will occur.  Until the Ministerial Order is signed, capital expenditure for the relevant subheads can only be met from the current year&rsquo;s capital allocation; once the Order is signed, the unspent capital moneys deferred from the preceding year become the first next charge against the subheads concerned.  Carryover must then be spent in full before any other moneys can be spent under the relevant subheads.  If the amount of capital carried over by a Department is not spent in the second financial year it must be definitively surrendered to the Central Fund at the end of that year.<table><tr><th>Vote</th><th>Capital Carryover into 2013<br /><br />Position at End November</th><th>Carried into 2013</th><th>Spend to end November</th><th>Amount left to spend</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>(&euro;000&rsquo;s)</td><td>(&euro;000&rsquo;s)</td><td>(&euro;000&rsquo;s)</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>Justice and Equality</td><td>287</td><td>0</td><td>287</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government</td><td>43,000</td><td>35,465</td><td>7,535</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Education and Skills</td><td>19,000</td><td>19,000</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>Foreign Affairs and Trade</td><td>400</td><td>270</td><td>130</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>Communication, Energy &amp;amp; Natural Resources</td><td>10,400</td><td>10,400</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>Agriculture, Food and Marine</td><td>6,000</td><td>6,000</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</td><td>25,000</td><td>25,000</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</td><td>1,200</td><td>1,200</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>Defence</td><td>900</td><td>900</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td>Social Protection</td><td>1,050</td><td>1,050</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>-</td><td>107,237</td><td>99,285</td><td>7,952</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Under the initiative, vouchers worth &euro;5,000 are allocated to small businesses whose proposals, to work with public knowledge providers on specific innovation questions, meet simple criteria.</p><p>  The following table illustrates the number of Innovation Vouchers issued; the number redeemed and their respective total values since the programme commenced.</p><p>Innovation Vouchers Approved and Redeemed for years 2007 to 2012<table><tr><th> -</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>Totals</th></tr><tr><td>Vouchers Redeemed </td><td>4</td><td>206</td><td>526</td><td>524</td><td>518</td><td>525</td><td>2303</td></tr><tr><td>Vouchers paid &euro;</td><td>18,264</td><td>1,014,935</td><td>2,406,334</td><td>2,591,145</td><td>2,573,568</td><td>2,547,178</td><td>11,151,424</td></tr><tr><td>Vouchers Issued</td><td>428</td><td>588</td><td>798</td><td>855</td><td>757</td><td>767</td><td>4193</td></tr><tr><td> &euro; Amt approved</td><td>2,140,000</td><td>2,940,000</td><td>3,990,000</td><td>4,275,000</td><td>3,785,000</td><td>3,835,000</td><td>20,965,000</td></tr></table></p><p>At the end of 2012, 55% of Vouchers issued were redeemed while 45% of approved Vouchers were not redeemed within the one year period of validity which is broadly typical for this form of innovation support.  For example, in the Netherlands where this scheme was originally established, 40% of issued Vouchers were never redeemed.  The Vouchers target small companies who may decide not to pursue the Voucher for a number of reasons including a change of company direction in the interim or a change of R&amp;amp;D or innovation ambitions.  The projected outturn for 2013 is positive with 1,007 Vouchers issued so far with a value of &euro;5,035,000.  In addition, 491 Vouchers have been redeemed to date with a value of &euro;2,360,337.  Under the current guidelines for the programme companies may make use of a maximum of three vouchers, one of which must be a 50-50 co-funded voucher between Enterprise Ireland and the company.  Excluding cancellations 3,337 companies have received vouchers to date, 76% received one voucher, 21% two vouchers and 3% have received 3 vouchers.</p><p>  The timescale between the award of an Innovation Voucher to a payment being drawn down differs as each project is distinct and the time to completion varies widely depending on the circumstances of the company, the knowledge provider and the nature of the project.  Many voucher projects are completed within a month of project commencement whereas others may take up to one year to complete depending on the nature of the work.  Vouchers are valid for one year from the date of issue and in general are redeemed within that period unless an extension is granted.  A formal procedure exists to enable companies to apply for an extension of the voucher, however, information on this specific data set is not available.  Enterprise Ireland believes that the number of Vouchers that have received an extension would represent a very small proportion of the total Vouchers redeemed.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland carry out regular independent programme evaluations to assess the effectiveness of all programmes.  The most recent external evaluation of the Innovation Voucher programme in 2012 indicated high levels of programme effectiveness and company satisfaction.  As part of this evaluation 94% of companies said that they would be willing to participate in an Innovation Voucher project in the future and 93% would be willing to recommend the programme to other businesses.  A further 82% stated that participation in the project has increased their desire to work with research partners in the future.  One of the key objectives of this programme is to improve links between industry and academia &ndash; these findings suggest that the Voucher programme has been successful in doing this.  The findings also demonstrate a very positive company experience and indicate how beneficial companies found the Innovation Voucher programme.</p><p>  The evaluation noted that the programme has delivered direct benefits for 69% of companies including new and improved products and processes to the company and to the commercial market.  The evaluation also found that the scheme achieved &euro;7.65 in company turnover per &euro;1.00 invested by Enterprise Ireland to date.  This evaluation also found that most companies were either satisfied or very satisfied with their partner institutes when asked about the following aspects:<blockquote>- overall role of the provider (72%)<br /><br />- partner institute&rsquo;s role in the setting up of the project (67%)<br /><br />- partner institute&rsquo;s role in supporting the project (68%)<br /><br />- partner institute&rsquo;s role in following up the partnership after completion (57%)</blockquote>  As a more immediate measure of the achievement of the Voucher&rsquo;s objectives, at the completion of an Innovation Voucher project the company must sign a declaration to confirm that the knowledge provider has completed the project to their satisfaction.  On receipt of the signed declaration Enterprise Ireland can issue a payment in respect of the Voucher.</p><p>  Innovation Voucher projects are independent projects carried out by the knowledge providers at the company&rsquo;s behest.  The company requires the skills and expertise which is available within the third level research community to help them address a particular technical issue or challenge that the company faces.  These projects are defined by companies and are in the research domain of the knowledge provider involved.  They are distinct and additional projects to the knowledge provider&rsquo;s core work and are paid for via the Innovation Vouchers.</p><p>  A full list of approved knowledge providers who have agreed to participate in the programme is available on the Innovation Voucher website .  This provides a directory of the skills and expertise available within each third level institute and a designated contact person for each knowledge provider.  Enterprise Ireland advise companies who have been awarded Vouchers to use this directory to assist them to contact and select the most appropriate knowledge provider for their project.  The competence of the knowledge provider in relation to providing knowledge to the companies participating in the Innovation Voucher programme is validated by the companies&rsquo; level of satisfaction and through Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s evaluation of the programme.</p><p>  The Innovation Voucher programme is restricted to small companies* (less than 50 employees) and medium size companies are not currently eligible to apply for a Voucher.  Specific data breaking down further the &quot;small company&quot; designation into further strata such as spin off companies or micro enterprises is not available.</p><p>*For the purposes of the Innovation Voucher Initiative, a Small Enterprise is defined as a company or (if part of a group) a group of companies where the total number of full-time employees in the company (or the entire group) is less than 50 and has either an annual turnover and/or an annual Balance Sheet total not exceeding &euro;10m.  (Exclusions: small enterprises in the agricultural sector are excluded in line with EU State aid guidelines).</p></reply>

The review assisted the Labour Court&rsquo;s deliberations as to whether any JLC should be abolished, maintained in its current form, amalgamated with another JLC or its establishment order amended and the Labour Court is required to make recommendations to the Minister to this effect.  On 1 October last, I published the Report of the Labour Court&rsquo;s Review of the 10 existing JLCs.</p><p>  In relation to the Retail Grocery JLC, the recommendation from the review was to confine the scope of the retained JLC to those establishments which are defined as multiples and symbol operators within the sector.  The review recommended that independent grocery shops, garage shops that do not have symbol shops attached, shops that are fish shops or butchers or cake and bread shops or vegetable shops should not be comprehended by the Retail Grocery JLC in future.</p><p>  It is important to remember that the JLC Establishment Orders envisaged will provide only a framework within which employers and employee representatives can come together voluntarily and negotiate terms and conditions of workers in their respective sector.  For vulnerable workers, the advantage of JLCs is that they see fair terms and conditions such as wage rates, sick pay etc. agreed and given effect by ERO, while for some employers, the advantage of the JLC system, based as it is on the principle of self-governance, means that they can agree and set minimum pay and conditions, agree on work practices which are custom-made to their industry &ndash; a flexibility which cannot be achieved by primary legislation.  Where both parties to a JLC see commonality of purpose and outcome then an agreement may emerge.</p><p>  The net effect of changing the scope in the ways recommended is intended to reduce the overall size of the JLC to more closely match the majority share of the competitive grocery market; to extend the scope to cover all of the relevant employees that fall within the remit of the JLC and to make it more flexible and simpler to follow and to enforce.  While some shops that are currently covered by the JLC would be excluded, these were not considered by the review to be a significant proportion of the main competitive market of the sector as a whole. </p><p>  The Office of the Parliamentary Council has been requested to prepare new orders to give effect to the Labour Court recommendations.  In addition, I am considering legal advice received from the Attorney General and I hope to deal with this issue and other establishment orders shortly.</p></reply>

In this regard, as part of assisting the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s oversight of exchequer expenditure, Government Departments, including my own Department, are required to prepare a monthly profile of expected expenditure, including capital expenditure, from their Votes at the beginning of each year.  It is the case that as the financial year progresses there can be a number of reasons why monthly expenditure may deviate from the initial monthly profile, resulting in capital underspends or overspends at the end of a particular month. </p><p>  Capital expenditure from my Department&rsquo;s Vote is essentially expended by the enterprise development agencies such as IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation as well as the County Enterprise Boards.  Typically this funding is by way of grant provision to private industry and to the higher education institutions.  The drawdown of exchequer financial support by companies or other bodies, such as the higher education institutions, is demand-led and funding is provided on the basis of matured liabilities.  It will be appreciated, therefore, that such funding provision can only take place if the entity in question has progressed a given project in line with the agreement entered into with the State.  In addition, there can also be factors such as timing issues relating to the finalisation of legal agreements or the securing of matching private funding by the successful grant applicant to ensure eligibility to drawdown the grant.  Given these factors, it is important to point out that the &euro;23 million referred to by the Deputy represents just 4.7% of the overall Departmental capital budget for 2013.</p><p>  Insofar as 2012 situation is concerned, the total Government capital carryover of &euro;107.2 million referred to by the Deputy included an amount of &euro;25 million in capital carryover in respect of my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  I would point out that as part of the conditions associated with any annual capital carryover provision, a Ministerial order approved and signed by the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform, requires that carryover money must be expended in the early part of the following financial year to support on-going activity.  Such carryover provision must be exhausted prior to expending any of the capital funding provision approved in the Vote allocation as published on Budget Day. </p><p>  As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s request for a breakdown of capital projects in this area, it is the case that as there can be several thousand live grant awards and initiatives being supported across the enterprise agencies at any particular point in time, it would be not feasible to provide the Deputy with specific details regarding the status of projects per profiled expenditure.  The capital expenditure programme overseen by my Department is undoubtedly a key element in supporting Ireland&rsquo;s jobs, enterprise and research activities.  The total capital allocation of &euro;479.5m for 2013, which includes the aforementioned &euro;25m in carryover from 2012, represents a very significant and vital stimulus in the on-going and increasingly successful challenge of promoting enterprise and creating jobs for our citizens.</p></reply>

By implementing the 2013 Action<i> Plans for Jobs</i> and the new 2014 <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i> , to be developed in the New Year, the Government is confident that further growth in employment in both sectors will be achieved. </p><p><b><i>Manufacturing</i></b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>Job Gains</td><td>12,800</td><td>10,299</td><td>6,919</td><td>8,151</td><td>11,359</td><td>10,704</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2007</td><td>2008</td><td>2009</td><td>2010</td><td>2011</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>Job Losses</td><td>-15,108</td><td>-20,194</td><td>-28,525</td><td>-14,108</td><td>-11,004</td><td>-7,987</td></tr></table></p><p><b><i>Financial Services </i></b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>Job Gains</td><td>3,360</td><td>2,298</td><td>1,027</td><td>1,643</td><td>2,398</td><td>2,505</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2007</td><td>2008</td><td>2009</td><td>2010</td><td>2011</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>Job Losses</td><td>-565</td><td>-1,247</td><td>-1,973</td><td>-1,677</td><td>-1,245</td><td>-1,855</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Global Pharmaceutical industry is experiencing a number of challenges due to patent expiry and over-capacity in manufacturing and Pfizer is no exception.  Greater efficiencies and competitiveness are continually being sought across all Pfizer&rsquo;s sites in order to compete in the changing landscape.  It is regrettable that this process has resulted in 150 job losses in Newbridge.  The relevant State agencies will work closely to ensure the best possible outcome for the affected staff. </p><p>  In relation to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, or EGF, the Managing Authority for that Fund is part of the Department of Education and Skills.  That Authority monitors collective redundancies in order to assess whether the strict requirements and criteria can be met to make sustainable applications for EU co-financing of approved programmes of guidance, training, education and enterprise supports through the Fund.  Ireland has made seven successful EGF applications to date since 2009, assisting over 9,760 redundant workers affected by the adverse impacts of globalisation.  Applications are normally made where, inter alia, at least 500 workers are made redundant within prescribed reference periods.</p><p>  In this context, my Department have been in touch with the EGF Managing Authority, who, in turn, have been in contact with IDA Ireland and contacts are being made with the Pfizer company seeking to ascertain in the first instance whether the conditions may exist whereby a sustainable application for EGF co-financing assistance can be progressed in due course, including potentially on a broader sector wide or exceptional circumstances basis, under the terms of the new EGF Regulation coming into force from 2014. </p><p>  I am informed that the total EU funding available annually under the new funding EGF round 2014 &ndash; 2020 has been reduced by 70% and care must be taken to ensure that only those applications with the most favourable prospects of success in support of redundant workers are submitted by Member States.</p></reply>

Accordingly, it is something to be facilitated and encouraged.  However, we must also ensure that the right of free movement is used for the right motives and is not abused through unjustified claiming of benefits.  Restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian citizens accessing the Irish labour-market were lifted with effect from 1 January 2012 and so citizens of those countries are already entitled to live and work in Ireland.  Restrictions on these citizens will be lifted in the UK and other countries from 1 January 2014.</p><p>  The UK recently announced a series of measures in relation to the welfare entitlements of EU migrants.  These include a ban on EU migrants receiving out-of-work benefits for the first three months of residence and restrictions on the claiming of jobseeker's allowance for more than six months, unless a person can prove that they have made serious efforts to secure employment and that they have a genuine prospect of securing work.  In relation to the former, under the EU Residence Directive, member states already have the right to refuse support under their social assistance systems to certain migrants for the first three months of residence.</p><p>  Access to social assistance payments in Ireland is subject to the habitual residence condition.  Accordingly, those receiving such payments are deemed to have established their centre of interest in Ireland and to have significant contacts with the country.  As well as satisfying habitual residence conditions a person claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance must, inter alia, be available for and genuinely seeking full-time employment.  Any person who does not satisfy these conditions will not receive a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment.</p><p>   I am satisfied that the provisions of the Irish welfare system, and EU regulations in this area, are being used to the fullest extent possible to deter unjustifiable claiming of benefits in this country.  I am not proposing any changes in practises here at present but I will continue to monitor developments here and in the UK and other countries, with a view to establishing potential implications and learning for this jurisdiction.</p></reply>

As at end November 2013, a total of 486 schools, including both primary and secondary, had participated in the scheme.</p><p>  Host organisations participate in the scheme on a voluntary basis and receive no payment or other benefit from the State in respect of their participation in the scheme.  I believe that in these circumstances the organisations concerned have a legitimate expectation that their participation on the scheme will remain confidential, and accordingly do not propose as a matter of course, to publish names of any host organisations.  JobBridge is a voluntary scheme.  Host organisations are not obliged to offer an intern employment at the end of their internship.  However, a six-month cooling-off period applies where the host organisation cannot advertise for another intern for the same area of activity.  This is to prevent potential displacement.</p><p>  As at end of November, 2013, there were over 6,500 jobseekers participating on the scheme.  Of which, there were 393 participants on the &euro;100 jobseekers rate and 739 participants on the &euro;144 jobseekers rate.  An additional &euro;50 weekly top-up payment is made to all participants.</p><p>  JobBridge is administered and monitored by the Department&rsquo;s regional offices comprising over 2000 staff.  These are supported by a central JobBridge team comprising 6 staff and the National Contact Centre comprising 18 staff.  It is worth highlighting that over 4,000 on-site monitoring visits have been conducted by Departmental officers to ensure on-going compliance with scheme criteria.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and thus increase employment.  Increasing full-time employment opportunities will benefit both the unemployed and those who are currently under-employed.  In terms of measures such as access to training and education, internships and other labour market interactions, government policy is to prioritise these opportunities for people who are full-time unemployed.</p><p>  However, young people who are currently underemployed and seeking alternative employment can avail of the public employment services at their local Intreo office where a range of job-search facilities are available and where vacancies from the JobsIreland website are advertised.</p></reply>

The person concerned was refused carer&rsquo;s allowance on the grounds that she was not providing full time care and attention as required.  She was notified of this decision on 11 April 2013.  The person in question requested a review of this decision and file was forwarded to a social welfare inspector (SWI) for assessment of the level of care being provided and for a means assessment and confirmation that all the conditions for receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance were satisfied.  The person in question was invited to attend for interview with the SWI but failed to attend without providing good reason.</p><p>  Following the review the decision remained unchanged.  The person in question was notified of the review outcome on the 14th of October 2013 and of her right to appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) within 21 days.  There is no record of an appeal being registered in this case.</p><p>  If the person in question wishes to make a new application for carer&rsquo;s allowance, she may do so by completing and submitting a claim form.  If she makes a new application, it is likely that the application will need to be referred to a SWI for investigation.  In that event, it is important that the person in question complies with all reasonable requests from the SWI in relation to the investigation of her application for carer&rsquo;s allowance.</p></reply>

In other cases PPS Numbers are issued following a controlled allocation procedure which takes approximately 20 minutes and involves personal attendance at one of the Department's PPS Number allocation centres, the completion of a written application form, the submission of appropriate identity documents and the proving of identity.</p><p>  In circumstances where a person is not resident in the State, but requires a PPS Number, s/he, or someone acting on his or her behalf, must apply by post to the Department submitting the required documentation.  This is the case in respect of the application referred to by the Deputy. </p><p>  The Department processes some 17,000 of these applications annually.  The vast majority of such requests are for reasons such as probate or property purchase.  However some requests are from individuals who are employed outside of the State by an Irish employer and require a PPS Number in that context.  Where these requests are identified, they are given priority by the Department.  Apart from these, requests are dealt with in the date order in which they are received.  It normally takes between 3-4 weeks to finalise the allocation of such PPS Numbers.  In all cases, once it becomes apparent that a person will require the allocation of a PPS Number, I would urge that the application be submitted immediately, rather than waiting until the last minute, in order to ensure that it will be available when required. </p><p>  The application referred to was received in my Department on the 18<sup>th</sup> of November and a PPS Number was allocated on the 4<sup>th</sup> of December.</p></reply>

The terms of reference for this group are to review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the implementation of the Guarantee.</p><p>  The Department held a stakeholders&rsquo; consultation forum in relation to the Guarantee on October 14, and has also invited further submissions from the bodies that attended. </p><p>  The Department of Social Protection has also requested the assistance of the OECD in developing the implementation plan.  In particular the OECD has been asked to identify best international practice and how it might best be applied to implementation of the Youth Guarantee in Ireland.  A delegation from the OECD has already met with stakeholders at the forum mentioned above as well as with a range of relevant public bodies.  They will be presenting an interim report this week. </p><p>  The development of the plan is also drawing on expert work already carried out by the European Commission over the last few years, and in particular the Commission Staff Working Document (SWD) accompanying the Proposal for a Council Recommendation on Establishing a Youth Guarantee, published in December 2012. </p><p>  The Department appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee (JOC) on Education and Social Protection on November 6th in order to provide a comprehensive update on the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.

The financial data for the Department of Social Protection contained in the November Exchequer Returns indicated an underspend of &euro;4 million (&euro;3.577 million rounded to the nearest million) in capital expenditure in the year to date.  This data was not final as it was compiled prior to the month end and was estimated based on the best information available at the time of preparation.   </p><p>  Final data in relation to the position at the end of November is now available.  This shows that capital expenditure at end November was &euro;2.143 million under profile.  Capital expenditure in the Department relates to two main areas of expenditure, namely, buildings and computer hardware/e-Government.  Capital expenditure on buildings provides for the costs of new buildings ('fit outs' of new leased buildings) and the refurbishment of other buildings necessary to meet the accommodation demands on the Department.  Current capital projects arise principally from the continued rollout of the accommodation element of the Intreo programme in a very wide range of locations throughout the country as well as Public Service Card centres.  These projects are being progressed in conjunction with OPW and includes acquiring new Local Office accommodation and in placing contracts for refurbishment of existing offices.  At end November, capital expenditure on buildings was &euro;0.827 million over profile and reflects the considerable progress which has been made.</p><p>  Capital expenditure on computer hardware/e-Government was &euro;2.97 million behind profile at the end of November.  This was mainly due to lower than profiled expenditure in a number of demand led expenditure items including routers and switches, servers and scanner hardware.  In addition a significant invoice (over &euro;1 million) for the purchase of computer storage equipment was not received in time for payment in November.  Finally, a sum of &euro;1.05m in capital carry-over was allocated to the Department in 2013.  This has been entirely expended on buildings, principally Intreo and public service card centres, and is not included in the earlier buildings financial data outlined above.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding the positions of the Department (who now has responsibility for CE) in rejecting that liability for these costs to be met from public funds, this matter has been the subject of discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the unions representing CE supervisors.  In the event that funding was required from the Department of Social Protection, the implementation of the claim is not considered sustainable in light of the current and ongoing fiscal environment and the requirement to contain and reduce public expenditure.  The costs of the introduction of any scheme are likely to be of the order of &euro;3m per annum with retrospective costs of the order of at least &euro;30m.</p><p>  It should also note that the Department of Social Protection is not the employer of CE supervisors and such employees are not public servants.

Cognisant of the potential of these events to be of wider tourist interest, I continue to encourage the co-ordination of organisations in Waterford, Killaloe and Ballina in emphasising their Viking heritage and links to Brian Bor&uacute;, as well as with Dublin City Council and groups from Clontarf, to maximise the potential benefit to these areas from increased tourism. </p><p>  The particular funding allocation for commemorative events in 2014 has not been finalised as yet and I must take into account the need to commemorate important events, including the centenary of the founding of Cumann na mBan, the Curragh Mutiny, the Howth, Kilcoole and Larne gun-running, and, of course, the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War.

In all Member States, biofuels will be the largest contributor to meeting this obligation and all biofuels used in doing so must comply with a strict set of sustainability criteria.  The Government shares the concerns expressed that biofuel production and its use, unless properly regulated, may not deliver the required greenhouse gas savings and could impact negatively on food production and on food prices.  My Department has been in regular contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, on the issue of sustainability and land-use implications of biofuels, including food security and food production.</p><p>  In light of these concerns, during discussions on the European Commission's proposal to address the risk of indirect land-use change (ILUC), Ireland has argued for a restriction on first generation biofuels that can contribute to the 2020 renewable energy targets and for incentives to encourage the development of advanced biofuels that do not affect food production.  Our preference is to see as low a cap on biofuels with a risk of ILUC effects as is realistically achievable in order to mitigate the potential conflict between biofuel use in the EU and land use in the developing world.  Ireland will re-emphasise the importance of these concerns at the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council meeting taking place on 12 December.</p><p>  As regards biofuel use in Ireland, based on figures provided by the National Oil Reserve Agency (NORA) to my Department, over 16 per cent of the biofuel used in 2012 was produced indigenously with the remainder imported from a number of different countries.  Currently, there is only one biofuel producer of scale in Ireland and it produces biodiesel from waste materials, such as used cooking oil and tallow.  It produced over 99.75 per cent of the indigenously produced biofuels placed on the Irish market last year.  One other Irish producer produced a small amount of biodiesel from rapeseed. </p><p>  Table 2 of the Biofuel Obligation Scheme Annual Report for 2012 produced by NORA provides a breakdown of the biofuel placed on the Irish market since the sustainability criteria were fully applied in 2012.  It also sets out all the countries from which the biofuels were sourced.</p></reply>

I have stated on a number of occasions that transparency in the development of the framework is crucial and that the views of local communities must be at the heart of the transition to renewable energy.  The Stage 1 consultation, which involved the publication of Stage 1 information and summary documents, ran from 23 October to 22 November, and gave all interested parties an opportunity, at the outset, to present their views on how we should develop national policy to realise the opportunity to trade renewable energy with other EU Member States and, in the first instance, with the United Kingdom.</p><p>  My Department received nearly 1,400 responses to the consultation and is now in the process of assessing the responses to inform the development of the framework.  In order to complete Stage 1 of the development of the framework, taking into account the feedback received, my Department will now prepare the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) scoping report.  The process will then move to Stage 2 with the publication of the scoping report for public consultation in Quarter 1, 2014.  National press advertisements and updates on my Department's website will inform all stakeholders of the commencement of the Stage 2 consultation.  During Stage 2 a report on the Stage 1 consultation will also be published providing an overview of the consultation process, feedback and analysis. </p><p>  During Stage 3 the draft policy, the Environmental Report (on which the Strategic Environmental Assessment will be based) and Natura Impact Statement (on which the Appropriate Assessment will be based) will all be published and a public consultation will provide all stakeholders a further opportunity to contribute to or make observations on the development of the framework.</p></reply>

These projects are aiming to supply the domestic Irish market and contribute to achieving 40% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020, as part of our overall legally binding target of 16% of energy from renewable sources by 2020.</p><p>  As regards projects of a significant scale specifically for renewable export, it is important to note that any wind energy export project must await the conclusion of an Inter-Governmental Agreement, the development of the Renewable Energy Export Policy and Development Framework and the obtaining of the necessary consents from An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the project.  The Memorandum of Understanding on energy co-operation, signed in January of this year by the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Mr. Edward Davey MP, and I, sent a strong signal of our shared interest in developing the opportunity to export green electricity from Ireland to Britain and will result in completion of consideration of how Irish renewable energy resources, onshore and offshore, might be developed to the mutual benefit of both countries.  An agreed programme of work to this end, including a full technical and economic analysis, is underway with the ambition to settle on an Inter-Governmental Agreement in 2014.  A key objective, from an Irish Government perspective, is to realise the potential for investment, jobs and growth.  The amount of energy to be procured by the United Kingdom and the mechanisms for sharing the resultant economic benefits, including an appropriate return to the Exchequer, are among the matters to be addressed ahead of signing any Inter-Governmental Agreement.</p></reply>

No other electricity supply company has to date chosen to enter the domestic market and to offer a microgeneration feed-in-tariff on a commercial basis, although the Commission for Energy Regulation invited them to do so.  In addition, no company has opted to offer, on a commercial basis, a feed-in-tariff for microgeneration to the commercial and industrial sectors.</p><p>  Currently, a number of supports are available for commercial micro and small scale generation.  All renewable electricity generating technologies can avail of tax relief on capital directly invested in renewable energy assets under Section 486B of the Tax Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 (as amended).  This allows an investor to claim the lesser of 50% of all capital expenditure (excluding lands) or &euro;9.525 million for a single project.  Investment by a company or group under this scheme is capped at &euro;12.7 million per annum.  Corporate investors in renewable energy projects can claim tax relief on equity investment in capital assets.  Other tax based support measures include the <i>Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme</i> which allows individual investors to obtain income tax relief on investments in renewable energy in each tax year.  This scheme supersedes the previous Business Expansion Scheme.  It provides a minimum tax relief of 30% with an additional 11% accruing at the end of the third and final year if the business has expanded to employ a designated number of people (or if the investment was used for R&amp;amp;D).  The scheme has an investment cap of &euro;750,000 and is thus suited to commercial small scale generation projects.  An Accelerated Capital Allowance scheme also allows companies to offset the cost of investment in qualifying renewable energy generation technologies against their tax liabilities in Year 1 rather than over a more prolonged period of years, thus aiding their cash flow.</p><p>  Analysis of the potential of microgeneration, using technologies such as solar and small scale wind and hydro, has been carried out by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  During 2011 and 2012 SEAI carried out microgeneration field trials, a final report on which was submitted to my Department earlier this year.  A progress report on Ireland's National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP), as required by the EU Renewable Energy Directive, is currently being completed.  The findings of this progress report will provide a suitable context for reviewing the potential for cost effective support of microgeneration, and whether any such support should be tariff, or non-tariff, based.</p></reply>

However, the technologies underpinning the sector are at a relatively early stage of development with the result that there is uncertainty surrounding the cost structure and the supports required to support the sector's development.  Therefore, further detailed economic analysis of the biogas sector and its supply chains, from its production from different forms of biomass through to its distribution and use, will be required before any additional supports for biogas and biomethane appropriate to Ireland can be considered.  This analysis will be carried forward, taking account of the cross-sectoral benefits that a biogas sector could deliver, in the context of implementing the forthcoming Bioenergy Strategy.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  The area referred to by the Deputy is covered under that Scheme and therefore all fixed residences and businesses located within the area are eligible to avail of the NBS service from &quot;3&quot;, the NBS service provider.  The broadband service contracted under the NBS is a basic, affordable, scalable product in keeping with EU State Aid clearance for the Scheme in September 2007.  Under the terms of the NBS contract, the NBS mobile wireless service is required to offer minimum download and upload speeds of 2.3Mbps and 1.4Mbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 18:1.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This will be achieved by providing:<blockquote>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<br /><br />- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</blockquote>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.   With particular reference to mobile telecommunications services, I note that a number of mobile operators have made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings, including one operator who has announced its intention to ensure that all of its customer base has access to 3G.</p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is optimised in terms of resources and focus to maximise the response to social housing need.  This must be achieved in a context in which public expenditure necessarily continues to be constrained.  Nonetheless, in July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. </p><p>  In addition to the &euro;525.8 million in housing programme expenditure provided for in my Department&rsquo;s Abridged Estimate for 2014, Budget 2014 provides a further &euro;50 million to fund infrastructural investment primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million for the State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and an additional &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants.  When this is taken into account, funding for housing for next year is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.   </p><p>  Delivery of social housing continues to be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  In addition, my Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes.  Approved Housing Bodies will also play a key role in 2014 in the delivery of social housing and in particular in their capacity to attract external financial investment.   </p><p>  In spite of our challenging economic circumstances, I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2013 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units, and it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will also be provided for social housing in 2014.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-10a.718.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121000067#WRR01300"><p>It is a statutory function of each individual fire authority, under Section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981, to provide a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of a premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable.  Cork County Council&rsquo;s fire services are provided primarily through a retained staffing system with a core of full time officers.  Retained fire-fighters are employees of fire authorities, and are organised to provide a fire service through a network of 21 fire stations located throughout the county. </p><p>  The <i>Keeping Communities Safe</i> (KCS) policy document, which I published as national policy in February 2013, sets out standards and norms for developing and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of fire services in Ireland.  The approach in KCS is based on an &lsquo;area risk categorisation&rsquo; system which will be applied across the country by all fire services, including in Cork County.  This will result in fire station areas being graded across five bands from very high to very low risk categories.  The fire service approach to risk management, including response in terms of numbers of fire appliances and fire crews in an area, is to correspond to this risk categorisation. </p><p>  I understand that the risk categorisation process has been completed for the Cork County Area and appropriate risk designations for each station area in Cork County have been determined.   To maintain local political accountability for fire services to the community, Section 26 of the Fire Services Acts provides that it is a reserved function of local authorities which maintain a fire brigade to adopt &lsquo;fire and emergency operations plans&rsquo; indicating the provision made in respect of organisation, appliances, equipment, fire stations, training, operational procedure and any such matters as may be relevant.  It is expected that the risk categorisation mentioned above will inform the next iteration of Section 26 plans.   </p><p>  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each county and city manager is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authority for which he or she is responsible.  Accordingly, the deployment of fire brigade staff in Cork County is a matter in the first instance for the management of Cork County Council. </p><p>  Since the embargo on the filling of public service posts was introduced on 24 March 2009, local authorities seek permission from my Department to fill staffing vacancies that arise within a fire service.  All requests are considered on a case by case basis, having due regard to maintaining appropriate services within budgetary and staffing constraints.  Fire-fighters numbers (1,170 full-time and 2,063 retained) have been protected from the impact of the recruitment embargo and the numbers have not changed since 2008, in contrast to the general trend in the local government sector, which has seen an approximate 25% decrease in staffing levels, including among senior fire officers.     </p><p>  I understand that the position in relation to staffing in Cork Fire Service is kept under constant review by Cork County Council management.</p></reply>

Details regarding that review are available on my Department&rsquo;s website  and the period for public submissions closed on 27 September 2013.  Earlier this year, I asked the Housing &amp;amp; Sustainable Communities Agency to conduct a standalone review of the shared ownership scheme, including identification of the main difficulties and recommendations for mitigating measures.  I have received an in initial draft of the review from the Agency and I intend to issue a circular letter to local authorities imminently with interim recommendations arising from the review. </p><p>  A number of issues have been identified that need further detailed financial analysis in order to fully assess the impact on local authority finances of possible mitigating measures.  This additional work is underway and I expect to make further recommendations to bring the review process to a conclusion in the near future.  Also, on foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears, the Government launched a mortgage to rent scheme, in respect of distressed mortgages in the commercial sector, on a pilot basis in February 2012.  This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners. </p><p>  A pilot mortgage to rent scheme for the most acute cases of local authority mortgage arrears which was launched earlier in 2013, in Westmeath County and Dublin City Councils, has now been completed.  It is my intention to extend this scheme throughout the local authority sector in the near future, as part of the package of options available to local authorities to deal with mortgage distress, including in the case of shared ownership customers.</p></reply>

For example, the process provides for a 60 day decision period and a 28 day cooling off period within the timeframe of the scheme.

The selection of polling stations is then a matter for the returning officer. </p><p>  It is open to local authorities to review their polling schemes as necessary in accordance with the Electoral Act 1992.  Where a new local electoral area splits an existing polling district, the local authority should adjoin that area to an existing polling district or constitute it as a polling district in its own right and appoint a polling place for it.  These temporary arrangements should then continue in force until the next polling scheme for the county comes into effect. I will make the necessary orders for the new local electoral areas in Sligo in good time before the 2014 local elections.</p></reply>

Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014, the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund, as General Purpose Grants.  In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing.   </p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised.  The establishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisational and financial challenges in 2014.  Service provision responsibilities will shift from the local authorities to Irish Water, infrastructure will be transferred, financing arrangements will alter and local authorities will operate on behalf of Irish Water under Service Level Agreements.  These changes must be managed.   </p><p>  In this context, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015.  This approach allows maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax in 2014 in the form of General Purpose Grants, with a priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases.  In allocating general purpose funding for 2014 I am seeking to ensure, in combination with the funding being made available through Irish Water, that these elements of support for local authorities would be maintained around 2013 levels.  It will be a matter for each local authority to determine how best to use General Purpose Grant revenue in line with local priorities and circumstances.     </p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates.  A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.</p></reply>

The Revised Estimates for Public Services 2013, published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform earlier this year, provide for gross capital expenditure of &euro;726 million in respect of my Department in 2013.  At the end of November, capital spending by my Department was behind the profile established earlier in the year.  Expenditure under the Water Services Investment Programme in 2013 has been less than anticipated due to slower than expected progress on water services capital projects during the year; work on the implementation of the Water Sector Reform Programme, in particular on the establishment of Irish Water, has required considerable input from the local authorities and this has impacted on the progress of the Programme.  In addition, drawdown by local authorities of housing funding has been slower than expected. </p><p>  I expect that there will be some further expenditure under the water, housing and other capital programmes before year end. Consideration is being given, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to the appropriate use of potential savings arising on the Vote.  Finally, of the total of &euro;107.2 million in capital carryover funding from 2012 across Government Departments, &euro;43 million in additional funding has been made available to my Department for investment in the Housing (&euro;22m), Environment and Waste Management (&euro;10m), Local Government (&euro;2m) and Community and Rural Development (&euro;9m) programmes.  To end November, &euro;35.5m of the allocated &euro;43m has been invested in these programmes.</p></reply>

The proposals for an amended EIA Directive are currently the subject of negotiations between the Council and the European Parliament.  If and when the amending Directive is adopted, any necessary consequential changes to Irish planning legislation and guidelines will be made.</p></reply>

If satisfactory resolution cannot be achieved through dialogue and negotiation the option of seeking civil legal remedy may be considered. </p><p>Given that a clear statutory framework is in place, I have no proposals for the introduction of a mediation service along the lines suggested.  My Department continues to liaise with local authorities in relation to significant building control issues that have arisen in a number of multi-unit developments across the country, including those instances raised in the question.  In this regard, local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Safety Act 1981, the Building Control Act 1990 and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be relevant in relation to fire safety arrangements in residential buildings, and have successfully used such powers to deal with a number of instances of non-compliance. </p><p>  I have also amended the Building Control Regulations to require, in respect of building projects commencing on and from I March 2014, lodgement of design documentation, inspections during construction, overseen by registered construction professionals, and certificates of compliance signed by designers, builders and assigned certifiers.  The new regulations are designed to ensure that competence and professionalism become part and parcel of building projects generally and will lead to a new era of quality in our construction industry and ensure that the legacy of defective buildings seen in recent years will not recur.</p></reply>

Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories in the 2011 survey as follows:<blockquote>- Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;<br /><br />- Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;<br /><br />- Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and<br /><br /> - Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.</blockquote>  The 2012 categorisation methodology for the survey was different to that which was used in 2011.  That earlier categorisation related largely to the level of on-site activity at the time the 2011 survey was carried out and had less to do with the physical character of a development.  The 2012 survey was based purely and objectively on the actual state of completion of a development.  Only developments that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &quot;seriously problematic condition&quot;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included. </p><p>  No estate called &lsquo;Riverwalk&rsquo; in Ratoath was identified as falling under any of the above categories in either the 2011 or 2012 survey.  Each local authority has a nominated Unfinished Estates official whose contact details are on and queries regarding the status of relevant developments should, in the first instance, be directed to the relevant local authority.</p></reply>

In that regard I am further informed that Garda data shows a decrease in burglaries in the Coolock Garda District, which includes Dublin 17, in line with the national trend.  As the Deputy may be aware the latest crime statistics show that the rate of burglary has decreased by 8.9% nationally for twelve months ending 30 June 2013 and this underlines the impact being made by Garda&iacute; under Operation Fiacla.  As part of the measures which are coordinated under Operation Fiacla, Operation Acer is in force throughout the Dublin Metropolitan Region, including Coolock.  It is an intelligence driven operation and includes analysis led checkpoints and patrols to target specific areas and case manage targeted offenders.  These arrangements are kept under review to ensure adjustments are made to maintain the effective focus of the operation.</p><p>  Operation Acer operates alongside ongoing community policing measures, including problem solving with the community and providing crime prevention advice and assistance to victims of burglary.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>In this regard I am advised that a recent crime prevention leaflet drop in the area has been well received in the community.There is also full engagement with local Neighbourhood Watch and other community groups in the area.</p><p>  Insofar as the question of the sale of stolen gold as referred to by the Deputy is concerned, I am informed by the Garda authorities that, where outlets or businesses trading in gold are identified, Garda&iacute; conduct enquiries to establish their bona fides, and where there are suspicions of criminality the matter is fully investigated and the appropriate action taken.  The Deputy will also be aware that in June 2012 I published a report on the criminal justice aspects of the cash for gold trade.  The Report prepared by my Department is available on www.justice.ie.  I requested the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence to consider the content of the report, to ensure that it obtains the views of all relevant interested parties and that it makes such report and recommendations to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to Government as it deems proportionate and appropriate in the public interest.  I received the Committee's response on 30 May 2013, and it is currently under consideration.</p></reply>

However, I must draw the Deputy's attention to the official recorded crime statistics, published by the Central Statistics Office, which show reductions in 12 out of the 14 categories for which figures are given in the twelve months ending 30 June 2013. In relation to concerns about street crime the figures show a substantial reduction in public order offences of 14.6%. In addition, the incidence of assault causing harm fell by 9.3%. </p><p>  The commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackling violent crimes is set out in the National Policing Plan for 2013 which includes objectives to address all forms of violent crime through strong enforcement and crime prevention strategies, working with all relevant partners. In this regard there is continuing Garda participation in a wide range of local fora, including Joint Policing Committees,  partnership programmes such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch as well as recent innovations such as the Text Alert Scheme and the development of Garda community clinics.</p><p>  The existing legislative framework provides substantial provisions to counteract this sort of crime including strong provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts and the Intoxication Liquor Acts.   In particular, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides the Garda&iacute; with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking and the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 gives further powers to the Garda&iacute; to tackle misuse of alcohol. These include provisions to allow Garda&iacute; seize alcohol to prevent underage drinking in public places and to forestall public disorder or damage to property.</p><p>  In relation to violence aimed at the Garda&iacute; themselves, there is specific legislation in place to deal with assaults of, or threats to, emergency workers in front line positions, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This is contained in section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) 1994 Act (as amended by section 185 Criminal Justice Act 2006) and provides penalties on summary conviction of a fine or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or both or, on conviction on indictment, of a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or both.  </p><p>  I am confident that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to deliver a robust and appropriate response to violent crime. In this regard I am advised that local Garda Management closely monitors the allocation of all resources in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.</p><p>  An Inter-Departmental Committee on the Convention is monitoring the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  The Committee has identified as part of its work programme, issues to be considered by various Government Departments.  It is a matter for those Departments to determine whether any actions are required in relation to these issues in advance of ratification and report back to the Committee.  This work is ongoing in all Departments.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, is also assisting it to assess remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure that all outstanding issues will be comprehensively addressed.</p><p>  As regards my own Department one of the key requirements is the enactment of capacity legislation.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a Bill that is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Assisted Decision - Making (Capacity) Bill, published on 17 July 2013, provides a series of options to support people with impaired capacity to make decisions and to exercise their basic rights, in line with the principles of the UN Convention.  It undertakes a comprehensive reform of existing legislation governing capacity.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>The second stage debate of the Bill began in the D&aacute;il on 3 December and will be completed on 11th or 12th December 2013.</p><p>  The enactment of this legislation is just one of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed to enable ratification by the State of the Convention.</p></reply>

The Act sets out the circumstances when temporary release may be provided and what matters must be taken into account. </p><p>  Before a final determination a number of factors may be taken into account including:<blockquote>  - the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relates;<br /><br />  - the sentence concerned and any recommendation made by the Court in relation to the sentence imposed;<br /><br />  - the period of the sentence served by the person;<br /><br />  - the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released;<br /><br />  - the person's previous criminal record;<br /><br />  - the risk of the person failing to return to prison at the expiration of the period of temporary release;<br /><br />  - the conduct of the person while in custody or while previously on temporary release;<br /><br />  - any report or recommendation made by the Governor, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a Probation &amp;amp; Welfare Officer, or any other person whom the Minister considers may be of assistance in coming to a decision as to whether to grant temporary release;<br /><br />  - the risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary release;<br /><br />  - the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary release;<br /><br />  - the likelihood that a period of temporary release might accelerate the person's reintegration into society or improve his prospects of obtaining employment.</blockquote>  Temporary release assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release and in administering short sentences, and is an incentive to prisoners. It is an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence.  Each application for temporary release for whatever reason, including those referred to in the Deputy's question, is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made.</p><p>  The Act also provides that,  I may consider prisoners for temporary release where I am of the opinion that it is necessary and expedient in order to ensure the good government of the prison concerned and to maintain good order as well as humane conditions within the prison concerned.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have announced a number of initiatives and programmes to alleviate over-crowding in the prison system. The Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan (2012-2015), which is publicly available, outlines a number of measures to be undertaken including the Community Return Scheme, a closer working relationship with the Probation Service and a more structured approach to Temporary Release.</p><p>  The Community Return Scheme, which was first piloted in 2011,  has been rolled out nationally across all prisons.  Almost 750 prisoners have taken part in the initiative since it commenced with 526 prisoners now having completed the programme. On 4  December  2013, there were 117 prisoners on the Scheme.</p><p>  In addition to Community Returns, the Unlocking Community Alternatives Scheme (UCAS) and the Community Support Scheme have been set up in Cork and Mountjoy Prisons in an attempt to address the recidivism levels of those serving sentences of under 12 months from those catchment areas. The UCAS and Community Support Scheme groups are comprised of a number of prison-based personnel, representing the discipline grades and therapeutic services, as well as Community Support Workers based in the community. These Schemes will see a focus on working with short term sentenced prisoners - assisting with issues such as housing, medical care, substance abuse, training needs, etc. The aim is to increase support to prisoners - prior to their release from prison, upon their release and then for a period after their release in order to help break the cycle of re-offending. Discussions have been ongoing, in this regard, with a number of external agencies and it is hoped that further initiatives will commence in the near future.</p></reply>

The various sections of the Charities Act are subject to implementation through commencement orders.  Sections that it was possible to commence in advance of the establishment of the Charities Regulatory Authority, as provided for under the Act, have been commenced.  The remainder will be commenced following the establishment of the Authority. </p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the full implementation of the Charities Act, including the establishment of the Authority and Register of Charities, has resource implications that had to be examined in the context of the urgent need to reduce government expenditure. I delayed bringing this legislation into force in order to consider how best to achieve the objectives of the Act in this context.  It remains an objective of the Government to strengthen the regulation of the charitable sector in effective and proportionate ways. To advance this, a public and stakeholder consultation on the implementation of the Charities Act 2009, and the establishment of a Register of Charities, was carried out by my Department earlier this year and published in July. At that time the Government also approved my plans to proceed with the establishment of an independent Charities Regulatory Authority under the terms of the 2009 Charities Act. It is envisaged that the new Authority will come into operation in 2014.    <b><font color="#000080">    </font></b></p></reply>

The CDT and NHCC comprise a range of government and non-government bodies working towards better joined up services on homelessness and the implementation of the National Homeless Strategy. The Irish Prison Service is also represented on seven of the Regional Homeless Consultative Fora established under the provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act, 2009. Through these fora, the Irish Prison Service, in partnership with the Probation Service, has been working to ensure that the unique circumstances of homeless offenders are taken into account in the development and provision of preventative and other supporting actions for persons who are vulnerable to homelessness.  </p><p>  With regard to women prisoners specifically, in recent years, in addition to the direct work of probation officers on accommodation issues, a weekly clinic service has been provided in the D&oacute;chas Centre by the Department of Social Protection Community Welfare Service through the Homeless Person's Unit (HPU).  This service is co-funded by the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service, the Department of Social Protection and four local authorities. Referrals to this service generally are at the pre-release stage and emergency and other accommodation options, supplementary benefits and fast tracked medical cards are arranged by the Community Welfare Officers (CWOs) who provide the information and clinic services. There were 241 female prisoners assisted by the HPU in-reach (CWOs) in D&oacute;chas Centre in 2012. These 241 prisoners account for 1,138 interactions with this service. The HPU service is invaluable for the successful resettlement of offenders and a vital component of pre-release planning. Focus Ireland operates a homeless in-reach service in Limerick Prison, which also accommodates female prisoners. The Focus Ireland service provides a case management and pre-settlement service for prisoners.  The service supports participants in accessing appropriate services and accommodation on the pathway to independent living.</p><p>  In addition I would like to inform the Deputy that as part of the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Strategic Plan, 2012-2015, the Service has committed itself to work in partnership with the Probation Service and other stakeholders in the statutory, community and voluntary sectors which include Dublin City Council, the Office of Public Works, the Health Service Executive and City of Dublin Education &amp;amp; Training Board in order to develop a strategy for dealing with women offenders and to put in place a targeted response in relation to homelessness for these women. The engagement between the Irish Prison Service and these agencies to date, has in part, concentrated on the provision of a Centre in the greater Dublin area which would target women with specific needs and would provide:<blockquote>- Supported accommodation,<br /><br />- Intensive case management (temporary and long term),<br /><br />- Specialist addiction and mental health support, with primary care teams, and<br /><br />- Day services with drop in and structured programmes, including training and educational programmes.</blockquote>Priority access will be given for women from the D&oacute;chas Centre.</p><p>  In relation to the development of a centre for women, the Irish Prison Service are working with the following:<blockquote><i>Strategic Partners</i>:<br /><br />  Dublin Region Homeless Executive<br /><br />  Health Service Executive<br /><br />  The Probation Service<br /><br />  City of Dublin Education &amp;amp; Training Board<br /><br /><i>Operational Group</i>:<br /><br />  The Probation Service<br /><br />  Dublin City Council<br /><br />  City of Dublin Education &amp;amp; Training Board<br /><br />  Novas Initiatives<br /><br />  Depaul Ireland<br /><br />  Heath Service Executive<br /><br />  Department of Social Protection</blockquote></p></reply>

The objective of the Diversion Programme is to divert any child who accepts responsibility for his or her criminal or anti social behaviour from committing further offences or engaging in further anti social behaviour. This is done by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the offender away from the courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending.  The Programme embraces, whenever possible, the principles of restorative justice and the programme also pays regard to the needs of the victims of youth offending.</p><p>  The Programme is supported by 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects.  These projects are nationwide, community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives run in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and funded/overseen by my Department&lsquo;s unit within the Irish Youth Justice Service. These projects seek to divert young people from involvement in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour. They aim to bring about the conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order can develop and mature through positive interventions and interaction with the projects. The projects are particularly targeted at 12-17 year old &quot;at risk&quot; youths in communities where a specific need has been identified and where there is a risk of  these young people remaining within the criminal justice system. </p><p>  The Annual Reports of the Committee appointed to monitor the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme under Part 4 of the Act 2001, as amended, include details of the number of incidents of youth crime and the number of individual children referred to the Programme each year. This information is broken down by Garda Region and Division. The reports for period 2004-2011 are available on the website of the Irish Youth Justice Service (www.iyjs.ie). I have recently received the 2012 Report and I will be in a position to publish that report shortly. The programme is seen to be successful in diverting young offenders away from crime by offering guidance and support to the young people and their families. </p></reply>

The scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the presiding judge who are under the Constitution independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. The Presidents monitor waiting times across all court lists and seek to ensure the optimum use of court time. The Courts Service has informed me that the primary objective for the Service is to maintain the delivery of front line court sittings and services.  The Courts Service continuously works to support the judiciary and assist in ensuring that cases are dealt with as effectively and as speedily as possible.  Available resources and operational and organisational structures are under ongoing review to ensure that resources are targeted and focussed on keeping waiting times in the provision of services to a minimum.</p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that, following the appointment of two additional Supreme Court Judges on 17 October,  the Supreme Court has begun to sit in two panels to address the backlog that has accumulated in the Supreme Court over the past number of years and the proposed establishment of a Court of Appeal will provide long-needed reform of our courts system.</p><p>  There are currently three judicial vacancies in the High Court, one in the Circuit Court and one in the District Court. The Government recently nominated a Circuit Court judge who is due to be appointed shortly and the other vacancies will be filled as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In addition, there were 878 cells which accommodated 2 prisoners, 133 cells which accommodated 3 prisoners and 30 cells which accommodated 4 or more prisoners. As the Deputy will appreciate the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts into its custody and does not have the option of refusing committals.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that my officials are concentrating on aligning our prisoner population numbers with the Inspector of Prisons' recommendations in those prisons with the highest levels of over-crowding, namely Cork Prison, Limerick Prison and  the Dochas Centre.</p><p>  In addition, a 40 month capital programme is being implemented to eliminate slopping out and to improve prison conditions in the older part of the prison estate. I am advised by my officials that work is continuing on the modernisation project at Mountjoy prison. Refurbishment of the Mountjoy B and C wings was completed in 2012. A wing commenced in early January 2013 and is substantially completed and will ready for occupancy early in the new year. D Wing is on track to have contract awarded by end 2013 for the<b></b>refurbishment and modernisation of the D wing and workshops. On completion of the refurbishment of D wing all cells in Mountjoy prison will have in cell sanitation facilities.</p><p>  In relation to Cork Prison, the tender process is now complete and a preferred tenderer has been identified. The contract is due to be signed at the end of this month and construction is due to begin in January 2014. The Business Case for the Limerick Prison project was submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure Reform in June of this year and approval has been received to advance the project to detail design stage.  A number of enabling project works have commenced and the main tender documents are due to issue in early to mid 2014. When the Limerick project is completed there will be additional spaces available to the female prisoner population there also.</p></reply>

Applicants for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal aid themselves.  The Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the "gravity of the charge" or "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.   An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that an accused person who faces serious charges is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence and if they cannot afford to pay for legal representation there is a right to legal aid.  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend him/herself in person or through legal assistance of his/her own choosing or, if he/she has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.</p></reply>

Prisoners usually return voluntarily, are re-arrested by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or are re-committed by the Courts.  The Garda&iacute; are informed when prisoners abscond and have the power to detain, arrest, and return such persons to prison. Experience has shown that the vast majority of offenders who abscond return or are returned to custody to complete their sentences within a short time frame.</p><p>  I wish finally to advise the Deputy that in October 2012, the Director General of the Irish Prison Service established a project team, chaired by himself, to examine means of tackling the issue of Unlawfully at Large prisoners.  The work undertaken by the project team along with the close co-operation of the Garda&iacute; and the Department of Social Protection has recently led to the recapture of 4 prisoners, one of whom had absconded in 2002. This project is ongoing.</p></reply>

It must also be borne in mind that modern organised criminal groupings are transnational in nature and engage in a wide range of disparate criminal activities. It can, therefore, be difficult to identify definitive numbers of groupings and members involved in such illegal and covert activity at any particular point in time.</p><p>  However, I can assure the Deputy that the operation of organised crime groups is closely monitored on an ongoing basis by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that tackling these groups remains a key ongoing priority for both the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This priority is clearly reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for 2013.</p><p>  In this regard, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to tackle organised crime through a range of targeted activities designed to disrupt and dismantle their operations. This involves targeting serious criminals and organised criminal groups through the use of focused intelligence led operations by specialist units such as the Organised Crime Unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau.   An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also maintains close liaison with other law enforcement agencies internationally in this area.</p><p>  The activities of these units are highlighted in the annual reports of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, e.g. in 2012, the Organised Crime Unit alone undertook 387 targeted operations against criminal groups. While the challenges and threat posed by such groups remains clear, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to arrest and bring those involved in such criminality before the Courts where substantial sentences continue to be handed down for serious crime offences.</p><p>  Our law enforcement operations are underpinned by a comprehensive framework of criminal law measures which are being fully utilised by the Garda&iacute;. In this regard I should highlight the recent publication of legislation to provide for the establishment of a DNA database to assist the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling crime. The intelligence generated from this database will be of particular value to the Garda&iacute;, and will greatly assist in the investigation of a wide range of serious crimes perpetrated by criminal gangs.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the most recent recorded crime statistics, which were released at the end of October show falling trends in the offence numbers for most categories of crime, including offences relating to  homicide, kidnapping, weapons and explosives, and drugs related offences. These crime figures reflect well on the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and demonstrate that those involved in criminal gangs are being vigorously opposed. In concluding, I can fully assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to actively pursue all persons involved in criminal gang activity.</p></reply>

These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.

Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.</p><p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled us to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.</p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.

In particular, building works in the Curragh Camp and refurbishment works in McKee Barracks were delayed earlier in the year.  The factors which led to the initial delays have been addressed and the projects are now underway. A capital carryover of &euro;900,000 from 2012 has been fully spent in 2013. Progress on capital projects is reviewed on an ongoing basis and, where unforeseen delays arise on particular projects, other projects are brought forward, insofar as is possible.  My Department has also received approval for an application for a deferred surrender of &euro;900,000 of capital funds to 2014 to meet commitments which will not mature before year-end, due to the delays referred to above. At this point, it is expected that the remaining funding for 2013 will be substantially spent by year end.</p></reply>

The services provided by the Clinic are being discontinued with effect from 31 December 2013.  The service dates back to a time where the provision of medical services for all families of enlisted personnel was included in Defence Forces Regulations. Following the introduction of free public hospital care for all citizens in the 1970&rsquo;s, the entitlement to medical services for military families was formally removed from Regulations in 1987 and the family section of the Curragh Military Hospital closed at this time. However, the Curragh Families Clinic was retained because of the difficulty in obtaining doctor and pharmacy services in the Curragh area at the time<font color="#FF0000">. </font>  This is no longer the case. </p><p>  The service is an anomaly in that it is a benefit which is only available to a relatively small number of families resident within the Curragh Camp and surrounding areas. Similar services are not provided to families of enlisted military personnel at any other location in the State. A further anomaly arises in that new personnel deployed to the Curragh in recent times do not receive the benefit of free family care. </p><p>  A number of reviews, undertaken in the period since 1990, have recommended that the Clinic be closed. The decision to discontinue the operation of the clinic has been made having regard to those reviews, equity considerations and the cost of the service. </p><p>  I would like to emphasise that the families affected will have the same rights of access to public health services as other families of enlisted personnel. Also, existing services are being maintained until 31 December 2013 to allow families make arrangements to transfer to local GP&rsquo;s and apply for medical cards or GP visit cards if required.  As I have indicated previously, if any patient requires assistance in finding a new GP or applying for a medical or GP visit card this can be provided by staff in the Clinic during the transition period.</p></reply>

All applications in 'Natura 2000&rsquo; areas are required to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of environmental compliance with the EU Habitats/Birds Directives.

Analysis of the data, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.

Environmental type measures may be co-funded up to 75%. The total Exchequer funding that will be required to draw down the available European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) funding will depend on the types of measures included in the new Rural Development Programme and on the co-financing rates applied to these measures.</p><p>  There are a number of conditions attached to Ireland&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;313 million per annum.  The draft Regulation provides that at least 5% of EAFRD funding must be reserved for LEADER while the draft Common Provisions Regulation provides that 6% of EAFRD funding must be set aside to a national performance reserve. The funding set aside to the performance reserve will be allocated to each Member State following a performance review in 2019. Finally, the draft Rural Development Regulation sets out that 30% of the total EAFRD amount must be reserved for environmental operations and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.</p><p>  Work is currently ongoing in my Department to design the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) for the period from 2014 &ndash; 2020. In designing the new RDP, my Department must take account of the range of requirements set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation and the need to support key policy aims for the agri-food sector in the light of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. In undertaking this work, a number of ex-ante analyses are being undertaken and a public consultation process has also taken place.

It currently accounts for 7.1% of national gross value-added and 8.6% of employment. Between 2008 and 2012, the sector&rsquo;s contribution to national GVA rose from 6.1% to 7.1%.</p><p>  However, these figures, significant as they are, may actually underestimate the importance of the sector to national economic development. The Deputy should be aware that more than 75% of the expenditure in this sector is on Irish goods and services, compared to 42% for all manufacturing. In addition it has a lower import content and a lower level of profit repatriation than other manufacturing industries. In fact every &euro;100 of exports from the bio-sector (agriculture, forestry, fisheries, food &amp;amp; drink industries) contributes around &euro;48 to GNP while the &lsquo;non bio-sector&rsquo; contributes around &euro;19. </p><p>  Last year, Irish food and drink exports exceeded &euro;9 billion for the first time. This trend is continuing, with the latest CSO figures showing a 6.7% rise in agri-food exports in the first three-quarters of 2013, as compared to the same period in 2012.</p><p>  The table below outlines the performance of total exports attributed to each sector of the agri-food industry, compared to the baseline figures from Food Harvest 2020.</p><p><b>Export Performance in the Agri-food Sector</b><table><tr><th>Products</th><th>&euro;m</th><th>&euro;m</th><th>-</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>FH2020 Baseline<br /><br />(2007 to 2009 avg)</td><td>2012</td><td>Difference 2012/baseline</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;m </td><td>&euro;m</td><td>% Change</td></tr><tr><td>Dairy Products &amp;amp; Ingredients</td><td>2,201</td><td>2,620</td><td>+19%</td></tr><tr><td>Beef</td><td>1,529</td><td>1,900</td><td>+24%</td></tr><tr><td>Prepared Foods</td><td>1,533</td><td>1,424</td><td>-7%</td></tr><tr><td>Beverages</td><td>1,238</td><td>1,255</td><td>+1%</td></tr><tr><td>Pigmeat</td><td>339</td><td>507</td><td>+49%</td></tr><tr><td>Seafood</td><td>342</td><td>501</td><td>+46%</td></tr><tr><td>Edible Horticulture &amp;amp; Cereals</td><td>238</td><td>227</td><td>-5%</td></tr><tr><td>Poultry</td><td>211</td><td>221</td><td>+5%</td></tr><tr><td>Sheepmeat</td><td>171</td><td>212</td><td>+24%</td></tr><tr><td>Live Animals</td><td>177</td><td>217</td><td>+23%</td></tr><tr><td>Total Food &amp;amp; Drinks</td><td>7,979</td><td>9,084</td><td>+14%</td></tr></table></p><p><i>Source: Bord Bia</i></p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland administers this funding which supports both greenfield and expansion projects in food. </p><p>  It funds a range of key programmes delivered by Enterprise Ireland supporting innovation, sales and marketing skills, strategic thinking and competitiveness, including Lean Training programmes, Leadership4 Growth and Innovation Vouchers.   </p><p>  DAFM representatives sit on the EI committees for Investment and Jobs Expansion.</p><p><b>Research and Development</b></p><p>  Enterprise Ireland sits on the industry led Food Research Expert Advisory Group operated by my Department which developed the <i>Food Research Ireland</i> strategic research agenda (SRA) used to guide the content for the Food Institutional Research Measure (FIRM) calls.  In addition, EI sits on the overarching Research Committee which conducts the 3<sup>rd</sup> stage (short listing projects for possible funding by DAFM) in the evaluation process for DAFM competitive research programmes.</p><p>  In turn representatives from my Department bring their expertise to bear as members of the Enterprise Ireland Industrial Research Commercialisation Committee, which deals with the funding for applied research and commercialisation involving the public research organisations, collaborative research and industry led networks. This committee has supported innovation with pan-industry initiatives, including the Food Health Ireland Technology Centre (parts 1 &amp;amp; 2), the currently developing Dairy Processing Technology Centre and a similar project regarding a potential centre for meat processing.  My Department also participates on the EI R&amp;amp;D Committee concerning support for in-company research.</p><p><b>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)</b></p><p>  Enterprise Ireland has responsibility for the attraction of international investment to Ireland and maintains a team in Ireland, supported by colleagues in the market place.  The FDI function is a key area of collaboration between Enterprise Ireland and my Department. Indeed, accompanied by EI and other state agencies I have used trade missions to the U.S., the U.A.E. and elsewhere as a vehicle for promoting Ireland as a location for inward investment.</p><p>  My Department will continue to develop this ongoing close cooperation with Enterprise Ireland across many different areas.</p></reply>

This scheme was designed to compensate farmers for a reduction in intervention prices. Since heifers were not eligible for intervention, they were not included in the Scheme. However, when the Slaughter Premium was introduced subsequently, heifers were entitled to benefit from this scheme. In addition, some funds from the Beef National Envelopes were directed towards heifers.   </p><p>  Generally, the Single Payment Scheme is applicable to farmers who actively farmed during all or any of the three reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002, who were paid Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid payments in one or more of those years and by whom Single Payment entitlements were, therefore, established. Other farmers, including new entrants to farming since the reference period, are also eligible for the Single Payment Scheme where they have received entitlements from the National Reserve, or by way of a transfer i.e. purchase or lease.</p></reply>

The farmer is then re-allocated a lower number of entitlements with a higher net unit value. </p><p>  Farmers who satisfy certain conditions are eligible to apply to have their entitlements consolidated.  The reduction in the number of hectares must have arisen because of one or more of the following circumstances:</p><p>- The acquisition of land by a public authority under a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) for non-agriculture.</p><p>- Lands leased in/ rented in during all or part of the reference period (2000-2002) where the lease /rental agreement has expired or will expire and the land parcels in question are no longer available.</p><p>  Lands declared by farmers under the Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes must be eligible if these lands are to benefit from payment under one of more of these Schemes. Ineligible features such as houses, scrub, roads, rivers etc must be excluded.  Consolidation may not be applied following such exclusions. </p></reply>

Swaps are normally initially proposed or organised by the fishing industry lead by the Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF) and completed in a transaction between Member States. This may happen for a number of reasons. Firstly at the start of each year when the TAC and Quota Regulation is published, quotas for  a number of fisheries which are of little interest to the Irish fleet are swapped for quotas for stocks which are of interest to our fleet.</p><p>  Secondly throughout the year, the industry lead by the FIF works closely with the Department to recommend to me effective monthly management regimes for pressure stocks. In this monthly process the Industry recommends that some quotas or effort be swapped in order to maintain a supply of a particular quota for a stock of particular importance to the Irish fleet.  In addition, where such proposals are received from other Member States, the FIF recommends the amounts and species to be swapped.  These swaps are completed by the Department using the EU FIDES fishery database system. </p><p>  The third reason for swaps is at the end of year where a quota has been exceeded  and  any opportunity to address this overfishing is used through  completing swops with other Member States. </p></reply>

Dublin will cease providing High Support services in May 2014 once the current residents complete their interventions and move on to their next placements.  Crann&oacute;g Nua will then undergo a period of refurbishment and enhancement in order to bring the standard of the current facilities up to the level of security required to provide Special Care services from that location.  In addition, a further building is being added.</p><p>  The HSE has also advised that Children and Family Services are committed to designing and developing a comprehensive continuum of care services to meet the divergent and complex needs of all children in care.  In 2012, Children and Family Services initiated an in depth review of all residential care services for children and young people.  This review will assist in mapping and reinforcing the various stages along the continuum of care provision in Children and Family Services as well as identifying where maps may exist.  A National Director of Residential Services is now in post to take the review forward and ensure the strategic development of such services with all necessary allied supports necessary.</p></reply>

The Act was written against the backdrop of the of the Hague Convention and a commitment to improving standards outlined in the Convention. The Hague principles of subsidiarity, support for birth families, free and informed consent for birth parents, and international adoption as a resource for the permanent care of children, are a means for improving standards in intercountry adoption and mitigating against some of the risks inherent in intercountry adoption. </p><p>  The Adoption Act 2010 has been in operation for nearly three years now.  Since the implementation of the Act, as is often the case with complex legislation, issues have arisen in relation to the operation of the Act.   There are  also more general policy questions around the nature of our adoption regime. In the circumstances I think it is timely to consider a review of adoption.  Given the range and complexity of the issues this will require a preliminary examination following which decisions will be made on the extent and time scale for the review. I do not know at this stage if proposals for legislative change will emerge from this review or the nature of such proposals.  Based upon the many domestic and international legal aspects to adoption the issue of further legislative development will certainly be considered.    This review will inform future operational and legislative considerations regarding the Adoption Act 2010. </p></reply>

All staff caring for children in a pre-school service will be subject to a minimum qualification requirement of FETAC Level 5, while pre-school leaders delivering the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme will require a Level 6 qualification.  These requirements will come into effect from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services.</p><p>  In light of these timeframes, my Department has sought to work with the childcare sector to accelerate the process for training and upskilling its staff and improving the quality of care delivered to children.  It is considered that, to achieve the required qualifications in the limited timescale available, staff in the childcare sector, who are on modest pay, should not have to pay the full cost of undergoing accredited training from their own resources.</p><p>  For 2014 a learner fund totalling &euro;1.5 million will be made available through the CCCs so that existing staff can choose a suitable training provider to upskill to Level 5 or 6 as applicable. </p><p>  Early Childhood Ireland (ECI), which is the largest of the voluntary childcare organisations funded by my Department, and the Border Counties Childcare Network (BCCN), which provides quality supports including training in the Border counties area, have been asked as part of their 2013 work plan to offer additional training to the existing childcare workforce in relevant training modules at FETAC Levels 5 and 6.  Additional grant funding will be made available to ECI and the BCCN in 2013 to provide for this.</p><p>  Both ECI and BCCN submitted proposals to my Department outlining their plans to provide the increased level of training support to the childcare sector in line with their roles as voluntary childcare organisations.</p><p>  242 childcare workers are currently participating in two FETAC Level 5 and ten FETAC Level 6 training modules provided by ECI.  A further 278 childcare workers will commence training across fifteen courses (four Level 5 and eleven Level 6), in January 2014, with another 94 commencing training across five courses (one level 5 and four level 6) in February 2014.  Some of the training courses are being delivered online, with the remainder being delivered face-to-face.</p><p>  BCCN has identified approximately 60 childcare practitioners who will avail of their training programme with some of these commencing training as early as next week. The training modules for remaining participants will commence in January 2014.</p></reply>

In addition, a further project, linked to the existing &lsquo;Preparing for Life&rsquo; project in Darndale, is also being included.</p><p>  The evaluation process was undertaken by a Working Group of the Project Team which was set up in February of this year to oversee the implementation of the new programme.  The Project Team is chaired by my Department and includes representatives from seven other Government Departments, our co-funders The Atlantic Philanthropies as well as two organisations, Pobal and the Centre for Effective Services, which have been designated to manage the programme on behalf of my Department.</p><p>The application and evaluation process was concerned with ensuring that the ABC Programme focused on disadvantaged areas whether rural or urban.   The term &quot;area&quot; was defined broadly as &lsquo;<i>A geographical territory, in which the resident population identifies with each other as a community on the basis of natural boundaries, common history or experience or other factors</i>  .'.  This was intended to encourage consortia from a wide range of areas to apply to the new programme.</p><p>  Applications had to prove that children in their target area were particularly disadvantaged.  The highest ranking criterion included in the application guidelines was Evidence of Need.  It was concerned with high levels of poor outcomes for children in the target areas.  40% of the overall scoring weight was assigned to this criterion.  The other criteria were Quality of the Proposal (30% of overall scoring weight), Additionality &amp;amp; Sustainability (20% of the overall scoring weight) and Understanding and Capturing Outcomes (10% of overall scoring weight).</p><p>  50 applications were received from consortia wishing to participate in the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme, including three from the existing PEIP participants which were evaluated first and approved for entry to the programme earlier this year.  The remaining 47 proposals were then evaluated against the programme criteria and nine were selected.  These did not include the application referred to by the Deputy as it did not score sufficiently highly against the programme criteria to be invited to proceed at this point to the next stage of development and design work.  With 50 proposals received from among the most disadvantaged areas in the State, it was a very competitive process.</p><p>  I would like to thank the Donegal consortium for its application to participate in the ABC programme and for its commitment to evidence-based programmes and early intervention and prevention services for children and families.</p></reply>

Dublin. </p><p>  When profiling this expenditure at the start of this year, it was anticipated that the building work would begin earlier than has actually been the case. This was primarily due to detailed contractual discussions and negotiations and I am happy to confirm that building work has now started. However, as a result of these timing issues, the cash flow for the project has been adjusted and it is now anticipated that only &euro;10m will be expended in 2013 as opposed to the original estimate of over &euro;20m. It is still expected that 3 new units will be delivered by the 3rd quarter in 2014 to prioritise the accommodation of 17 year old boys currently the responsibility of the Irish Prison Service. The remaining units, to replace existing buildings, will be delivered by the 3rd quarter 2015.    The overall project cost will not be impacted on by this cash flow adjustment with the balance of overall funding now being required in 2014 and 2015 to meet contractual commitments.</p><p>  The Deputy might also note that there was no carryover of 2012 funds to the Vote of my Department for capital projects.</p></reply>

This represents approximately 11.5% of overall health expenditure this year.  The majority of this funding is distributed through non-statutory agencies who deliver over 80% of all disability services. There are in the region of 300 such agencies at present across the country that provide a significant and broad range of services for children and adults with disabilities in partnership with and on behalf of the HSE.  It is important to note that many children and adults with a disability can be very effectively supported within mainstream child and adult health services.  </p><p>  Dyspraxia is a developmental co-ordination disorder that affects movement and co-ordination.  For some children, dyspraxia can affect their learning capacity.  For this reason they may require additional supports in the school setting to keep up with their classmates.  A comprehensive range of supports is in place in our school system to supports these children.  </p><p>  From a health perspective, there are a number of therapies that can make it easier for people with dyspraxia to cope.  These include speech and language therapy, to improve speech and communication skills, and occupational therapy to find ways to remain independent and complete everyday tasks.  Such therapy services do not necessarily have to be delivered through specialist disability providers and are frequently accessed through Primary Care Teams and community therapy services.        </p><p>  The Dyspraxia Association is just one of a range of organisations around the country at present providing supports to specific diagnostic groups who do not receive HSE funding.  Funding of these types of organisations is an issue that is under active and on-going consideration by the HSE.  Pending approval of the HSE's National Service Plan for 2014, it is not possible to predict the service levels and funding to be provided next year for the disability sector.</p></reply>

The Act provides that persons who are unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and family qualify for a medical card. The HSE can only award medical cards in accordance with the Act and, therefore, it must assess applicants on the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her dependants. The HSE gives effect to this legislation through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.</p><p>  While there is no legal basis for the HSE to award medical cards on the basis of a specific medical condition, the HSE has, however, discretion to grant a medical card in certain circumstances. If an applicant&rsquo;s means are above the financial thresholds, set out in the national guidelines, the HSE examines for any indication of circumstances (medical or social), which might result in undue financial hardship in the arranging of medical services. Eligibility may be granted on a discretionary basis if these circumstances are such that a person cannot arrange GP services for themselves and their family without undue financial hardship. </p><p>  The HSE has a clinical panel which assists in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there is financial expenditure related to a medical condition.

The National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAI) were  introduced in 2009 and HIQA continues to monitor compliance with these Standards using the powers provided in the Health Act 2007.

HIQA is currently developing a monitoring programme for the National Standards in 2014.  Under Section 8 of the Health Act 2007 HIQA has the powers to monitor compliance with the National Standards.

My Department is also working with the Chairs with a view to appointing the remaining Board members as soon as possible.  </p><p>  A Strategic Advisory Group is now being established, chaired by Mr Leo Kearns, which will oversee the establishment of Hospital Groups and the subsequent reorganisation of acute hospital services. Each group of hospitals will work together as single cohesive entities managed as one, to provide acute care for patients in their area, integrating with community and primary care. This will maximise the amount of care delivered locally, whilst ensuring complex care is safely provided in larger hospitals.  Hospital Groups will be required, within one year, to develop a strategic plan which will outline their plans for future services within the group area and the role of hospitals within each group will be considered in detail in the context of this strategic plan.</p><p>  The establishment of Hospital Groups will promote more efficient use of resources including NCHD staff.

Supports are tailored on a case-by-case basis by a job coach and can include on-the-job training , social skills training, assistance with travel to and from work, assistive technology and other supports necessary to make the employment successful, for both the employer and the employee.  An individual with a disability, including those with mild to moderate special needs, wishing to pursue training and employment in hair and beauty therapy, would be advised to contact their local SOLAS office to explore their options in this regard.</p><p>  Although supported employment is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection and SOLAS, some disability service providers also provide this service and it is open to service users to work with service providers through the person centred planning process to identify the type of supported employment that best meets their needs and abilities.  Increasingly, service providers are working with service users to identify their goals through this process of person centred planning placing the person, their life choices and wishes at the core of service development.    </p><p>  The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the training needs of people with disabilities.  The Occupational Guidance Officer provides one to one advice, support and guidance to enable individuals with a disability aged 16 to 65 years to make an informed choice about their rehabilitative training and occupational options.</p><p>  For individuals with a disability who require foundation level skills before progressing to vocational training, supported employment or open employment, the HSE provide rehabilitative training.  The purpose of rehabilitative training is to develop the individual&rsquo;s life skills, social skills and basic work skills. Approximately 3,000 people with special needs avail of rehabilitative training each year, some of whom then progress to vocational training, other training or employment. RT courses cover a wide range of skills and cater for people with a range of abilities and interests, and may include opportunities for work sampling or work placement. It is open to an individual in liaision with their service provider to pursue basic work skills training which would be of benefit to that individual should he or she wish to progress to training or employment in a specific area, such as hair and beauty therapy.</p></reply>

The increase in prescription charges will account for &euro;43 million of this target. The Government is committed to achieving these savings while protecting front line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>  Medical card holders will be required to pay a &euro;2.50 charge per item for medicines and other prescription items supplied to them by community pharmacists, subject to a cap of  &euro;25 per month for each person or family. Prescription charges do not apply to children in the care of the HSE or to methadone supplied to patients participating in the Methadone Treatment Scheme. In order to ensure that the full year savings of &euro;43 million is achieved in 2014, it was necessary to bring the new rates into operation from 1 December 2013.</p></reply>

I am advised that the SCA, wherever it is proper to do so, based on expert medical and legal advice, admits breach of duty at the earliest possible opportunity to avoid distress to patients and their families. Many of these cases however, particularly those involving catastrophic injuries, are very complex in nature and require time to investigate the liability and causation issues. This inevitably involves some delay before a formal admission of liability, if appropriate, can be made.</p><p>  In relation to medical malpractice generally, on Tuesday 12th November this year, the HSE launched National Open Disclosure Policy, Guidelines and supporting documents following on from a joint HSE State Claims Agency national pilot project in relation to Open Disclosure.  Open Disclosure is defined as &ldquo;<i>an open consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare.  This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event&rdquo;.</i>  One of the key recommendations of the Madden Report was the development and support of a culture of open disclosure to patients and their next-of-kin, following an adverse event resulting in harm to a patient.  The upcoming Health Information Bill will contain a provision to afford some degree of protection for healthcare personnel in line with the Madden Report.  This is also consistent with a recommendation in a consultation paper published by The Law Reform Commission in 2008 that &ldquo;<i>a statutory provision be considered which would allow medical practitioners to make an apology and explanation without these being construed as an admission of liability in a medical negligence claim&rdquo;</i>. </p></reply>

Both Minister Kelly and I met with trade unions representing workers in Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann on 21st November last in relation to the proposals outlined by the NTA in the recent consultation process. On the 5th of December, in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the NTA announced that about 10% of publicly subvented (PSO) bus services will be tendered out with the new services commencing in the summer of 2016.</p><p>  It is recognised that there are a number of concerns in relation to potential tendering for PSO services.  These include the impact on industrial relations and cost savings measures within CIE at a general level and the specific implications of Transfer of Undertakings legislation (TUPE) and related issues.  However, it must be recognised that the proposals outlined in the consultation process are relatively modest and there will be a long-lead in before any tendering takes effect. Furthermore, it is of course open to the two incumbent companies to compete for any tendered routes, so it should not be assumed that there will be any reductions in staff numbers or that TUPE will even arise.</p><p>  Following the announcement by the NTA on 5th December, these issues need to be addressed by it and the bus companies through constructive engagement with the unions in the course of the procurement process over the next two years.  I undertook to the trade unions at our meeting that I would contact the NTA to seek to have such a structured engagement put in place and I wrote to the Chairman of the NTA on 26th November to that end.  It is important to remember that it will be open to Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus to tender for these contracts. The winning tenderer will be required to deliver a specified service under which the timetables, fares and standards of service will be set down by the NTA. The intention is that a better service can be procured for the same PSO subvention that is currently provided, or that the same service can be provided for a lesser cost to the tax-payer.</p></reply>

Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has indicated that it is in the process of implementing new energy saving fleet utilisation initiatives on its DART and Intercity services to generate fuel savings, which will reduce fuel and maintenance costs by &euro;3.2m per annum.  Concerns about overcrowding have been raised with the Chief Executive of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and I understand that the company has already responded and re-introduced larger carriages to accommodate passengers where this has been considered necessary.  The Chief Executive has agreed to continuous monitoring of carriage levels on both DART and Intercity services to ensure they match passenger demand.   </p><p>  I have also been advised by the Railway Safety Commission (RSC) that it has received an increased number of public representations relating to crowding and the matter will be discussed further with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann at their next scheduled supervision meeting.  Additionally, RSC Inspectors will undertake some monitoring of Intercity train services over the coming weeks.</p></reply>
