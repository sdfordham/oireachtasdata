This will drive export growth to other international markets where there are known opportunities, and will reduce reliance on the UK. </p><p>With regard to export diversification, the EU and the Eurozone in particular present significant opportunities.  EI is currently finalising a strategy focused on the Eurozone, targeting a 50% increase in exports by 2020. </p><p>Furthermore, the US and Canada will continue to be key markets for Irish companies.  We will also continue to support companies to build their market share in high potential markets of China, South Korea, India, Asean, the Gulf, Latin America and Africa.</p><p>These client companies are spread right across the regions.

For a site to be considered suitable, I understand that it must be both supported by the necessary infrastructure and compatible with the evolving needs of data centre investments. </p>  <p>  This study is part of IDA Ireland's wider strategy to ensure that Ireland and its regions are best able to win and sustain mobile data centre investments of scale.  In recent times companies including Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Google have announced significant data centre investments for Ireland and the goal is to ensure that this trend continues.  </p>  <p>  More broadly, I regularly engage with stakeholders from the area and, on 19 January, I hosted a large delegation of elected representatives from Cavan and Monaghan to discuss issues around investment and job creation in the region.</p></reply>

It has supported the provision of top-class research infrastructure (buildings, laboratories and cutting edge equipment) as well as human capital development, through Structured PhD programmes across Ireland&rsquo;s Higher Education Institutes (HEIs).  It has facilitated Ireland in producing world class research in key strategic areas and has provided the base infrastructure for research teams funded by Science Foundation Ireland and other funders.  </p>  <p>  In 2017, PRTLI has an allocation in my Department's Vote of &euro;14.4m.   The annual allocation to PRTLI has been reducing in recent years as we are discharging the remaining liabilities for projects funded under Cycle 5 of the programme.  In addition to the PRTLI allocation, my Department is also allocating &euro;162.5 million to Science Foundation Ireland in 2017 to fund oriented basic and applied research.  SFI does not predetermine or &ldquo;ring fence&rdquo; specific funding allocation for basic or applied research.  Funding decisions are made through international peer review on the basis of research excellence and impact.  </p>  <p>  In addition in 2017 my Department has allocated a further &euro;122m to Enterprise Ireland specifically to support investment in research, development and innovation in Irish enterprise.  The IDA also invests in RDI through its R&amp;D Grants, with a total of &euro;55.6m in investment in this area in 2015.</p>  <p>  Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for research and innovation, provides for the establishment of a new programme to fund frontier research across all disciplines and all career stages.  The Irish Research Council (an agency of the Department of Education and Skills) has responsibility for developing and implementing this Programme.  </p></reply>

The contract, which was extended by 12 months in March 2016, is now set to conclude on 26 March.  I understand that it would not be permissible for any further extension to be granted on account of public procurement law.  </p>  <p>  The Board of IDA Ireland, at its meeting in November 2016, did consider the future of the initiative.  It decided that the Agency would not re-tender for its continuation at this stage.  A definitive decision was not taken, however, on the ultimate future of The Succeed-in-Ireland programme. </p>  <p>  I have asked my Department to commission a review of the initiative after the conclusion of the current contract.  This will help provide us with a better understanding of Succed-in-Ireland's results and its wider contribution to employment generation in the State. The review may also consider the development of a new programme.  I believe it is important that this review be undertaken before a determination is made on how we proceed.</p></reply>

Much will depend on the nature of the deal that will be negotiated between the UK and the EU.  This Government will seek, during that process, to highlight our unique economic ties with Northern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Government is very conscious of the specific challenges facing businesses in the border region who export to Northern Ireland.  To help address this issue it has provided additional resources to InterTrade Ireland, the Cross Border Body which has specific responsibility for developing Cross Border Trade, in order to enable that Body to provide additional services and support to such companies.  Inter Trade Ireland has commissioned a study by the ESRI which will improve our understanding of the impact of different trade and tariff regimes which might be imposed following Brexit.  This study will also provide useful data on the extent and concentration of cross border trade, including information on this trade by product and firm type as well as barriers to trade.  Inter Trade Ireland, in their day to day operations are very successful in fostering cross border trade. For  example  in 2016, the Body had a job creation impact of 2,339, it helped 79 companies to innovate for the first time and helped 88 companies to export for the first time. </p>  <p>  Both Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) have initiated a series of actions to assist their client companies. </p>  <p>  I am actively engaged with our Agencies to ensure that Irish jobs are maintained and created in the context of the challenges and opportunities which Brexit presents for us.  I chair a Brexit Coordination Group, which includes the senior management of my Department and the CEOs of relevant agencies.  I also recently organised an engagement event in Carrick on Shannon, to hear the views of stakeholders, both directly and through representative bodies. </p></reply>

Over 66,000 jobs were created during 2016. Employment growth is spread across all regions and all sectors of the economy and society.</p>  <p>  In February, we published the Action Plan for Jobs 2017.  This Government's goal is to ensure that all of our people have the opportunity to enjoy rewarding work and to participate and contribute to their full potential to our economy and society. </p>  <p>  The 2017 Action Plan sets out a whole of Government response to secure employment and retain jobs in the face of global uncertainty by strengthening the resilience and agility of our enterprise base.  In developing APJ 2017, I had a number of discussions with my colleague Minister Finian McGrath T.D., Minister of State with special responsibility for Disabilities and with representatives of the disability sector.  Minister McGrath will shortly publish a new strategy Make Work Pay to address the under-representation of people with disabilities in the workforce. </p>  <p>  The 2017 Plan commits to the implementation of the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for Persons with Disabilities and ensure that people who are able to, and want to work are supported and enabled.  This strategy falls under the remit of the Department for Justice and Equality.  There are a range of measures to equip people with the skills to avail of job opportunities as they arise, including activation measures under Pathways to Work.  The Government is also committed to increasing the target for employees with disabilities in the public sector towards 6 per cent by 2024 from the current level of 3.5%.</p>  <p>  We will continue to work across Government to ensure that people with disabilities have the opportunity to participate fully in the workforce.</p></reply>

This includes &euro;3 million which is specifically for &ldquo;Brexit&rdquo; related posts across the Department and its Agencies.  Part of this funding will support 39 targeted posts in Enterprise Ireland, located at both at home and abroad, to support its clients across all markets. </p><p>While Enterprise Ireland supports companies in the Food and Drink sector in Ireland, Bord Bia under the Department of Agriculture and Food works with these companies to access overseas markets.  Both Agencies work closely together.</p><p>While the UK remains a key market, Enterprise Ireland is also working closely with Irish Food and Drink companies to build on their international reputation for product excellence and to drive growth in other key markets such as the Eurozone, Canada, the US and Asia.</p><p>In summary, the key focus is on supporting companies through:</p><p>1. Greater competitiveness</p><p>2. Markets diversification</p><p>3. More innovation</p><p>4. Better risk management andstrategic financial skills.</p><p>My Department, working closely with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), EI and various stakeholders, has conducted a structured engagement with a large and diverse range of companies, to ascertain what, if any, impact Brexit is having on their business.  This detailed work will provide a strong evidence base for the development of appropriate, tailored and targeted responses to support real business needs.

In this regard, Employers/Vessel Owners are afforded all reasonable opportunity to rectify contraventions and, where relevant, pay any unpaid wages and/or make good on entitlements arising from these contraventions.  Following the detection of contraventions, the WRC issues, in all cases, a contravention notification to the vessel owner.  Such notifications have issued in respect of the 157 contraventions of employment rights and employment permits legislation detected to date by WRC Inspectors.  If the owner addresses the contravention to the WRC&rsquo;s satisfaction within the time specified in the notice, the matter can be closed without recourse to further proceedings. </p>  <p>  However, it is the policy of the WRC to issue Compliance Notices or Fixed Payment Notices and/or to initiate legal proceedings in cases where an owner has failed or is unwilling to effect compliance.  I am advised by the WRC that it has been necessary to date to initiate two prosecutions and that further prosecution proceedings will be initiated where owners refuse or fail to engage with Inspectors and/or address contraventions.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that arising from the recommendations of the Task Force on allegations regarding treatment of workers on Irish fishing trawlers, an atypical work permission scheme was introduced for non-EEA fishers working on Irish fishing vessels.  The scheme is administered by the Department of Justice and Equality and the Irish National Immigration Service (INIS) on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p>  <p>  A number of agencies and organisations are involved in the monitoring and enforcement of the scheme and have signed up to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in order to provide a rigorous and effective inspection system.  They include An Garda Siochana, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, INIS, the Naval Service, the Revenue Commissioners, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, my Department, the Workplace Relations Commission, the Health and Safety Authority, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and, with a number of exclusions, the Marine Survey Office of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. </p>  <p>  The WRC&rsquo;s responsibilities relate to the enforcement of the Employment Permits Acts and employment rights legislation including minimum wage legislation.  The Marine Survey Office in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport  is responsible for enforcing legislation relating to rest periods and maximum working time for seafarers and fishing vessel crew.</p>  <p>  Some 113 of the 174 fishing vessels which come within the aegis of the Atypical Scheme have been inspected to date by the WRC and the remainder will be inspected by Summer of this year.  Case files relating to all vessels will remain open until such time as WRC inspectors are satisfied that compliance has been achieved.</p></reply>

Meeting the demand for these drivers requires an integrated approach primarily involving labour market activation and upskilling/training.  As part of that approach, the employment permits regime offers only a short-term solution where genuine skills shortages exist.</p>  <p>  The EGFSN recommended, as a priority, that a HGV Driver apprenticeship be developed to help address the demand for HGV drivers with the required licence.  Engagement between industry representatives and education and training providers is a crucial factor in ensuring that skills needs of particular sectors are met.</p>  <p>  Employment permit policy is part of the response to addressing skills deficits which exist and are likely to continue into the short and medium term.  It is not intended over the longer term to act as a substitute for meeting the challenge of up-skilling our resident workforce.  Where a shortage exists, changes may be made to the lists which determine the eligibility of occupations for employment permits.</p>  <p>  Changes to access to the Irish Labour Market for specific occupations vis the employment permits system are made on the basis of research undertaken by the EGFSN in tandem with a consultation process in which submissions are sought from stakeholders on the appropriateness of the lists during the bi-annual review process.  A review of the eligible listings is being finalised at present; the situation in relation to HGV drivers is under consideration as part of this review.  It is expected that the outcome of this review will be available within the next few weeks.</p>  <p>  Both the Irish and British Governments have indicated their strong desire to maintain operation of the Common Travel Area following the UK's withdrawal from the EU.</p></reply>

The 2003 Act had been in force for over eleven years and it was considered timely to take stock of how the legislation is operating in practice.  </p>  <p>  Twenty nine submissions were received from a range of interests including Government Departments and agencies, industry, insurance and legal interests, and individuals.  The Department has been examining these submissions with a view to identifying areas which might require change.  The General Scheme of the Bill is now being prepared and it will have regard to the relevant recommendations of the Report of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  It is hoped to seek Government approval for the drafting of a Bill in the second quarter of this year.</p></reply>

It is a whole&ndash;of-Government, multi-annual initiative which mobilises all Departments to support job creation.  The Action Plan for Jobs is working.</p>  <p>  Since the first Action Plan for Jobs was launched in early 2012, almost 206,000 more people are at work.  Over 66,000 jobs were created during 2016, well in excess of the APJ 2016 target of 50,000 new jobs.  Employment growth is spread across all regions and all sectors of the economy and society.  The annual increase in employment was 3.3%.  Full-time employment increased by 4.7% while the number of part time workers declined by 1.4%, based on seasonally adjusted data.  Almost four out of every five part-time workers are working part-time by choice.  The number of under-employed part-time workers declined by 11.5% during 2016.  Under-employed refers to those who would work longer hours if available.</p>  <p>  On the 1st February, we published the Action Plan for Jobs 2017.  This Government's goal is to achieve sustainable full employment so that all of our people have the opportunity to enjoy rewarding work and to participate and contribute to their full potential to our economy and society.</p>  <p>  The 2017 Plan sets out a range of measures to address the immediate challenges of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU and also in response to a more volatile and changing external environment by strengthening the resilience and agility of our enterprise base.  This includes actions to drive innovation, grow and scale Irish businesses, diversify our exports, promote entrepreneurship, improve our competitiveness performance, deliver the skills needs of our growing economy and ensure finance is available at competitive cost to support and underpin growth.</p>  <p>  Securing full, sustainable employment in the face of global uncertainty will be challenging.  I will work closely with colleagues across Government to ensure the effective delivery of the 2017 Plan to keep us on track to deliver on our 2020 target to have an additional 200,000 people at work, including 135,000 people outside of Dublin.</p></reply>

If I am satisfied that the process provided for in the 2015 Act has been complied with by the Labour Court, I can then make the Order.  Where such an order is made it is known as a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO), will be binding across the sector to which it relates, and will be enforceable by the Workplace Relations Commission. </p>  <p>  To-date four applications for SEOs have been made to the Labour Court &ndash; one was withdrawn and one was rejected.  The remaining two are being considered by the Labour Court.  No application has been made by or on behalf of workers or employers in the Transport Sector. </p>  <p>  In situations such as the Bus Eireann dispute I would always advise and appeal to parties to use the offices of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court and they have done so on this occasion.  I would encourage both sides to continue to engage with the Workplace Relations Commission to try to resolve this dispute.</p></reply>

The employment permits system is intended to offer an interim solution for employers where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA.  The system offers a route into the Irish labour market for non-EEA nationals with in-demand skills.  It is operated as a vacancy-led system.  Vacancies must be for eligible occupations &ndash; the system is ordered by the use of lists of highly skilled and ineligible occupations, which are reviewed bi-annually.</p>  <p>  Work riders are currently included on the Ineligible Categories of Employment List, as research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, which underpins the review of the lists, has not indicated that there is any shortage of such workers.</p>  <p>  The next review of the lists is due to commence in April, and at that time, submissions to the review will be invited from interested parties &ndash; this is the mechanism whereby stakeholder input to the review process is accessed.

In this respect, as the Deputy will be aware the Department of Justice and Equality has recently concluded a three-phase consultation process with a view to developing a new National Disability Inclusion Strategy, which will be submitted for consideration to Government shortly.  Issues in relation to the Deaf Community featured strongly in the consultation process, and I intend that the new Strategy will respond credibly.  I can confirm that the Strategy contains an action that proposes legislation that will ensure that all public bodies provide ISL users with free interpretation when availing of or seeking their statutory services.  I believe that this approach will make a real and measurable difference in the lives of ISL users.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a Private Members' Bill, the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016, is currently awaiting Committee Stage.  I will be finalising my proposals for amendments to the Bill in early course and I look forward to a substantive discussion on all the issues involved, including formal recognition of ISL as a language used by the Deaf Community, at that time. </p></reply>

This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Given that there was no recruitment for a period of five years it will take some time before there are fully trained officers available to replace the number of personnel that have retired across the entire organisation, including traffic.  However, the Commissioner has confirmed that the personnel requirement of the Garda Traffic Corps is currently being assessed to identify the most vulnerable areas in regard to serious traffic collisions and the level of compliance with Road Traffic Legislation.  I understand that the Assistant Commissioner, Roads Policing and Major Event Management is currently assessing the capacity of Divisions and Districts to identify and target areas where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could accelerate the deployment of personnel to traffic in 2017.  The filling of any vacancies identified will be conducted on a structured basis and will be further enhanced with the recently renewed recruitment campaigns to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>Road traffic legislation is, of course, also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

This is the latest in a series of status updates since the examination commenced and sets out the progress being made by lenders in completing the review. </p><p>The immediate focus of the examination is to ensure that the interests of consumers are protected and that lenders prioritise the identification of impacted customers.  Under the Principles for Redress lenders must stop further harm to impacted customers at the earliest possible time and must put in place a redress and compensation programme to fully address the impact their actions have had on impacted customers.  The Principles for Redress also set out the Central Bank's expectations for lenders to provide, amongst other things, additional payments to allow impacted customers to seek independent professional advice.</p><p>The Tracker Examination continues to be a priority for the Central Bank and is being progressed as quickly as possible with specific timelines having been set for each lender to complete their reviews and to report to the Central Bank.  The Central Bank has indicated that it will continue to monitor the examination as it progresses with appropriate supervisory action, up to and including enforcement action being taken by the Central Bank where necessary, in order to ensure lenders' deliver fair outcomes for their customers. Enforcement activity will be influenced by the outcome of the reviews currently being conducted as part of the Examination.</p></reply>

Children with autism can be enrolled in an early intervention class from the age of 3.</p>  <p>  Children in early intervention classes benefit from a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1.  Class teachers are fully qualified and have access, through the Special Education Support Service, to training in a range of autism-specific interventions.  Each class will have a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants. </p>  <p>  As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes which can be supported by Special Needs Assistants and fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) as well as the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils. </p>  <p>  The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues.  My Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use.</p>  <p>  However, my Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that ABA should be the only approach used.  While ABA helps to improve behaviour, other approaches, such as a number of those to which I have referred, are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills.</p>  <p>  An application for Home Tuition for the child referred to by the Deputy has recently been received in Special Education Section of my Department.  Special Education Section are currently assessing the application with regard to the criteria for eligibility as set out in the Home Tuition Circular 0046/2016.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Home Tuition Grant Scheme is to provide a compensatory educational service for children with Special Educational Needs who are seeking an educational placement, either in a special school, a special class, including an early intervention class within a mainstream school, or a mainstream class in a mainstream school, with additional resources allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).  </p>  <p>  In the event that no placement is available, home tuition can only be provided until such a placement becomes available.  Home tuition is provided as an interim provision only and should not be regarded as an optional alternative to a place in school.</p>  <p>  It is of course open to parents, where a state funded school placement has been identified, to choose alternative educational interventions to those identified and funded by the State.</p></reply>

The Redress Board, which has made awards to nearly 15,600 applicants, operates independently and the application process is confidential in accordance with the terms of the 2002 Act.</p>  <p>  The 2002 Act provides that applications coming before the Redress Board are treated in a confidential manner. This confidentiality is required in order to protect the identity of applicants and because the Redress Board, when considering an application, is not permitted to address any issue of fault or negligence arising out of the evidence given in an application and is not empowered to make a finding of fact relating to fault or negligence in relation to evidence submitted with an application.</p>  <p>  The Act prohibits the publication of any information regarding an application made under the Act that refers to any other person, relevant person or institution by name or which could reasonably lead to such identification.</p>  <p>  Therefore my Department does not have the application details sought by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The 2002 Indemnity Agreement between the Government and religious congregations provided for a collective contribution of &euro;128 million from the 18 participating congregations in cash, counselling services and property. </p>  <p>  The cash contributions of &euro;54.42m under the Agreement have been received while information has been provided to my Department that confirms that counselling services in excess of the &euro;10m provided for in the agreement have been funded directly by the contributing congregations. </p>  <p>  Work to complete the outstanding property transfers is actively progressing and I should point out that in most of the remaining cases the transfer process is at a very advanced stage. It is worth noting also that most of the properties are already in use by the intended recipients.</p></reply>

We know that schools have done this well.</p>  <p>  We also know that under the pilot of the new allocation model that was conducted in 2015/16 that schools welcomed the discretion that they had to allocate resources under the new allocation model to pupils based on their individual learning needs, as opposed to primarily based on a diagnosis of a disability.</p>  <p>  A category of disability, by itself, does not identify how much support a child should receive &ndash; two students, with the same disability can need completely different levels of support.</p>  <p>  Schools use their own knowledge of their students to allocate teaching supports and they can also call on a wide number of support services to assist them.  These include the Visiting Teacher Service, NEPS, Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) and other support services such as the Special Educational Support Services.  Under the new allocation model, schools will continue to receive guidance when making decisions about supporting students&rsquo; learning needs.</p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on supporting children with special educational needs under the new allocation model are also currently being prepared and will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  Under the new model, schools will be guided as to how to identify pupils for additional teaching support and how to prioritise pupils for support taking into account the extent of their learning needs in order to ensure the appropriate level of support is being given to the child.  Schools should inform parents about this process and how to request a review of their child&rsquo;s additional teaching support, if this is required.</p>  <p>  However, despite these measures, some parents, might still disagree with the level of support being given to their child.  In such cases parents should discuss this first with their child&rsquo;s class /subject teacher or his/her support teacher.</p>  <p>  If parents remain unhappy with the level of support being given to their child in a school they may then raise this issue with the school principal and if necessary, at a later point with the Chairperson of the school Board of Management, who are the body which has responsibility for the management of the school.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines for Schools Supporting Pupils with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools, which are due to be published shortly will support schools in identifying and addressing the needs of children with special education needs and also in monitoring their deployment of resources to meet those needs.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines have drawn on best practice to assist schools to allocate the greatest level of resources to the pupils with the highest levels of needs.  The school self-evaluation process also supports schools to examine their own practices in the area of special education, to identify what is working well but also to identify areas that require improvement.  Schools will set targets for improvement and implement agreed actions at a whole-school level.  This process will enable schools to monitor their deployment of resources in area of special education needs.</p></reply>

The Department of Education and Skills invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling: </p><p>- 63% of students to attend mainstream schools </p><p>- 23% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and </p><p>- 14% to attend special schools.</p><p>The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required.  Special classes are part of a continuum of educational provision that enables students with more complex special educational needs to be educated, in smaller class groups, within their local mainstream schools and are for students who have a recommendation for a special class placement in their professional reports.</p><p>Special classes offer a supportive learning environment to students with ASD who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day.  Special class for students with ASD are staffed with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level and 6:1.5 at post primary level, and also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children.</p><p>Students enrolled in special classes should be included in mainstream classes to the greatest extent possible, in line with their abilities.</p><p>Progress in developing the network of Special Classes has been significant over the past 6 years.</p><p>In 2011 there were 548 special classes, of which 224 were primary ASD classes, 72 were post primary ASD classes and 34 were early intervention classes.

Within this approach, there is capacity to allow religious schools to require parents or students to indicate some support or respect for the ethos of the school.</p><p>I am mindful of the need to avoid possible pitfalls and unintended consequences with each of these approaches, including possible impacts on minority religions and on the wishes of Protestant, Jewish, Islamic and other communities to be able to run schools in accordance with their ethos and admit children from their communities to attend those schools.</p><p>Other possible consequences to be avoided include possible breaches of the constitution, technical and administrative difficulties impacting on the capacity to effectively run the system of over 4000 schools and the possibility of creating &lsquo;postcode lotteries&rsquo;, such as other countries have experienced, resulting in pronounced divergence in the quality of schools in more advantaged compared to less advantaged areas. </p><p>The 8 week phase of receiving written submissions is part of the broader 12 week consultation process which will include additional steps, including any follow-up consultation that is required, collation of responses and development of next steps. </p><p>My Department has begun the process of examining the submissions, which includes the submission to which the Deputy refers, and formulating next steps.  Clearly I will not make any decisions around next steps until such time as all of the submissions have been examined and considered.  </p></reply>

Special class for students with ASD are staffed with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level and 6:1.5 at post primary level, and also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children.

The remaining 218 were special classes for children with mild to moderate/severe general learning difficulties and specific learning difficulties including speech and language difficulties. </p><p>There are currently 1,153 special classes, which is an increase of over 100% on the number available in 2011 and an increase of approx. 16% on 2015/16 classes for children with Autism.  These classes comprise of 889 classes for children with Autism; 127 early intervention classes, 525 primary ASD classes and 237 post-primary ASD classes.</p><p>My Department has no plans to open ASD classes in all primary schools.  The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned.  The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p><p>In this regard, the NCSE is currently engaging with schools in opening special classes where there is an identified need for special class provision for children whose assessed needs clearly indicate the need for Special Class provision.</p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>Parents of children with special educational needs can contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>It is general practice to include a Special Needs Unit in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required. In addition, my Department may also provide capital funding to schools to establish special needs provision e.g. re-configure existing accommodation to provide a special class where this has been approved by the National Council for Special Education through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers.</p><p>The NCSE recently launched guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools which provide information on setting up and organising special classes.  These guidelines are available to download from www.ncse.ie.</p><p>My Department provides a range of supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, they will have access to an appropriate education. </p><p>The range of supports and services which are made available include additional learning and resource teaching support, Special Needs Assistants support, funding for the purchase of specialised equipment, services of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), enhanced levels of capitation in Special schools and Special Classes and additional teacher training.</p><p>The NCSE also provides information for Parents of Children with Special Education Needs through its website (www.ncse.ie) and Pamphlet Series which inform parents and guardians of supports and services available for children and young people with ASD and their families.</p><p>The NCSE has published updated policy advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.  In developing this policy advice, the NCSE consulted widely with parents, professionals and other stakeholders and interested parties while also conducting research.

I myself also met with the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Waszczykowski, when he visited Ireland in November last, and agreed to investigate the possibility of setting up a number of pilot projects in relation to providing Polish in schools.

At present NOAC is finalising a review of local authorities' management and maintenance of their housing stock. </p><p>Regarding Approved Housing Bodies (AHB's), as part of the Payment and Availability (P&amp;amp;A) Agreements entered into by AHBs under the social housing leasing programme, AHBs agree:</p><p>- to be responsible for the upkeep, management and maintenance of the dwelling the subject of the agreement, and</p><p>- to comply at all times during the term of the agreement with the provisions and requirements of the Planning Acts and of the Building Regulations.</p><p>Housing authorities are responsible for monitoring compliance with the terms and conditions governing P&amp;amp;A agreements, including ensuring that the dwellings are in a lettable condition and are in compliance with the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008.  Provision has been made for an administrative fee to be paid in respect of this regulatory role being undertaken by housing authorities.  This annual fee equates to 1% of the yearly leasing cost and is paid by my Department at the commencement of the leasing arrangements.</p></reply>

In this regard, Action 5.1 of Rebuilding Ireland commits to the development of a National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy, informed by Census 2016 data, to</p><p>- inform the compilation of a register of vacant units across the country,</p><p>- identify the number, location and reasons for longer-term vacancies (i.e. over 6 months) in high demand areas, and</p><p>- set out a range of actions to bring vacant units back into reuse.</p><p>To this end, the Housing Agency, which has lead responsibility for coordinating the development of the Strategy, established a working group in September 2016 comprising of senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself to inform the Strategy.  The Group is due to report in the coming weeks.</p><p>An important action that will have a significant impact in the regeneration of vacant properties is the Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS), which has been developed to assist private property owners and local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to harness the accommodation potential that exists in certain vacant properties across Ireland.  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an Approved Housing Body (AHB).  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.</p><p>A property owner can either choose to arrange for a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.  Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities and the local authority or AHB will have on-going management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties.</p><p>The local authority will determine the eligibility for the scheme, having regard to the location and the suitability of the property for social housing and also taking into consideration the extent of the repairs that may be required.  The maximum costs of repairs allowable under this initiative will be &euro;40,000.  My Department is working closely with local authorities to implement the scheme locally.</p><p>Following on from the success of the initial pilot in Waterford and Carlow local authorities, the Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) is being rolled out on a national basis from 23 February 2017.  I am making an additional &euro;26m available to fund the scheme in 2017, which brings the total amount available this year to &euro;32m.  This additional investment in 2017 means that delivery under the scheme can be accelerated and up to 800 vacant properties can be brought back into use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists this year.  This funding represents a frontloading of the &euro;140m being made available for the scheme over the next 5 years.  Over the period 2016 to 2021, it is anticipated that up to 3,500 units will be secured for social housing under this scheme.  Funding to support the cost of bringing new social houses into use using the Repair and Leasing Scheme in 2017 will be released based on proposals submitted by local authorities to my Department rather than by allocation to each local authority.  I have provided funding to support ambitious delivery under the scheme in 2017 and I would urge every local authority to work hard to secure units as early as possible and maximise the use of this investment.</p><p>I will be carefully monitoring the scheme in 2017 to ensure that it works well and is cost effective.  Likewise, this analysis will assist in determining its delivery potential for future years, as well as whether additional financial resources are required in that context.</p><p>The Repair and Leasing Scheme is one of a number of initiatives in Rebuilding Ireland to address vacant properties around the country.  Other initiatives include the Buy and Renew Scheme.  The full details of this scheme are being finalised and will be communicated to local authorities shortly.  I have made an initial &euro;25 million available for this initiative this year and propose to increase this to as much as &euro;50 million in 2018, depending on the uptake.  I expect this investment to deliver between 400 and 500 renewed houses for social housing use.  The initiative may present opportunities for local authorities and approved housing bodies to tackle dereliction in towns and urban areas, but prospective housing units will always need to be suitable for social housing use, in an area of need, and to represent reasonable value for money.</p><p>The Built Heritage Investment Scheme, which comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural &amp;amp; Gaeltacht Affairs, is a &euro;2m scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures.  Launched in October 2015,  this scheme is expected to support in excess of 330 projects across the country in 2017 and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.</p></reply>

It is also worth noting the limited scope of this report, which did not include an environmental study. </p>  <p>  Within a broader policy context, in December 2013, my Department published proposed draft revisions to the noise, setback distance and shadow flicker aspects of the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines.  These draft revisions proposed: </p>  <p>  - the setting of a more stringent day and night-time noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments,</p>  <p>  - a mandatory minimum setback distance of 500 metres between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations, and</p>  <p>  - the complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings.</p>  <p>  A public consultation process was also initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines, which ran until February 2014.  The Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this public consultation process.</p>  <p>  In light of the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to finalise the Guidelines and on-going policy and legal developments in this area, my Department is continuing to advance work on the Guidelines and related matters in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, in order to bring the various issues to a conclusion as early as possible.  I expect to be in a position to make a statement on the matter in the coming weeks, outlining the timelines for implementation of the various elements.</p>  <p>  As part of the overall review, and with regard to the recent ECJ Judgement in Case C-290/15 on the Belgian/Wallonian wind energy guidelines, it is proposed to undertake a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) of the proposed revisions to the 2006 Guidelines - in accordance with the requirements of Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment - before they are finalised.

However, despite a high level of engagement with a wide range of potential providers and financiers of social housing, no new model of provision and/or financing of social housing on an off-balance sheet basis could be identified.</p>  <p>  In response to this outcome, it was decided instead to commit &euro;10 million per annum from the Bord Gais proceeds, over a longer period, which could be used to secure the development of a pilot affordable rental scheme.  Action 4.6 of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan provided for the introduction of an affordable rental scheme to enhance the capacity of the private rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  Provision was made for &euro;10 million to be allocated through my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2017.</p>  <p>  As set out in the recently published Strategy for the Rental Sector, the commitment on affordable rental is now to be progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones.  Lands held by local authorities in rent pressure zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, targeting middle income households, in mixed tenure developments.  The cost of providing rental units is to be permanently reduced by lowering the initial investment and development costs for providers - AHB or private - allowing the rental units to be made available at below market prices without the need for ongoing rental subsidies.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the provision of &euro;10 million allocated for 2017 is being redirected to support additional activity under other housing programmes within my Department.  </p></reply>

To be eligible for the scheme a household must have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable by their lender under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) and agree to the voluntary surrender of their home.  In addition, the household must be deemed eligible for social housing support.  </p>  <p>  I am not in a position to comment on any particular case nor would it be appropriate for me to do so.  The reasons why a case has not progressed are varied and can depend on the lender, the property, the household and the ability of the Approved Housing Body to increase their involvement in the scheme.  Where MTR is not an option, it will be a matter for the borrower to discuss with their lender if there are other options available to resolve their mortgage arrears situation.</p></reply>

The average processing time for carer&rsquo;s allowance appeals determined by way of a summary decision reduced from 31.3 weeks in 2011 to 20.6 weeks in 2015, 17.6 weeks in 2016 and 19.1 weeks to date in 2017.  </p>  <p>  While carer&rsquo;s allowance processing times for the first two months of 2017 may appear to have increased slightly when compared with the 2016 annual figures, it should be noted that the corresponding figure for the first two months of 2016 was 22.7 weeks for an oral hearing and 18.9 weeks for a summary decision.</p>  <p>  The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved.

Therefore the discount rates applied to the CI&Eacute; Group and to private operators do not refer to the same calculation methods and, as a result, are not comparable.</p>  <p>  My Department, the Department of Transport and the National Transport Authority are currently reviewing the funding level for the scheme which was set in 2010.  We are also reviewing the payment mechanisms underpinning the free travel scheme.  The outcome of these deliberations will help to inform future funding requirements for the scheme.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The decision was communicated by the Board of CIB to all CIS and MABS Boards and to all staff on the same day.  The CIB assures me that there will be no job losses, no closure of services, no change to service delivery locations and no change to the terms and conditions of serving staff during the lifetime of the restructuring programme.  There will be no disruption to CIS and MABS services for those who use them. </p>  <p>  The decision comes after a lengthy and extensive analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders on the need for a more streamlined governance model.  The restructured governance arrangements are being implemented at local company board level only.  The decision does not include any proposal to defund the local network of services.  The services provided by CIS and MABS services are funded by the State, by way of an annual grant from the Citizens Information Board.</p>  <p>  The decision taken simply reduces the number of individual local CIS and MABS company boards from ninety three (93) to sixteen (16).  A new regional board structure will be put in place which will comprise eight (8) CIS boards and eight (8) MABS boards.  The valuable work carried out by the employees and volunteers working in CIS services and the employees of MABS services will continue as heretofore.  </p>  <p>  A more streamlined governance structure will result in a more targeted use of valuable staff resources, re-directed to increased front line service delivery, made possible by reduction in the current significant administrative burden associated with maintaining ninety three (93) individual companies nationwide.  The changes will bring the CIS and MABS organisations more into line with modern public service governance guidelines and requirements where significant State funding is involved.</p>  <p>  In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services (including &euro;13.1 million to the 42 local Citizens Information Services, &euro;1.2 million to Citizens Information Phone services and, the balance, &euro;0.7 million to central and other supports), and &euro;24.6 million is allocated to the network of MABS services (including &euro;15.4 million to the 51 local MABS, &euro;0.3m to National Traveller MABS, &euro;2.0 million to MABS National Development Company, &euro;3.3 million to the MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears initiative, &euro;3.5 million to the Abhaile service, and the remaining &euro;0.1m to MABS central supports).</p>  <p>  Following on from the decision of the Board, a Restructuring Implementation Group is being set up by CIB to examine all aspects of implementing the new sixteen (16) board model.  This work will include examination of the establishment costs of the new structure and the potential for future savings derived from the reduction in the administrative burden associated with ninety three (93) individual local companies.  Current costs are an aggregate of the costs incurred by each of the ninety three (93) local companies on items such as audit fees, professional fees (including legal services), payroll administration and board of director expenses.  While cost is not the driver of the restructuring project, some efficiencies are likely to result from moving to a reduced sixteen (16) company model.</p>  <p>  The aim of the project is to improve existing governance arrangements and optimise the benefits from operating a more modern, streamlined and customer focused service delivery model.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Government is doing everything it possibly can in our ongoing engagement with the Egyptian authorities to seek to have this young man returned to his home and his family at the earliest possible time.  The reality is that it is the Egyptian authorities that are detaining this citizen, and only the Egyptian authorities can make the decision to return him to Ireland.  The Government maintains open lines of communication at all levels with the Egyptian Government on the case.  I once again urged the Egyptian Government to release this citizen without further delay when I met with my Egyptian counterpart, Foreign Minister Shoukry, in Brussels on March 6th.</p>  <p>  My Department does everything possible to monitor the health and welfare of this citizen and we have emphasised the need to protect his health and welfare directly with the Egyptian authorities.  Minister Flanagan raised the issue with Minister Shoukry earlier this month.  Following representations from the Irish Embassy, the Court ordered a medical assessment of Ibrahim Halawa at the second last hearing.  A further assessment was ordered at the last hearing (22 March).  It is important that these medical assessments take place.  I am disturbed by recent reports about Mr. Halawa&rsquo;s health and I am seeking urgent clarification in this regard. </p>  <p>  We have made it clear to the Egyptian authorities that we hold them responsible for ensuring this citizen&rsquo;s welfare by carrying out regular medical checks and providing all required medical treatment.  The Egyptian authorities have consistently given us assurances on these points.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Cairo has paid an unprecedented number of consular visits to this citizen, more than 55 in all.

This funding is directed towards the provision of life-saving assistance including food support, shelter, and the provision of basic services including health, education and water and sanitation.  In 2016, we also provided &euro;7.5 million in core funding to UNICEF, the UN Agency which leads efforts, globally, to provide clean drinking water in humanitarian crises. </p>  <p>  The continued provision of timely humanitarian assistance to those in need in these countries is crucial, and we are currently preparing a package of assistance for the crises in South Sudan and in Somalia.  This will be in addition to the &euro;31 million Ireland has provided to South Sudan since December 2013 and the &euro;27 million provided for Somalia since 2012.  In the case of Yemen, Ireland has provided almost &euro;6 million in humanitarian assistance since the conflict began in early 2015 and we intend to maintain similar levels of support in 2017.  At the recent Oslo Conference, Ireland made an indicative commitment of at least &euro;5 million in humanitarian funding for 2017 for north-east Nigeria and the Lake Chad region. </p>  <p>  Intractable conflict is the main driver of the humanitarian emergencies for people in these countries.  It is clear that action at political level and by humanitarian organisations is required to protect the rights of the populations affected. Ireland is working with our international partners, including the EU and the UN, to support a strong focus on the need for peaceful resolution of these conflicts.  The EU has pledged up to &euro;50 million in support of the Multinational Joint Taskforce to combat Boko Haram, which supports 8,700 troops from Nigeria and neighbouring countries to promote regional security.  The EU is also funding the African Union peacekeeping Mission in Somalia, AMISOM, which is mandated by the UN Security Council to reduce the threat posed by Al-Shabab. </p>  <p>  Together with our EU and UN partners, we will continue to monitor these four crises closely and to provide significant life-saving humanitarian assistance for those in most need.</p></reply>

billion, the Government announced that on foot of the State Assets Disposal Programme, it would undertake further Exchequer investment including enabling works to support the PPP projects.  Almost &euro;100m   was made available for enabling works on the roads and education PPPs.</p>  <p> - In June 2013, the Government allocated &euro;150m   additional Exchequer investment to schools, energy efficiency and roads projects;</p>  <p> - At Budget 2014, the Government announced that along with the &euro;200m already committed to the National Children's Hospital, some &euro;200m   would be invested from the proceeds of the Lottery Licence transaction and used for a range of projects and programmes; </p>  <p> - In May 2014, the Government allocated a further &euro;200m   of investment for a range of capital projects in a number of different sectors and regions across the country. </p>  <p> - At Budget 2015, the Government announced that &euro;400m   of the proceeds to be received from the sale of Bord Gais Energy would be made available to support the Government's Social Housing Strategy.  </p>  <p> - In 2015, the Government allocated the &euro;335m   proceeds from the sale of its shareholding in Aer Lingus to establish a Connectivity Fund, to support commercial projects that enhance connectivity both within and for the State. The Connectivity Fund was established as a sub-Fund of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and is being managed by that Fund.   </p>  <p>In total, the Government has, to date, allocated over &euro;1.5 billion   from the proceeds of the State Assets Disposal Programme and the sale of the National Lottery licence to support jobs and economic development across the country.  As indicated above, Ervia has to date paid &euro;350m of the proceeds of the Bord Gais Energy transaction to the Government by way of special dividends.  A further special dividend of &euro;100m is expected in 2017.  The remainder of the proceeds will be paid to the Government on a phased basis, as required by Government and in a manner that is consistent with protecting Ervia's investment grade credit rating while also maximising the GGB impact of the payments.  In relation to the Bord Gais Energy proceeds earmarked for social housing, the Deputy will be aware that in Budget 2015 the Government announced that &euro;400m of these proceeds were to be made available to establish an off-balance sheet financial vehicle to provide financing to Approved Housing Bodies, with the aim of facilitating the provision of additional housing units in support of the Government's Social Housing Strategy.  However, despite a high level of engagement by the Department of Housing Planning, Community and Local Government with a wide range of potential providers and financiers of social housing, no new model of provision and/or financing of social housing on an off-balance sheet basis could be identified.  This reflects the strict requirements under Eurostat rules to qualify for off-balance sheet status. In response to this outcome, it was decided to commit &euro;10m per annum from the Bord Gais Energy proceeds, over a longer 20 year period, which could be used to secure the development of a pilot affordable rental scheme as envisaged in Rebuilding Ireland. </p>  <p>  A decision on the use to which the remainder of the Bord Gais Energy proceeds is to be put is under consideration.  In the meantime, pending payment of the proceeds to the Government by way of special dividend, Ervia has used the sale proceeds, on a temporary basis, to reduce debt balances, including debt associated with the assets disposed of, and to restructure its current debt facilities, resulting in cheaper finance for the Company.</p></reply>

The importance of immunisation is acknowledged by all the major international health organisations, particularly the World Health Organisation (WHO).  The immunisation programmes in Ireland are based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).  NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority and the European Medicines Agency continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  All relevant and appropriate information is taken into account when deciding to make changes to the State's immunisation programmes.</p>  <p>  It is important to counter misinformation in relation to the safety of vaccines, and to increase the uptake rates of all vaccines in the State&rsquo;s immunisation programmes.  The safety of vaccines, as with all medicines, will continue to be carefully monitored and any future new evidence of side effects that becomes available will take into account.  The benefits of vaccines significantly outweigh any known side effects.</p></reply>

In cases where a Member State does not introduce this new system for payment, the old scheme remains in place but payments must phase out on a digressive basis. </p><p>The biophysical criteria set out in the legislation to underpin the new system of designation are: </p><p>-  Low temperature</p><p>-  Dryness</p><p>-  Excess soil moisture</p><p>-  Limited soil drainage</p><p>-  Unfavourable texture and stoniness</p><p>-  Shallow rooting depth</p><p>-  Poor chemical properties</p><p>-  Steep slope.</p><p>My Department has commenced work on this project, and relevant technical experts are currently working on sourcing and analysing the data in relation to the new criteria.  Department officials have also been in contact with the Joint Research Centre  and DG Agri in the EU Commission in relation to technical issues arising.</p><p>Over the coming months this analysis will identify areas deemed to be facing natural constraints, which will in parallel be subjected to a refinement process.  The categorisation of designations, such as hill/mountain areas, and linked payment levels will be examined based on the outcome of the technical work I have outlined.  It is envisaged that stakeholders will be consulted as this process develops.  </p></reply>

The possibility of a voluntary all Island  label has been previously raised with British retailers, who have made clear that they have a longstanding policy to market British and Irish beef separately, with a simple, clear origin label.  This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one EU Member State i.e. born, reared and slaughtered in Ireland or in the United Kingdom, so that the label can simply indicate "Origin Ireland, or "Origin UK".</p>  <p>  While voluntary labelling of this nature has been mooted as a mechanism to encourage a live export trade between the Republic and Northern Ireland, it must be noted that this trade is determined by a range of factors, including the Sterling exchange rate and the supply of cattle in each market, retailer preferences and production cycles.  </p>  <p>  I met my counterpart from Northern Ireland, Michelle McIlveen MLA on many occasions to discuss issues of mutual interest and of course the north-south trade in cattle and beef has featured in these discussions.  Needless to say the focus now is on minimising the effects of the UK&rsquo;s proposed withdrawal from the EU and on securing arrangements which are best suited to the development of our respective agrifood sectors.</p></reply>

Based on information received, they suspended certification from the 4 establishments under investigation that were approved for export to the EU.</p>  <p>  On 20 March the Commission requested full information on all exports to the EU from the 4 establishments since 1 January 2017, and asked the Brazilian authorities to recall any consignments in transit.  The Commission also suggested the suspension of certification from all other establishments approved for export to the EU, pending the outcome of a full investigation.</p>  <p>  On 21 March I wrote to Commissioner Andriukaitis, supporting the suggestion to suspend certification from all other establishments approved for export to the EU.</p>  <p>  Food safety is a shared responsibility between national and EU authorities.  Food business operators in the EU also carry out their own quality and safety checks in line with their responsibilities to ensure that their products are safe. </p>  <p>  My Department is in charge of carrying out controls on imports (at Border Inspection Posts &ndash; BIPs).  The EU imposes strict hygiene and safety controls on food imports, and in particular on animal products for which documentary, identity and physical checks are compulsory for meat products imports.  These are implemented here in Ireland by veterinary staff from my Department at the Border Inspection Posts.</p>  <p>  The checks on all Brazilian product are now being intensified in light of current developments.</p></reply>

The likely outcome is closer to 6%, representing a significant shortfall in terms of reaching the 20% reduction in 2020. This reflects both Ireland's reduced investment capacity over the period of the economic downturn, as well as the fact that the target itself was misinformed and not consistent with what was achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, a key objective of the first statutory National Mitigation Plan is to try and close the gap to Ireland's 2020 EU target. In this context, the Plan sets out the mitigating measures currently in place and also a range of mitigating measures under consideration. It is important to note that the first National Mitigation Plan represents an initial step to set us on a pathway to achieve the level of decarbonisation required by 2050. It does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the 2050 objective, but rather is a work in progress reflecting the reality of where we are in our decarbonisation transition. When finalised, the Plan will become a living document, accessible on my Department's website, which is continually updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options. In addition, there will be the formal preparation of successive National Mitigation Plans at least once every five years as provided for in the 2015 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act. </p>  <p>  In the context of the development of renewable electricity generation, the White Paper on Energy Policy, "Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030" (December 2015), is a key policy driver in our low carbon transition and in the development of appropriate mitigating measures to achieve that transition.</p>  <p>  The overarching objective of the Energy White Paper, published in December 2015, is to transition to a low carbon energy system which provides secure supplies of competitive and affordable energy to citizens and businesses. This will involve moving away from higher emissions fuel types to lower emissions fuels such as gas, or zero carbon renewable energy technologies. Public Service Obligation (PSO) support for Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s Edenderry peat-fired generation station expired in December 2015. PSO support for the ESB owned West Offaly and Lough Ree power stations will expire in 2019. The Edenderry power station is now in receipt of support for biomass co-firing via REFIT3 for up to 30% of the size of the plant. In addition, Bord na M&oacute;na has stated that it intends to cease harvesting peat for electricity generation by 2030. The company has committed to replace large-scale peat production with alternative energy sources. This will contribute to the decarbonisation of electricity generation and is in line with the Energy White Paper.</p>  <p>  Moneypoint generation plant contributes to Ireland&rsquo;s security of supply by diversifying the fuel mix, provides generation storage capacity and provides competitively priced electricity. However, while Moneypoint is an important element of our power generation mix, before it comes to the end of its operating life in its current configuration in 2025, the most suitable low-carbon generation technology will have to be identified as committed to in the Programme for a Partnership Government. Key decisions on the future of Moneypoint will be taken before 2020, and this is included as mitigating option under consideration (RE8) in the draft National Mitigation Plan.</p></reply>

This includes &euro;10 million allocated under the Government Stimulus package 2014. </p><p>The first tranche for the years 2012/2013 funded fifteen cycling projects across the country with &euro;7 million in funding provided.  Under the second tranche for the years 2014-2016, a further three projects shared in funding of &euro;6.3 million. Of these three projects only one (in Waterford) has been completed. In May 2014, a &euro;10 million investment package for greenway development was announced by Government as part of the &euro;200 million national stimulus package. Eleven cycling projects were selected to share in this funding and eight of these projects have now been completed. </p><p>In July 2016, &euro;3.5 million was reallocated from the second tranche of NCN funding to projects in Kildare, Meath, Westmeath and Longford as two of the original projects selected (Kerry and Galway) were not in a position to draw down their full allocation for 2016.</p><p>It is a condition of any funding award that local authorities are responsible for the ongoing maintenance of the infrastructure once the project has been completed.</p><p>Separately, under the Sustainable Transport Measures Grants (STMG) Programme, my Department provides funding to the National Transport Authority (NTA) for the seven local authorities in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) for the implementation of sustainable transport measures which includes cycling and walking infrastructure.  The NTA also manages a similar sustainable transport grants programme - the Regional Cities Programme - in the four regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. I have forwarded your request to the NTA for consideration and response to you within 10 working days in relation to greenway projects funded.  If you have not received a response within 10 working days please contact my office.</p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>Greenway/Cycling projects funded</b></div></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td><b>All projects completed unless otherwise stated</b></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>Projects 2011 </b></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b><i>Year</i></b></td><td><b><i>Local Authority</i></b></td><td><b><i>Project</i></b></td><td><b><i>Status</i></b></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Limerick</td><td>Great Southern Trail extension</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Longford Town</td><td>Royal canal cycle and walkway</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Westmeath</td><td>Mullingar cycle network extension - Ballinagh to Shandonagh</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Waterford</td><td>The Track walking and cycling route</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Leitrim</td><td>Shannon Erne cycle/walkway</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Limerick</td><td>Nenagh Loop cycle/walkway</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>National Cycle Network Funding Programme 2012-2013 - Projects funded</b></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Carlow/Kilkenny</td><td>44.5km cycleway linking Carlow to Paulstown to Kilkenny.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Clare </td><td>4km cycleway linking Ennistymon to Lahinch</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Donegal</td><td>195.5km cycle route between Donegal Town and Newtowncunningham</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Fingal</td><td>3km cycle link from Ashtown to Blanchardstown</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kerry</td><td>1.2km extension to existing cycle/pedestrian route from Killarney to Fossa </td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Limerick</td><td>3km extension to the Great Southern Trail (GST) from Abbeyfeale Town to Rathoran.</td><td><div> </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Louth</td><td>6.3km greenway from Omeath and Carlingford</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Mayo </td><td>8.8km greenway from Castlebar to Turlough Park</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Meath</td><td>3km cycle/walkway from Drogheda Ramparts to the Oldbridge Estate entrance.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Monaghan</td><td>4.5km cycle route through Monaghan Town </td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>North Tipperary</td><td>2.8km extension to the existing N52 walkway/cycleway </td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Offaly </td><td>16.8km of dedicated cycle lanes along the R420 from Tullamore to Moate </td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Roscommon</td><td>20km of dedicated cycle lanes along the former N6 between Athlone and Ballinasloe (<i>funding withdrawn due to inability to deliver project</i>)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Waterford City</td><td>3.2km cycleway between Tramore and Waterford City</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Waterford Co</td><td>6.4km cycleway between the City Outer Ring Road to Tramore </td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Westmeath </td><td>11.3km upgrading of canal tow path from Boardstown Bridge to county Boundary</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>*Outside of the NCN Programme Kerry Co Council received funding of &euro;200,000 in 2012, approved in 2010, to complete the Tralee/Spa/Fenit 1.8km cycleway.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>National Cycle Network Funding Programme 2014-2016 - Projects funded</b></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>Kerry</td><td>Phases 2 &amp;amp;

There are PSO services, which are socially necessary but financially unviable services, provided by operators under contract with the National Transport Authority (NTA) and which receive taxpayer funding.  And then there are commercial bus services, which are commercial services provided by operators under licence from the NTA and which receive no taxpayer funding.</p><p>Counties Cavan and Monaghan are served by both types of bus services.</p><p>The PSO network in the counties comprises approximately 17 routes operated primarily by Bus &Eacute;ireann but also one PSO route operated by Whartons Travel Limited.  The Deputy will be aware that funding for PSO services has increased in recent Budgets with Budget 2017 providing an additional 11% in taxpayer funding for the PSO programme generally.  PSO services generally are improving and expanding as reflected in the strong passenger growth figures recorded for 2016 when almost 32 million passenger journeys were made on Bus &Eacute;ireann PSO network nationwide, which represented a 5.5% increase as compared with 2015's figures.</p><p>Commercial bus services in the counties are provided by a mix of private operators and also Expressway, which is operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has recently announced its intention to withdraw one of its three Expressway routes in the region, namely route 33 Dublin/Derry.</p><p>As I have stated on numerous occassions, in cases where a commercial operator, such as Expressway, decides to alter or withdraw a route, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has the statutory powers available to it to respond as appropriate to ensure continued transport connectivity.  In response to Bus &Eacute;ireann's recent announcement, the NTA published an assessment of the proposed changes and indicated what action it believes is necessary to ensure continued public transport connectivity. </p><p>  As indicated in that published assessment, the NTA does not believe that connectivity issues arise on the route 33 corridor following the proposed withdrawal of Expressway's route 33.  In publishing its assessment the NTA has invited feedback on its proposals.  A copy of their assessment is available on <i>www.nationaltransport.ie</i>.</p></reply>

That is why I have directed IDA Ireland to explore the potential for winning more FDI on account of Brexit and the Agency and its staff are already working hard with this goal in mind.</p><p>In our efforts to win more FDI, we can continue to rely on the selling points that make investing in Ireland so attractive in the first place.  Ireland will also, of course, be remaining as a member of the EU and Eurozone.</p><p>All of this means Ireland will remain an appealing destination for overseas investors in both the pre and post Brexit context.</p><p>Our challenge is to make sure these messages are communicated to the international business audience.  It is for this reason that additional funding was provided to the IDA to strengthen its communication capacity.</p><p>These additional resources will help the Agency target key markets and hopefully secure investment that will lead to future jobs and opportunities for the people of this country.</p><p>IDA has also been provided with additional Capital supports for 2017 which will be used to provide grant assistance to FDI companies seeking to expand or to locate here and to support the IDA regional property programme.</p><p>IDAs enhanced property capacity is also important to retain and grow the existing client base in Ireland.  In 2017, the IDA will further progress its Regional Property portfolio by investing in 3 new Advance facilities in:</p><p>-  Galway;</p><p>-  Limerick; and</p><p>-  Dundalk.</p><p>IDA believes there are potential FDI opportunities for Ireland from BREXIT.  These opportunities are likely to be found along differing timelines, partially influenced by sector.  The potential sources of FDI are likely to come from:</p><p>-  existing IDA Clients with a presence in Ireland who also have a presence in the UK;</p><p>-  overseas clients (US, European and Asian) who have a presence in the UK but not in Ireland;</p><p>-  UK companies operating in the UK who now need certain access to the European Market; and</p><p>-  International clients without a presence in Europe seeking a European home.</p><p>Looking at the opportunities for our indigenous enterprises, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for the period 2017-2020 developed following the UK vote to leave the EU focuses on:</p><p>-  Consolidating and growing exports into the UK market</p><p>-  Expanding the Irish export global footprint, re-orienting towards N America, Canada, Asia and the Middle-East</p><p>-  Expanding the EI Export Platform</p><p>I have previously announced 39 extra staff for EI's overseas offices and in the Irish based team to support exporting companies in the context of Brexit.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-23a.548.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032300053#WRU01600"><p>My Department recognises the key role that innovation has played in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery to date.  It contributes significantly to job creation, exports and investment, and the competitiveness of the indigenous enterprise base, and also to embedding the foreign direct investment base in Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is clear that a strong interdependence exists therefore between science, technology and innovation policy and enterprise policy.  My Department has developed its Innovation 2020 strategy for Research and Development, Science and Technology and its Enterprise 2025 policy side by side.  A critical objective for my Department is delivering on the actions and commitments set out in Innovation 2020.</p>  <p>  A report published by my Department in October 2016, Economic and Enterprise Impacts from Public Investment in R and D in Ireland, focuses on the public R and D investments that are aimed at achieving enterprise impacts.  These relate to investments by this Department, through Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, and also through the Irish Research Council and the Higher Education Authority.</p>  <p>  This study has shown that investment in R and D translates into improved job creation and enterprise performance.  Among the findings are:</p>  <p>  -  Firms that invested in R and D grew employment by 14% between 2000 and 2014 while those that did not invest in R and D saw employment decline by 40% </p>  <p>  -  Similarly, R and D performing companies grew exports by 181% between 2003 and 2014 compared to a loss of 42% in exports for non-R and D performing companies over the same period</p>  <p>  -  R and D activity was identified as being one characteristic of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland client firms that has driven growth in sales and exports since 2003.  During the recession these firms exhibited greater resilience than non-R and D active firms and have increased their contributions to sales, exports and employment</p>  <p>  -  For Enterprise Ireland client firms funded through its R and D scheme, there was an 8% growth in net employment (22,003 jobs to 23,739 jobs) between 2002 and 2012. In comparison there was a 6.2% decline in employment in the total Enterprise Ireland client base over the 2002 to 2012 period (131,144 jobs to 119,935 jobs).</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) has played a particularly important role in supporting job creation in Ireland.  Between 2014 and 2016 employment in EI backed companies reached 200,000.  In its new strategy 2017 - 2020, Building Scale, Expanding Reach, EI is aiming to increase this further with a new target to create an additional 60,000 new jobs by 2020.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for 2017 &ndash; 2020 also aims to drive innovation in Irish enterprise to unprecedented levels through new supports to reach the target of &euro;1.25bn in R and D expenditure by its client companies per annum by 2020.</p>  <p>  In addition, Enterprise Ireland operates a range of supports to help companies engage with third level researchers to undertake collaborative research for the benefit of companies.  Again, evidence shows that R and D active firms who collaborate with the Higher Education sector do significantly better in terms of job creation and exports than those that do not collaborate.  Through supports such as Innovation Vouchers; Innovation Partnerships, and its network of Technology Centres and Gateways, Enterprise Ireland is striving to ensure optimum industry collaboration with our Higher Education sector.  In 2016 alone, a record number of 1,036 collaborative projects were supported by EI.</p>  <p>  A major aspect of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s work is to extract maximum value from Ireland&rsquo;s investment in the research system &ndash; the objective is to secure commercial purpose, leading to jobs and sales by transferring technologies and ideas developed in Irish research institutions out into firms.</p>  <p>  EI will continue funding its critical existing innovation supports while also developing a number of new supports which include:</p>  <p>  -  A new programme for Business Innovation to drive innovation beyond selling products based on technical innovations providing more customer focussed process and service solutions;</p>  <p>  -  A Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Initiative, a mechanism which enables public sector bodies to connect with innovative ideas and technologies and aimed at providing novel solutions for specific public sector challenges and needs. </p>  <p>  -  New initiatives to equip graduates and researchers in the higher education system with the key skills required by the enterprise base;</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s main objective is to encourage investment into Ireland by foreign-owned companies.  The Agency reported a second, consecutive record year in 2016.  199,877 people are now employed in IDA Ireland supported client companies, up from 188,035 in 2015.  This is the highest level of employment in the Agency&rsquo;s history.</p>  <p>  The area of research, development and innovation (RDI) is of strategic importance to IDA Ireland.  A company decision to invest in RDI may be to support improvement in productivity; to develop a strengthened reputation for quality or to develop new products and services.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy Winning FDI 2015-2019 outlines a plan to support clients in creating 80,000 new jobs and increase employment in the client portfolio to 209,000 by 2019.  Support for RDI will be key to achieving these targets.  Research, development and innovation investments not only embed existing FDI operations and employment but pave the way for future investment, job creation and export growth.  As the global battle for FDI intensifies, our investment in research and development will become even more critical to attracting and retaining FDI companies.</p>  <p>  The increase in RDI investment since 2000 has improved our attractiveness as an FDI location.  60% (just under &euro;60m in 2015) of IDA&rsquo;s total grant-aid budget is allocated to RDI projects each year.  This investment leverages RDI expenditure of &euro;600m by IDA clients for these approved projects and an overall annual spend by IDA supported companies of &euro;1.53bn per annum on RDI.  This has the effect of anchoring FDI clients and securing sustainable employment and related benefits to the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  The National Support System for Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for research and innovation, is coordinated by Enterprise Ireland.  Horizon 2020 is part of the drive to create new growth and jobs in Europe, has a budget of almost &euro;75 billion and runs over the period 2014-2020.  Irish companies that compete successfully for funding from Horizon 2020 will boost their innovative capability and competitiveness which in turn will deliver strong national economic impacts, including job creation.</p>  <p>  Demand for the Framework Programme from Irish companies has been high.  In the first 33 months Ireland&rsquo;s draw down was &euro;336.6 million, placing Ireland on target to meet its goal of securing &euro;1.25bn from Horizon 2020 by 2020.  Of this funding, over &euro;104 million went to companies and &euro;73.6 million of this went to SMEs.  Ireland has the highest success rate in Europe for the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument with a 16% success rate, compared to a European average of 6%.  Innovative Irish SMEs have secured &euro;26.5 million.</p>  <p>  70% of the Horizon 2020 budget (&euro;52 billion) is to be allocated between 2017 and 2020, which gives Irish companies the opportunity to continue availing of these supports. </p>  <p>  The recent national ex-post evaluation of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7) estimated that the European Commission contribution of &euro;625M to Ireland from 2007 to 2013 would lead to an estimated 2,000 jobs created per year.  It is expected that such figures will grow considerably in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s current target to double participation in the period 2014-2020.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently analysing more recent data in relation to Horizon 2020 and will publish updated results in due course.</p></reply>

That is why I secured significant additional funding for IDA Ireland to help the Agency better respond to the challenges and opportunities Brexit may present for each and every county of Ireland.  I also regularly engage with the IDA about its Brexit-related requirements and other issues in connection with securing new investment for Ireland.</p>  <p>  Our focus now is converting the interest shown to date by new investors into new projects here.  Both the IDA and the Government will continue to work hard with that goal in mind.  The IDA has also recently launched a new global communications campaign, called "Right Place, Right Time", which will help target decision-makers in key locations.</p>  <p>  While I am confident about the potential to secure new investment in Ireland, we do need to be realistic about what is achievable.  Competition for all new such investment remains intense and we should not expect tens of thousands of jobs to be created here by default.  </p></reply>

The fact that over 130,000 of those 201,000 jobs are outside of Dublin is significant.</p>  <p>  The objective of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s new &lsquo;Global Ambition&rsquo; strategy 2017-2020 is to support enterprises across the economy, to grow into strong Irish international companies, developing world-leading products and services and exporting them all around the world.</p>  <p>  There is a vast range of programmes and supports offered to companies to drive this strategy.  These include management capability, leadership and marketing/sales skills as well as promoting innovation and R&amp;D. Investment in these areas is becoming more important as the demands of the marketplace evolve and become tougher.</p>  <p>  In terms of supporting traditional industry, my view is that manufacturing in Ireland is still, and will always be, an essential part of a well-balanced economy.  Our manufacturers have innovated and moved with the times &ndash; and they will continue to do so.  Advances in ICT, new materials, biotechnology, fuels, and nanotechnology offer scope for continuous innovation in manufacturing. Together with the opening up of world markets, these advances offer great opportunities for Irish manufacturers.</p>  <p>  Manufacturing today is not just about making things anymore.  It is about finding solutions for a more sophisticated and demanding range of customers. It includes research, design, maintenance, sales and marketing, logistics and distribution too.</p>  <p>  The best way to protect and increase manufacturing jobs is to compete with excellent products and services, using high technology, drawing on design, innovation and our strong science base.</p>  <p>   We are placing a particular focus on encouraging startups and small businesses to embrace the culture of innovation that now exists and maximise the benefits of technology.</p>  <p>  My Department also ensures that companies can access the right type of funding, appropriate to their stage of development.  This ranges from microfinance right through to seed and venture capital, development capital and risk-sharing credit guarantees through the banks.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s activity across all sectors of the economy is supporting a total of 400,000 directly and indirectly supported jobs.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, our 8 Regional Action Plans for Jobs are building on the jobs potential of each region.  At local level, the Local Enterprise Offices, supported by EI, are supporting indigenous businesses and entrepreneurs in every county.</p>  <p>  I am currently finalising plans for a regional initiative of up to &euro;60m to support collaborative approaches to grow and sustain indigenous enterprise and jobs across the regions.  This will be administered by Enterprise Ireland.</p></reply>

Since 2012, the annual Action Plan for Jobs has delivered actions to support job retention and creation.  The unemployment rate has dropped from a high of 15.1% in February 2012 to 6.6 % in February 2017.

Much will depend on the nature of the future trade deal that will be negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations are likely to be complex and multifaceted. </p>  <p>  The Government has just published a new Trade Strategy, Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World which supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification - promoting diversified export markets in light of the potential impacts of Brexit is a key priority for my Department.  This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth.  The programme of trade missions and trade events for 2017 includes a substantive focus on the EU and third country markets. In 2017 we have 42 Minister led trade missions to existing and emerging markets.  These have been reorientated to reflect an increased focus on EU markets.  Enterprise Ireland is consistently working with client companies focussing on enhancing their competitiveness, capability and levels of innovation to assist them to diversify into new markets. </p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s suite of Free Trade Agreements with third Countries help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish firms.  These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be important for Ireland.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements giving Irish firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries.  The EU-Canada Free Trade Agreement will create sizeable new market access opportunities in services and investment in many sectors for Irish firms.  My Department is already working with our agencies and Business Groups to ensure that Irish firms take early advantage of the terms of the Agreement.  I will be leading a trade mission to Canada in the first half of this year to promote the opportunities provided by the Agreement.</p>  <p>  The EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement has led to a sizeable increase in Irish exports since it came into effect in 2011.  This is the real evidence that Trade Agreements work for Irish exporters and Irish jobs. </p></reply>

The certainty, predictability and clear signal that this sends to enterprise &ndash; including both Irish owned and foreign owned entities establishing and doing business from here - remains essential.  This certainty has become even more important in the current dynamic and uncertain geopolitical landscape.</p>  <p>  The KDB, introduced in Budget 2016 forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s competitive offering to continue to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and to support Irish owned companies to innovate and to compete effectively on international markets.  The Government and I are satisfied that the Knowledge Development Box will protect Irish interest in the international jobs investment market and will continue to benefit the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  The continuing imperative to establish Ireland as the best place in which to succeed in business is reinforced in our national Enterprise and Innovation strategies.  Our aim is that Ireland will be recognised as the place where businesses are innovative, competitive and productive &ndash; leading to growth that is sustainable and results in employment opportunities and a higher standard of living for all.  These strategies set out the framework for investment over the coming decade to ensure that Ireland remains equally attractive to foreign direct investment and to Irish entrepreneurs and growth businesses in the context of an intensely competitive international environment. </p>  <p>  The Knowledge Development Box provides an effective 6.25% rate of corporation tax on profits from certain qualifying assets that are earned by a company, chargeable to corporation tax in the State, to the extent that the assets relate to R&amp;D undertaken by that company.  The OECD nexus approach sets out the principles and guidelines under which income arising from IP assets can qualify for a lower rate of tax under a KDB initiative. Ireland&rsquo;s KDB effective rate is 6.25 percent (half of the corporation tax rate of 12.5 percent) and is internationally competitive. </p>  <p>  The KDB complements the existing suite of initiatives and supports available to companies that undertake R&amp;D activities in Ireland across the lifecycle of research and development &ndash; including R&amp;D tax credits, RD&amp;I grant supports, support for technology acquisition (S291A), significant state investments in National Research Centres and knowledge transfer infrastructures, and advisory supports for accessing Horizon 2020 funding &ndash; providing a competitive proposition for business investment. </p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that the Knowledge Development Box will benefit companies of all sizes.  To ensure maximum access the Knowledge Development Box (Certification of Inventions) Bill 2016 will apply to certain small and medium sized companies to avail of the Knowledge Development Box without the need for public disclosure of their innovative concept.  Under the new scheme, the Patents Office will be the body certifying applications for inventions under the new certification scheme to check that they meet the criteria of being novel, useful and non-obvious.  The Bill is intended to open up the opportunity for companies across a broad spectrum to pay lower taxes on profits from Irish-based research and development activities.  This includes companies in incubation units right through to high-potential start-ups in all industry sectors once they are generating income resulting from research and development activities.  The scheme should serve to significantly boost Irish innovation and investment in research and development.   </p>  <p>  This Bill will be in the D&aacute;il for Reporting and Final Stage next week.</p></reply>

In 2016, 52% of all Agency supported jobs created were based outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  While IDA Ireland does everything in its power to ensure an even spread of investments, it is important to realise that the ultimate decision on location rests solely with the company.  There is a global trend to base foreign direct investment around large urban areas.  Quite often, companies also want to be located near competitors or clusters of other similar enterprises.  As a result, some businesses are only interested in investing in our larger cities.  </p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to achieving balanced regional development and this ambition is reflected in our eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs (RAPJs).  The aim of the RAPJs is to ensure that the unemployment rate of each region is within one percentage point of the State average by 2020.  These plans are delivering clear results with an implementation rate of over 90% for each region.  This improvement is also reflected in the increase in regional employment in 2016, with 70% of all new jobs created last year located outside Dublin. </p></reply>

This expansion was given significant consideration by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare which reported in July 2015. Senior officials from the Department of Education and Skills contributed to the discussions on an upper age limit for the scheme, taking a child centred approach and considering the delivery of better outcomes for all children.  As with any scheme, there must be entry and cut off points.  Prior to Budget 2016 the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme had one entry point (September) from when children could begin pre-school, and children had to be aged between 3 years and 2 months and 4 years and 7 months by the September to avail of the free pre-school year (i.e. 38 weeks).  The programme was then expanded by reducing the age of eligibility to 3 years and by increasing the number of entry points to three throughout the programme year (September, January and April).  This means that children can begin to avail of their free place on the pre-school programme as soon as possible after they reach the age of 3 and participate in the programme once they will not be older than 5 years and 6 months by the end of the programme year (i.e. end of June).  These rules for ECCE reflect evidence based policy and are necessary from an administrative and budgetary management perspective.  Regrettably, it is the nature of such rules that they benefit some more than others and it will therefore not be possible to provide an extension of ECCE in circumstances where a family may be unable to find a place for a child in their local school.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area. Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  In a circumstance where a child has been refused a place by a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, a parent or guardian can choose to take an appeal under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998  to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance.  Further information on the Section 29 appeals process is available on the Department of Education and Skills website <i>www.education.ie. </i></p><p>The Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is the statutory agency which can assist some parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The EWS can be contacted at 01-7718500.  The Deputy will be aware that, in legislation, the legal school starting age is 6.  Prior to a child reaching the age of 6, the Educational Welfare Services of Tusla cannot do anything in terms of representing/advocating for parents to access school places.  However, after the age of 6, Tusla's Educational Welfare Service would engage with, advise and support parents in accessing school places, including advising on the writing of appeals, with the Educational Welfare Officers acting as advocates at appeal hearings. <i></i></p><p>I would also note to the Deputy that plans are currently in train to provide for a new national scheme of financial support for parents towards the cost of their childcare entitled the Affordable Childcare Scheme, which will replace the existing targeted childcare subsidisation schemes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme.  This scheme may be of benefit to some families in the circumstances outlined. Further information on the scheme will be available from my Department shortly</p></reply>

The Coast Guard helicopters contribute across the roles of the Coast Guard, including the provision of maritime search and rescue services within the Irish search and rescue region. </p>  <p>  In the past, the Air Corps provided search and rescue services but was withdrawn from this role in 2004 following a handover to CHC Ireland, a private operator.  This decision was taken on account of what has always been the overriding concern of the Government: the safety of mariners and indeed anyone who gets into difficulty where Search and Rescue can respond.</p>  <p>  The Irish Coast Guard search and rescue services can draw on the support of the Air Corps on an &lsquo;as available&rsquo; basis under a Service Level Agreement between the Department of Defence and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the most recent of which has been in place since 2013.</p>  <p>  If requested, and if available, the Air Corps provide &ldquo;top-cover&rdquo; for the Coast Guard using a CASA fixed-wing maritime patrol aircraft. Coast Guard helicopters also provide their own &ldquo;top-cover&rdquo; during Search and Rescue missions.</p>  <p>  On the night of the tragic incident, the Coast Guard requested the assistance of the Air Corps to provide "top cover".  It was not possible to undertake this task.  The Air Corps is not providing fixed wing aircraft for routine operations, on an ongoing basis, outside normal hours.  This is because of a loss of experienced personnel both Air Crew and Air Traffic Control.  All agencies for which the Air Corps provides support in accordance with their Service Level Agreements were notified of this reduced availability last summer.  However, it is normal practice for agencies to check for Air Corps availability as relevant missions arise.  In exceptional circumstances outside of normal hours the Air Corps can recall personnel, as happened when Rescue 116 went missing.</p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that, while there has been a loss of experienced personnel in the Air Corps, there is significant work under way in the Defence Organisation, both civil and military, aimed at improving the capacity of the Air Corps.</p></reply>

The manpower requirement is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services.  As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force, targeted recruitment has been and is currently taking place so as to maintain the agreed strength levels.  </p>  <p>  Given the improvement in the domestic economy and demand for experienced pilots, the retention of experienced Pilot Officers in the Air Corps has been a significant challenge for the Defence Organisation in recent years, and there has been an outflow of experienced Air Corps Pilot Officers, both rotary and fixed wing.  A Working Group comprised of Civil and Military personnel was established to look at ways of addressing the issue of how to retain sufficiently experienced Pilot Officers within the Air Corps.  The Working Group&rsquo;s report contained a number of recommendations ranging from increasing recruitment levels to examining the current terms and conditions of pilots.  Work on the implementation of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations is currently ongoing by both Civil and Military staff of the Defence Organisation.  While there are a number of initiatives underway, realistically it will take time for a return to previous levels of capability in the Air Corps as pilots within the system progress to become aircraft commanders and newly qualified cadets become co-pilots.    </p>  <p>  There are currently three Cadet classes totalling 27 personnel at various stages of the Wings Course (this is reduced from the 28 previously reported, where one person has been unable to continue their pilot training) with 7 currently undergoing flight training, and four Apprentice Technician classes totalling 41 personnel in training with 5 due to qualify this summer. </p>  <p>  The 2017 Cadetship competition was launched yesterday Wednesday 22 March with a planned intake of up to 12 Cadets in Quarter 3 of 2017.  The Defence Forces also plan to launch an Air Corps Trainee Military Aircraft Technician competition in early Summer this year, from which it is planned to induct up to 25 Apprentice Technicians in Autumn 2017.</p></reply>

Key aspects of the re-organisation included the consolidation of under-strength units into a smaller number of full strength units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and the associated re-deployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational units.   </p>  <p>The White Paper on Defence, which was published in 2015, resulted from a comprehensive examination of Defence requirements over a ten year planning horizon and it specifically provides for the retention of the Army&rsquo;s two Brigade structure.   </p>  <p>  There are no plans to return to a three brigade structure which would cause a range of unnecessary inefficiencies, such as an increased administrative burden arising from the need to re-introduce a layer of non-operational middle management, and a return to under-strength units.</p></reply>

The strength of the Permanent Defence Forces on 28 Feb 2017 stands at 9,070 (Whole Time Equivalent): Army 7,293, Air Corps 701, Naval Service 1,076. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces has a policy of ongoing recruitment with the objective of returning to and maintaining its stated Establishment figure of 9,500.  In total 590 General Service Recruits (501 Army, 89 Naval Service) were inducted in 2016, along with 100 Cadets between all services.  Recruitment Campaigns for the Defence Forces will continue in 2017 with the following competitions scheduled to be launched in the early part of the year: Army Cadetship, Army Equitation Cadetship, Army Engineer Cadetship, Air Corps Cadetship, Naval Service Operations Cadetship, Naval Service Marine Engineer Cadetship, Naval Service Electrical Engineer Cadetship, Air Corps Trainee Military Aircraft Technician, Army General Service Recruits, and Naval Service General Service Recruits. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces are planning for the induction of 850 &ndash; 900 new entrants in 2017.    </p>  <p>  To date in 2017, 106 General Service Recruits (103 Army and 3 Navy) and 10 Air Corps Trainee Military Aircraft Technicians have been inducted.   Details for recruitment in 2018 and 2019 are yet to be confirmed and the extent of these campaigns will naturally be subject to Defence Forces strength and operational requirements at that time.   </p>  <p>  A key policy in supporting retention of military personnel is the provision of opportunit ies for extensive personal and professional development offered by the Defence Forces through accredited courses, and the unique features of the military environment.  Additionally, in terms of remuneration, the new Public Service Pay Commission has been tasked with providing objective analysis and advice on the most appropriate pay levels for the public service, including the Defence Forces.</p></reply>
