    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-10a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071000104#WRA00500"><p>Policy issues relating to childcare fall within the remit of my colleague, Ms Frances Fitzgerald T.D., Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Issues relating to employment rights policy fall within my remit.  Ireland's body of employment rights legislation protects all employees legally employed on an employer-employee basis in Ireland.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment in another person's home, on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees and as such, it is my view that no additional regulation is required.  </p><p>  It is important to distinguish such domestic employees from an au pair placement.  A genuine au pair placement falls outside the scope of the employer-employee relationship. </p><p>  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has encountered individuals, described by their employers as au pairs, who have been found to be domestic employees and as such are fully protected by the State's employment rights legislation.  NERA investigates such employers who are using the term au pair to avoid their statutory obligations under employment law.  Complaints received by NERA concerning au pairs would first be examined using the &#8220;Code of Practice Determining the Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals&#8221; in order to determine whether or not the person is in fact an employee. Where the employment status of the person cannot be established or is in dispute the matter is referred to the Scope Section of the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>  Where a person has concerns that employees may be exploited or are receiving less than their statutory entitlement, the matter can be reported to NERA for investigation.  Cases for redress on matters relating to Employment Equality or Employment Rights legislation can be made on the workplace relations complaint form available from NERA or online at .</p></reply>

The system that developed over the last sixty years had become unwieldy and complex; it lacked consistency, involved long delays and in some cases proved expensive for users.  In short, the system was no longer fit for purpose and it was for this reason that I have commenced a root-and-branch reform with the objective of establishing a world-class Workplace Relations Service.  Significant progress has been made to date and I am happy to report that in the last eighteen months a number of priority actions have been successfully delivered within the target timescale. </p><p>  While considerable progress has been achieved to date on an administrative basis, completing the proposed reform requires the enactment of detailed legislation in order to provide the statutory basis for the new structures and processes.  A significant amount of work has been completed on the preparation of the Workplace Relations Bill which will give statutory effect to the Reform proposals.  In July 2012, I published a policy document - <i>Legislating for a World Class Workplace Relations Service</i> - which was submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in order to give the Committee an early opportunity to shape the legislation.  I had a constructive dialogue with the Committee on the basis of this document.</p><p>  Enactment of the Bill will necessitate amendments to 22 primary acts, 12 specified parts or sections of acts and 71 statutory instruments.  The Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill has been approved by Government for priority drafting and was included on the 'A' list for the Government's Summer Legislative Programme 2013.  Engagement is on-going with the Attorney General's Office and I am committed to the enactment of the legislation at an early stage with a view to having the proposed new structures in place from 2014.</p><p>  I intend to progress the reform programme to the next stage with the same determination that has delivered the achievements to date.  I am working towards delivery of the new two-tier Workplace Relations structure so that from next year two statutorily independent bodies will replace the current five.  In the meantime I intend to continue to progress the reform and bring about further enhancements for users of the services on an administrative basis in the coming months.</p></reply>

The Article provides, in effect, that the exclusive power to make laws is vested in the Oireachtas. The Supreme Court took the view that Registered Employment Agreements are instruments having the status of laws made by private individuals. While the Constitution allows for the limited delegation of law making functions, the provision of the 1946 Act went beyond what is permissible under the Constitution.</p><p>  The effect of this decision is to invalidate the registration of employment agreements previously registered under Part III of the 1946 Act.  This is an important issue for many employers and their employees, particularly in relation to rates of pay and tendering for contracts.  With these issues in mind, I intend as soon as possible to legislate for a revised framework that will be fully informed by the Supreme Court judgment.</p></reply>

In an effort to help ease cash flow difficulties for Irish small businesses operating under the current economic environment, while at the same time, setting an example for businesses in the private sector to improve their payment record by paying each other more promptly, Ireland has introduced, on a voluntary basis:</p><p>  A 15 days prompt payment requirement for all central Government Departments to pay their business suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice. This arrangement applies to all valid invoices received on or after 15 June 2009;</p><p>  A similar arrangement has now being extended beyond central Government Departments to our State Agency Sector to include the Health Service Executive, the Local Authorities, State Agencies, and all other Public Sector Bodies, (with the exception of the Commercial Semi-State bodies). These new arrangements apply in respect of valid invoices received on or after 01 July 2011.</p><p>  The most recent set of composite figures published are for Quarter 1 2013 and show that 92% of Government payments, valued at &euro;468m, were paid to suppliers within 15 days.  The Quarter 1 2013 returns also shows that 91% of Agencies&rsquo; payments, under the remit of my Department and valued at &euro;28.3m, were paid to suppliers within 15 days.  The Late Payment Directive which established EU law in the area of prompt payments was originally introduced in 2000 and was recast in 2011 to modernise the law in this area.  The Recast Directive (2011/7/EU) came into effect across the EU on 16 March 2013.  The issue of prompt payment is now covered in Irish law by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 580 of 2012).</p><p>  This legislation will act as a deterrent to late payment and as a driver for payment on time by establishing a clear expectation in law that payment will be made according to agreed terms. It lays down the specific deadlines for the payment of invoices and establishes a right to compensation in the event of late payment in all commercial transactions, whether they relate to transactions between private or public undertakings, or between undertakings and public authorities.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2013 contains commitments in respect of a Code of Conduct on Prompt Payments to improve cash flow for business and to take steps to enhance awareness of the need for prompt payments by all elements of business.  Minister Perry recently announced agreement for the text of a Code of Conduct on Prompt Payments aimed at improving cash flow between businesses.  The Code of Conduct is being developed by the Business Representative Bodies in Ireland with the support of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Signatories to the Code will undertake to:</p><p>  - Pay suppliers on time, within the terms of contract and in accordance with legislation;</p><p>  - Give clear guidance to suppliers on payment procedure; and</p><p>  - Encourage good practice by promoting adoption of the Code.</p><p>  Prompt payments legislation serves as an important mechanism that can help to improve cashflow for businesses. I believe the publication of a Code of Conduct on Prompt Payments combined with the recent implementation of the Late Payment Directive and the 15 day prompt payment arrangement for the Public Sector, represents significant progress on the issue of prompt payments in Ireland in 2013.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-10a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071000104#WRA01500"><p>In the period between Quarter 1 2008 and Quarter 1 2012 the economy experienced the loss of 321,000 jobs. Throughout this period, those sectors which rely mainly on trading in the domestic market suffered the greatest job losses. For example, the Construction sector directly accounted for over 150,000 job losses between 2008 and 2012, while 48,000 jobs were lost in the Wholesale and Retail sector.</p><p>The sectors which have proved most resilient in maintaining or increasing employment levels during the economic crisis are those which are engaged in exporting goods and services. In examining the relationship between exports and employment, therefore, it is more appropriate to examine exports and employment for companies supported by the enterprise development agencies &ndash; which focus on exports - rather than the economy as a whole.  These companies account for the bulk of Irish exports (80% in 2012) and directly employed 294,000 in 2012.  They are indirectly responsible for a similar number of jobs in ancillary and support services.</p><p>Table 1 shows the numbers in employment in companies supported by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and Udaras na Gaeltachta between 2003 and 2012.  The value of exports in these companies over the same period is also provided.  The table shows a reasonable correlation between employment and exports in these companies throughout the period 2003-2012.  When exports performed strongly in the period 2003 to 2007, employment in agency assisted companies grew, with 23,500 jobs added in that period. As exports declined between 2008 and 2009, employment fell sharply. In the period 2008 to 2010, 45,000 agency supported jobs were lost.</p><p>Exports recovered again in 2010 and grew significantly during 2011 and 2012.  In the past two years, enterprise agency supported employment has increased by almost 17,000.  This is a positive development, bearing in mind the time lag between export growth and employment growth.  This lag effect is due to the fact that firms may be operating below capacity when exports start to grow, or that firms may be reluctant to increase employment until export gains are seen as long-term and sustainable.</p><p>There are also many variables that need to be considered in examining the correlation between employment and exports, including the constituent components of our exports which change over time as some sectors of the economy experience a decline and new sectors start to emerge and grow. It is notable that since 2002 Services Exports have increased from &euro;37 billion to over &euro;90 billion in 2012 and now account for almost half of total exports. Other variables include the competitiveness of our firms and the degree of labour intensity of various sectors, which in turn are influenced by technological and innovative improvements.</p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; Agency supported companies: Employment and Exports 2003-2012</b></p><p><table><tr><th></th><th>2003</th><th>2004</th><th>2005</th><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td><div>Employment<br />,000</div></td><td>300.2</td><td>298.5</td><td>307.8</td><td>319.6</td><td>323.7</td><td>316.6</td><td>283.6</td><td>278.0</td><td>285.8</td><td>294.8</td></tr><tr><td><div>Exports<br />&euro; billion</div></td><td>92.3</td><td>94.9</td><td>101.7</td><td>122.8</td><td>132.1</td><td>135.6</td><td>124.7</td><td>130.1</td><td>140.7</td><td>146.3<br />(est.)</td></tr></table></p><p><bu>Notes</bu><b>:</b></p><p>Data on exports is compiled by Forfas in the Annual Business Survey of Economic Impacts 2011 and captures data in respect of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and Udaras na Gaeltachta.</p><p>Data on Employment is taken from the Forfas Annual Employment Survey.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-10a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071000104#WRA01800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 48 together.</p><p>  Microfinance Ireland (MFI) offers loans for 3 or more years at 8.8% fixed rate for all types of business needs including working capital and financing of business equipment to people who have been refused credit by the Banks.  The Banks are offering standard variable rates for business loans and overdrafts for working capital at interest rates ranging from 6.5% to 8%.  The interest rate charged by MFI reflects the higher risk profile, lack of security and possibly lack of trading history of many of the MFI applicants.  The rate charged by MFI gives the customer the certainty of a fixed interest rate and fixed monthly repayments.</p><p>  I can confirm that with over six months trading history now behind it, MFI is currently reviewing feedback in relation to the features of the Loan Scheme in order to ensure that the loan is as accessible as possible to potential applicants while at the same time providing reasonable protection to the taxpayer and private funding underpinning the Fund. Launching a variable rate loan product is being considered as part of that review.  I should add that there is no feedback or evidence that a modest lowering of the interest rate will materially change the level of applications as the motivation for applicants to apply for the loan is based on their needs of having access to credit - having already been declined by their bank.</p><p>  The key challenge for MFI is to ensure that people are aware that there is support for new and existing viable businesses with perceived or real higher trading risk that have been refused credit by Banks. In that regard MFI has been engaged with key influencers across the country to get that message across. To date this has included:</p><p> - Meeting regularly with the Local Enterprise Offices and other support enterprise agencies at national and local level to ensure that the loan offering is understood and supported by them in their dealings with local communities;</p><p> - Mailshots to every TD in the country to ensure they have loan information, brochures and website details available at their regular clinics;</p><p> - Meeting the Banks and the Credit Review Office to ensure that they refer people declined by them to MFI;</p><p> - Make presentations at local micro and small business seminars and workshops across the country in order to heighten awareness of the loan fund.</p><p>  In addition MFI has run three radio campaigns across both national and local radio stations to raise awareness of the loan fund amongst local communities.

It will also support established companies or groups of businesses examine the potential for expansion, diversification or spinning out of a new enterprise in the industry.  The funding will enable the promoters to reach firm conclusions regarding the project's viability and strategies for developing and commercialising the innovative product or service on international markets. </p><p>  The fund is open to applications from the Aviation Sector including financial services associated with the sector, Aircraft and Engine leasing, Aviation software and IT, Training, Travel related software and related services, Small Aircraft Assembly, Aircraft Dismantle, Maintenance Repair Operations Airframe and Components, Composite Repair, Parts Manufacture, Aviation Services, and other engineering and technical activities.</p></reply>

While it is far too early to anticipate the eventual negotiated outcome<b></b>of the Agreement, the negotiating mandate is broad based and positions the Commission to enter the talks with strong support from the Council to negotiate the best possible deal for Europe.</p><p>  According to assessments made by the EU Commission and other European bodies, a comprehensive Trade and Investment Partnership could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum bringing significant economic gains as a whole for the EU.  Given the current very low level of economic growth in the EU and in Ireland, this agreement will provide a significant injection of economic activity and consequently of new job opportunities.  Based on those assessments, if Ireland simply benefited in proportion to the size of our economy within the EU, a comprehensive trade and investment partnership could over time provide gains to Ireland in the order of &euro;800 million per annum in increased GDP and 4,000 new jobs. </p><p>  An independent study by the London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), entitled 'Reducing Barriers to Transatlantic Trade', suggests the EU's economy could benefit by &euro;119 billion a year, up to 80% of which would come from cutting unnecessary costs imposed on business by having to comply with two separate sets of rules, and from liberalising trade in services and creating new access for exporters into the huge public procurement market in the U.S.  <b></b></p><p>  Given that negotiations have yet to begin, it is not possible to estimate in detail the impact on Ireland until there is greater clarity about any exchange of offers, the scale of the possible long term gains will have a positive impact on Ireland given our close trading and investment relationship with the U.S.  In addition, many Irish exporters are part of European supply chains where their exports to the UK, Germany or elsewhere to the EU, feed into Europe's exports to the U.S.  While tariffs are already low on trade across the Atlantic, the objective of abolishing even these will bring benefits to business in the short term.  Tariffs that average about 3% on EU/U.S. trade may appear insignificant but tariffs can be a tax on business and especially where trade is between company affiliates.  That is the case for a good proportion of trade between US multinationals in Ireland and the US market.</p></reply>

Promoting entrepreneurship, attracting inward investment and facilitating the key infrastructural needs of Irish enterprise across all regions is vital to ensuring a vigorous pipeline of new business leaders, new business ideas and entrepreneurial activity. The Action Plan for Jobs is a whole of Government, national strategy aimed at creating and sustaining jobs across all regions of the State.  The objective of balanced regional development is supported by the EU Commission's Regional Aid Guidelines, which recognise that some regions can face significant structural disadvantage.  Regional Aid Guidelines permit Member States to grant higher investment aid in areas suffering such structural disadvantage.  </p><p>  All of the enterprise development agencies have regional structures to maximise local opportunities.  Both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland have offices in Limerick, Cork, Waterford, Galway and Letterkenny, Co. Donegal.  This regional spread allows the agencies to drive take-up of their services and supports such as entrepreneurship programmes focused on identifying new business opportunities, at a local level, thereby maximising take up and impact.  In addition, EI has a network of 110 Community Enterprise Centres in operation across the regions.  At present, two thirds of employment in Enterprise Ireland client companies, well in excess of 100,000 jobs, is currently located outside of Dublin.</p><p>  The establishment of a one-stop-shop to provide micro-enterprise support through the dissolution of the existing CEB offices and the creation of a new network of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) will ensure an enhanced delivery of support to micro-enterprises in the regions and nationally.  Microfinance Ireland is also providing support to such businesses.  This comes in the form of loans available to microenterprises of up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly-established or growing firms employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.  The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal.</p><p>  LEADER, which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government also provides both direct and indirect support to enterprise start-ups and already established microenterprises in rural areas all over Ireland.  Since 2009, almost &euro;20m has been provided for direct support to enterprise in rural Ireland through the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013.  A significant proportion of the resources provided through the RDP Training Measure, which has registered a further &euro;10m in expenditure to date, also provides indirect capacity building and mentoring support for rural entrepreneurs. </p><p>  To support the development of a pipeline of High Potential Start-Ups across all regions of the country, Enterprise Ireland has the following initiatives in place:</p><p> - The New Frontiers Programme</p><p> - Competitive Feasibility Fund aimed at stimulating start-ups and creating jobs and growth in the regions.</p><p> - The &quot;Get Export Ready&quot; Programme encompasses a wide range of practical measures for early exporters focusing on export readiness, the importance of research, developing a value proposition and the skills of export selling. </p><p> - Innovation Vouchers worth &euro;5,000, give small companies access to the vast knowledge available in Irish Institutes of Technology, Universities and other public research bodies. </p><p>  I believe that these measures combined with other initiatives set out in the Action Plan for Jobs will assist the development of investment and employment opportunities at regional level and across the country generally and help to achieve our objective of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business. </p></reply>

There is also an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary bargaining process, together with long-established dispute settling institutions that play an important role in disputes relating to collective bargaining.  </p><p>  In the absence of a practice of voluntary collective bargaining, subject to agreed qualifying criteria, the Industrial Relations Acts, 2001 &amp;amp; 2004, provide for a mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality could be assessed.  A 2007 decision of the Supreme Court in Ryanair v The Labour Court impacted on the process to be followed where issues pursued to the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts, 2001 and 2004 to resolve problems between employers and workers on employee representation issues where that could not be done through existing procedures.</p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to reform the current law on employees' right to engage in collective bargaining (the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001), so as to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.  With this in mind, in late 2012, I wrote to relevant stakeholders inviting their observations on the matter.  Submissions have been received and follow up meetings took place between Departmental officials and stakeholders up to end May 2013.  Legal advice on issues arising is awaited.  </p><p>  I hope to be in a position to put proposals to Cabinet later this year.  In this context, I am certain that satisfactory arrangements can be put in place that will reconcile Ireland's constitutional, social and economic traditions, and international obligations, whilst at the same time ensuring continued success in building Ireland's domestic jobs-base and in attracting overseas investment into the economy.</p></reply>

Ireland's open economy needs to have the export of goods and services at the heart of its economic strategy.  The excessive growth in the reliance on property in the years up the crisis was not only unsustainable but it undermined Ireland's competitiveness in export markets and caused a steady decline in our export market share.  The economic transition which we are now undertaking must be founded solidly on exporting with the innovation and enterprise that is necessary to support it.</p><p>  Employment in agency supported exporting companies fell by over 46,000 between 2007 and 2010.  However in the past two years this has been reversed and 22,000 net additional persons are now at work in those exporting companies.  This has been built on strong performances by both Irish owned and foreign owned companies in export markets.  The fall in exports recorded in the first quarter has broken with this trend.  My Department and Agencies are closely monitoring this situation.  It is clear that there has not been a negative impact in employment during that first quarter.  A number of factors are at work such as the re-pricing of pharmaceutical products which are coming off patent and a downgrading of demand in many of our key trading partners.</p><p>  Other sources of data suggest that export growth can be sustained.  They underpin the importance of work to build up our position in export markets through initiatives in the areas of trade promotion and innovation.  In this context, Enterprise Ireland has established a Potential Exporters Division as a new way of engaging with Irish companies and providing them with mentoring, business advocate support and financial support.  A pilot initiative will also be commenced, focusing on enabling companies to research, evaluate and plan market entry strategies in new geographic markets.  A total of 15 Ministerial Trade Missions will take place in 2013 to existing and emerging markets.  </p><p>  In addition, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Overseas Offices will work with indigenous companies to help them realise new market opportunities.

However, on 29 September 2011, the company announced 100 voluntary redundancies at the facility.  The redundancies were a result of a manufacturing line for one product being transferred to Thailand.  The redundancies were to take place over a two year period and the company is currently completing this process. 	</p><p>  In relation to Alkermes, a review of its Athlone operations was undertaken as a result of a fall in demand for certain pharmaceutical products that had become generic or are nearing the end of their commercial life.  Following the review, the company decided to reduce the number of staff at their Athlone facility.  Reductions of approximately 100 to 130 staff are expected to take place over a two-year period as these older product lines are phased out.  The company anticipate that a reduction in staff numbers will be achieved through a combination of natural attrition, voluntary redundancy and compulsory redundancy.  While this will inevitably have a regrettable impact on the staff affected, favourable redundancy terms and outplacement services will be provided and discussed as part of the consultation process with employees.  </p><p>  The Athlone facility will continue to play a strategic part in Alkermes' future business, and significant investment is planned to be made at the site over the next number of years which will allow Alkermes to focus primarily on the manufacture of newer, advanced pharmaceutical product lines.  World-class development and manufacturing activities at the plant will remain robust and will continue producing global pharmaceutical products.  The Alkermes facility in Athlone will remain strategically important to Alkermes&rsquo; global development and manufacturing network.  Headquartered in Dublin, Alkermes currently employs 440 people between its corporate headquarter offices in Dublin and its facility in Athlone. </p><p>  I am confident that the on-going efforts of IDA Ireland and the other development agencies will continue to enhance job creation in the Athlone area.</p></reply>

I am mindful, however, that the aviation sector contributes approximately &euro;4.1 billion directly to the Irish economy and that Ireland is responsible for half of the world's aircraft leasing.  A report from Oxford Economics in 2012 estimated the air transport industry directly employed 26,000 people and a further 16,000 people are estimated to be employed along the air transport supply chain. </p><p>  In light of the above, the Government, through its Action Plan for Jobs 2013, agreed that it would support the development of the aviation industry in Ireland.  In that regard, I recently launched the new Enterprise Ireland &euro;375,000 Competitive Feasibility Fund.  The Fund will provide up to &euro;25,000 to support new start up companies or individual entrepreneurs to investigate the viability of a new significant growth oriented business or proposition in the aviation sector.  It will also support established companies or groups of businesses to examine the potential for expansion, diversification or spinning out of a new enterprise in the industry.  The funding will enable the promoters to reach firm conclusions regarding the project's viability and strategies for developing and commercialising the innovative product or service on international markets.  The fund, which will remain open until 16 September, is open to applications from the aviation sector including financial services associated with the sector, aircraft and engine leasing, aviation software and IT, training, travel related software and related services, small aircraft assembly, and other engineering and technical activities.</p><p>  IDA Ireland continues to market Ireland as a location for aircraft leasing on the basis of a number of selling points, including the following:</p><p>  - Ireland is an established major centre of global significance, with 9 of the top 10 industry leaders having operations in Ireland.  This is partly due to the longevity of the industry going back to the establishment of GPA as one of the first aircraft leasing companies in the world;</p><p>  - The availability of a talented pool of people with superior levels of expertise and commercial technical and legal experience;</p><p>  - A pro-business and technologically advanced environment; and</p><p>  - An attractive corporate tax rate and double taxation treaty network. </p><p>  IDA Ireland has confirmed that the above points are consistently cited as reasons why key global corporations continue to select Ireland as a destination of choice for aircraft leasing.  The aircraft leasing sector continues to grow globally and, notwithstanding competition from other locations, IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to seek to win investment in this sector.</p></reply>

The Labour Court is a court of last resort in the industrial relations process, and it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the Court&rsquo;s recommendation.  However, the system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature and recommendations of the Labour Court are not legally binding.  Neither the Labour Court, nor I, can compel a company to comply with such recommendations.  Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties to the dispute.</p></reply>

These measures are being delivered by various bodies, including Enterprise Ireland, InterTradeIreland, the National Procurement Service (NPS) and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The NPS and Enterprise Ireland are continuing to encourage SMEs to register on the Government&rsquo;s eTenders website to enable forthcoming procurement opportunities to be brought to their attention.  Since the upgrade to the eTenders website in November 2012, an additional 12,000 companies have registered with the site.  This brings the current total of registered suppliers to approximately 82,000.</p><p>  As well as publishing contract notices, the new eTenders site has a wide range of additional functionality that will allow other aspects of the procurement process to be completed electronically.  This additional functionality is improving and generating efficiencies for both the public and private sectors.</p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation in procurement, the NPS and InterTradeIreland have, over the past three years, conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the public sector.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  Enterprise Ireland has also participated in these events.  To date, over 4,500 SMEs have attended events of this nature throughout the country.  SMEs are being actively encouraged to form consortia or similar business relationships to improve their bids for larger contracts.</p><p>  In the context of the reform of public procurement and the establishment of a national Procurement Office, my Department and Enterprise Ireland are in on-going dialogue with the new National Procurement Officer to ensure that opportunities for SMEs to access procurement opportunities are taken into consideration and that tendering criteria are proportionate.  Last year, my Department and Enterprise Ireland introduced a new Procuring Innovation initiative to make better use of the innovation available in Irish-based companies to provide solutions to the public sector.  This initiative has resulted in some promising contacts between contracting authorities and SMEs.  The objective is to build further on this initiative in 2013.</p><p>  Full details of the implementation of the actions aimed at improving SMEs access to procurement are published in the quarterly Progress Reports on the Action Plan for Jobs which are published on my Department's website, www.enterprise.gov.ie.</p></reply>

By comparison, in the last two years, there has been a significant slow-down in the decline in the number of young people at work.  Recent labour market figures published by the CSO indicate that the number of people under 25 years of age in employment decreased by 4,000 in the year between Quarter 1 2012 and Quarter 1 2013.  The number of unemployed people under 25 years of age fell by 10,000 in the twelve  month period to Quarter 1 2013, while the unemployment rate for young people fell from 29.7% to 26.6% over the same period.  This downward movement in youth unemployment in Ireland differs from the trend in the EU as a whole, where youth unemployment has continued to rise.  However, youth unemployment continues to present a major challenge for Ireland as it does for most other Member States. </p><p>  The work which the Government is doing through the Action Plan for Jobs aims to transform our economy from one that became over-dependent on property, construction and debt, to one focused on enterprise, innovation and exports.  The Action Plan is focussed on sustaining and creating employment for all, including young people.  There are a range of initiatives in place under the Action Plan and Pathways to Work to support young people looking for employment.  These include programmes such as JobBridge, Springboard, Momentum and the ICT Action Plan, which are delivered by the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills.  A recent independent evaluation of the Jobbridge scheme conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that 61% of interns progressed to paid employment after completing their internship. These progression outcomes are among the best in Europe for similar schemes. </p><p>  My Department is also keen to support young entrepreneurs and, in this context, initiatives such as Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Competitive Start Fund and New Frontiers Programme, along with the Microenterprise Loan Fund, will all contribute to supporting young entrepreneurs.  The Government will also publish a Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship, including youth entrepreneurship, later this year.</p></reply>

As an increasingly important component in the way companies differentiate themselves, the customer contact centre has evolved into a multi-functional, multi-lingual environment, which adapts new digital technologies at an early stage to service a global customer base.   </p><p>  According to the Contact Centre Management Association of Ireland (CCMA) who published the findings of its research into the role of contact centres throughout Ireland in 2011, the sector employs more than 29,000 people, with a spread of over 100 contact centre operations nationwide. The CCMA findings show very positive results against the backdrop of a challenging economic climate and emphasise a focus on growth and business retention within the sector.</p><p>  IDA Ireland continues to seek to attract customer support companies to locate in Ireland as part of its overall strategy to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). This strategy has proven to be successful and Ireland is now home to a broad range of companies based in different industries servicing multiple markets. Examples of such companies include, Google, Facebook, Lufthansa, Cook Medical, Hertz, EMC, Merrill Lynch, EA Games and Riot Games.  Recent announcements by Paypal and Zenimax further endorse the successful strategy being pursued by IDA Ireland. </p><p>  The Irish owned Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) sector, which is a sub sector of the services industry and involves the provision and management of non core processes and services by third parties under contract, grew out of customer management activities. This sector is now growing through the provision of specialist services to meet specific market needs in regulated and compliance driven sectors, including finance and administration, HR services and Public Sector outsourcing. Within customer management, the Irish sector is developing a strong position in the multilingual sub-sector. There are over 6,000 people employed in Enterprise Ireland supported companies who had total sales and exports of over &euro;180m and &euro;60m, respectively in 2012. Growth in the past 3 years has been driven by Irish companies supplying multi-lingual tech and financial services support to the overseas divisions of multinationals and growth in services to the Irish banking and public sectors. </p><p>  The Irish BPO sector provides significant opportunities to both maintain and expand employment based on securing business opportunities, both domestically and in export markets. Enterprise Ireland is working with client companies to identify and pursue opportunities identified in the public sector and with the base of multinational companies operating in Ireland. The Agency is also supporting clients to access export markets, specifically the UK, in specialised niche market sectors such as the public sector, insurance and other financial services.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland is working with BPO Companies to:</p><p>-  Develop technology platforms, specifically in the areas of Cloud Computing and Data Analytics, which are currently the two main drivers of technological change in the global BPO market. </p><p>-  Ensure that they can compete in key areas such as sales and marketing, data analytics and advisory capacity.</p><p>-  Assist them in building the best management teams and service innovation capability in the industry.</p><p>-  Given Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in terms of technology, skills and existing base of companies, to continue to develop our offering in terms of knowledge intensive services.  These services require high levels of expertise in the industries they service combined with sophisticated customer interaction and decision making.</p><p>-  Support a cluster development project for 13 BPO companies to investigate the potential opportunity in overseas markets.</p><p>  In accordance with the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, Enterprise Ireland and IDA are committed to working together to put in place a joint strategy to further establish Ireland as the best location in Europe from which to deliver complex, added value services. The vision for the Irish owned sector is to have a competitive BPO sector with companies of international scale which will result in continued increased employment growth in Ireland.</p></reply>

This follows on from contractions in the last two quarters of 2012.  The contraction in GDP in the first quarter of 2013 is attributable to the fall in consumer spending and a decline in exports due to the impact of a weak global economy.</p><p>  However, these figures should not be seen in isolation.  Gross National Product increased by 2.9% in the first quarter of the year.  It should also be noted that the most recent trade figures published by the CSO show that the value of goods exported recovered in April 2013 and were up 6% on the same month in 2012.  Meanwhile, the volume of retail sales increased modestly in May.  Despite the contraction in GDP, we have seen an annual increase of 20,500 in the number of people in employment to Quarter 1 2013, with employment growth on a seasonally adjusted basis up by 23,700 in the last three quarters.</p><p>  The unemployment rate decreased from 15% in the first quarter of 2012 to 13.7% in the first quarter of 2013 &ndash; the first time the unemployment rate has fallen below 14% for some years.

It is in this way that we will create the environment in which sustainable jobs will be created, living standards will be raised and Ireland will be regarded as an attractive location in which to live and work. </p><p>  More specifically, engaging with the Diaspora to strengthen and form new relationships is a particular Government priority underpinned by the Global Irish Economic Forum. For example, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland's Senior Management team are focusing on the roll-out of a number of joint initiatives, including marketing and events aimed at attracting entrepreneurs and start-ups to Ireland, and ongoing engagement with Irish emigrants through the Global Irish Network.IDA Ireland engages with the Irish Diaspora working in multinational companies in its role to attract new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Ireland and to build on the existing FDI base to support Irish management to win new business. The ability of the investor to source the very best quality people, with appropriate levels of training and experience, is a prime consideration and a real location differentiator. Attracting skilled Irish emigrants back to Ireland is an important component in creating this skill base. The &#8220;Succeed in Ireland&#8221; initiative to attract greater numbers of inward investors to Ireland provides direct financial incentives to people around the world to create employment in Ireland by rewarding people responsible for bringing sustainable jobs to Ireland.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) also plays a significant role in forging linkages with Ireland's Diaspora. Under the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, EI initiatives included the establishment of a &euro;10m International Start-up Fund and a targeted marketing campaign making greater use of existing<font color="#000080"> </font>  networks in the IDA and the wider Diaspora. In 2012, twelve overseas entrepreneurs were supported by Enterprise Ireland to establish their companies here. This campaign is continuing in 2013.  Enterprise Ireland is also involved in the establishment of a website  which features opportunities in Irish SMEs in the ICT sector and allows our Diaspora a full view of the potential opportunities for employment and advancement. </p><p>  The Government recognises that there has been an increase in emigration, particularly amongst young people, since the start of the recession. However, the CSO data also indicates that significant numbers of Irish migrants have been returning to the country since 2008. For example, 20,600 Irish people returned to Ireland in 2012. These are people who had previously emigrated seeking work, and many of them are coming home having gained skills and expertise abroad that we can now capture to strengthen the operation and management of companies based here.</p><p>  While there will always be people who choose to emigrate for personal or professional reasons, the Government's aim is that, by continuing the process of transforming our economy step by step through the Action Plan for Jobs, we can provide opportunities for employment in Ireland.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is not possible to provide the information requested. </p><p>  As indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 116 to 118, inclusive, of 30 May 2013, significant measures were taken in response to concerns in the 1990s regarding Irish Registered Non-resident companies. These can be found at sections 42-51 of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999 as amended. </p><p>  The relevant measures placed the following obligations on companies wishing to incorporate in Ireland:</p><p>Firstly, as a precondition of incorporation, every application for registration is required to demonstrate that the proposed company intends to carry on an activity in the State. </p><p>Secondly, the Act requires that every company registered in the State is required to have and maintain at least one director that is resident in the European Economic Area or the company must hold a bond to the value of &euro;25,394.76. </p><p>  The requirement for either a bond or an EEA resident director does not apply if the company obtains from the Registrar of Companies a certificate that the company has a real and continuous link with one or more economic activities in the state. The company concerned must provide proof of such a link. A statement from the Revenue Commissioners that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the company has such a link is deemed proof of a link under the Act.</p><p>  Additionally the number of directorships which can be held by one person was limited to 25 (subject to certain exemptions).  Finally, the Act contained enhanced strike-off provisions and enhanced notification to the Companies Registration Office where directors have resigned. The Companies Bill 2012 contains similar provisions to sections 42-51 of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999 as amended.</p></reply>

The issue of employment creation is one that is challenging all Member States across the Union. Under our Presidency we have made progress in a significant number of areas that can create the right environment for growth and employment in accordance with the &ldquo;Compact for growth and jobs&rdquo; as agreed by Heads of State and Government in June 2012.  </p><p>  I placed a strong emphasis on advancing measures that can boost the EU&rsquo;s competitive edge globally. Overall, our Presidency achieved major successes across the policy spectrum and has significantly enhanced the reputation of this country at home and abroad.  Our good standing and reputation is a vital ingredient in making this country attractive to investors and for instilling confidence leading ultimately to jobs and growth. This will assist us in building on the average of 2,000 jobs per month created in the private sector over the last twelve months in contrast to the loss of 7,500 jobs per month during the years 2008-2010.  </p><p>  Within the various Council formations which I had the honour to chair, we succeeded in attaining agreements on all of the significant funding Programmes under the EU&rsquo;s new 2014-2020 Budget, itself agreed during our Presidency. For example, on the agreement on the new &euro;70 Billion research and development Programme, Horizon 2020, Ireland argued strongly, and successfully, in favour of a greater emphasis on the SME sector.  In addition to new specific supports, such as access to finance and debt and equity facilities, for SMEs, it has now been agreed that the target for SME participation in relevant areas of Horizon 2020 should be increased from 15% to 20%. This is a significant change given the proposed scale of Horizon 2020. In line with the Action Plan for Jobs we will pursue funding and other opportunities under EU Horizon 2020 for specific sectoral activities of national importance and in line with our national research priorities. </p><p>  Agreement was also achieved on the &euro;2.03 Billion dedicated Programme for Competitiveness and SMEs (COSME Programme) which will provide targeted financial support for SMEs. In particular, I welcome the proposed equity facility for growth-phase investment which will support the development of the EU wide Venture Capital market, as well as the Loan Facility which will provide direct or other risk sharing arrangements with financial intermediaries to cover loans for SMEs. We also built on the progress already made in reducing business costs by the administrative burden reduction efforts of the Commission and Member States. At the end of 2012 annual administrative savings totalling almost &euro;288 million representing a 19% reduction have been achieved for business in Ireland as against 2008.</p><p>  Proposals on State Aid Modernisation (SAM) were also agreed. These new State Aid Regulations will take account of post-crisis structural reforms and industrial restructuring which Member States are undergoing and the need for better alignment of State Aid with Europe 2020 objectives.  </p><p>  A number of important files which were vital to completing the EU Single Market were also agreed or significantly advanced, including those on recognition of Professional Qualifications, Public Procurement, and the Accounting Directive.  Agreement on these will make it easier to move and work across all Member States and to lower transaction costs for SMEs.</p><p>  In the area of Patents, remarkable progress was made to complete the Single Market in that sector with the signing of an International Agreement on a Unified Patent Court by 25 participating Member States during the Competitiveness Council on 19th February last. It has been estimated that users of the Unified Patent Court could save somewhere between &euro;148 and &euro;289 million per year, compared to the present costs of &euro;1.5 million in some Member States of such litigation.</p><p>  Agreement was reached at the EPSCO Council on the Youth Guarantee, which promises to provide young people with a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed. In addition, the European Council approved a Youth Employment Initiative amounting to &euro;6 billion for the period 2014-2020 to support measures aimed at addressing youth unemployment and, in particular, to support the Youth Guarantee for regions with particularly high levels of unemployment. Furthermore, political agreement was reached on the EU programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) with a proposed budget of &euro;815 million for the period 2014-20 period. EaSI will support Member States efforts in the design and implementation of employment and social reforms by means of policy coordination, identification, analysis and the sharing of best practice.</p><p>  Under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU, we attached great importance to promoting the EU&rsquo;s external trade agenda for the benefit of Irish companies and for the wider EU economy and its exporters. Trade is essential to job creation: 30 million jobs or 10% of the EU workforce depend on exports.  In June, we reached agreement among EU Trade Ministers on the mandate to start talks on an EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Reaching agreement among EU Trade Ministers on the terms of the EU&rsquo;s negotiating mandate has been a top priority for the Irish Presidency. According to assessments made by the EU Commission and other European bodies, a comprehensive Trade and Investment Partnership between the U.S and the EU could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum and help create approximately 400,000 jobs in the EU.  Based on those assessments, if Ireland simply benefitted in proportion to the size of our economy, a comprehensive trade and investment partnership could over time provide gains to Ireland in the order of &euro;800 million per annum in increased GDP, and 4000 new jobs.</p></reply>

The latest available data show that the research intensity rate for 2012 is estimated at 2.11% of GNP (1.71% of GDP). The estimated research intensity rate for 2013 is 2.16% of GNP (1.73% of GDP).  This is encouraging against the backdrop of the economic and fiscal situation and I believe that we are on track to achieve the research intensity target by 2020. Ireland's National Reform Programme update for 2013 submitted by the Government to the European Commission in April reflects this projection.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy has been to put in place a range of initiatives with the overarching aim of accelerating both the economic and societal return on our public investment in Science, Technology and Innovation. A number of initiatives are also in place designed to encourage more private investment in R&amp;amp;D.  Specific initiatives include:</p><p>-  Research Prioritisation which is being implemented on an all of Government basis targeting the majority of competitive public STI investment in the 14 areas which are most likely to deliver economic and societal returns, particularly in the form of jobs &ndash; support is also being targeted at relevant underpinning technologies as well as related infrastructure.</p><p>- An Intellectual Property Protocol is now in place which gives more clarity and certainty around ownership of IP emerging from state funded research &ndash; this will facilitate greater transfer of ideas to market. A key element of this &ndash; establishing a Central Technology Transfer Office &ndash; is in the final stages of completion.</p><p>- The remit of Science Foundation Ireland is being expanded to cover applied research, aligned with the 14 priority areas to further support the development of research findings into commercial opportunities.</p><p>-  In July last year the Government agreed targets for enterprise participation in publicly funded research to drive behaviour of research funders to encourage more collaboration with enterprise.</p><p>-  In late February this year the largest ever state and industry co-funded research investment in Ireland was announced &ndash; SFI&rsquo;s research centres awards includes overall investment of &euro;300million with two thirds coming from the exchequer and one third from industry (cash and in-kind support) involving over 150 industry partners in 7 centres over a 6 year period.</p><p>-  The latest business expenditure figures are very encouraging showing an increase from &euro;1.83bn in 2010 to &euro;1.86bn in 2011 with estimates of a further increase to &euro;2bn for 2012.</p></reply>

This is a very useful piece of independent research on the phenomenon of emigration in Ireland today and outlines some of the positive and negative aspects of emigration amongst young people.  The recommendations in the Report are, however, outside the direct remit of my Department.</p><p>  The Government recognises that there has been an increase in emigration, particularly amongst young people, since the start of the recession.  However, CSO data also indicates that significant numbers of Irish migrants have been returning to the country since 2008.  For example, 20,600 Irish people returned to Ireland in 2012. These are people who had previously emigrated seeking work, and many of them are coming home having gained skills and expertise abroad that we can now capture to strengthen the operation and management of companies based here.	</p><p>  At a macro level, the Government&rsquo;s strategy is to re-build the economy step by step so that we can provide opportunities for sustainable employment in Ireland based on enterprise, exports and innovation.  We are doing this through the Action Plan for Jobs process and have seen a stabilisation in the labour market in recent months, with over 20,000 extra people at work in the first Quarter of 2013 compared to 2012.  </p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs, the Government has a range of initiatives in place to support young people looking for employment.  These include programmes such as JobBridge, Springboard, Momentum and the ICT Action Plan, which are delivered by the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills.  A recent independent evaluation of the JobBridge scheme conducted by Indecon found that 61% of interns progressed to paid employment after completing their internship. </p><p>  My Department is also keen to support young entrepreneurs and, in this context, initiatives such as Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Competitive Start Fund and New Frontiers Programme, along with the Microenterprise Loan Fund, will all contribute to supporting young entrepreneurs.  The Government will also publish a Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship, including youth entrepreneurship, this year.  I have recently set up an Entrepreneurship Forum which will provide a key input in informing the Government&rsquo;s Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship.</p></reply>

In its various forms, crowdfunding allows individuals, businesses and promoters to solicit capital from funders, using social networks and crowdfunding platforms to finance projects. It appears to be affording real opportunities in the area of alternative finance for SMEs.  Use of the mechanism appears to have seen substantial growth globally in the recent past and it is seen by many sponsors as a means of &ldquo;democratising&rdquo; access to funds and supply of capital and moving the model away from venture capitalists and angel investors.</p><p>  However, crowdfunding is in its infancy and financial returns on capital will dictate its overall success. Data is not yet readily available domestically, at EU level or internationally with which to analyse its impact to date, although moves are afoot at EU level to consider methods to address this data deficiency.</p><p>  As the industry needs time to &ldquo;find itself&rdquo; and should not be over burdened by regulation before the required platforms have been given the time to grow and develop, I am keeping the issue under review as to how best to utilise its benefits to promote business development.  It is certainly too early to provide a specific regulatory mechanism for the concept, but my officials will continue to monitor the issue in collaboration with all other key stakeholders in this matter.  As set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, we have committed to investigate the potential for alternative funding mechanisms including peer to peer lending, supply chain finance and crowdfunding.</p><p>  I am also aware that crowdfunding is being discussed seriously within the European institutions and the OECD as an alternative source of SME financing.  Ireland will continue to actively engage with the relevant Institutions in these deliberations and is fully committed to providing an appropriate policy response with regard to the emerging need to establish a European framework and ecosystem for best practices.</p><p>  In view of the early stage of development of this concept, my Department would of course welcome any stakeholder views on how to optimise the potential of this developing phenomenon for securing additional finance for business growth and jobs.</p></reply>

I recently attended this year&rsquo;s International Labour Conference in Geneva and chaired an Informal Ministerial on the subject of Domestic Workers.  Also as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency I ensured the conclusion of a Council Decision which authorises EU Member States to ratify the Convention.  The European Parliament must now consent to the Council Decision and the timeframe for this depends on European Parliament procedures.  However I understand Parliament will decide by November of this year.  If as expected, Parliament consents to the Council Decision, I can move forward with the ratification process.</p><p>  In tandem with this work at EU level, at National level my officials have carried out an assessment of the implications of ratifying the International Labour Organisation&rsquo;s Convention 189 on Domestic Workers.  The Attorney General has also confirmed to me that there are no legal obstacles to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the Domestic Workers Convention.  It is important to note, that domestic workers are protected by virtue of the fact that the full suite of employment rights legislation, including that of redress for violations of their employment rights, apply to domestic workers in the same way as they apply to other categories of employees in Ireland. Also it is worth pointing out that NERA has carried out a programme of inspections involving Domestic Workers as well as continuing to respond to any complaints it receives from Domestic Workers.</p><p>  A voluntary Code of Practice for Persons Employed in Other People&rsquo;s Homes was developed under the Industrial Relations Act 1990. The Code sets out certain employment rights and practices for persons employed in other people&rsquo;s homes and encourages good practice and compliance with the law in such employment situations. In any proceedings before a court, or a workplace relations dispute resolution body, a code of practice shall be admissible in evidence and any provision of the code which appears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings shall be taken into account in determining that question.</p></reply>

The annual value of potential demand from SMEs is very difficult to assess.  This makes the setting of an upper limit of annual lending capacity which ought to be made available via Schemes difficult to set precisely. From the outset, I have emphasised that the figures used are estimated and that the exact requirements could be lower or higher depending on SME credit demand needs and economic conditions over the duration of the Schemes.  The figures quoted are most definitely not targets for the Schemes and there will be no specific targets set for the schemes for the coming year as they will remain demand led schemes. </p><p>  The Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) can facilitate up to &euro;150m of additional lending per annum.  When the Scheme was launched in October 2012, I made a commitment to review the Scheme after 12 months of operation.  However, due to the low level of utilisation of the Scheme, I have brought forward the review process to examine ways to improve future performance and take-up. An external consultant will be selected very shortly to commence the formal review of the Scheme which I intend will be concluded by end quarter 3 2013.  Any changes to legislation arising from the review will take place after that date.</p><p>  In relation to MFI and based on the existing business model, Microfinance Ireland (MFI) can support up to &euro;8.8m of lending to microenterprises per annum.  The key challenge for MFI is to ensure that people are aware that there is support for new and existing viable micro enterprises with perceived or real higher trading risk that have been refused credit by banks. In that regard MFI has been engaged with key influencers across the country to get that message across.  There will be on-going promotional and awareness activities to ensure that awareness of the scheme is promoted to its full potential amongst relevant micro business groups across all sectors of business.</p></reply>

It is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach.  That Department also services the meetings and publishes the minutes of these meetings on its website.   </p><p>  The Secretary General of my Department and senior representatives of the IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland &ndash; both of whom have a role in promoting the sector in the international arena - are among the public sector representatives on the Group.  Their key objective is to ensure our industrial promotional policies and activities assist in maximising the employment creation potential of this growing international sector.  </p><p>  Given its critical role and the dynamic environment in which this sector operates, the Department of the Taoiseach recently invited a small public/private sector team to discussions about the workings of the Clearing House Group and to examine how best to maximise the potential of the sector.  The Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of IDA Ireland are among the public sector members of this team, which I understand is to have its first meeting shortly.  </p><p>  With some 33,000 jobs, the international financial services sector is already a significant employer in Ireland.  The 5 year Strategy for the sector launched by the Taoiseach in 2011, targeted an increase of 10,000 jobs in IFSC companies by 2016. The Action Plan for Jobs 2013 reaffirms Government&rsquo;s commitment to this objective. Good progress has been made already with more than 65 new investments over the period January 2011 to date in 2013 with associated employment potential (gross jobs) of approximately 6,000.</p><p>  These investments are significant achievements in view of the global crisis that has impacted the industry over the last two years and highlight Ireland&rsquo;s on-going attractiveness for investment and the Government&rsquo;s on-going commitment to the development of the sector.</p></reply>

A key part of the Government&rsquo;s plans for jobs and growth is ensuring that we deliver a truly world-class service for this sector. The purpose of restructuring the current model for the delivery of State supports to that sector is to rejuvenate and enhance the national model so as to ensure that the micro and small business sector is properly positioned to be a lead player in relation to job creation and to the economic recovery process.</p><p>  The new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) will draw and build on the successful County Enterprise Board (CEB) model which has supported over 33,000 jobs across the country since 1993, as well as 900 new projects per annum and almost 25,000 training participants per annum. The enhanced model is designed to harness the best elements of the enterprise agencies and local government and to support local business and contribute to local development. For the first time, the skills, experience and resources of Enterprise Ireland, the CEBs and the Local Authorities will be combined in a structured and coherent manner to benefit micro and small businesses. The LEOs will be the first-stop-shop through which all information on State supports for small and micro businesses can be accessed and where businesses with clear high growth potential can be fast-tracked to the next level of support from EI.</p><p>  As part of the reform process, the CEBs will be dissolved and their functions, assets and liabilities transferred to Enterprise Ireland to be delivered by the LEO in each Local Authority area under a robust Service Level Agreement (SLA) between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities. The SLA will set out robust Performance Indicators measuring employment, start-ups and other metrics.  A key element of new structure will be the consistent application of policy across all LEOs from the evaluation of applications to the spending of budgets allocated. This will be monitored using the agreed SLA in each Local Authority. The on-going drawdown of budgets by LEOs will be contingent on them reaching agreed targets. </p><p>  Minister Perry and I have consulted widely in the context of this proposed reform and we view the restructuring of the supports as an important opportunity to get a combined effort in behind start-ups and small business and we shall vigorously work to harness the potential of the new model.</p></reply>

Examples of <i>InterTradeIreland's</i> programmes that are having a significant impact are: <b><i>Acumen</i></b>, which is designed to stimulate cross-border business for small and medium enterprises in Ireland and Northern Ireland; <b><i>Fusion</i></b><b>,</b> InterTradeIreland's flagship three-way partnership technology transfer programme; <b><i>Go-2-Tender</i></b>, which provides businesses with the confidence, knowledge and skills to tender successfully for public sector contracts; and <b><i>Innova</i></b>  , a unique cross-border collaborative Research &amp;amp; Development programme offering companies an opportunity to accelerate new product, process or service developments through partnering with a company in the other jurisdiction.  </p><p><i>  InterTradeIreland</i> have adapted their offering in recent years, as a result of economic circumstances, to meet the specific needs of SME's, North and South. Their key programmes are now focused on promoting trade and innovation activities among SME's which it is hoped will lead to an increase in the number of firms engaging in cross-border business and exporting to the other jurisdiction, and taking innovative steps to trading themselves out of difficult operating environments.  This approach has proved very successful.  For example, in 2012, there were 92 First Time Innovators firms (against a target of 35) and 67 First Time Exporters firms (against a target of 50) as a direct result of these firms participating in <i>InterTradeIreland's </i>programmes  .</p><p><i>InterTradeIreland</i> is co-funded by my Department and its counterpart in Northern Ireland, and I am glad to say that we have managed to avoid curtailing <i>InterTradeIreland's</i>   budget in recent years despite ongoing economic pressures. I believe that the Body's unique all-island offering to SME's provides specifically tailored support for SME's that want to engage in cross-border trade. </p><p>  In addition to the work of <i>InterTradeIreland</i>, Enterprise Ireland works closely with its counterpart organisation, <i>Invest Northern Ireland, </i>on a range of initiatives to benefit enterprise development in the border region. These include activities such as <i>Bridging the Border</i> Seminars/partnering events, which are designed to promote joint opportunities between firms, North and South, in areas such as licensing and commercial agreements, sub-contracting, technical co-operation and business partnerships. These are practical measures that can help address barriers to firms looking to trade in the other jurisdiction.</p><p>  Another useful tool in assisting businesses in border areas is the Interreg Programme. My Department has co-funded some 28 enterprise projects, to a value of &euro;58m, under this EU Programme with the N.I. Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment over the last number of years. This funding has assisted local micro projects in the border region to get up and running, through the provision of mostly training and capacity-building. It is hoped that the next strand of the Interreg Programme will see projects being approved that have a more economic development focus. </p><p>  Increasing cross-border trade and the development of the economy in the border region will continue to be a key priority. My Department will continue to work with the enterprise agencies, including <i>InterTradeIreland</i>, on developing appropriate supports that encourage cross-border trade.</p></reply>

It is estimated that data collected and generated by companies and governments is growing by approximately 40% per year. An independent study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research ( Cebr) recently identified the potential demand by businesses in Ireland for a total of 6,000 new deeply data analytics roles by 2018. </p><p>  In that context, the Government has agreed two specific deliverables in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 which are associated with the Industry-Government Taskforce:</p><p>  - To oversee a mapping of existing and planned initiatives across Government and the private sector that can contribute to Ireland's reputation as a leader in the areas of Big Data and data analytics (Q3 2013);</p><p>  - To identify and commence at least two new pilot initiatives whereby data analytics will be employed to address specific challenges delivering economic impact and/or improved public services (Q3 2013).</p><p>  These actions are complemented by nine other actions for delivery in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs relating to areas such as R&amp;amp;D investment for data analytics, investment in high performance computing, initiatives around education and skills for data analytics, standards development and Open Government.  On 1 May 2013, the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and I met with the six Government-appointed industry partners to discuss the mechanisms for taking forward the Big Data disruptive reforms.  At this meeting, it was agreed that:</p><p>  - an Assistant Secretary General in my Department would lead the public sector engagement on the Big Data disruptive reform;</p><p>  - Mr Liam Casey, Ms Heather Reynolds and Mr John Herlihy would assist as industry partners in helping to deliver the Big Data disruptive reform.</p><p>  To progress the initiative, it was agreed to form an <i>ad hoc</i> working party as a precursor to the establishment of the formal Industry-Government Taskforce on Big Data and Data Analytics. The working party, which will be chaired by my Department, will comprise representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Health, Forf&aacute;s, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, NSAI and the three industry partners (or nominees).  In line with the commitment in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, an immediate next step is to transition from the ad hoc working party mechanism to the more formal Industry-Government Taskforce on Big Data and Data Analytics.</p><p>  Membership of the Taskforce is based around a core group with the flexibility to co-opt additional members from the public and private sector to reflect specific areas of focus and sectoral expertise.  The core group consists of the Assistant Secretary General of my Department with: </p><p>  - The Government Chief Information Officer from Department of Public Enterprise and Reform.</p><p>  - Senior officials nominated by Central Statistics Office, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, National Standards Authority of Ireland.</p><p>  - Government appointed Industry Partners or nominees.</p><p>  It is envisaged that the full membership of the Taskforce will be announced in the coming weeks, coinciding with the first formal meeting of the Taskforce in July.</p></reply>

Foreign owned firms contribute substantially to Ireland's exports, jobs, expenditure in the Irish economy and to Exchequer funds. FDI plays a key role in stimulating the development of new sectors in Ireland, in enhancing our research, development and innovation performance, in contributing to balanced regional development and in accelerating the achievement of critical mass within sectors.</p><p>  Ireland has earned a strong reputation for being able to compete globally for FDI. The IBM Global Location Trends Report 2012 ranks Ireland as a top location in world for Inward Investment. Ireland is listed:</p><p>  - First in the world for inward investment by quality and value.</p><p>  - First in Europe for jobs created in Research and Development.</p><p>  - First in Europe for investment in the Pharmaceutical sector.</p><p>  - Second in Europe and fourth globally for the number of investment jobs per capita.</p><p>  Ireland's favourable tax regime and financial support systems for research and development underline the Government's determination to continually enhance the country's attractiveness to overseas companies. The Government acknowledges that ambitious national job creation targets can only be achieved with the active co-operation of a highly skilled workforce allied to world class research, development and innovation (RD&amp;amp;I) facilities. Today, Ireland's advanced manufacturing technologies deliver continuous innovation and sustainable success in high-value manufacturing. </p><p>  IDA Ireland has indicated that there are a number of factors which are considered by potential investors before deciding to locate here. These include: </p><p>  - A pro-business and technologically advanced environment.</p><p>  - An attractive corporate tax rate.</p><p>  - An educated and talented workforce. </p><p>  - A blend of appropriate skill sets. </p><p>  - Access to world class infrastructure - road access to key cities, ports and international airports. </p><p>  - A range of affordable, state-of-the-art property solutions</p><p>  - A track record of success coupled with the right attitude and ambition of its people.</p><p>  In seeking to win FDI, IDA constantly promotes the availability of these factors to potential investors.</p><p>  Amid significant economic challenges globally and locally, IDA Ireland achieved a strong FDI performance in 2012. There were 145 individual investments, with over 40% from companies coming to Ireland for the first time. 12,722 gross job gains were generated with 6,570 net new jobs gains across a broad range of sectors.  Helping FDI clients to transform their operations within Ireland has also led to a significant reduction in employment losses, producing a strong year overall.  Despite this success, Ireland faces a highly competitive landscape, with notable strong competition for FDI arising from the UK, the Netherlands and Switzerland, in particular. Key global markets are slowing down, particularly in Europe, which is a key focus for IDA's existing and potential clients. </p><p>  IDA Ireland has assured me, however, that there are definite opportunities for growth in the IT/technology sector, in specific areas of financial services, in life sciences, in social/digital media and in sectors where consolidation is taking place on a pan-European basis. The IDA's global team is determined to pursue these opportunities vigorously in 2013 in order to ensure that another 132 new investment projects, which will yield another 6,000 net new jobs, are won in accordance with the Government's Action Plan for Jobs 2013.</p></reply>

The Authority is also the national Competent Authority for REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) and other chemicals legislation.  It operates under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and the Chemicals Acts 2008-2010.  The aim of the Authority is to make occupational safety, health and welfare an integral part of doing business in every Irish workplace and to ensure that the manufacture and use of chemicals in Ireland do not affect human health or the environment.</p><p>  One of the ways the Authority attempts to achieve its aim is through the implementation of its national programme of workplace inspections. Details of the Authority's national inspection programmes are outlined in its annual Programmes of Work, which are submitted to me as Minister for approval and published on the Authority's website ().  The Authority carried out 13,835 workplace inspections in 2012 and aims to carry out 12,850 such inspections in 2013. Further details on the Authority's 2012 inspection programme, including information on the numbers of inspections (including investigations) undertaken in different sectors of the economy are available in its 2012 Annual Report, which is available to download at .

This is a key step in delivering the National Broadband Plan which commits to broadband speeds of 30Mbps and, where possible, higher speeds to all parts of Ireland through a combination of public and private investment.</p><p>  The mapping exercise will help identify where broadband services are already in place or planned by service providers in the coming three years.  It will identify the gaps in provision that need to be filled with state-supported investment.  It will look at broadband availability in each locality and therefore will encompass all broadband users, both households and businesses.  My Department is supportive of this initiative and looks forward to the outcomes of the exercise, particularly in the context of the availability of broadband for businesses. </p><p>  My Department is also working closely with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in relation to an initiative in the Action Plan for Jobs to increase the number of businesses trading on-line.  The objective of this initiative is to achieve a step-change in the number of businesses, and particularly small businesses, trading on-line for the first time.  It will provide a voucher of up to &euro;2,500 to companies to support them in commencing to trade on-line.  My officials are working with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on finalising the arrangements for the scheme which will be run on a pilot basis in 2013 prior to a wider roll-out in 2014.</p></reply>

In this context, the Labour Court appointed Ms Janet Hughes to undertake the review of the 10 existing JLCs on its behalf. The Review was completed on 12 April last.  </p><p>  The review assisted the Labour Court&rsquo;s  deliberations as to whether any JLC should be abolished, maintained in its current form, amalgamated with another JLC or its establishment order amended and the Labour Court is required to make recommendations to me to this effect.  The Labour Court submitted its report of the review and recommendations in relation to the 10 existing JLCs to me on 22 April last. The report is detailed, comprehensive and complex and required careful examination and consideration. </p><p>  Since its receipt, the Supreme Court, on 9 May last, issued its decision in relation to the constitutionality of Registered Employment Agreements (McGowan and others v The Labour Court, Ireland and the Attorney General). I was concerned that this decision may have had implications for Joint Labour Committees and Employment Regulation Orders. With that in mind, I sought legal advice on this point, which I am currently considering.  It is my intention to publish both the Report and my proposals in the very near future.</p></reply>

For 2013 to date 4% of this capacity has been utilised with 49 loans facilitated, valued at &euro;6.4 million.  I intend to publish the 2nd quarter Progress Report on the Scheme on the Department's website shortly.<font color="#FF0000">  </font>I expect this to show slow but real progress in comparison with the published Progress Report for 2012, where there were six live guaranteed facilities resulting in &euro;582,000 being approved through the scheme.</p><p>  From the outset, I have emphasised that the potential utilisation figures used are estimated and that the exact requirements of the Scheme would be demand led.  Utilisation could be lower or higher depending on SME credit demand needs and to date this has been lower than expected.  I would like to repeat today that the figure of &euro;150 million is the maximum lending capacity. It is not a target for the Scheme.</p><p>  When the Scheme was launched in October 2012, I made a commitment to review the Scheme after 12 months of operation.  However, due to the low level of utilisation of the Scheme, I have brought forward the review process to examine ways to improve future performance and take-up. An external consultant will be selected very shortly to commence the formal review of the Scheme which I hope will be completed by end Quarter 3.  Any changes to legislation arising from the review will take place after that date.</p></reply>

Insofar as prices in this jurisdiction are concerned, the European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 639 of 2002) require traders to indicate the selling price in Euros of products offered for sale. The Regulations, which are enforced by the National Consumer Agency (NCA), do not prevent traders from indicating the price of those goods in other currencies such as Sterling, so long as the Euro price is indicated.</p><p>  I am aware that some goods in addition to carrying the mandatory Euro price also carry a Sterling Price indication. I also am aware of concerns that have been raised in the past in relation to differentials as and between the sterling and euro prices for certain dual priced goods. Where there is a significant difference between the euro price and the sterling price for a good, it is primarily a matter for the trader concerned to explain to his/her customers why he/she is imposing such different prices. I would encourage any consumer who is concerned in relation to the differential between the euro and sterling prices for goods in particular retail outlets to demand an explanation from the retailers concerned as to the reasons for such differentials. If consumers are unhappy in relation to the differential in prices or the explanation for such differentials, they may wish to seek better value elsewhere.</p><p>  In this regard the National Consumer Agency, as part of its statutory mandate, conducts regular price comparison surveys to provide consumers with information as to the different price offerings that are available in the marketplace. Evidence available to the Agency shows that consumers have become much more discerning in relation to their shopping habits, are actively seeking better value for money and that price is becoming a pre-eminent determinant in relation to where they do their shopping. Consumers can and are demonstrating their willingness to positively seek out value and are not prepared to give their custom to traders, who they do not believe offer value for money.</p><p>  As regards general price comparisons between this country and the UK, the most recent Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is the accepted measure for comparing price inflation across the EU, found that prices in Ireland had risen by 0.5% in the 12 months to April 2013, whereas prices in the UK had risen by 2.4% in the same period. It is clear, therefore, that we are becoming more competitive price wise in comparison with the UK. This improvement in our competitiveness is most welcome, not least by consumers, and follows on from the specific measures taken by the Government to restore national competitiveness. The Government is fully committed to pursuing the competitiveness agenda, so as to ensure that Irish consumers receive and can expect to receive a fair deal in the goods and services that they buy. </p></reply>

As stated in the Good Friday Agreement, the tragedies of the past have left a deep and profoundly regrettable legacy of suffering.  We must never forget those who have died or been injured, and their families.  In the context of the &ldquo;Together: Building a United Community&rdquo; initiative by the Northern Ireland Executive, the Northern Ireland Assembly will shortly establish an All Party Working Group under an Independent Chair to consider and make recommendations on issues that cause community divisions, including Dealing with the Past.</p><p>  The HET has an important role to play in ensuring that the families of all of the victims of violence in the past can pursue the truth of what happened to their loved ones, and it plays a significant part in the pursuit of justice.  I am aware of the comprehensive Inspection Report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary into the PSNI&rsquo;s Historical Enquiries Team.  I believe it is essential that the HET operate to the highest standards of effectiveness and impartiality, so that the people of Northern Ireland &ndash; and in particular, the families of the victims whose cases are being reviewed &ndash; can have confidence in it.  Consequently I welcome Chief Constable Baggott&rsquo;s acceptance of the Inspection Report&rsquo;s Recommendations and his commitment to work with the Policing Board on ensuring their delivery.</p><p>  I am glad to inform the Deputy that there is close and ongoing co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI on all aspects of policing.  The two police forces have in place a joint Cross Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island.  The Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI who have responsibility for operational policing co-operation have repeatedly emphasised that the close and high quality co-operation between their forces has been instrumental in preventing attacks, combating criminality and saving lives. </p></reply>

The Government follows closely reports of human rights violations against Falun Gong practitioners, including reported cases of organ harvesting, and is concerned about the situation.  Human rights issues, including the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners, are issues discussed regularly with the Chinese authorities during both bilateral and multilateral meetings.</p><p>  Through the formal framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which was established in 1995, the EU continues to share with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion, and to urge China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation.  The latest session of this dialogue took place on 25 June 2013 and provided the EU with the opportunity to express its concerns about a wide range of human rights issues in China, including the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, deprivation of liberty, and criminal and administrative punishment.  At this meeting, the EU also enquired about measures taken so far by China to ratify the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights, signed in 1998 in view of China&rsquo;s undertaking made during the 2009 Universal Periodic Review (UPR) to ratify the Covenant at an early date. </p><p>  In February 2013, officials from my Department met with representatives of the Irish Falun Dafa Association.  During this meeting the Irish Falun Dafa Association discussed the issue of organ harvesting and ways in which human rights issues are raised with Chinese authorities by both Ireland and the EU.  Officials in my Department are meeting again this week with the Falun Dafa Association regarding the issue of organ harvesting.</p><p>  In relation to measures taken to ensure no Irish company, organisation or individual becomes involved in the mistreatment of Falun Gong practitioners, a Common Position adopted by the European Council in 2008 outlines that Member States shall deny an export licence if there is a clear risk that military technology or equipment to be exported might be used for internal repression.  Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to address human rights issues with China, including those related to the Falun Gong, in frequent and regular dialogue, through our contacts in both Dublin and Beijing and through the relevant multilateral channels, including at the next United Nations Universal Periodic Review of human rights in China, scheduled for October 2013.</p></reply>

The range of interests expressed by Irish companies in Africa varies from agribusiness to financial services and telecommunications.  The majority of companies are interested in initially trading and investing in the more mature South African market, often using South Africa as a basis to penetrate other markets in the region.  In November 2012, I led an Enterprise Ireland trade mission involving 35 Irish companies to South Africa to further strengthen Irish private sector links with the southern Africa region. </p><p>  Last year I also led a trade focused visit to Nigeria and Ghana, which involved senior representatives from Enterprise Ireland and An Bord Bia. This has resulted in a significant increase in the level of interest by Irish companies in West Africa.  During July, visits are taking place by officials from my Department, Enterprise Ireland and An Bord Bia to Nigeria to prepare for a trade mission, which will involve a number of Irish companies, scheduled for November 2013.  Irish companies are also involved in pursuing additional business opportunities across African markets without necessarily linking directly with my Department or with state agencies.</p><p>  The Africa Strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade launched in 2011, outlines a new relationship with Africa which not only includes development aid but also seeks deeper political and economic relations. This approach has been warmly welcomed by all of our partner countries in Africa and has created a framework for closer relations with the Irish private sector that is already engaged across the continent. </p></reply>

All deposit-taking credit institutions in Ireland are required by law to participate in the Deposit Guarantee Scheme. The scheme currently covers all 395 credit unions in Ireland and 37 banks and building societies. Further information can be found on the Central Bank of Ireland's website at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>.  The Deposit Guarantee Scheme is funded by a charge on the credit institutions participating in the scheme. The cost of compensation payments is met from the balances in the Deposit Protection Account.  In the event of the Deposit Protection Account being insufficient to fund a compensation event, any difference is made up using advances from the Central Bank or the State; the remaining participating institutions are then responsible for the repayment of these advances.</p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland (&#8220;the Bank&#8221;) is responsible for the operation of the Deposit Protection (Guarantee) Scheme - DGS. I am advised by the Bank that it currently holds data on total deposits held by financial institutions.  The Bank has explained that while it holds data relating to total deposits, not all of the deposits are covered by the DGS scheme (e.g. only amounts up to &euro;100,000 are currently covered and there are various exclusions from coverage, such as large companies and inter-bank deposits).  </p><p>  The Bank advises me that it is currently working with Credit Institutions in order to receive data on actual coverage under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme.  Formal powers to request this data are in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011.  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 has passed all stages in the Oireachtas and is currently with the President for signature.  I anticipate that the bill will be signed by the President in the coming days and following this the Central Bank will make the necessary arrangements to ensure that such information is fully accessible to it where required.</p></reply>

It is important to note that at the time the products were offered to customers there was no additional guarantee provided by the State in respect of those products.  It was always the case that the ELG scheme covered only those liabilities which were entered into during the issuance window. In relation to the DGS Scheme, I am advised that the DGS Regulations explicitly specify which deposits are excluded from coverage under that Scheme. Deposits held by pension funds and retirement funds fall within the category of excluded deposits, though small self-administered pension schemes are included. The decision to include SSAPs and exclude ARFs, AMRFs and other pension funds/instruments was based on the fact that SSAPs are usually small schemes administered by the member(s) of the scheme whilst ARFs are managed by a qualified fund manager through a credit or investment institution.</p><p>  There are currently no plans to alter the terms of the Deposit Guarantee Scheme.

Information of this type is not available for 2014.</p><p>I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the figure for total USC provided in the table is a projected estimate of the total USC liability in respect of the tax year 2013 and is not intended to correspond to the cash receipts expected to be collected in the corresponding calendar year. Figures of cash receipts are subject to timing arrangements and can also be distorted by cash flow adjustments.  The figures are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model using actual data for the year 2010, adjusted as necessary for estimated income and employment trends in the interim. These are, therefore, provisional and likely to be revised.</p><p>As far as is practicable income ranges are in brackets of &euro; 5,000 up to &euro;100,000, thereafter the range bands expand over wider brackets in the higher income ranges.  Moreover, because of the Revenue Commissioners' obligation to observe confidentiality in relation to the taxation affairs of individual taxpayers and small groups of taxpayers, the breakdown by income bands requested by the Deputy is not provided in relation to incomes exceeding &euro;2 million due to the small numbers of income earners with incomes in excess of that level.

Information of this type is not available for 2014.</p><p>I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the figure for total PAYE provided in the table is a projected estimate of the total PAYE liability in respect of the tax year 2013 and is not intended to correspond to the cash receipts expected to be collected in the corresponding calendar year. Figures of cash receipts are subject to timing arrangements and can also be distorted by cash flow adjustments.  The figures are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model using actual data for the year 2010, adjusted as necessary for estimated income and employment trends in the interim. These are, therefore, provisional and likely to be revised.</p><p>As far as is practicable income ranges are in brackets of &euro; 5,000 up to &euro;100,000, thereafter the range bands expand over wider brackets in the higher income ranges.  Moreover, because of the Revenue Commissioners' obligation to observe confidentiality in relation to the taxation affairs of individual taxpayers and small groups of taxpayers, the breakdown by income bands requested by the Deputy is not provided in relation to incomes exceeding &euro;2 million due to the small numbers of income earners with incomes in excess of that level.</p><p>It should be noted that Gross Income is as defined in the Revenue Statistical Report 2011.  A married couple which has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.  Corresponding information by reference to age or gender is not available.</p><p>In relation to income distribution by gender, the deputy may wish to note that historical details on the incomes of different marital status groups for the income tax year 2010 are provided in Tables IDS 1 to 17 of the <i>income distribution chapter</i> of the Revenue statistical report for 2011, which is available on the Revenue website at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.

These are Disposal of Principal Private Residence, Retirement relief - within the Family, Retirement Relief - outside the Family, Disposal of a site to a child and Other Reliefs (to be specified).  Claimants for the Personal Exemption are also identified.                                                                           </p><p>  In the case of the Personal Exemption it is tentatively estimated that the Exchequer cost in terms of tax forgone in respect of claimants who filed a Form 11 tax return for 2011 was in the region of &euro;4 million.  Claims for the other identified reliefs require the entry to the tax return of the consideration value and not the actual capital gain. There is therefore no basis on which a nominal gain could be identified and on which an estimate of Exchequer cost of the tax relief could be calculated. </p><p>  It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return (Form 12) is not captured in the Revenue computer system. However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than &euro;3,174 is required to complete an income tax return (Form 11).</p></reply>

These figures are estimates in terms of 2013 expected yields.  Corresponding estimates for 2014 are not yet available.</p><p><table><tr><th>VAT rate</th><th>Estimated cost/yield from 1% change</th></tr><tr><td>9%</td><td>+/- &euro;125m</td></tr><tr><td>13.5%</td><td>+/- &euro;230m</td></tr><tr><td>23%</td><td>+/- &euro;250m</td></tr></table></p><p>A pro-rata calculation may be applied to these figures to arrive at the impacts of greater or lesser increases or decreases to the respective rates.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that Irish VAT law is governed by the EU VAT Directive, and any changes made to the VAT rates must be guided by EU VAT law.  In this context, where the zero rate of VAT is increased, children&rsquo;s shoes and clothes could only be increased to the standard rate (23%) while other goods at the zero rate could be increased to a reduced rate of 5% or more, provided only two reduced VAT rates are in operation.  As such, there are no figures provided for a 1% increase on the zero rate.  In addition, most items applying currently at the 13.5% cannot be reduced below 12%.</p><p>As stated earlier, the costings in the table relation to the 9% VAT rate relates to 2013 figures.  From 2014 all goods and services applying at this rate are scheduled to revert to 13.5%, and so any change that would result in a rate lower than 13.5% on this activity would result in a cost to the Exchequer. However, costings in relation to the items currently at the 9% rate for 2014 are not yet available.  Any decision on a deviation from this policy will be taken in the context of Budget 2014.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the specific information requested by the Deputy cannot be provided.

One aspect of this Agreement relates to supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and as both Unions that represent SNAs namely, SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to the Haddington Road Agreement, the Department has now implemented supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2013/2014 school year.  The detailed arrangements are set out in Departmental Circular 0037/2013 which issued on 1 July 2013, a copy of which has been forwarded to the Deputy.</p><p>  The first part of the LRC proposals for supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs outlines that the supplementary assignment arrangements only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant.  Accordingly, with effect from 1 May 2013 once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service is notified by his/her employer that he/she is to be made redundant then he/she shall be deemed to be a member of a Supplementary Assignment Panel for SNAs.  </p><p>  SNAs who were made redundant prior to 1 May 2013 are free to apply for SNA positions.  However, the revised rules on SNA recruitment are as set out in Departmental Circular 37/2013, the purpose of which is to facilitate those SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant in filling SNA vacancies which become available in other schools / ETBs.  Accordingly, those SNAs who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel are afforded preferential treatment in the filling of SNA vacancies.  As the LRC proposals are part of a wider public-sector pay agreement that represent compromises by both employers and unions, I do not have the ability to alter the terms of that agreement.</p></reply>

The main conditions of the scheme are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold inter alia EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.  The Deputy will appreciate that as the rules of the scheme are of general application that it is not possible to make an exception in any individual case.  It should also be noted that Higher education institutions are autonomous bodies and the criteria governing the level of tuition fees to be charged (EU or Non EU rate), in cases where undergraduate students do not qualify for free fees is a matter for the institutions to determine in accordance with their own criteria.  Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners on www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

All recognised schools are legally owned by the school patrons or trustees and managed by a school's Board of Management which is also the employer of teachers in a school.  While the Minister for Education and Skills provides funding and policy direction for schools, neither I nor officials of my Department have powers to investigate individual complaints, except where the complaint involves a refused enrolment, expulsion or suspension, in accordance with Section 29 of the 1998 Education Act.</p><p>  If a parent wishes to make a complaint against a teacher or school they should contact the relevant school authorities.  The complaint procedures adopted by most schools are those that have been agreed between the teacher unions and school management bodies.  If a parent has a complaint about a teacher or about the school, the first step is to speak to the class teacher, if the complaint is not resolved, the parent should then speak to the school principal.  If the complaint is not resolved at this stage the parent can lodge the complaint in writing with the chairperson of the school's Board of Management/Single Manager/VEC.</p><p>  If the parent has exhausted the school's complaints procedure and the complaint has not been resolved, the parent can make an appeal to the Ombudsman for Children.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures.  The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the action of the School has had a negative affect on a child.  Further guidance to parents on progressing a concern in relation their child's school is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</p></reply>

One aspect of this Agreement relates to supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and as both Unions that represent SNAs namely, SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to the Haddington Road Agreement, the Department has now implemented supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2013/2014 school year.  The detailed arrangements are set out in Departmental Circular 0037/2013 which issued on 1 July 2013, a copy of which has been forwarded to the Deputy.</p><p>  The first part of the LRC proposals for supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs outlines that the supplementary assignment arrangements only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant.  Accordingly, with effect from 1 May 2013 once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service is notified by his/her employer that he/she is to be made redundant then he/she shall be deemed to be a member of a Supplementary Assignment Panel for SNAs.  SNAs who were made redundant prior to 1 May 2013 are free to apply for SNA positions however, the revised rules on SNA recruitment are as set out in Departmental Circular 37/2013, the purpose of which is to facilitate those SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant in filling SNA vacancies which become available in other schools / ETBs.  Accordingly, those SNAs who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel are afforded preferential treatment in the filling of SNA vacancies.  As the LRC proposals are part of a wider public-sector pay agreement that represent compromises by both employers and unions, I do not have the ability to alter the terms of that agreement.</p></reply>

Where a NEPS psychologist is not assigned to a school, authorities therein may access psychological assessments through SCPA.  Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p><p>  It should be noted that in common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for a pupil's initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention.  Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.  In relation to assessment for special needs resourcing, I might add that NEPS psychologists would normally only have input into the process in relation to pupils with General Learning Difficulties (GLD) and Emotional Disturbance/ Behavioural Disorders (EDBD) with other types of special needs, such as for example, Autism are referred to clinicians for diagnosis.  It is the responsibility of the school Principal in the first instance to identify and prioritise pupils for assessment under the process described above and advise that the school in question may raise individual pupils with the NEPS service if they have concerns in this regard.</p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy also that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including the allocation of resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools.  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  The responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational resources to be allocated to pupils with special educational needs resides with the NCSE through the SENO.</p><p>  Assessment reports carried out by relevant professionals are provided by schools to the SENOs as part of the application process for support.  The consideration of these reports is an integral part of determining the extent of supports to be provided for pupils with special educational needs.  Whereas health reports provide valuable assistance to education providers in identifying a diagnosis or identifying appropriate interventions, health staff are asked not to include references to the specific quantum of educational resources in their reports, but should state the outcome of tests carried out and the range of needs of the child as clearly as possible.  The NCSE circular 03/08 clarifies the respective roles and functions of the NCSE and the HSE and their respective personnel in carrying out assessments and sanctioning resources to support children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability.  Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided.  The allocation of home based provision to siblings for July Provision is reflective of the school grouping principle.  This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary.  Accordingly it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home.</p><p>  The school grouping principle does not purport to replicate or mirror all aspects of school based provision.  The age or ability of siblings is reflected in their education level as determined by education and health professionals. In general where a child is receiving their education in a class setting with other children of mixed age and ability, this should carry through to their July Provision.  However in recognition of the differing needs of some siblings, including the sisters referred to by the Deputy, separate allocations can be considered on a case by case basis.  Applications in this regard will require supporting documentation including professional reports from a psychologist or a letter from the principal of the school detailing the existing arrangements currently in place for the respective children and providing reasons why they cannot be tutored together in the home. No appeal has been made in respect of the allocation for the pupils in question.</p></reply>

Pupils with Down Syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability.</p><p>  I wish to explain also that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down Syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools.</p><p>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.  The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild General Learning Disability (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD.  The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for children with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild GLD range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down Syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process.</p><p>  In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.</p></reply>

My Department and its agencies are focused on the development and support of internationally trading manufacturing and services firms in Ireland, and have a clear and steady focus on the potential and opportunities that exist and can be created by prioritising innovation and science as a key driver of success. Enterprise development agencies, Enterprise Ireland (EI), IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, provide a spectrum of innovation and science/technology development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support to help companies become more innovative, encourage and support competitiveness, and help them grow their sales and exports in order to create a climate in which sustainable employment will grow and expand.</p><p>  The importance of innovation to Ireland has been well recognised by the Government as being crucial to growth in both our indigenous and FDI sectors. It was most encouraging to see that the recent European Commission&rsquo;s Innovation Union Scoreboard, published in spring 2013, shows Ireland retaining its position among those EU Member States with above average performance in their research and innovation systems. In addition, improvements have taken place in Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness, reflected in the fact that, in 2013, Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness ranking improved three places from 20th in 2011, to 17th in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook for 2013 published in May. Ireland is 6th out of the 25 EU countries featured. In addition IBM&rsquo;s Global Location Trends Report of 2012 places Ireland:</p><p>- 1st in the world for inward investment by quality and value;</p><p>- 1st in Europe for jobs created in Research and Development;</p><p>- 1st in Europe for investment in the pharmaceutical sector; and,</p><p>- 2nd is Europe and 4th globally for the number of investment jobs per capita.</p><p>These indicators correspond well with the stated ambition of our Taoiseach to make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business by 2016. </p></reply>

In executing its mandate, IDA Ireland engages with corporate entities, as the primary decision makers around FDI investment.  IDA Ireland markets Ireland as a location for FDI on the basis of a number of selling points, including an attractive corporate tax rate.  IDA Ireland recently undertook a media road-show in New York to counter claims that Ireland is a tax haven and to explain how the Irish corporate tax system operates. The media road-show involved a prime time speaking opportunity on CNBC, the most watched business news network in the United States. The resulting interview was subsequently re-cycled through various social media channels. The Chief Executive of IDA, Mr Barry O&rsquo;Leary, also held briefings with correspondents from influential outlets including the New York Times and Bloomberg on the issue of Corporate Tax and FDI.  IDA Ireland has indicated that it continues to seek opportunities to relay Ireland&rsquo;s message on corporate tax to key media.</p><p>  Over 152,000 people are employed directly by 1,000 IDA client companies in Ireland. IDA Ireland has established strong and credible links with its client companies through direct meetings which are supported by overseas missions led by the Taoiseach and Ministers. These meetings provide IDA with the opportunity to reassure its clients about Ireland&rsquo;s continued commitment to the 12.5% Corporation Tax rate and the actions taken by the Irish Government in the context of work undertaken by the OECD with regard to Base Erosion and Profit Shifting work and the progress made during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of EU to address failings in the international tax system.  In regard to the latter, considerable progress was made:</p><p>- Throughout the course of the Irish Presidency, Ireland prioritised files that will deliver on &ldquo;Stability, Jobs and Growth&rdquo; and outlined how an open, transparent and fair international taxation system is an essential prerequisite to this goal;</p><p>- In May, Ireland brokered an ECOFIN agreement on aggressive tax planning and good governance, which was acknowledged by Member States as a significant achievement;</p><p>- Ireland secured agreement that such international tax issues cannot be solved by unilateral action by individual countries and stressed the importance of coordination with the OCED;</p><p>- A Roadmap for action against aggressive tax planning was outlined in Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency conclusions;</p><p>- The OECD&rsquo;s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project represents that response and BEPS will be the main toolkit of the global effort to tackle these issues;</p><p>- The OECD&rsquo;s report on BEPS will be presented to the G20 in July.</p><p>  It should also be noted that the OECD acknowledged that Ireland had given &ldquo;smart and constructive assistance&rdquo; to developing an international plan for preventing multinationals escaping paying corporation tax altogether. A proposal for addressing the issue is expected to be published shortly and it is envisaged that the measures involved will be implemented over the following two years.</p></reply>

FP7 offers Ireland's SMEs, multinationals, and research institutions valuable opportunities to participate in high-calibre research collaborations with our European counterparts.</p><p>  Job creation and, equally important, job maintenance is increasingly underpinned by science, technology and innovation including, for example, in the pharmaceutical, ICT, agri-food, medical devices, engineering and even financial services sectors which are developing innovative products and services. FP7 enables companies to work with academic research groups and other industry players across Europe and derive the benefits associated with collaborative research. This enables them to gain benefits such as access to knowledge networks, access to specialist equipment, sharing of costs and risks and, in particular for industry, the possibility of opening up commercial opportunities.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s researchers and companies have been involved in more than 1,500 successful applications obtaining European Commission funding of approximately &euro;485 million (2007-2012) under FP7.

This has played a major part in helping to restore a significant proportion of our competitiveness losses in the preceding years. Latest available data for the 12 month period to April 2013 indicates that Ireland continues to outperform most of our European counterparts.</p><p>  The recently published Forfas report &ldquo;Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2012&rdquo; is an important report in the context of our need to continue to build an export-led recovery. It looks at the relative importance of different areas of cost for different sectors.</p><p>  The report indicates that business costs in Ireland have reduced significantly in recent years, with overall price levels in the economy falling back to levels last experienced in 2002. The improvement in business cost competitiveness has been driven by significant reductions in property related costs (in terms of purchase and rent levels) and falling prices across a range of professional and business services. There have also been relative improvements in labour costs in Ireland which fell on average by 0.9% per annum in the period 2008-2011, while labour costs increased in the euro area by 4.6% per annum on average in the same period.</p><p>  However, while these improvements are very welcome and indicate that the economy is moving in the right direction, we must continue to focus on actions to promote further cost reductions across the economy. The Forf&aacute;s report advises that over half of recent cost competitiveness gains are attributable to favourable exchange rate movements. The report also indicates that upward price pressure is beginning to emerge in some areas.</p><p>  The Forfas report makes a number of recommendations aimed at further improving our cost competitiveness position in relation to labour, property, transport, utility and professional services costs. Part of the objective of the Action Plan for Jobs has been the development of proposals each year that can improve our competitiveness. The 2013 Action Plan includes a number of specific actions in this regard which address some of the areas highlighted in the Forfas report.</p><p>  Action 126 of the Action Plan requires that Forf&aacute;s will, this year, compare consumer price levels and consumer price inflation in Ireland with prices in our key competitors.  They will identify the primary drivers of price and inflation differentials and assess the impacts of cost of living in Ireland on labour costs and other business costs.</p><p>  The implementation of these Action Plan measures, combined with the Government&rsquo;s broader agenda to enhance productivity, will play a key role in improving our competitiveness and realising our ambition of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.</p></reply>

The Council is supported in its work by Forfas, who monitor Ireland's competitiveness on an on-going basis.  The NCC has recently been reconfigured to provide greater synergy between the Council's recommendations and the development and implementation of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs.  Six leading industrial figures who have been assigned to assist with the implementation of the seven &quot;Disruptive Reforms&quot; as part of the Action Plan for Jobs were appointed to the NCC in May of this year.</p><p>  Ireland is already rated highly internationally as one of the best countries in the world in which to do business, and we have built a strong competitive basis on which to compete on global markets. Ireland has moved up three places to 17th place in the IMD's World Competitiveness Yearbook 2013 having being ranked 24th only 2 years ago, while Ireland is ranked 15th in the World Bank's Doing Business 2012 Report.</p><p>  There are a number of key areas where Ireland tops global competitiveness rankings, including:</p><p>- business impact of rules on foreign direct investment;</p><p>- inflation;</p><p>- FDI and technology transfer;</p><p>- availability of skilled labour;</p><p>- flexibility and adaptability of the labour force; and</p><p>- investment incentives.</p><p>  While Ireland's competitiveness has improved in recent years, we must continue to do more, though the Action Plan for Jobs, to ensure that these competitiveness gains are not eroded as the economy begins to recover.  The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs includes a range of concrete measures to address issues which impact negatively on our competitiveness position.  The implementation of these actions, combined with the Government's broader agenda to enhance productivity, will play a key role in improving our competitiveness and realising our ambition of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.</p></reply>

The Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton, T.D., has been rolling out a new streamlined service, known as Intreo, which offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers and employers alike.  The new service includes the provision of recruitment and job-matching services for employers, to facilitate the hiring of workers from the Live Register.  Along with the Taoiseach, Tanaiste and Minister Burton, I launched the new JobsPlus Incentive on 8 July.  JobsPlus is a new initiative which encourages employers to offer employment opportunities to the long term unemployed.</p><p>  The Incentive will provide two levels of payment: a payment of &euro;7,500 over two years to an employer for each person recruited who has been unemployed for more than 12 months, but less than 24 months, and a payment of &euro;10,000 over two years for each person recruited who has been unemployed for more than 24 months.  The new Incentive will be payable monthly in arrears.  In order to qualify, an employer must offer full time employment of at least 30 hours per week, spanning at least four days per week, to eligible recruits.</p><p>  Details of the full range of services available to employers through Intreo, and of the JobsPlus initiative are available on the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s website, www.welfare.ie.</p></reply>

When the Government came into office, it gave extensive consideration to abolishing upward-only rent reviews in leases signed before 28th February 2010. The advice received by the Government was that it was not possible to develop a scheme to tackle this issue that would not be vulnerable to a Constitutional challenge or compensation claims from landlords. On the basis of this advice, the Government concluded that it was not feasible to legislate to abolish upward only rent reviews.</p><p>  However, the Government has taken steps to address the issue where possible. In the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, the Government undertook to place downward pressure on commercial rents where the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) had acquired the loan on the underlying property.</p><p>  The 2013 Action Plan includes a number of specific commitments to support the retail sector, including an initiative to increase the number of businesses trading on-line and a project to develop a single business licence application portal for the sector.  My Department is also chairing an Interdepartmental Group to undertake a short examination of further possible measures to assist the retail sector, which could, for example, be considered in the context of the Budget or the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs. The Group comprises key Government Departments and has already met with the main representative bodies for the retail sector.  The Group will hold a further series of meetings with other stakeholders this week.</p></reply>

The law is clear on the matter of employment of 3rd country nationals - it is illegal for such a 3rd country national to be employed without the State&rsquo;s permission and it is an offence for both the 3rd country national and the employer concerned.  Illegal employment of 3rd country nationals creates a serious problem for the employees concerned in that they do not have a legally binding contract of employment and cannot therefore rely on such a contract in asserting their rights under the contract and under the wide spectrum of employment rights legislation.</p><p>  Following the result of this in the High Court judgement concerning Mr. Younis, I committed to amending the legislation in order to provide a defence for the employee which will then give the courts some discretion on the matter. Also, subject to Government approval, I intend to introduce new safeguards in the legislation that will ensure that the situation which arose in the Younis case will be prevented in future in a manner which does not undermine legal principles and ensures that an employer cannot benefit from the fact that a contract of employment is illegal and therefore not legally binding.</p><p>  Another key feature of the new Bill, subject to Government approval, will be the establishment on a statutory footing of an Employment Permit for dealing with 3rd country nationals who have, to use a parlance, &ldquo;fallen out of&rdquo; the Employment Permits regime. I recognise that there can be situations where such a 3rd country national can find themselves falling out of the Employment Permits&rsquo; regime through circumstances beyond their control or even as a result of their omission to keep their Employment Permit up to date.  Such people may have established roots in Ireland and it can be in the public interest to facilitate a reactivation of their inclusion within a legal employment framework through the granting of an Employment Permit.</p><p>  There will be three overriding principles concerning an application for an Employment Permit of this type. Firstly, the application process and administration must be clear and approachable from the perspective of an applicant. Secondly, the employee concerned must have originally entered the labour market legally through the Employment Permits system. I do not want to create a mechanism capable of abuse or considered as an alternative to the normal Employment Permit process. Also, it is logical that an Employment Permits Bill deals only with Employment Permits matters. The third principle will be that the employee must not currently be in employment illegally &ndash; it would be nonsensical for an applicant to apply for a permit under one section of the Act whilst at the same time potentially committing an offence under another section of the Act.</p><p>  I should also point out that it continues to be the case that an employer can be prosecuted for breaches of employment law including the Employment Permits Acts and it is the National Employment Rights Authority&rsquo;s policy to pursue such breaches.</p><p>  Finally, in terms of the current status of the Employment Permits Bill, the drafting process is almost concluded. I am expecting a further draft of the Bill this week and subject to it fully meeting policy objectives I envisage submitting it to Government for approval at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

PRSI credited contributions are an integral part of the social insurance system.  For the most part they are linked to having an underlying entitlement to a social welfare payment while temporarily detached from the labour force or having entitlement to statutory leave e.g. parental or maternity leave.  The primary purpose of PRSI credits is to secure social welfare benefits and pensions of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI such as during periods of unemployment, illness, etc.   </p><p>  The class at which a contributor paid his or her last PRSI contribution determines entitlement to credited contributions.  Credits are usually awarded at the same rate as your last paid PRSI contribution.  For example, Class A PRSI contributions may entitle a person to all insured DSP benefits, provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions.  Credits are not available to a person who has only Class S contributions.</p><p>  People who cease to be covered by compulsory social insurance, may opt to protect their existing long-term social insurance pension entitlements by becoming insured on a voluntary basis and paying voluntary contributions.  Payment of voluntary contributions does not provide social insurance cover for short term benefits such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  A person who wishes to become a voluntary contributor must satisfy certain contribution conditions and must apply to become a voluntary contributor within 12 months after the end of the contribution year in which he/she was last compulsorily insured.  A person cannot be a voluntary contributor while also an employed contributor or in receipt of credited employment contributions.</p></reply>

No other electricity supply company has to date chosen to enter the domestic market and to offer a microgeneration feed-in-tariff on a commercial basis, although the Commission for Energy Regulation invited them to do so.  In addition, no company has opted to offer, on a commercial basis, a feed-in-tariff for microgeneration to the commercial and industrial sectors.</p><p>  Previously, a joint ESB/Electric Ireland microgeneration support scheme for the domestic sector offering a total of 19c/kwh (comprising &euro;10c/kwh from ESB Networks combined with the 9c/kwh from ESB Customer Supply (now Electric Ireland)) ran for 3 years from February 2009 to February 2012, and had a take up of between 500 and 600 installations.</p><p>  In view of falling technology costs, my Department has recently asked the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to update analysis on the costs of varying levels of support for microgeneration technologies, with a view to considering how the sector, including on-farm microgeneration, could be supported in the future.  This analysis will also cover non-tariff support mechanisms, the cost of which is not funded from the Public Service Obligation.</p></reply>

The Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband to all parts of Ireland through two principal means:</p><p>- by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and </p><p>- by providing a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  ComReg has put in place a new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and for service bundles, both of which are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by service providers. ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction, completed in 2012, is also enabling the rollout of advanced mobile broadband services.</p><p>  There is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which they committed in the Plan with investments of up to &euro;1bn underway.  Some of the key developments in the short and medium term are as follows:</p><p>- eircom launched its next generation broadband services on 16th May last, with speeds of up to 70Mbps, immediately available to over 300,000 premises.  By the end of this year, eircom aims to reach more than 600,000 homes and businesses. It has a target to pass 1.2m premises by June 2015. </p><p>- UPC is continuing with its investment in the cable network, which should see 750,000 homes able to access services at data speeds of at least 150 Mbps by 2015.</p><p>- Other fixed operators also continue to invest in Local Loop Unbundling (LLU). BT Ireland now supplies broadband access to both Vodafone and Sky Ireland, and along with other operators, is also investing in fixed infrastructure.</p><p>- Mobile wireless operators are making plans for the rollout of 4G services later this year.  The operators are obliged, under the terms of the licences, to cover 70% of the population. </p><p>- ESB is currently considering the prospect of utilising its distribution network to rollout fibre broadband services.</p><p>  In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. </p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My officials have just commenced a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband services over the coming years.  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment so as to deliver on the targets for high speed broadband contained in the National Broadband Plan.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  Implementation of the National Broadband Plan will be complemented by the National Digital Strategy.  The first phase of the National Digital Strategy, which I will launch on 11 July next, will target specific segments of society, aiming to improve digital adoption and to realise the economic and social benefits that digital technologies can bring.</p></reply>

The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) is responsible for maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s 90 days of strategic oil stocks for use in the event of an oil supply disruption.  It is a matter for each Member State to decide on the manner in which they fund this security of supply obligation and this will vary from Member State to Member State.  NORA receives no Exchequer funding and is funded by way of a levy on disposals of petroleum products and by bank borrowings.  I do not believe that the NORA levy creates competition issues between EU Member States.  All Member States have to bear the cost of the strategic oil stocks requirement and ultimately this requirement will be transferred by way of price inclusion to consumers.</p><p>  The NORA levy is not imposed directly on firelighters or fire logs as such, although oil may be a constituent element of such products and the levy would be payable on that constituent part.  The NORA Act 2007 provides that the levy must be paid by all companies on the oil products specified in the legislation.  An exemption is provided for in the case of companies that maintain 55 days of oil stocks, on the basis of their previous year&rsquo;s oil consumption.</p><p>  My Department received an application from the company concerned for an exemption from NORA levy duty under Section 38 of the NORA Act, 2007 in 2011 but that application was unsuccessful because it did not satisfy the requirements of Section 38 and Section 62 of the NORA Act.  Officials of my Department met with representatives of the company to outline the position.</p><p>  I understand that whilst a revised proposal was subsequently put to my Department by the company that my Department had no contact from the company since June 2012.  My officials have contacted the company and are seeking to clarify the position as soon as possible.</p></reply>

By the end of April 2013, the situation has dramatically improved and the split is now 74% as physical stocks on the island of Ireland and 26% as physical stocks in other EU Member States.</p><p>  In 2007, NORA held approximately 75 of Ireland&rsquo;s total 90 day strategic stockholding obligation.  Today NORA holds 88 of Ireland&rsquo;s total 90 day obligation.  This increase has come about largely due to the implementation of the new EU Oil Stocks Directive (Directive 2009/119/EC), which came into effect on 1 January 2013, whereby commercial stocks may no longer be counted towards a country&rsquo;s strategic stockholding.</p><p>  As an island nation with limited refining capacity and no indigenous oil production, the physical availability of already refined strategic oil product stocks on the island, as part of our strategic oil stocks, improves our security of supply position, particularly in the event of prolonged weather disruption which might make imports difficult.  It was considered that the over-reliance on stock tickets (short term contracts for the supply of oil in the event of an emergency), created a vulnerability in the event of supply disruption and this has now been eliminated.  There are also benefits to the national economy of holding the strategic stocks on the island of Ireland. In this context, a policy has been pursued since 2007 of rebalancing the wholly owned strategic stocks onto the island of Ireland.</p><p>  The lack of physical infrastructure on the island available for oil storage required NORA to develop its own new storage facilities which took time as well as additional funding and staffing resources.  NORA pursued all options for increasing storage capacity in Ireland, including maximising its use of existing commercial storage and refurbishing existing storage facilities for its own use.  In the last 3 years, NORA has refurbished and commissioned three new oil storage facilities on the island &ndash; in Dublin, Kerry and Antrim, providing a total of an additional 320,000 tonnes of storage.  NORA will continue to seek out new storage facilities and opportunities subject to value for money in line with Government policy.  Stocks held in other EU Member States are held in Spain, Netherlands, United Kingdom and Denmark.  These stocks are held under Member State to Member State bilateral agreements.</p></reply>

The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on non-principal private residences. The charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  Section 6 of the 2009 Act, as amended, provides that the owner of a liable property who fails to pay the charge, in addition to his or her being liable to pay the charge, is liable to pay to the relevant local authority a &euro;20 late payment fee in respect of each month or part of a month in which the charge, any late payment fee, or any part of such charge or fee, remains unpaid.</p><p>  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect non-principal private residence charges and late payment fees due to it and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. I have issued guidelines to local authorities in relation to the operation of the &ldquo;care and management&rdquo; provisions of the legislation in instances in which genuine hardship in having to discharge a liability in a single payment can be demonstrated.

A key conclusion in that regard is that such an office should not be simply inserted as a further layer of governance and administration in addition to the current local government structures.</p><p>  The establishment of an office with more far-reaching powers, functions and budgetary capacity would be likely to require significant changes in existing local government arrangements. The implications in this regard and the changes required at local government level would need to be considered carefully and include issues in regard to the powers, structures and functions of such an office and consequential changes in the powers, structures and functions of local authorities and other relevant bodies, budgetary matters, strategic co-ordination, an elected assembly with oversight and accountability functions, avoidance of duplication, maximisation of efficiency in local government arrangements, avoidance of cost increases and achievement of savings. The Action Programme indicated that a special forum or colloquium of the elected members of D&uacute;n Laoghaire &ndash; Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin County Councils and Dublin City Council would be convened by the Lord Mayor of Dublin to consider the options for local governance in Dublin, including the potential for a directly elected Mayor for a Dublin Metropolitan Area. It is intended that proposals arising from the colloquium will be put for decision through a plebiscite in 2014, which I envisage will be held alongside the local elections. This will provide for suitable democratic debate and consultation on all dimensions of the issue.</p><p>  The Lord Mayor of Dublin wrote to me recently on the matter and I replied, setting out matters which I consider would need to be addressed by the elected members of the four local authorities, when developing proposals to be put before the electorate in the plebiscite. It will be open to the forum or colloquium to assess the various options for local governance in the Dublin metropolitan area as part of its deliberations. I have asked for a response by the end of the year, in order to allow Government make appropriate decisions on the next steps in the preparation of the plebiscite. I have received no other written submissions in the matter.</p></reply>

Where any borrower, either from a local authority or from a private financial institution, is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, they should engage proactively and constructively with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution. The services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service are also available to such borrowers and support is available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme. Local authorities have long been the lenders of last resort servicing the housing loans needs of less affluent members of society. In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.</p><p>  Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases. In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based upon the Central Bank&rsquo;s first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.  To reflect the content of the Central Bank&rsquo;s revised Code of Conduct &ndash; which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt &ndash; my Department issued updated guidance in June 2012 to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association. This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.</p><p>  In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, presents borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, including those referred to, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case. This process features a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent. Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices.  The introduction of these revised guidelines standardises the approach across the whole sector, introduces a systematic structure to this area and provides borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution. My Department is currently preparing updated guidance in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s latest Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.</p></reply>

On this basis the fee for technical assessment has been set at &euro;4,500. This amount represents a significant reduction on the figure originally proposed due to a concession given by the registration body at its own expense. My Department understands that the registration body has negotiated a loan facility with the Bank of Ireland to provide support to those undergoing Technical Assessment.  Section 17(3) of the Act enables the registration body to waive or reduce a specified fee in cases of verified hardship.</p><p>  While the above sets out the current factual position in relation to the fee, I have recently asked Mr. Garrett Fennell, Solicitor, who is currently serving as the Chairperson of the Admissions Board relevant to the register of Architects, to carry out an independent review of the experience to date in relation to the operation of the register with a view to identifying any further improvements that can be made at this point.

In addition, Ireland must comply with strict limits under the Landfill Directive for the volumes of material which are landfilled.  I published <i>A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland</i> in July 2012 which clearly signalled my intent ion to raise the landfill levy in July 2013 in order to provide certainty, in the form of both policy and legislation, so that the necessary actions and investments are progressed to achieve the policy's objectives.</p><p>  The National Waste Report for 2011 reported the quantity of biodegradable municipal waste disposed at landfill in 2011 as 771,551 tonnes. This is 161,551 tonnes in excess of the July 2013 EU Landfill Directive limit and 344,551 tonnes in excess of the 2016 limit. Therefore, effective economic instruments, such as the landfill levy, are key to encouraging more sustainable management of our waste.</p><p>  Charges applied by waste management companies are a matter between those companies and their customers, subject to compliance with all applicable environmental and other relevant legislation, particularly the conditions attached to each waste collection permit issued under the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2007 as amended. The increase in the landfill levy is &euro;10 per tonne of leviable waste disposed of to landfill and in that context, the National Waste Report for 2011, published by the Environmental Protection Agency records a figure of 0.163 tonnes of residual household waste per person being disposed of to landfill in that year.</p></reply>

Among the issues discussed at the Informal Council was the future development of EU policy on air quality, which is currently under review and which is expected to be published by the European Commission later this year.</p><p>  My Department has since met with the Department of the Environment, Northern Ireland, to agree terms of reference for the study and prepare tender documentation. The request for tender will issue later in July and the successful bidder to undertake the study will be appointed as soon as possible. It is expected that the contract will be completed within six months.</p><p>  Notwithstanding recent regulatory improvements and extension of the smoky coal ban, I recognise that having different standards applying to coal between larger urban and smaller urban/rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for people across these different locations. For this reason I have set the challenging target of introducing a ban on smoky coal across the State within the next three years. However, I fully recognise the cross-border enforcement difficulties arising, if a national ban is introduced unilaterally in the South rather than on an all-island basis. A closer alignment of solid fuel policy and legislation on an all-island basis will allow the benefits derived from the ban potentially to be further extended. In this regard, the policy options identified following the conclusion of the joint study will steer further legislative development in this area.</p></reply>

However, in this case the section provides that the provision in section 11 of the Roads Act requiring the authority to consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge is to be disregarded.</p><p>  Section 180 also provides that where a planning authority, in complying with section 180, makes an order under section 11 of the Roads Act, it must also take in charge any open spaces, car parks, sewers, watermains, or drains within the attendant grounds of the development. Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a planning authority may take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the planning authority consider that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer. Planning authorities have also been empowered to take in charge part of an estate or some, but not all, of the facilities in an estate.</p></reply>

Effective roads policing is central to the Garda Policing Plan 2013 and road traffic enforcement is high throughout the country.</p><p>  Garda enforcement activities are focused on the main causes of deaths and serious injuries on our roads and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na conducts specific operations to improve the compliance culture particularly among young male drivers.  The Garda authorities work with the Road Safety Authority and other road safety stakeholders to promote road safety among target groups and conduct Garda Road Safety Awareness Programmes in schools and third level institutions.</p><p>  I am advised that Garda authorities conduct ongoing strategic local enforcement operations targeting anti-social driving.  These enforcement operations are intelligence-led, targeting areas in particular where young male drivers congregate. Regular Garda mobile patrols and checkpoints are also conducted in these areas and websites are monitored to assist in establishing where events are taking place and to implement the necessary operational Garda response.  Such operations have resulted in a significant number of young drivers being prosecuted or for driving without a learner permit, driving unaccompanied while on a learner permit and driving a vehicle with prohibited modifications.  Where breaches of road traffic legislation are detected, the Garda authorities make full use of the fixed charge notice, penalty point system, court prosecutions and Juvenile Diversion Programme where appropriate.</p></reply>

The Strategy is underpinned by a vision of providing &lsquo;A safer community through excellence in a prison service built on respect for human dignity&rsquo;. To underpin this strategy the Irish Prison Service intends to introduce a Dignity at Work Charter and a prison wide dignity and respect campaign with the aim of creating a positive and caring environment for staff and prisoners.  Everyone in the Irish Prison service should be committed to treating everyone fairly, with courtesy, respecting personal dignity at all times.  These principles will be at the heart of what the Irish Prison Service sets out to achieve in the coming years and into the future in all strategic actions.</p><p>  I am informed by the Director General that a Working Group, comprising of representatives from Human Resources and Corporate Affairs Directorates, the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association, the Legal and Professional Standards Unit, the Employee Assistance Service and the Psychology Service, was established to deliver on this commitment. Work on phase 1 of the dignity at work programme finished in the past few weeks. This phase comprised of significant staff consultation which was undertaken through the holding of 19 focus groups at prison level. A number of subgroups have been established to identify the common issues raised and work in this regard will continue over the coming months. It is hoped that by addressing these issues we will be able to implement what is needed to make and create a working environment which is based on co-operation, openness, equality and respect.</p></reply>

These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services. On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison. At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date. Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.</p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the new Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015. There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning, including Integrated Sentence Management, and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.</p><p>  In relation to participation in education programmes, the aim of the Prison Service places a strong emphasis on improving prisoners' employability prospects through Work Training activities and accredited vocational training courses. Over 100 workshops and service activities operate across the prison estate and the number of accredited courses and activities has increased in recent years. There are now over 100 qualifications available across 20 skill sets. 1,459 prisoners participated in accredited vocational training courses in 2012 - up from 314 in 2007 - and 1,030 prisoners received certificates in the last year.</p><p>  A wide range of training workshops and service activities are operating in the Midlands Prison. These include carpentry, metalwork, computers, laundry, waste management, horticulture, industrial cleaning and catering. Prisoners housed in the new accommodation block in the Midlands have access to the existing Work Training and Education activities alongside other constructive activities such as gyms, paint parties, cleaning, and reception work. In addition to a recently opened 'bag and Tag' Tuckshop facility, the new block will also include workshop activities in printing/computers, catering training and light industry/craftwork. Soft skills programmes will also be facilitated in the new block.</p><p>  In November, 2012, prior to the opening of the new block, an average of 108 inmates were engaged in work training activities in Midlands Prison compared with an average of 123 inmates in May, 2013. It is envisaged that the additional activities will come on stream in the near future once vacancies in the Work Training Officer (WTO) grade are filled through a competition which will be held in the coming weeks.</p><p>  The aim of the Education Service is to deliver a high quality, broad, flexible programme of education that helps prisoners cope with their sentence, achieve personal development, prepare for life after release and establish an appetite and capacity for life-long learning. The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons through the VECs (220 in the academic year 2012/13).</p><p>  Ten general purpose rooms have been re-designated in the new block for education purposes, this equates to approximately 70 additional places. Prior to the opening of the new block 280 students attended classes per week. During the week ending 3 May 2013, 348 students attended classes. At present the formal academic year is complete and the summer programme is running with limited resources - 150 students attended classes during week ending 5 July 2013.</p></reply>

As the Deputy can see from the table there are 308 prisoners in Mountjoy accommodated in single cell accommodation, or 56% of the prison's population.</p><p>Given the current number of prisoners in custody - 4,203 on 8 July 2013 - the Irish Prison Service is not in a position to provide single cell accommodation to all prisoners.  Single cell occupancy across the system would result in a bed capacity of less than 3,000 (only 308 in the case of Mountjoy) and would not be possible to achieve without releasing sizeable numbers of prisoners considered to represent a threat to public safety.</p><p>In addition it should be borne in mind that in some cases prisoners are housed together for reasons other than lack of capacity. Family members, friends and co-accused prisoners often elect or are assigned a shared cell. Shared cell accommodation can be very beneficial from a management point of view particularly for those who are vulnerable and at risk of self-harm. There will always be a need for certain prisoners to be accommodated together.</p><p>As outlined in the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan, it is intended to align prison capacity with the guidelines laid down by the Inspector of Prisons by 2014, in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.</p></reply>

Those not on a restricted regime can associate with other protection prisoners and have normal out of cell time during the day.  </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that protection prisoners are those who are considered to be under threat or at risk in the general population.  The Irish Prison Service must ensure in so far as possible the safety of prisoners, which is why those seeking protection are immediately separated from the general prison population or from specific prisoners identified as presenting a threat.</p><p>  It is at the committal stage that the majority of prisoners are identified as being in need of protection.  In many instances, the prisoner will request protection and in other instances, either intelligence or the assessment of the Governor will identify a prisoner as requiring protection.  Allowing prisoners to be accommodated in protective custody clearly demonstrates prison management's commitment to ensure safe and secure custody for offenders.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I published the Irish Prison Service Strategic Plan 2012-2015 in April last year.  The Strategic Plan includes a number of Strategic Actions one of which is a commitment to develop a specific strategy for prisoners requiring protection.  The Strategy also commits the Prison Service to introducing appropriate assessment procedures to inform their prisoner placement policy, to ensure that prisoners are accommodated appropriate to their security status.  I am advised by my officials that the concerns regarding protection prisoners outlined in the Inspector of Prisons Annual Report 2012 will be addressed in the development of this strategy and that the target of completion by 2015 will be met.</p></reply>

Approximately 300,000 files relating to the period from Easter Week 1916 through the War of Independence and Civil War comprise this collection.  The files relate mainly to the applications by individuals and/ or their dependants for the award of pension and gratuities for veterans who served as members of the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Citizen Army, the Hibernian Rifles, the Irish Republican Army, Cumann na mBan, Na Fianna &Eacute;ireann, the National Army on active service or who were casualties or wounded while on duty during the period from April and May 1916 through to 30 September 1923.  The membership records of these organisations (less that of the National Army) as on 11 July 1921 and 1 July 1922 will also be released along with selected administration files and material to put the entire collection in context.  This is a significant element of the collection.</p><p>  No date has been set yet for the launch of the inaugural release, which is web-based and concentrated on 1916 participants.  However, arrangements for the launch are under active consideration.  The first release contains files relating to in excess of 3,000 individuals (2,397 of these individuals are veterans of Easter Week 1916) and comprising some 452,000 scanned images giving background and context to the individual applications.  Databasing and digitising of these files is complete.  Testing of the website is nearing completion.</p><p>  A phased release of material into the public domain is planned with regular releases relating to the War of Independence and Civil War occurring in the run up to 2016.  Subsequent releases will have a web element but it is important to note that not all files will be available online.  Physical visits to the Military Archives will be required to see the full material.  It is envisaged that the provision of accommodation for people wishing to access the Military Archives records and for the storage of the archives will be progressed further under the Government Centenary Commemoration programme.</p></reply>

The FAO is more involved with setting standards (e.g. via the Codex Almentarius and the various expert committees on genetic resources and animal health) and evaluating global policy for agricultural production.  Their work is complementary and they are encouraged to cooperate wherever possible.

It found that it is very difficult to identify young carers in the population. </p><p>  In order to learn more about children that undertake caring roles, my Department requested the Central Statistics Office to include a question in the Census of Population 2011.  People of all ages were asked whether they provide any unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long term-term illness, health problem or disability.  The Census of Population 2011 found that 6,449 children provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problems or disability.  Overall, 5.6 per 1,000 children provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problem or disability.  Rates ranged from 4.3 per 1,000 in Co. Louth to 8.2 per 1000 in Co. Leitrim.  It is further planned, under the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives published by my Department in November 2011, that a detailed analysis of those children who report in the 2011 Census that they undertake caring roles, will be carried out by the end of 2013.  It is anticipated that the analysis will inform future policy as to how best to address the support needs of children and young people who undertake caring roles. </p><p>  In 2012 the Department of Health published The National Carers&rsquo; Strategy &ndash; Recognised, Supported, Empowered.  The strategy recognizes that although the needs of young carers can be similar to carers of any age, they may have additional needs, which include support in education to help them to achieve their full potential.  </p><p>  My Department has been supporting the implementation of this strategy by ensuring that the children strategies which it is developing are cognisant of the necessity to make them as &lsquo;carer friendly&rsquo; as possible.  However, given the young age that the Childcare Directorate is dealing with, the number of cases where children might be carers is very small.  </p><p>  In preparation for the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency (CFA) the following actions have been taken that are relevant to the Carers Strategy:  - Child care staff have been alerted to the strategy and its relevance to children with carer responsibilities; - Strategy disseminated to key children and family services staff; - Linkages between carer responsibilities and child protection issues have been highlighted to staff</p><p>  The National Education Welfare Board (NEWB) is developing national guidelines as a practical support for schools in the preparation of School Attendance Strategies as outlined in Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000.  The guidelines will assist schools to implement effective measures to support children at risk of poor attendance and participation, including those with caring responsibilities.</p><p>  The NEWB has made significant progress towards delivering an integrated school support service based on the principle of &ldquo;One Child, One Team, One Plan&quot;.  This streamlined national approach will enhance education support services and enable the NEWB to respond appropriately to the circumstances in which children and families need help from NEWB.  Consultation on the practice model started in October 2012 and concluded early in 2013.  The model is also being developed to complement and link with models of practice and methods of working proposed by the new Child and Family Agency (CFA) within its proposed National Service Delivery Framework.</p></reply>

Following receipt of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, my officials have established that the programme is seeking funding of &euro;35,044.88 to create a new post of Traveller Education Support Worker to serve the primary schools in the project.  I am also aware that this proposal was submitted to my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, for his consideration.  The National Educational Welfare Board, which operates under the remit of my Department, is responsible for the operational management of the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme.  In delivering on this role, the board works closely with management committees, schools and local Home School Community Liaison Scheme and School Completion Programme co-ordinators to ensure student supports and interventions are tailored to meet local needs.  As the services of the National Educational Welfare Board are central to this proposal, I will ask it to engage directly with the schools and the Department of Education and Skills to facilitate consideration of the proposal in the appropriate context.</p><p>  It should be recognised that the Dominican Campus School Completion Programme operates under the direction of a Local Management Committee.  This Committee assesses local needs to devise a programme of student supports and interventions, known as the Retention Plan, to support identified young people at risk of educational disadvantage in their school, home and community life.  Funding is provided by my Department following approval of annual plans by the National Educational Welfare Board.  The Deputy may wish to note that the Dominican Campus School Completion Programme received funding of &euro;193,754 in the current academic year.  The project model approach enables creative and innovative local strategies to be developed.  Therefore, it is open to the Dominican Campus School Completion Programme to consider its priority requirements, including the present proposal, within the existing planning and funding cycle.  Furthermore, within its targeting process, the schools involved should identify and prioritise at-risk children, including those from within the Traveller community, for available supports.</p><p>  In planning its programme of supports, the Local Management Committee must have regard to the full extent of DEIS resources provided to its schools.  Given the need to achieve saving in the School Completion Programme in 2013 and 2014, a coherent approach in the use of all school resources will ensure available funds are committed to those services which provide the greatest contribution to children's educational outcomes.  Projects are finalising proposals for the next academic year.  The National Educational Welfare Board will work with the Local Management Committee to examine this proposal in the context of its suite of supports and interventions.</p></reply>

The Health Service Executive has responsibility for the delivery of services such as mainstream home help, enhanced home care packages, meals-on-wheels and day or respite care.  The budget for these community services for older people in 2013  is &euro;392 million.  The HSE has committed to maintaining community supports at the levels planned for in 2012.  This means that 10,870 people will be in receipt of home care packages, and that 10.3 million hours of home help service will be provided with 50,000 people receiving this service.</p><p>  Following on from the special allocation of &euro;35 million for mental health in Budget 2012, a further &euro;35 million was provided in Budget 2013 for the continued development of community mental health teams for, <i>inter alia</i>, older persons and for mental health intellectual disability.  In addition, funding is being provided to further advance suicide prevention initiatives and forensic services.  Approximately 900 additional staff are being recruited to implement these measures.  The vision for the Disability Services Programme set out in the Value for Money and Policy Review is to contribute to the realisation of a society where people with disabilities are supported as far as possible to live in the community, to participate to their full potential in the economic and social life of the community and to have access to a range of quality personal social supports and services to enhance their quality of life and well-being.  In this context, support for community living means providing the range and type of individualised supports needed to enable each person to live in the home of their choice and be included in their community.  The range of individualised supports provided by the health services to enable people with a disability to live in their own homes covers a diverse area, such as the provision of care, therapeutic supports and training.</p></reply>

No. 179 of 2004).  Membership of the Board of the NTPF, as well as accountability and reporting arrangements are set out in its Establishment Order; the SI provides for a Board of nine members which reports to the Minister.  </p><p>  In July 2011, I announced changes to the remit of the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), namely that its role would be changed to support the mission of the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which aims to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  The NTPF is now fully aligned with the SDU and is targeting waiting lists strategically and assisting in the performance management of hospitals to reduce waiting times for patients.  The NTPF capability is a core part of the SDU's performance improvement role. </p><p>The NTPF has been working to rationalise its internal structures and to establish new functional areas that reflect its evolving role.  These include data and analytics reporting, data audit and quality assurance and performance improvement.  Where appropriate, redeployment opportunities in other agencies have also been identified and I understand that a number of staff have taken these up.</p><p>  The Acting CEO of the NTPF resigned with effect from 5 July last and the HSE National Director designate of Acute Hospitals has been appointed as Acting CEO of NTPF.  The NTPF's future will be considered further in the context of the structural reforms set out in <i>Future Health - A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015.  </i></p></reply>

This HTA was published on the 26th of June 2013. Arising from the findings of the HTA, HIQA&rsquo;s advice to the HSE was that, despite some promising results on the effect of IPC in people with severe peripheral vascular disease (who are not suitable for revascularisation), further high quality studies are required to reliably demonstrate its effectiveness. They also advised that until such evidence is generated in the context of well designed research studies, the efficacy of this treatment remains unproven.</p><p>  Within the Irish healthcare system there has been limited use of IPC to treat patients with critical limb ischaemia. Following the publication of this HTA report there will be engagement and discussion with prescribing clinicians regarding its findings.</p></reply>

As far as the law is concerned, car drivers in the age range 60 to 67 may apply for a licence which expires at 70.  From 67-69 they may apply for a three-year licence.  In neither case is a medical report required.  The legislation requires a medical report if the applicant will be 70 or more on the day of commencement of the licence.  However, in circumstances where there is a condition or a history of conditions which the legislation requires be notified in a licence application, a medical report would be required from an applicant who is under 70.</p><p>  The  circumstances described by the Deputy should not therefore arise.  A person of 66 at the time of the commencement of the licence should receive a licence valid until they turn 70, and should not be asked for a medical report unless they have a condition, or a history of a condition, which requires notification.  In the latter case their existing licence should have a code 101 on it, indicating that renewal is subject to a medical report.</p></reply>
