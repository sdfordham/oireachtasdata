Inspections under this campaign will check compliance with, among other requirements, national minimum wage rates, employment permit obligations and working hours provisions including those relating to rest breaks, leave, public holiday and Sunday work entitlements. </p>  <p>  Other WRC initiatives in the equine sector include an awareness and education programme in tandem with stakeholder engagement with the overall objective of achieving employment rights compliance.  I am advised by the WRC that planning and scoping arrangements for this campaign have been completed and that inspection appointment letters have issued to those employers who will be inspected under the initial phase of the campaign.  It is expected, therefore, that the majority of inspections will rollout from next week onwards.  However, 9 inspections have already been undertaken in 2017.</p>  <p>  Employees who feel that they are not receiving their statutory employment rights entitlements may make a complaint through the WRC&rsquo;s website at www.workplacerelations.ie.  Complaints are, depending on their nature and the legislation involved, dealt with by investigation by inspectors or referred by the Director General for adjudication by Adjudication Officers. </p></reply>

The funding is also used to deliver &ldquo;soft&rdquo; supports comprising training, mentoring and sign-posting/referral.</p>  <p>  The additional allocation for 2017 enables the LEOs to assist microenterprises navigate challenges posed by Brexit, including a new Technical Assistance Grant, a LEO Innovation Investment Fund, as well as tailored training, mentoring and information provision.</p>  <p>  In 2016 the LEOs provided grant assistance to almost 1,000 microenterprises; training to over 27,500 participants; and mentoring to almost 7,500 participants.  In addition, 1,842 young entrepreneurs engaged with Ireland's Best Young Entrepreneur programme, which carries an investment fund of &euro;2 million.</p>  <p>  My aim is to build on that performance in 2017 and future years and my officials will be working with Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs to identify their funding requirements for next year as part of the 2018 Estimates cycle.</p></reply>

That is why, for example, I secured additional financial resources to support the strategic response to Brexit by our enterprise agencies.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are now engaging on an ongoing basis with client companies from all over Ireland regarding the commercial impact of Brexit on Irish firms.  The Agencies also have plans in place to both mitigate the challenges and maximise the opportunities that may arise on account of the UK's decision to leave the EU.     </p>  <p>  I am very much conscious of the particular trade implications that Brexit may have for border counties, such as Donegal.  InterTrade Ireland is currently undertaking a number of initiatives to assist companies in those locations that may be potentially affected by Brexit.  Last year the LEOs, EI and IDA supported 7,978 jobs in Donegal with the IDA recording seven site visits to the County last year, up from five the year before, with one additional visit recorded in Q1 this year.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Regional Action Plan for the North East/North West includes measures aimed at supporting the creation of 28,000 new jobs across Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth by 2020.  Significant progress has already been made towards that target, with 5,742 more people in employment across the region since the start of 2016.</p></reply>

This plan aims to support the creation of 28,000 new jobs across both regions by 2020.  Progress is also being made towards this goal, with 5,600 more people in employment across the region since the start of 2015.</p>  <p>  Regional development remains a key priority of mine and I am determined to help drive job creation all over Ireland.  I am aware, in particular, of the need to create jobs in border areas and I regularly engage with stakeholders from Cavan and Monaghan to discuss how best to achieve our investment targets.  Last month I visited Monaghan where, along with the enterprise agencies, I met with elected representatives and the County Council to further examine enterprise and employment opportunities in the area.

In 2015, the Agency made payments of &euro;6,058,747 to companies in these counties.  This was primarily to support new business employment, R&amp;D, capital investment and staff training.  EI&rsquo;s strategy for 2017-2020 aims to create a further 60,000 jobs.</p>  <p>  Progress has also been made by IDA towards achieving its target of increasing FDI in the region by 30% to 40% by 2019.  There are currently 12 IDA supported companies in Cavan and Monaghan.  I understand that the existing client base has performed well to date and is sustaining a total of 1,340 IDA supported jobs.</p></reply>

Cycle 5, awarded in 2010, involves over &euro;287m in direct Exchequer funding.  Cycle 5 is now coming to a close with 29 of the 33 projects fully completed.  As the outstanding bill to Higher Education Institutes has been reducing, the allocation to the PRTLI in my Department&rsquo;s Vote has also reduced.  My Department&rsquo;s allocation to the PRTLI in 2017 is &euro;14.4m.  This is being used towards meeting the remaining Cycle 5 liabilities.</p>  <p>  In addition to the PRTLI allocation, my Department is also allocating &euro;162.5 million to Science Foundation Ireland in 2017 to fund oriented basic and applied research.  SFI does not predetermine or &ldquo;ring fence&rdquo; specific funding allocation for basic or applied research.  Funding decisions are made through international peer review on the basis of research excellence and impact.  </p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are important funders of research, with spending on R&amp;D of &euro;394m in 2016.  This accounts for approximately half of total Government investment in R&amp;D.  Other Departments invested &euro;367m in R&amp;D in 2016 including funding programmes that encompass all disciplines and all types of research.</p>  <p>  Action 3.8 of Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for research and development, science and technology, provides for a new programme to fund Frontier Research.  On 6 April 2017, both myself and Minister Bruton launched the Irish Research Council&rsquo;s Frontier Research (LAUREATE) Programme, with initial funding of &euro;2.5 million.</p></reply>

Enterprise 2025 sets out actions that focus on building competitive advantage, ensuring a supportive business environment and attracting further investment.  It seeks to realise a significant uplift in the performance of enterprises in terms of innovation, export potential and productivity.  The potential set out in Enterprise 2025 for employment, exports, productivity and growth is ambitious, and even more so in today&rsquo;s environment. </p>  <p>  In March this year, I and my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade brought to Government and published our new trade and investment strategy, 'Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World'.  The critical importance of intensifying our well-established markets in the UK and the US and diversifying into other global markets is at the heart of our Strategy.  Targets for Enterprise Ireland include that 80% of export growth be in markets outside the UK, exports to the Eurozone be increased by 50% and a target of 60% growth in food and drink exports in Asia, North America and Africa. </p>  <p>  My review will be informed by potential future growth scenarios and my objective to complete later this year is to determine the extent to which the policy priorities set out are robust and to adjust as necessary.  The fundamentals of our enterprise policy are likely to remain valid, although this timely review will help to identify additional actions that may now be needed.</p></reply>

The 2003 Act had been in force for over eleven years and it was considered timely to take stock of how the legislation is operating in practice.  </p>  <p>  Twenty nine submissions were received from a range of interests including Government Departments and agencies; industry, insurance and legal interests; and individuals.  The Department has been examining these submissions with a view to identifying whether there are areas which might require change.  The General Scheme of the Bill is now being prepared and it will have regard to the relevant recommendations of the Report of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  I intend to seek Government approval for the drafting of a Bill by the end of the second quarter of this year.  The review will seek to strengthen the legislation to encourage more claims to be finalized through the Board.</p></reply>

While I am confident about the potential to secure new investment in Ireland, we do need to be realistic about what is achievable.  Competition for all new investment remains intense and we should not expect tens of thousands of Brexit related jobs to be created here by default.  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that in order to attract FDI including any mobile investment as a result of Brexit to the regions, IDA Ireland must maintain an adequate supply of marketable serviced land and buildings that can be offered to potential investors.  In County Wexford there are three IDA Ireland sites and one private finance facility available to market.</p></reply>

In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the D&aacute;il will be part of the final decision to ratify the Agreement.  My understanding is that the European Court of Justice has not been asked to decide on issues referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I fully support the early provisional application of the Agreement.  I am of the view that there should be no impediment to Irish companies immediately taking advantage of the provisions of CETA including eliminating tariffs on almost all of key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, easing regulatory barriers and ensuring more transparent rules for market access. </p>  <p>  Canada is currently finalising its internal implementation procedures to allow for its ratification of the Agreement.  This process is expected to be completed in the near future and should facilitate provisional application by Autumn of this year.  Regarding ratification by Ireland, I believe that it is important to wait to see the benefits of CETA come into being before it is put before the D&aacute;il for ratification.  Then we can have a fully informed, evidence based debate on the value of the Agreement to Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department is already working with our agencies and business representative groups to ensure that Irish firms take early advantage of the terms of the Agreement.  In addition, Minister Breen and Minister Murphy have led sectoral trade missions to Canada this year.  I will also be leading a trade mission to Canada later this month to promote the opportunities provided by the Agreement.</p>  <p>  Earlier this month, the Taoiseach met with Prime Minister Trudeau to discuss the ties between Canada and Ireland including the potential for increased economic and trade links between Ireland and Canada arising from CETA.</p></reply>

We also regularly engage directly with companies regarding concerns they have surrounding the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union.  Our focus remains on taking steps to mitigate the potentially adverse consequences Brexit may have for our economy whilst also ensuring that Ireland is well-placed to capitalise on the opportunities that might emerge. </p>  <p>  The IDA is working hard to convert the interest shown to date by potential investors into investments on the ground here in Ireland.  This process involves engaging with companies, both at home and abroad, in connection with various issues associated with locating or expanding in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Convincing companies to invest here is a delicate process that requires perseverance and patience.

This will provide greater certainty regarding earnings thereby addressing difficulties employees may have in accessing financial credit including mortgages.</p>  <p>  The proposed reference period of 18 months was chosen as it is considered sufficiently long to allow for the normal peaks and troughs of businesses including those subject to seasonal fluctuations.</p>  <p>  The provision will not apply to an employer who has entered into a banded hour arrangement through an agreement by collective bargaining with their employees.</p>  <p>  It is proposed that there will be four bands of hours which will be kept sufficiently wide to allow a degree of flexibility for both employers and employees.  The bands are 1 hour to 10 hours; 11 hours to 24 hours; 25 hours to 34 hours and 35 hours or over.</p>  <p>  I am referring the draft legislation to the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for the Committee to consider and determine if it wishes to engage in pre-legislative scrutiny of the proposed Bill.</p></reply>

This is a whole of Government effort and is delivered through our integrated Action Plan for Jobs.</p>  <p>  Since the first Action Plan for Jobs was launched in early 2012, almost 206,000 more people are at work.  Over 66,000 jobs were created during 2016.  Employment growth is spread across all regions and all sectors of the economy.</p>  <p>  In February, we published the Action Plan for Jobs 2017 which sets out the whole of Government response to secure employment and retain jobs in the face of global uncertainty by strengthening the resilience and agility of our enterprise base.</p>  <p>  In developing the 2017 Plan, I met a wide range of stakeholders including a broad selection of Enterprise Ireland and IDA client companies and the employer representative bodies.  I also expanded the Industry Partners Forum to include a wider sectoral and regional representation.  These meetings with enterprise informed the priorities that I and my Ministerial colleagues are progressing under the 2017 Plan to support further job creation and deliver sustainable enterprise growth in the short to medium term.</p>  <p>  In particular, the 2017 Plan sets out a range of actions to address the immediate and medium term challenges posed by Brexit and the volatility in the global trading and investment environment.  These include measures to drive innovation, grow and scale Irish businesses, diversify our exports, promote entrepreneurship, deliver the skills needs of our growing economy, improve our competitiveness and ensure finance is available at competitive cost to support and underpin growth.</p>  <p>  Accelerating the pace of progress in each region to maximise their job potential has been a  top priority for the Action Plan for Jobs.  In 2015, we launched the Regional Action Plans for Jobs initiative to help each region achieve its economic potential and increase employment.  Each Regional Action Plan has an Implementation Committee that brings together enterprise, third level and other stakeholders from within each region, and senior officials from my Department and I have met with the Committees at various stages over the last year.  I am also engaged in a range of stakeholder and industry consultations as part of my work on Brexit preparedness. </p>  <p>  I am keen that the Department continues to engage in in-depth and frequent dialogue with our stakeholders on a range of policy areas which fall within our remit.  With this in mind, I have established a Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Enterprise Forum on Brexit and global challenges.  This will provide a vehicle for discussion of enterprise, trade and investment policy implications arising from wider global challenges, with a specific focus on Brexit in the first instance. </p>  <p>  In addition to this more structured engagement with enterprise, I am talking to employers across the country every week about the issues of importance to them to grow their businesses and create jobs. </p></reply>

The details supplied relate to ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p><p>Ireland signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and since then, successive Governments have emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are met.  This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention. </p><p>It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.  Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.</p><p>Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights. </p><p>The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.</p><p>The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.<b></b><b></b></p><p>The major issue at this stage is in relation to deprivation of liberty &ndash; in the case of persons in nursing homes for example, whose capacity to consent may be in doubt.  This is a sensitive and important issue and we must get it right.  Unfortunately, it is taking longer than expected to develop a proposal that is constitutionally sound and operationally effective and reasonable.  The Department of Justice and Equality continues to engage with the Department of Health to assist with that work, but there is still some work to be done.</p><p>While Ireland&rsquo;s not having ratified the CRPD is a recurring point of criticism by the UN as well as by domestic civil society and NGOs, it should be noted that in terms of quality of service and the actual position of people with disabilities in society, Ireland is in many respects in advance of other EU states.  This is not to be complacent and we are continuing to take practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.  The Report of the Make Work Pay Group was published in recent weeks and already action, as announced by Minister Harris has been taken on its recommendations.  We have a Comprehensive Employment Strategy in place and 2017 will see positive action measures being taken to support public sector recruitment of people with disabilities.  And very shortly, Government will consider the draft of the new Disability Inclusion Strategy, which I expect to see published in the coming weeks.  It will contain a wide range of practical commitments to improve the position of people with disabilities.</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains a very high priority for me as Minister.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his statutory functions and I as Minister for Justice and Equality have no role in the matter.  Regarding the valuation for rating of bar areas in sporting complexes, historically the premises of sports clubs which were registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904, i.e. clubs licensed to sell alcohol, were rateable in their entirety.  However, the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 introduced a new provision to the Valuation Act 2001 at Schedule 4, paragraph 4B, to provide an exemption from rates in respect of the buildings in such clubs and complexes which are used exclusively for community sport on a not-for-profit basis.  Such buildings would typically include the club's meeting rooms, machinery sheds, equipment storage areas, administrative offices, changing rooms and gymnasia. </p>  <p>  Following this change to the valuation legislation, community sports clubs are now only liable for rates on parts of buildings that are used for the generation of income on a commercial basis.  Consequently, the following parts of a premises of a club registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904 remain rateable:</p>  <p>  (i) any part of the premises used for the sale, or consumption of alcohol on a regular, or occasional, basis;</p>  <p>  (ii) any part of the premises used directly, or indirectly, in the generation of income for the club, or other persons, other than:</p>  <p>  - income derived from club membership fees,</p>  <p>  - community organisations using the building for community purposes;</p>  <p>  - participants in community sport using the building for the purposes of community sport.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the parts of the premises of sporting complexes which would be rateable would include the following:</p>  <p>  - A shop or similar areas reserved for retail or commercial activity;</p>  <p>  - Areas used in conjunction with the storage, preparation, sale or consumption of food such as kitchens, dining areas, function rooms and toilets;</p>  <p>  - Areas used on a regular or occasional basis for the sale, or consumption of alcohol such as bar areas, function rooms, halls, etc.</p>  <p>  - Areas used in connection with the storage of alcohol or other produce for sale on the premises.</p>  <p>  In summary, this effectively means that buildings or part thereof within the sporting complex that are used for the sale of alcohol or food, retail outlets, etc. are rated but buildings used exclusively for community sport are exempt.  If a sport club's only commercial facility is the bar then it is only the bar and ancillary features that are rated.  As a result of this exemption provided for in the Valuation (Amendment) Act, 2015, which became effective on 8 June 2015, I understand that the Valuation Office has been revising the valuations of registered sports club premises to ensure that only the commercial part of such premises are rateable and that buildings used exclusively for community sport are exempt.  Any sports club which is registered under the 1904 Act, and has not yet had its valuation revised to take advantage of the new exemption, may apply to the Valuation Office for a revision of the valuation.  The application may be made using the specified form which is available on the Valuation Office's website, www.valoff.ie.</p></reply>

Under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, any person found guilty of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation shall be liable to imprisonment for a period up to life.  It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 was enacted on 22 February 2017.  Part 4 of the Act provides for two new offences of purchasing sexual services, in the context of prostitution.  The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.  The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, in the context of prostitution, and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not commit an offence. </p>  <p>  These new offences implement the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.  Both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have recognised the effectiveness of the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services as a tool in the fight against human trafficking.</p>  <p>  These provisions were commenced with effect from 27 March 2017.</p></reply>

Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner, that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014,  981 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 50 of whom were assigned to the Kildare Division.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation, including the Kildare Division. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the following table the strength of the Kildare Division for the years 2011 to 2016 and up to 31 March 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, as provided by the Commissioner. </p><p><b>Strength of Kildare  Division 2011-2017</b><table><tr><th>Total</th><th>Year</th></tr><tr><td>318</td><td>2011</td></tr><tr><td>318</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>315</td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>301</td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>312</td><td>2015</td></tr><tr><td>316</td><td>2016</td></tr><tr><td>323</td><td>2017</td></tr></table>*As of 31 March 2017</p></reply>

Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State.  A breakdown of how this 4,000 will be taken in across the various mechanisms through which the programme is being delivered can be found in Table 1.  </p><p><b><i>Table 1: Table of Total Numbers under Government Decision on the IRPP</i></b><table><tr><th>Relocation Strand</th><th>Numbers</th></tr><tr><td>Council Decision 2015/1523</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Council Decision 2015/1601</td><td>2,022* </td></tr><tr><td>Total Relocation</td><td>2,622</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Resettlement Strand</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 09/06/15</td><td>520</td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 06/07/16</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 29/11/16</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>Total Resettlement</td><td>1,040</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total Unaccompanied Minors Calais (Government Decision 10/11/16)</td><td>200 (up to)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mechanism as yet undecided</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>4000</td></tr></table><i>*Of the total of 2,022 under Council Decision 2015/1601 - 910 have yet to be assigned to either Italy or Greece by the EU Commission.  </i></p><p><b><i>Arrivals to date </i></b></p><p>As of the 15 May 2017, the numbers of persons that have arrived under both the programme refugee resettlement strand and the relocated asylum seeker strands of the programme are set out in Table 2 and Table 3 respectively.</p><p><b><i>Table 2: Resettlement Programme Refugees</i></b><table><tr><th>Total People</th><th>Adults</th><th>Minors</th><th>Age 0-4</th><th>Age 5-12</th><th>Age 13-17</th></tr><tr><td>779</td><td>362</td><td>417</td><td>120</td><td>230</td><td>67</td></tr></table></p><p><b><i>Table 3: Relocated Asylum Seekers</i></b><table><tr><th>Total People</th><th>Adults</th><th>Minors</th><th>Age 0-4</th><th>Age 5-12</th><th>Age 13-17</th></tr><tr><td>459</td><td>274</td><td>185</td><td>70</td><td>82</td><td>33</td></tr></table></p><p>Further numbers will of course arrive under the relocation programme over the coming months.  Full details on the two primary strands of the programme are set out as follows for the information of the Deputy.</p><p>Of the 1,259 people who have arrived thus far under the  IRPP (including unaccompanied minors), a total of 543 persons are now living in the community in various locations nationwide.  It is expected that in the region of another 100 people will be housed within the community by the end of June 2017.  IRPP officials are working closely with local authorities across the State and the Irish Red Cross to secure appropriate accommodation for those currently in emergency accommodation and all future arrivals.  </p><p><b><i>Resettlement strand of the programme</i></b></p><p>Taking account of the situation in the Middle East, and the plight of the refugees, the T&aacute;naiste announced that Ireland would accept 520 persons for resettlement over an 18-month period to the end of 2017.  This was almost double the figure proposed for Ireland by the European Commission and was delivered a year ahead of the Commission deadline.</p><p>In addition, the Government announced last year that it was extending the resettlement programme to take in a further two groups of 260 refugees (520 in total) from Lebanon in 2017, most of whom are expected to be of Syrian origin.  The first group of 260 have already arrived following a selection mission last October and a further mission to Beirut in late March/early April this year selected sufficient numbers to ensure the overall total of 1,040 is reached by the end of 2017. </p><p><b><i>Relocation strand of the programme</i></b></p><p>Despite initial delays outside of Ireland's control in respect of the operation of the 'hotspots' on the ground in Greece, Ireland has to-date taken in a total of 459 people from Greece under relocation.  A monthly schedule has been agreed with the Greek authorities which will sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its initial commitments to Greece within the time frame envisaged by the Programme. </p><p>Ireland has agreed to take up to 20 unaccompanied minors (UAMs) under the relocation aspects of the IRPP.  Fundamentally, Ireland's capacity to take UAMs is determined by Tusla, the child and family agency.  6 UAMs (by the Irish definition) have arrived in Ireland from Greece under the programme.  However, relatively few UAMs appear to be available within the cohort eligible for relocation and efforts continue to seek further transfers within this cohort.  All UAMs that have arrived to-date are in the care of Tusla. </p><p>As regards Italy, the relocation mechanism from Italy to Ireland has yet to commence due to issues with the Italian authorities surrounding the security assessment of migrants assigned to other Member States.  Intensive efforts are ongoing to resolve this, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level, including through the European Commission.</p><p>The total target for relocation EU-wide in the two Council Decisions for relocation also includes an unallocated portion which in the case of Ireland amounts to  910 persons.  These numbers have not yet been allocated as between Greece and Italy.  It is understood that the European Commission are examining allocating this &quot;unassigned&quot; portion and if they do Ireland will immediately work towards relocating them. </p><p><b><i>Calais Unaccompanied Minors</i></b></p><p>In a further gesture of humanitarian assistance towards the most vulnerable caught up in the migration crisis and following a debate in the D&aacute;il, the Government also committed to taking up to 200 additional unaccompanied minors (UAMs) from France who were previously resident in the migrant camp at Calais.  The Child and Family Agency, Tusla, which provides welfare and protection services for unaccompanied minors who enter the State, comes under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Dr. Katherine Zappone TD.  I understand that  21 young persons have been relocated to this jurisdiction to-date, 19 of whom are currently in the care of Tusla and 2 of whom have been reunited with family.  </p><p>Following the Dail resolution on unaccompanied minors who were previously in unofficial camps near Calais, Minister Zappone asked Tusla to put in place the supports needed to coordinate its role in this effort.  Tusla launched the Calais Special Project (CSP) and this is being led operationally by their separated children's team.  I would note that Tusla&rsquo;s separated children team also care for unaccompanied minors who arrive on their own and those that are being relocated under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. </p><p>The French authorities have provided assistance in meeting with young persons who were previously in unofficial camps near Calais and have an interest in relocating to Ireland.  Tusla officials and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carry out the interviews with the young persons to minimise the time required and any unnecessary duplication of effort.  Officials of my Department coordinate with colleagues in Tusla in relation to immigration matters, ensuring that the unaccompanied minors arriving in the State meet the terms of the D&aacute;il motion, transit seamlessly through their port of entry and receive refugee status.  Further information on the operation of this initiative can be obtained from Tusla or my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Dr. Katherine Zappone TD.</p><p>The above initiatives therefore leave just a small residual balance to be allocated from the Government decision to take 4,000 persons.  </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that there are many moving parts to such a programme given the large number of state bodies and non-governmental organisations and agencies involved at both national and international level and not all aspects are entirely within the control of my officials.  Overseeing a programme that touches on virtually all aspects of the lives of 4,000 vulnerable people is also a hugely labour intensive operation.  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that everything that can be done within my Department to ensure the Government's meets its humanitarian undertakings under the programme is being done.</p></reply>

Accordingly, decisions in relation to the provision and allocation of Garda resources and the training of Garda members and civilian staff are matters for the Garda Commissioner and, as Minister, I have no direct role in relation to these matters.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s overarching commitment is to ensure a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  In furtherance of this, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300, and in this regard I was pleased to be able to launch a new recruitment campaign for Reserve members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recently.  </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, which takes on board the key findings of various reports into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and expert groups, amongst others, is being implemented.  The Programme is intended to professionalise, modernise and renew An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that the organisation can meet present and future challenges and includes an emphasis on the development of all members and staff to ensure that they will receive the training, mentoring and leadership development that they require to continue to develop their skills, to perform more effectively in their roles and progress their careers. </p><p>In addition, the Government has committed to significant investment of some &euro;330 million in Garda ICT infrastructure, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, between 2016 and 2021.  This investment will enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime and will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to provide effective policing services in response to the evolving challenges of modern day criminal activity, including fraud.  I am informed that, the Garda authorities are continually looking to ensure that the latest information, communications and forensic technologies are sourced and deployed to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be properly resourced to meet the evolving needs of a modern effective police force and to take advantage of proven up to date technological developments in crime detection and prevention as they occur. </p><p>The Deputy will, of course, be aware that there have also been a number of significant developments in our legislative framework in recent years targeting crimes of fraud.  For example, the Criminal Justice Act 2011 targets specified serious and complex offences, including offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud and corruption.  It provides for procedures to facilitate Garda access to essential information and documentation to assist in investigations.  In addition, Part 5 of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 makes provision for the selection of up to 15 jurors to serve in a criminal trial which is likely to last more than 2 months, with 12 jurors to be selected to consider the verdict.  These provisions are of relevance to lengthy trials involving fraud or other complex financial matters where there is a risk of jurors becoming unavailable during the course of a protracted trial. </p><p>In terms of forthcoming legislation, the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010 will be replaced by the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill which will replace and update the offences of giving and receiving bribes contained in existing legislation.  The Bill will also enhance the ability of the DPP to bring prosecutions by providing for presumptions of corrupt gifts or payments and it will provide for penalties of up to 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment and unlimited fines for persons convicted on indictment.</p><p>In addition, the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill<b></b>was approved by Government in December 2016.  The Bill will give effect to provisions contained in the Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive which has the aim of strengthening laws in the EU to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. </p><p>While my Department has responsibility for legislation addressing some aspects of white collar crime including fraud and corruption, other aspects, such as insider trading, Companies Acts offences and environmental offences, fall within the responsibility of other Government Departments.  Other relevant legislative enhancements in recent years include the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, the Companies Act 2014 and more broadly the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. </p><p>The breadth and diversity of the issues connected with this form of crime are such that no one piece of legislation could effectively address all of them and therefore legislation in this area is continuously under review and development.  Further developments in this area will be assisted by the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s 2016 issues paper in relation to Regulatory Enforcement and Corporate Offences.  Among the issues under consideration by the Commission will be whether the supervisory and enforcement powers of the State's main financial and economic regulators (such as the Central Bank, ComReg, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Director of Corporate Enforcement) are adequate or need to be supplemented by, for example, civil financial sanctions and more effective co-ordination between such regulators.  In addition, the Commission will consider whether there are gaps in the criminal law, particularly in relation to fraud, that need to be filled in order to respond more effectively to serious wrongdoing by corporate bodies, and whether there is a case for introducing an offence of reckless trading.</p><p>Finally, I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop strategies, working closely with other bodies with relevant enforcement functions, aimed at targeting, dismantling and disrupting criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodology.</p></reply>

In their initial consultation, (pre-questionnaire stage) the applicant is informed of the Permission to Remain (PTR) procedure.  This includes the potential for consideration of an application for PTR contemporaneously with their application for asylum/subsidiary protection.  They are also informed of their ongoing obligation to inform me of any changes in circumstances that might affect their application; and of the 5 day statutory period following receipt of the International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT) decision to file further PTR submissions before final review by me. </p>  <p>  If the International Protection Office (IPO) issues a negative recommendation to the client, it is reviewed by the Legal Aid Board solicitor who will then take the client&rsquo;s instructions.  If the client is not appealing the recommendation, a letter will issue to them advising that the case is now completed.  Should the IPAT affirm the negative recommendation, the client will be advised again of the statutory time-limit for reviewing the decision.  Where requested by the client, a review will be initiated by the solicitor.</p>  <p>  If a client has been served with a Deportation Order, the Legal Aid Board solicitor will write to them explaining its implications.  They will be offered an appointment if the solicitor considers it appropriate and necessary.  The solicitor will then review the considerations and, if they are of the view that there are no grounds for challenging the Deportation Order:</p>  <p>  - The client will be informed in writing;</p>  <p>  - The client will be advised of the possibility of obtaining a second opinion privately, and</p>  <p>  - The client will be advised that their file will be closed after the reporting date has passed.</p>  <p>  If the solicitor is of the view that there are legal grounds to challenge the Deportation Order, the client will be advised on the options of seeking a revocation or instituting judicial review proceedings.  If considered appropriate by the legal representative, they may submit written representations to me setting out the reasons as to why the Deportation Order should be revoked.</p>  <p>  Where it is considered that the decision to issue a Deportation Order is flawed and merits the institution of Judicial Review proceedings, that possibility will be investigated by the Legal Aid Board solicitor and the client will advised as to their options.</p></reply>

I understand that the draft report was sent to all interested parties for their observations before being finalised.  A copy of the final Report was received by my Department from the Garda Commissioner on 27 March 2017. </p>  <p>  As you will be aware I have indicated publicly my concern at the findings of the Interim Internal Audit Report.  As you will also be aware the Public Accounts Committee is examining the Commissioner in relation to the Interim Audit Report and intends to resume that examination in the coming weeks, and will report subsequently.  Very particular responsibilities lie with Accounting Officers and you will appreciate that I must be careful not to interfere in any way with the work of that Committee.  I can assure you that I will pay very careful attention to the  proceedings at the Committee and, in particular, any report they may make.  If action is required on my part as a result, I will not hesitate to take it.</p>  <p>  While, of course, there has to be accountability in relation to what went on at the College, the immediate priority has to be ensuring the problems identified in the audit are resolved.  I have been assured that the Garda Authorities recognise the gravity of the issues raised and that they are taking comprehensive steps to progress the recommendations in the Report.  External governance expertise and auditors have been engaged.  A Steering Committee, chaired by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Chief Administrative Officer and including a representative from my Department, is overseeing the implementation of the recommendations.  In addition, upon receipt of the report I referred it to the Policing Authority to oversee the implementation of the recommendations and to report back to me each quarter.  I expect the Authority  to submit its first report to me in July.  </p>  <p>  It is the case that section 41 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act places a requirement on the Garda Commissioner to report certain matters to me.  In practice it is a matter for the judgement of the Commissioner as to when to make reports specifically citing that section of the Act.  It is not just a question of legal judgement - it is a question of determining whether a particular set of circumstances fall within the criteria set out in the Act.  There are issues too about at what stage a Commissioner might consider it appropriate to make such a report.  Most contacts between me, my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do not involve specifically citing that legal provision.  So I would simply say that whether a report is made in relation to particular circumstances and when it might be made is clearly not a straightforward issue.  It is worth making the point too that simply informing me of a particular matter does not, of itself, resolve any issue.  Equally, the fact that I might not be informed of an issue under section 41 does not prevent the necessary action being taken to address the issue.  </p></reply>

This has been achieved by a review of business processes within the office and an extra Executive Officer and Higher Executive Officer being assigned to the office.

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>- be without one or both legs;</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p><p>The Scheme and qualifying criteria were designed specifically for those with severe physical disabilities and are, therefore, necessarily precise.  </p><p>The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the fuel grant, the scheme is estimated to have cost of the order of &euro;65m in 2016.  This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p><p>I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities.  I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

These include the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme referred to above, the Blind Person&rsquo;s Tax Credit, the Incapacitated Child Credit and the Dependent Relative Tax Credit.  Relief from tax is also available in relation to the costs incurred in employing persons to care for incapacitated individuals and the cost of medical expenses.  Certain exemptions from Income Tax may also be available depending on the individual&rsquo;s circumstances, for example lump sum payments can be exempt from tax where paid by an employer because of injury or disability.</p><p>More detailed information on these types of measures is available in the Revenue Leaflet IT12, which provides a guide to taxation for those with disabilities.  This is available from the Revenue website at </p><p>Furthermore, it is my view that the tax system, which has as its primary function the collection of tax revenues to fund public expenditure, is not the most appropriate route through which to provide such supports as proposed by the Deputy.  The tax system is limited in its ability to provide supports, as tax measures can only benefit those whose incomes are high enough to pay tax and thus benefit from any additional tax credit or relief.  Direct expenditure measures can have a wider reach than taxation measures, and it is for this reason that direct expenditure is the main route through which assistance and services are provided by the State to individuals affected by disability.</p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that taxpayers are choosing different channels to 'walk-in' services and are getting the information and assistance they require in a way that better meets their needs.</p>  <p>  In this regard, Revenue introduced an appointments service in a number of public offices in 2015 and 2016, including Dundalk from December 2016.  The provision of an appointments service at the Dundalk office provides a further improvement in Revenue's service to taxpayers.  It enables taxpayers to arrange attendance at a time when they can be certain of a speedy service and removes the need for queuing. </p>  <p>  Revenue offers a range of service channels to support taxpayers to comply voluntarily with their tax and duty obligations.  Revenue continues to enhance its service offering and, in particular, the channels through which their customers can obtain information and/or engage with it.  Revenue will shortly launch a substantially revamped website that will, inter alia, better meet the needs of taxpayers for clear and easy to understand information.</p>  <p>  Many taxpayers prefer to do business online and at a time of their convenience.  To meet that need, Revenue has in place modern, high-quality, accessible and user-friendly online services for taxpayers to manage their tax affairs at a time that best suits each taxpayer.  Revenue continues to enhance those services as evidenced by recent on-line developments that include the facility for PAYE customers to file their tax returns online; the 'myaccount' service, eTax Clearance and the 'MyEnquiries' secure online enquiry facility.  Additional developments are in the pipeline.  This is supported by, for example, the introduction of a new Business Taxes service and consistent opening hours across the telephone services giving greater certainty for taxpayers.</p></reply>

This resource was allocated in accordance with pupil enrolment.  42% of second-level schools at the time were allocated at least 22 hours per week in respect of guidance (22 hours being the equivalent of one teaching post) while the remainder of the schools were allocated between 8 and 17 hours of guidance per week.</p>  <p>  Since September 2012 at post primary level guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation.  Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students.  This operates at local school level and therefore the information requested by the Deputy on the number of guidance counsellors in post primary schools is not available centrally within my Department. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Education 2016-2019  has a specific action to enhance guidance counselling at second-level as resources permit.  A significant move was made in the 2016/17 school year with the restoration of half of the cut in provision for guidance counselling.  This was equivalent to the restoration of 300 posts.</p>  <p>  The allocation of a whole time equivalent of an additional 100 teachers to second level schools in Budget 2017 is a restoration of a further 16% of the teaching resources that were removed.</p>  <p>  The delivery of this 16% restoration in addition to the 50% restoration in Budget 2016, means that two thirds of the Guidance allocation that was withdrawn in Budget 2012 will be restored in our schools with effect from September 2017.  </p>  <p>  The 400 posts will be provided in respect of Guidance as a separate allocation on school's staffing schedules from September 2017.  The guidance allocation shown separately on the staffing schedules represents 0.4 of the PTR for each school.  DEIS schools will have a guidance allocation of 1.15 of the PTR which represents the total guidance allocation that was restored to these schools.</p></reply>

In restoring capitation payments, where schools have introduced these cost effective principles, they will receive a premium capitation payment. </p><p>I believe that full transparency in relation to the use of any voluntary contributions is important information for parents to have.  The Parent and Student Charter will require every school to set out a financial statement, which will include information on how any voluntary contributions are used.</p><p>This is part of a suite of measures I am introducing, including the School Admissions Bill which will reform information and procedures around the process of school enrolment, and the commencement of Fitness to Teach, which allow a complaint to be made about a registered teacher to the Teaching to Council for the first time.</p><p>Circular letter 32/2017 &lsquo;Measures to be adopted by schools to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs&rsquo; was published at the end of April and is available on my Departments website.</p><p>Following the implementation of the circular, school authorities will be required to adopt the following principles of cost-effective practice which will put a greater emphasis on reducing the cost of school uniforms and other costs:</p><p>- All elements of a school uniform should be purchasable from various stores;</p><p>- Only iron on or sew on crests should be used;</p><p>- Wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.);</p><p>- Provide parents with a list of all required items and indicate the likely costs of these required items at best value stores;</p><p>- Provide a book rental scheme;</p><p>- Phase out, between now and September 2018, the use of workbooks which cannot be reused;</p><p>- Where an exclusive supply arrangement applies, it should be tendered for regularly and</p><p>- The Board of Management in each school will have to review the cost of items which they require parents to purchase and to make this information available to the school community.</p><p>Schools will consult with parents on their views and ask for suggestions on cost reduction initiatives.  Parents will be asked for their views about school uniform costs, and other costs, through a questionnaire.</p><p>In relation to workbooks, the Circular advises that schools should phase out, between now and September 2018, the use of workbooks which cannot be reused. </p><p>My Department is very aware of the appropriate contribution that well-designed learning activities can make in the classroom.  Resources that align well with the learning objectives of the curriculum (including workbook tasks) and which foster development of key skills and concepts are an important support for classroom learning and teaching and can help to consolidate students&rsquo; understanding. </p><p>Used skilfully, such activities can provide the teacher with valuable opportunities to promote independent learning; and for learners they can facilitate completion of differentiated activities or tasks at a number of levels.  When these kinds of activities are integrated well into classroom teaching and learning, they can provide rich learning opportunities especially when combined with focussed classroom talk and discussion.  By contrast, the negative uses of workbooks have also been highlighted in inspection reports, and appropriate recommendations made, in that regard, to schools and teachers. </p><p>My Department is committed to working with the Irish Educational Publisher&rsquo;s Association to ensure that progress can be made on developing workbooks that can be reused.</p><p>The Circular provides a period, between now and September 2018, for the phasing out of workbooks which cannot be reused.</p><p>My Department supports for the provision of school books are dealt with through the school book rental scheme.  My Department provides funding of &euro;16m annually to schools to support the operation of school book rental schemes for students in all recognised Primary and Post-Primary schools within the Free Education Scheme.  The arrangements in relation to this scheme are set out in Circular 0046/2013 which is published on my Department's website at .</p></reply>

The Stay Safe Programme was developed by a group called the Child Abuse Prevention Programme and a framework of CPD support is currently being rolled out.  The Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Framework which PDST has developed in this regard includes support for both the revised Stay Safe programme and the revised Walk Tall materials for primary schools.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that this programme of support is now well underway and I am satisfied that the necessary resources are available to PDST to implement the CPD Framework.  The costs associated with both the CPD and the suite of support material available to schools are met by my Department and are not allocated to schools.  </p>  <p>  The programme of work associated with the Stay Safe programme is funded as part of the overall PDST Health and Wellbeing budget which has an overall allocation for 2017 of almost &euro;1.8m, including personnel costs.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also providing funding through the PDST Wellbeing budget  for child protection training.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Children First Act 2015 will, when fully commenced by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, put elements of the Children First-National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children on a statutory footing.  The commencement of the 2015 Act will result in the publication of a new Children First which in turn will necessitate changes to the existing Child Protection Procedures for schools.  The 2015 Act also provides that Tusla will issue guidance in relation to the Act&rsquo;s requirements in respect of Child Safeguarding Statements.  </p>  <p>  My Department has commenced a review of the existing child protection procedures for schools in consultation with the relevant education partners.  This  review will take account of the statutory provisions of the Children First Act 2015 and, when available, the updated Children First and guidance on child safeguarding published by Tusla in accordance with the Act.  </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s training on child protection will in turn be updated to take account of the new procedures for schools.</p></reply>

There is no maximum limit on the capitation grant.</p>  <p>  In 2017, the capitation grant is &euro;170 per pupil and the ancillary services Grant is &euro;158 per pupil.  The 500 pupil cap on ancillary grant equates to a maximum grant of &euro;79,000.  Within the context of limitations on available resources, this funding of &euro;79,000 is considered a reasonable amount to cater for the secretarial and caretaking needs of a large school.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that schools have the flexibility to use capitation funding provided for general running costs and ancillary funding provided for caretaking and secretarial services as a common grant which is outlined in Circular 40/2009.</p></reply>

The HEA allocates this funding to the institutions and the internal disbursement of funding is then a matter for the individual institution.  Core funding is driven primarily by student numbers, either via the Recurrent Grant Allocation Model which is the mechanism used by the HEA to allocate funding or 'free fees' funding.  </p>  <p>  Higher Education Institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day to day affairs, including the allocation of all of its income (both public and private) and for the provision of courses at the institution.  </p>  <p>  My Department and the HEA recognise the particular challenges attached to multi-campus provision in both GMIT and other institutes of technology.  The HEA has begun a major review of the funding allocation model for higher education and this review will include looking at how the future model can take account of the additional costs associated with such arrangements.  The Department and the HEA are committed to such multi-campus provision, including Castlebar.  </p>  <p>  My Department and I along with the HEA and GMIT Governing Body are fully committed to and are in the process of establishing and implementing a viable development plan for the continuance of the GMIT Castlebar campus.  GMIT has appointed an Interim Head of the campus in Castlebar to lead this process.  This will include looking at the future development of the Mayo Campus as a Centre of Excellence in Health Sciences.  </p>  <p>  In addition, Taoiseach Enda Kenny, TD, and I recently announced the establishment of a working group which will formulate a plan for a sustainable future of the GMIT Mayo Campus in Castlebar.  The Working Group will be required to present a full report to the HEA&rsquo;s Finance Committee in Q3 2017.  The Mayo Campus has a very important role to play in delivering economic growth and driving regional development.  That is why the Working Group will be engaging with the Local Enterprise Office, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, as well as the Implementation Committee of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs West which is charged with overseeing the delivery of 25,000 jobs across Mayo, Roscommon and Galway over the lifetime of the Plan.  GMIT is also represented on the Atlantic Economic Corridor Steering Group, which is a key part of the Action Plan on Rural Development.  </p></reply>

The L1 (Language 1, in Irish, Teanga 1) specification is targeted at students in Irish-medium schools and students in English-medium schools who learn one or more subjects (apart from Irish) through the medium of Irish.  The L2 (Language 2, Teanga 2) specification is targeted at other students in English-medium schools.  </p><p>The new Junior Cycle specifications for Irish (both L1 and L2) have a strong emphasis on oral language.  This is particularly highlighted in the main strand of the specifications &ndash; Communicative Competence.  This strand places an enhanced emphasis on Irish as the language of learning and communication in classrooms as well as an emphasis on the skills required to communicate effectively with other users of the language.  Communication, opportunities for use and interaction are central to classroom tasks.  </p><p>A different type of assessment methodology for oral language skills (and other skills) will be used in the new Junior Cycle Irish specification.  Up to now, there was an<b></b>optiona<b>l</b>oral language test, taken by a minority of students, and generally assessed by their teachers as part of the old Junior Certificate examination.  Now, as part of the new Junior Cycle Irish specifications, the oral language skills of all students<b></b>will be formally assessed.  This will be done by means of two Classroom-Based Assessments (CBAs) which will be reported by schools to parents at the end of third year in the Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement (JCPA).  </p><p>Under the Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022 published by my Department, schools in the Gaeltacht are being invited to seek recognition as a Gaeltacht school in accordance with language-based criteria.  To achieve Gaeltacht school recognition, schools will have the opportunity to work towards educational provision entirely through the medium of Irish (apart from the English and other language curricula) over the timeline of this five-year Policy.  One of the language criteria for second-level schools includes a requirement to implement the L1 Irish specifications at junior cycle and encourage their uptake by students, particularly native speakers of Irish.

Details of the special education teaching allocations have also been published on the NCSE website.  </p>  <p>  The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children.  </p>  <p>  No school, including the school to which the Deputy has referred, will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  </p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011.  </p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government.  The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular school referred to by the Deputy, this school had a Learning Support allocation of 19.8 hours for the 2016/17 school year, which combined with 28.73 resource teaching hours allocated to the school by the National Council for Special Education, gave a total allocation to the school of 48.53 additional teaching hours for the 2016/17 school year.  </p>  <p>  As the profiled allocation for the school did not indicate an increased allocation requirement for the school for 2017/18, the school has maintained its existing level of allocation.  </p>  <p>  The special education teaching allocation for this school for 2017/18 is 48.53 hours.  </p>  <p>  There has therefore been no reduction to the special education teaching allocation for this school.</p></reply>

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.</p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. </p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO in September 2016 will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4,600 and &euro;6,700) for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  The pay increases for new teachers were also available to ASTI members under the proposals which members recently balloted on.</p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.  </p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  Further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay across the public service will be informed by the recently published analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. </p>  <p>  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of future public service pay talks.  Indeed, negotiations on a successor agreement to Lansdowne Road will shortly get under way.</p></reply>

The recent Budget contained measures to deliver on this.</p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO in September will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4,600 and &euro;6,700) for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  The pay increases for new teachers were also available to ASTI members under the proposals which members recently balloted on.</p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  Further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay across the Public Service will be informed by the recently published analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission.</p>  <p>  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of future public service pay talks.  Indeed, negotiations on a successor agreement to Lansdowne Road will shortly get under way.</p>  <p>  The Framework for Junior Cycle gives students the opportunity to develop a wider range of knowledge and skills &ndash; to equip them for further learning, for work, for responsible and active citizenship, and for healthy living.  It gives students better learning opportunities, and rewards and recognises non-academic performance and achievements, with a central focus on the student&rsquo;s quality of life, well-being and mental health.  The new junior cycle has been developed on a partnership approach, involving teachers, their unions and many wider interests over a considerable period of time.  The new approach draws on the best available international research evidence in order to ensure the best possible learning experience for students at this vital stage of their development.  The written exam for English this year has been reduced from a 5 hour exam to a 2 hour exam.  This reflects the move to a dual approach to assessment.  The Classroom Based Assessments have been introduced to allow students to show their understanding of skills and concepts that would not be possible in an externally assessed examination.  This dual approach reduces the focus on one terminal examination and increases the prominence given to classroom-based assessment.  This change of emphasis enables teachers to provide really meaningful feedback that helps students to understand how their learning can be improved.</p>  <p>  The level of challenge for, and the learning requirement on, students remains at least the same as it currently is.  The Junior Cycle builds on existing good practice in teaching and learning.  The subject specifications set out very clearly the learning outcomes to be achieved by students.  Students will have opportunities to both acquire and apply knowledge and skills.  They will be able to demonstrate their understanding of concepts and skills through both ongoing assessment activities and terminal examination.</p>  <p>  Concern relating to the new Junior Cycle English examination has arisen on foot of many students&rsquo; experience of the mock examination which they undertook in their schools in January/February of this year.  Mock examinations in Ireland are sourced by schools from a number of commercial suppliers nationally.  The State Examinations Commission (SEC) has no role in producing mock examination papers.</p>  <p>  The Croke Park hours are part of wider productivity measures introduced under the Public Service Agreements that require all public servants to work additional time for no additional payment. </p>  <p>  The Croke Park hours represent a real reform with significant benefits for parents and children.  In schools, the Croke Park hours are 33 additional hours a year at post primary (36 hours at primary) worked by teachers.  They are a valuable resource within the school system which allow certain essential activities involving the entire teaching staff or groups of teachers to take place.  These include staff meetings, parent-teacher meetings, school planning, subject planning and mandated Continuous Professional Development.</p>  <p>  Before the Croke Park hours were introduced, these activities ate into tuition time.  This meant that schools closed for full days or half days in order to carry them out, causing interruption to tuition and significant inconvenience for parents, as well as child care costs &ndash; particularly for primary parents.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that many public servants committed significantly more hours than this under the public service agreements.  Across the public services &ndash; education, health, local authorities, civil service etc. - the additional time being provided represents about 450,000 additional hours per annum or the equivalent of between 12,000 and 13,000 public service posts.  That is a serious productivity benefit for the Exchequer.  Replacing those hours would cost hundreds of millions of euro.</p>  <p>  In response to concerns expressed by teacher trade unions regarding the use of the Croke Park hours, my Department agreed with TUI and INTO to carry out a review of their usage under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  This review, which also involves the school management bodies is now under way and will have regard to teacher professional judgement, system and school requirements and experience to date of best practice in the use of the hours.</p>  <p>  The review provides for an up-front increase in the quantum of time allowed for planning and development work on other than a whole-school basis.  The original Croke Park Agreement provided that all Croke Park hours (36 for primary and 33 for post-primary annually) would be worked on a whole-school basis.  The Haddington Road Agreement provided that up to 5 of the hours could be worked on a less than whole-school basis (e.g. small groups of subject teachers).  The recent agreement increases this maximum to 8 hours in September 2016 and 10 hours in September 2017.</p></reply>

The person&rsquo;s application was unsuccessful.</p>  <p>  The statutory basis for ill health retirement pension benefits for members is contained in the Secondary, Community and Comprehensive School Teachers Pension Scheme 2009.  The award of ill-health retirement pension is based on the scheme criteria that the scheme member is incapable by reason of infirmity of mind or body of discharging his or her duties as a teacher and that infirmity is likely to be permanent.</p>  <p>  Entitlement to retire with a pension on grounds of permanent ill-health is not automatic.  When a person makes application for retirement on medical grounds s/he must submit medical evidence from the person&rsquo;s treating medical advisor for consideration by the Occupational Health Service.  The Occupational Health Service provider makes a recommendation as to whether or not the teacher is incapable by reason of infirmity of mind or body of discharging his/her duties as a teacher where that infirmity is likely to be permanent.  The Occupational Health Service Provider (as contracted by the Department) is the sole recognised provider of independent medical advice for teachers and employers.  The OHS provider, is staffed by Occupational Health Specialist Physicians with post- graduate qualifications in occupational health.  Following receipt of the recommendation of the Occupational Health Physician, the Department makes a decision to approve or reject the application in accordance with the provisions of the pension scheme.  Where an applicant is unsuccessful there is provision for an appeal and details regarding the appeal process are advised to an applicant when s/he is notified that his/her application has not been successful.</p>  <p>  Where a significant deterioration in the medical condition of a scheme member occurs and all reasonable treatments have been exhausted, it is open to a scheme member while in service to make a fresh application after a period of one year has elapsed from the date of notification of the refusal of the earlier appeal.  Any fresh application will be considered in accordance with the procedures in place. </p>  <p>  A teacher who does not satisfy the medical criteria for retirement on ill-health pension, but who is considering retirement, may avail of Cost Neutral Early Retirement where s/he has reached aged 50 years and has un-interrupted service from before 1 April 2004.  Pension and lump sum, both actuarially reduced, are payable effective from the date of retirement.</p></reply>

This change is consistent with recommendations of NCSE reports and the review of the VTSVHI.</p>  <p>  The Service will provide advice and support to schools on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, including children on the autism spectrum.  It will provide in-school support for support teachers, continuing professional development for teachers, and support to schools on the management of challenging behaviour.  It will also enhance the multi-disciplinary capacity of the education system by providing access to expert knowledge in areas such as autism, speech and language and challenging behaviour.</p>  <p>  The NCSE&rsquo;s reports also recommended that this Service should be used to provide immediate assistance to schools in unplanned and exceptional circumstances, where this is indicated. </p>  <p>  The service will have a close relationship with NCSE Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), who will be able to indicate where supports are most needed for schools. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note also that my Department annually funds post-graduate programmes for approximately 400 teachers involved in Learning Support and special education.  There are places on these programmes specifically for teachers of students on the autism spectrum.</p></reply>

Substantial work is already taking place in schools to support students&rsquo; wellbeing.  The Junior Cycle Wellbeing programme will require that 300 hours are allocated to wellbeing from 2017, and from 2020, this will increase to 400 hours. </p>  <p>  I am quite satisfied that this will not impact negatively on the time available for other subjects. </p>  <p>  This is because wellbeing is built on a number of pillars, which include subjects already offered.  These are CSPE, PE and SPHE. Together, these three existing curriculum inputs already contribute 275 hours of the 300 hours which schools are required to allocate to wellbeing from next September.  There are a range of options available to schools in determining how to meet the other 25 hours in the coming year, and the additional 100 hours required in 2020. </p>  <p>  For instance, across the curriculum, a school can identify a number of elements of learning in other subjects (beyond CSPE, PE, SPHE and guidance-related learning) which relate to wellbeing.  A school may also opt to include once-off whole-school events, as part of its provision for wellbeing, including for example, a healthy eating week.  This would reflect the whole-school approach to wellbeing as advocated in the guidelines.  Chapter 4 of the Guidelines for Wellbeing in Junior Cycle provides information for schools on possible options. </p>  <p>   The Junior Cycle subject specifications and syllabuses developed by the NCCA set out the minimum time to be allocated to subjects.  The development of these specifications was informed by extensive consultation and engagement with stakeholders.  It is important to note that these are minimum time allocations. </p>  <p>  Subject to meeting the minimum thresholds, schools have flexibility in allocating time to subjects.  Through a process of consultation, individual schools should consider the local context and students&rsquo; learning needs and interests, when decisions regarding timetabling are being made.  In effect this enables schools to allocate time in excess of the minimum to subjects, if it deems that this is appropriate in meeting students&rsquo; needs, and in the context of the full programme provided.</p></reply>

This is in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, the SEA Directive.  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process. </p>  <p>  In light of the SEA requirement, it is likely that while the proposals for revisions to the Guidelines will be available shortly, the Guidelines will not be finalised and come into effect until the end of the year.  In the meantime, the current Guidelines remain in force.</p>  <p>  When finalised revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts. </p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.</p>  <p>  Local authorities adopted the fourth and current round of TAPs in April 2014, with the five-year rolling programmes running from 2014 to 2018.  These programmes provide a road map for local authority investment priorities over the period.  They also form the basis for the allocation of funding from my Department for Traveller accommodation.</p>  <p>  Local authorities submit proposals for individual Traveller-specific projects and developments which are assessed on a case-by-case basis in my Department, in advance of allocations being made.  The allocations and recoupment profiles for capital Traveller accommodation projects can vary across local authorities given the local priorities, circumstances and project timelines as set out in the TAPs.  Funding is recouped to local authorities on eligible expenditure incurred and, where it is likely that an allocation to a local authority may be unspent or under-spent, my Department engages with local authorities to re-allocate the funding to another scheme in order to try to ensure that drawdown is maximised before year-end.  I am anxious that local authorities make full use of the increased levels of capital funding for Traveller accommodation and my Department will continue to engage proactively with local authorities in that regard.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to establishing a special working group to audit the current delivery and implementation of local authorities' TAPs and consult with stakeholders on key areas of concern.  This commitment has been underpinned in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, which provides for the commissioning by the Housing Agency of an expert, independent review of expenditure on, and delivery of, Traveller accommodation to underpin the work of the special working group.</p>  <p>  The review, which has regard to the targets in the local authorities' TAPs, is due to be completed very shortly.  It will provide factual information and this provide a key platform for the special working group to progress its work effectively.  The working group will be established by the statutorily appointed National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (NTACC) immediately after completion of the review.  I expect the working group to complete its work in an expeditious manner and, as provided for in the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, the NTACC may then advise me in relation to any appropriate measures for improving the provision and management of accommodation at local level.</p></reply>

Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 requires all housing authorities, as a reserved function, to make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support and to households approved for a transfer, the allocation of which would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the accommodation needs and requirements of the households.</p>  <p>  In determining the accommodation needs of a household seeking a transfer, and the priority to be awarded to such households, housing authorities have regard to whether the current accommodation is overcrowded within the meaning of section 63 of the Housing Act 1966.  Decisions as to the priority to be awarded to individual households are a matter for the housing authority concerned, having regard to their allocation schemes.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the issues arising where a tenanted household outgrows its current accommodation.  To assist housing authorities in addressing this issue, my Department provides capital funding to housing authorities to undertake adaptations and extensions to their existing social housing stock on a targeted and prioritised basis, where such works are required to address over-crowding.  However, my Department would expect that housing authorities, in as far as possible, should manage their existing stock of vacant properties to meet such need.</p>  <p>  In the longer term, the range of measures being progressed under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness will address the challenges in the social housing sector.  The Plan aims to deliver 47,000 new social housing solutions by 2021.  The delivery of these new units will be informed by the needs identified through the now annual Summary of Social Housing Assessment process carried out by all local authorities from 2016 onwards.  This will ensure that the right types of accommodation are built to meet the changing requirements of households into the future.</p></reply>

In order for a household to qualify for social housing support, a housing authority must carry out an assessment to establish whether the household meets specified eligibility requirements, including income eligibility requirements, and has a housing need, as defined in the Housing Acts.  In determining whether a household has a housing need, housing authorities are required to have regard to whether the current accommodation is, inter alia, overcrowded within the meaning of section 63 of the Housing Act 1966.</p><p>In addition, the Finance (No 2) Act 2013 and Finance Act 2014 provide for a Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) Scheme, which runs until the end of 2018, which can be availed of by both homeowners and landlords.

The Disabled Person Grant Scheme provides funds to local authorities to undertake adaptations and extensions to homes to meet the needs of local authority tenants with a disability, or to address serious overcrowding.  The Housing Adaptation Grant Scheme for Older People and People with a Disability is also delivered by local authorities with funding from my Department.  It assists other people and people with a disability in private houses to have necessary adaptations, repairs or improvement works carried out in order to make their accommodation more suitable for their needs.  There are no restrictions on the type of disability covered by the schemes and the administration of the available funding is a matter for the local authorities based on their assessment of priority and need at the time.</p></reply>

The purpose of the regulations is to provide the tenant with basic details regarding their tenancy and proof of  payment of rent by way of receipt.</p>  <p>  All rent and other payments under the tenancy must be acknowledged in writing by the landlord.  In addition, the rent book must contain specific particulars relating to the tenancy including, among other things, the name and address of the landlord and of the landlord&rsquo;s agent (if any), the term of the tenancy, the amount of the rent and of any other payments to be made by the tenant to the landlord, details of any advance rent or deposit paid and an inventory of furnishings and appliances supplied with the house.

Building Regulations apply to the construction of new buildings and to extensions and material alterations to buildings.  In addition, certain parts of the Regulations apply to existing buildings where a material change of use takes place.</p>  <p>  The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 provide for accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.  In effect, compliance with Building Regulations is ensured during the construction process, the statutory Certificate of Compliance on Completion certifies that a building is compliant with all relevant requirements of the Building Regulations.</p>  <p>  However, when a property is let, or available to let, it must comply with the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations.  The Regulations specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, fire safety and safety of gas and electrical supply.  Under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, the housing authority must have inspected and been satisfied that the property meets rental accommodation standards within 12 months prior to a HAP application or arrange to inspect the property within 8 months of HAP commencing.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Strategy for the Rental Sector, published in December 2016, sets out a number of actions in relation to Standards with the combined aim of improving the quality and management of rental accommodation.  On 27 January 2017, the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017 were made and will come into operation on 1 July 2017.</p>  <p>  The Strategy for the Rental Sector also prioritises strengthening the inspection capacity of local authorities to increase the number and frequency of inspections of rental properties.  In addition to the updated regulations, procedures for a more efficient, standardised and transparent inspection and enforcement approach across all local authority areas will be introduced.</p>  <p>  Specific ring-fenced funding for inspection and compliance activity will be identified from 2018 onwards and annual targets for both inspection and compliance will be agreed with local authorities.  The objective set out in the Strategy is to increase inspection numbers incrementally each year so that, by 2021, 25% of all rental properties are inspected annually.  The additional cost to local authorities for this initiative over the period 2018 to 2021 is estimated to be in the region of &euro;24 million.</p></reply>

It should be noted also that the CJEU held in this case that while the tax incentives and subsidy mechanisms provided for in the Flemish Decree were liable to be classified as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, it was for the referring Belgian court to determine whether the specific requirements for classification as State aid were met.  The CJEU also held that it was a matter for the referring court to decide, having regard to Case C-280/00 and Commission Decision 2005/842/EC, whether the measures would in any case fall outside of Article 107(1) TFEU by virtue of being regarded as compensation for the services provided by the recipient undertakings in order to discharge public service obligations.</p>  <p>  I do not consider that a Part V agreement is covered by the concept of a &lsquo;public works contract&rsquo; contained in Article 1(2)(b) of Directive 2004/18, as it is not a written contract which &ldquo;has as its object either the execution, or both the design and execution, of works related to one of the activities within the meaning of Annex I to that directive or a work, or the realisation, by whatever means, of a work corresponding to the requirements specified by the contracting authority&rdquo;.

Under section 30 of the Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including enforcement, with which a planning authority is or may be concerned.</p><p>It should be noted that a recent determination by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in a particular case has determined that the exclusive use of a residential apartment for short-term holiday lettings is a material change of use requiring planning permission.  Therefore, the continued operation of the apartment in question without such planning permission could be considered to be unauthorised development and subject to enforcement proceedings by the relevant local authority under the Planning Act.</p><p>In this connection, my Department has, by way of Circular letter PL12/2016 of 22 December 2016, brought this determination to the attention of all planning authorities to ensure that they are aware of:</p><p>- the grounds on which the Board reached its decision</p><p>- the planning implications in terms of the requirement for such commercial use of residential units to be the subject of an application for planning permission, and</p><p>- the importance of a pro-active approach to planning enforcement generally in this regard.</p><p>A copy of the Circular letter is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<i>.</i></p><p>In the wider context, in December 2016, Government approved the publication of a Strategy for the Rental Sector.  In terms of rental accommodation supply, the focus in the Strategy is on maintaining existing levels of rental stock and encouraging investment in additional supply, reflecting the shortages in the supply of rental accommodation in key locations, particularly in urban areas.  In some of these areas, there is also significant demand for transitory short-term accommodation.  In this context, providing short-term rentals at higher prices may be an attractive option for landlords.</p><p>The implications of the above-mentioned determination by An Bord Plean&aacute;la has raised a number of regulatory and other related issues, such as tax liability, residential tenancy regulation, support for tourism, and planning.  The Strategy for the Rental Sector provides for the establishment by my Department of a working group, comprising representatives of relevant stakeholders including local authorities, relevant Departments, public bodies and other interests in the area, with a view to providing more information on the scale and nature of the issue and full clarity regarding the appropriate regulatory approach to be adopted in relation to short-term tourism-related lettings.  The working group is due to report in Quarter 2 2017.</p></reply>

This includes kitchens, living rooms, bedrooms, conservatories you can sit in and studies, but excluding bathrooms, toilets, kitchenettes, utility rooms consulting rooms, offices, shops, halls, landings and rooms that can only be used for storage such as cupboards.</p>  <p>  Section 63 of the 1966 Act refers specifically to the sleeping arrangements of persons in a dwelling and sets out a definition of overcrowding in accommodation for the purpose of the Housing Acts.  Paragraph (a) of the definition states that a dwelling is deemed overcrowded when the sleeping arrangements are such that any two opposite-sex persons aged 10 or more who are not married must sleep in the same room.  Paragraph (b) refers to the free air space in any room used for sleeping for any person not being less than 400 cubic feet.</p>  <p>  In the absence of detailed information regarding the number and gender of individuals in each household, the sleeping arrangements in place and the type of dwelling occupied, it is not possible to determine whether any of the 95,013 households referred to in the CSO report are in overcrowded accommodation as defined in Section 63 of the Housing Act 1966.  </p>  <p>  The Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness (July 2016)  is focused on increasing supply, across all tenures, to achieve total housing output of at least 25,000 homes per year by 2021 and beyond, effectively doubling the output of 12,600 homes recorded in 2015.  Specifically, Pillar 5 of the Action Plan is focussed on achieving optimum occupancy of the country&rsquo;s existing housing stock, both private and social housing, so as to meet national housing needs in as effective a way as possible. </p>  <p>  While still at an early stage of implementation, there is already strong evidence that the focus on increasing and accelerating housing supply in Rebuilding Ireland is starting to have a positive impact.  The latest residential commencements and completions data show that house-building activity is continuing to strengthen.  Completions, as measured through ESB connections, for the 12-month period to end February 2017 stood at 15,327 homes, a 16% increase year on year.  Likewise, commencement notices for 13,169 new homes were submitted in the twelve month period to end February 2017, up 27% year on year.</p></reply>

Under Section 10 of that Act, fire authorities are required to make provision for the prompt and efficient extinguishing of fires in buildings and other places of all kinds in its functional area and for the protection and rescue of persons and property from injury by fire.  A fire authority, in the exercise of its fire-fighting functions is required to have regard (in addition to all other relevant considerations) to the nature of the fire hazards and the probable incidence and extent of fires in its functional area, the character of the area and the value of the property liable to be damaged by fires.  Decisions about mobilising and deploying fire-fighting resources to fire situations are vested in the Senior Fire Officer present at the scene.  On-scene co-ordination of all responding resources takes place under the aegis of the Senior Fire Officer.  The safety of members of the public, as well as the fire authority&rsquo;s own personnel, is a primary consideration in all fire-fighting situations. </p>  <p>  My Department is assigned the &ldquo;Lead Government Department&rdquo; role for fire emergencies.  On behalf of the Department, the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) exercises the role of monitoring and responding at national level to incidents of fire as considered appropriate.  The NDFEM&rsquo;s Assessment Team has been monitoring the incidents of wildland fires and has been liaising with the relevant fire authorities in this regard. </p>  <p>  The NDFEM undertakes a liaison role also, in accordance with pre-agreed procedures, for channelling requests from fire authorities for Defence Forces support, including for deployment of Air Corps helicopters, where requested. </p>  <p>  Where a situation merits, or where a fire authority indicates that the local level response is overwhelmed, national level co-ordination may be invoked to support the local response.  Where judged as necessary and appropriate, the &lsquo;Lead Government Department&rsquo; may convene a National Emergency Co-ordination Group (NECG) to bring a whole of Government support to bear in assisting the local response as necessary. </p>  <p>  While recognising the difficulties and dangers posed to local communities by the recent spate of wildland fires, the NDFEM Assessment Team has not considered it appropriate to move to the stage of convening a National Emergency Co-ordination Group, as the relevant Departments and agencies have been working well with fire services to deal with the fires at a local level. </p>  <p>  The NDFEM Assessment Team will continue to monitor further incidents of gorse and forest fires at a local level and will make decisions whether or not to convene a NECG on a case-by-case basis, in conjunction with relevant local authority fire services.</p></reply>

However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.

Customers availing of this support prior to 1st January 2014 have been able to retain entitlement to the scheme up to 1st January 2018.  There are currently approximately 1,800 people in receipt of the scheme, for which Government has provided over &euro;4 million in 2017.  </p>  <p>  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported is through on-going engagement with their lender to explore sustainable solutions.  The payment of this supplement on an indefinite basis does not address the longer term issues for people in serious mortgage arrears. </p>  <p>  It is expected that the customers currently in receipt of this support will continue to exit the scheme through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders; securing employment; or exit strategies such as the Mortgage to Rent Scheme.  In line with all schemes administered by my Department, any further extension of the mortgage interest scheme for existing customers would have to be considered in a budgetary context. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments.  As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.  </p>  <p>  The role of MABS was expanded in 2015 with the establishment of a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS service (DMA MABS) across the MABS network, to help people specifically with home mortgage arrears.  There are now 32 specialist DMA advisors working across 27 locations countrywide, assisting borrowers to assess the options available to them and, where required, negotiating with lenders on their behalf.  To date, the DMA service has helped almost 3,600 such borrowers.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, MABS provides a national network of court mentors who attend each listed repossession Court hearing countrywide.  The mentors provide support to distressed borrowers who are facing the loss of their home and signpost them to the appropriate services.  To date, over 1,400 borrowers have been referred onward to MABS advisors through the court mentor service.  </p>  <p>  In 2016, a further initiative was announced by Government, known as Abhaile.  This scheme further extends the free services already available to borrowers through the DMA MABS service and the court mentor service.  The new voucher based scheme, for which MABS is the gateway, provides access for people, who are insolvent and in home mortgage arrears, to access independent expert financial and/or legal advice and assistance, free of charge.

The funding for the scheme was increased this year, as part of Budget 2017, by an additional &euro;5.7 million (almost 14% over the previous year&rsquo;s allocation) which will benefit over 50,000 children.  The funding allocated for the school meals programme for the last five years is provided in the tabular statement.  Funding is based on a rate of payment per meal, per child, per day.  The maximum rates of payment and the number of students availing of each meal option is also provided in the tabular statement.</p><p>The objective of the scheme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  Applicants to the scheme are directed to the Department&rsquo;s website which clearly advises that funding is for healthy nutritious food only and examples of food items are provided.  Access to healthy eating documents and guidelines are available on the school meals site including a link to the most recently launched &lsquo;<i>Healthy Food for Life &ndash; the Healthy Eating Guidelines and Food Pyramid</i>&rsquo; by the Department of Health.  The Department is engaging with Safefood and the Department of Health in the development of technical standards for food provided in schools, which will include that provided under the school meals programme.</p><p>Schools and organisations must reapply for funding in advance of each school year and are required to submit detailed records at the end of each school year.  Expenditure on unhealthy food items is deducted from the following year&rsquo;s funding allocation.  In addition, the Department initiated an on-site inspection programme in 2012 in participating schools to ensure that the scheme rules are being adhered to.  The inspection process is being rolled out across all schools and includes an assessment of the type of food provided.</p><p>The operation of school meals projects is the responsibility of the school or group including the delivery model and choice of supplier to be used.  The scheme can be delivered in a variety of ways and depends on the needs, capabilities and resources, including infrastructure, of the schools or groups.  Delivery models can range from the provision of full canteen services to the purchase of pre-prepared meals from specialist school meals suppliers or local suppliers which ensures that the supports available under the scheme can be provided across all schools.  The physical infrastructure in schools is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p><p><b>Table 1: Allocation under the School Meals Scheme 2012 &ndash; 2016</b><table><tr><th colspan="2">Allocation </th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>&euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>42</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2: Rates of Payment for school meals scheme and number of pupils availing in the 2016/17 Academic Year </b><table><tr><th>Meal </th><th>Max Rate of Payment (per child per day) </th><th>Examples of Food to be Provided </th><th>No. of Pupils</th></tr><tr><td>Breakfast/Snack</td><td>&euro;0.60</td><td>Cereal, Toast, Scone, Fruit, Yogurt, Milk, Unsweetened Juice - 2 Items must be provided</td><td>125,260      <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Lunch/Afterschool</td><td>&euro;1.40</td><td>Filled Sandwich/Roll or Soup &amp;amp; Roll or Salad Plate, plus2 other items (e.g. Water, Milk, Unsweetened Juice, Fruit, Yogurt)</td><td>142,220</td></tr><tr><td>Dinner</td><td>&euro;1.90</td><td>Meat, Potatoes &amp;amp; Vegetables or Chicken Curry or Spaghetti Bolognaise, plusa drink (Milk, Water, Unsweetened Juice)</td><td>20,420</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The scale of its operations and expenditure demand that a robust and integrated range of control and anti-fraud measures are in place.  Measures to prevent and detect fraud and enhance controls across the Department&rsquo;s various schemes are set out in the Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy which covers the period 2014 &ndash; 2018. </p>  <p>  The current publicity campaign is designed to: </p>  <p> - Promote discussion on the topic of social welfare fraud and challenge the perceptions of those who see it as a victimless crime; </p>  <p> - Encourage reporting of suspected/known social welfare fraud.  It also affords an opportunity to increase awareness of the Department&rsquo;s fraud reporting contact numbers and online reporting options;</p>  <p> - Demonstrate that the Government and Department takes the issue of social welfare fraud very seriously and that it will investigate and prosecute, where this is found to be warranted; and </p>  <p> - Demonstrate that the Department is very conscious of its obligations, as one of the largest spending Departments in the State, and the importance of protecting the integrity of the social welfare system.  </p>  <p>  In all, some 12 staff, including management staff, dealt with increase in reports and support the press office and communications unit during the campaign.  All staff members were in place in advance of the campaign and had extensive experience in handling telephone, webservice and written communication under the Department&rsquo;s good citizen reporting service.

Welfare fraud can be reported in a variety of ways.  The Department provides a dedicated service on its website to enable reports to be made.  A concerned member of the public can also write to the Department or telephone with information.</p><p>The Department examines all reports of suspected fraud and abuse received from the public.  The initial examination focuses on identifying the person(s) who was reported and if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment.  Where there appears to be sufficient grounds for concern, a request for a claim review is issued to the appropriate scheme area for investigation.  </p><p>A payment is not suspended or stopped solely on the basis of a report received but on evidence garnered following a formal review/investigation.  The report received provides a &lsquo;trigger&rsquo; for the instigation of a review of a specific entitlement and further investigation if that is considered to be warranted.  Given the hearsay nature of the reports, they are excluded from the statutory decision making process and do not form part of any evidence when the case is considered for prosecution.  Accordingly, the Department does not track the outcome of reviews or investigations that are initiated following receipt of a Good Citizen Report.  </p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>TABLE: Reports of suspected social welfare fraud from members of the public received and referred for investigation 2006-2016</b><table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Reports Received</div></th><th><div>Of reports received &ndash; number referred for investigation </div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2006*</div></td><td><div>580</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>2007*</div></td><td><div>604</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>2008*</div></td><td><div>1,044</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>6,429</div></td><td><div>Data not compiled</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>12,648</div></td><td><div>9,958</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>16,917</div></td><td><div>12,881</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>23,868</div></td><td><div>18,306</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013</div></td><td><div>20,120</div></td><td><div>15,431</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2014</div></td><td><div>18,866</div></td><td><div>14,882</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2015</div></td><td><div>16,456</div></td><td><div>11,685</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2016</div></td><td><div>18,744</div></td><td><div>15,162</div></td></tr></table>*  <i>Data for 2006 to 2008 was not compiled in the same manner as in later years.</i></p><p>Each report receives a preliminary examination for relevance and to identify the persons concerned and if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment.  Where a person can be identified and sufficient information is provided to warrant a further examination, the report is referred to the relevant scheme area in the Department, to a Social Welfare Inspector for further investigation or to the Special Investigations Unit for more serious allegations.  A payment is not suspended or stopped on the basis of the report received &ndash; instead this happens when evidence of wrong-doing has been ascertained by the appropriate scheme area.</p><p>All reports are received on an anonymous and confidential basis.  To preserve the integrity of the public&rsquo;s reporting system, the Department does not track the outcome of the individual allegations of wrongdoing received.  However, internal assurance checks by the Department indicates that around 1 in 3 reports received results in the payments being made to individuals being reduced or terminated.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The control strategy is set out in the Department Compliance and Anti-fraud Strategy 2014 to 2018.  The Department publishes an annual report on the implementation of the main actions plans and progress against targets &ndash; the strategy document and the annual reports are published on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.welfare.ie.</i>I plan to publish the annual report for 2016 in the coming weeks.  </p><p>Reviews and investigations of entitlements are conducted by social welfare staff, social welfare inspectors and inspectors assigned to the Special Investigations Unit and a combination of desk-based assessment of entitlements, direct enquiries with recipients of social welfare payments, site and employer visits and face-to-face interviews are used.

It was introduced to offer jobseekers a wide variety of work experience opportunities, so JobBridge placements are not formally accredited.  The number of people who commenced a JobBridge placement in 2015 and 2016 is listed in Table 1.  JobBridge closed to new entrants in October 2016, so there were no new entrants in 2017.  Over 700 participants remain on the scheme.</p><p>A robust external evaluation of the scheme conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants in 2016 found that it is one of the most effective labour market programmes &ndash; increasing participants&rsquo; employment outcomes by 32%.  It also found that while participants rated the scheme positively on 18 out of 20 aspects measured, most were dissatisfied with the level of payment and a sizable minority rated the scheme negatively on some aspects, for example the quality of training offered.  Based on the findings, and taking account of the improvement in labour market conditions, Indecon recommended that JobBridge be discontinued in its current form and replaced with a new scheme.  A copy of the full evaluation can be found at:<i> . </i></p><p>The Labour Market Council welcomed the report and noted the positive employment impact of the scheme.  A majority of the Council similarly recommended that JobBridge be replaced.</p><p>Having considered the evidence and the suggestions put forward by Indecon and the Labour Market Council, I announced the closure of JobBridge to new applications from 27 October 2016 and my intention to replace it later this year with a new work experience programme better suited to the much-improved labour market and that addresses criticisms of the scheme. </p><p>I am very conscious that any new scheme would need the support, trust and confidence of employers, jobseekers and the public.  That is why I instructed my officials to consult with key stakeholders before making a final decision on any potential replacement scheme.  That process has recently concluded and I will make an announcement after I have a chance to consider the feedback.</p><p><b>Table 1</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of JobBridge starts</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>8708</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>4167</td></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>N/A</td></tr></table></p></reply>

With this in mind, my Department undertook an analysis of CE, which also looked at the other employment programmes.  In this context, it is should also be borne in mind that the Government strongly supports the work being done through CE and the other employment programmes.  </p>  <p>  I have seen first-hand myself, over recent months, the vital role such schemes are playing in local communities, including supporting social services, across the entire country. </p>  <p>  Recently the Government approved the implementation of a number of changes to the terms and conditions of participation on CE.  The main purpose of these changes is to broaden the availability of CE to a greater number of people on the live register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on the programme. </p>  <p>  The changes I am planning to introduce will see the general qualifying age for CE for those on the live register reduced from 25 to 21 years.  It will also be easier for previous participants, who have exhausted their CE entitlement, to requalify as participation prior to the year 2007 will be disregarded.  While participants between 21 and 55 years on CE will be entitled to one year on the programme, this can be extended by up to 2 more years if they are engaged in a recognised training or education award that is helping them progress towards employment.  All CE participants age 55 and over will be able to avail of 3 consecutive years on a CE scheme up to the overall limit of 6 years from 2007 (7 years if on a disability payment). </p>  <p>  I have also agreed to review the current participation limits for older people on CE within the next three months.  As the Deputy will be aware, participation limits are necessary to allow for the utilisation of places amongst qualifying persons to ensure the benefits of CE are available to the widest possible number of jobseekers. </p>  <p>  My Department keeps all aspects of its activation programmes under review to ensure the best outcomes for participants.  As part of the implementation of the new measures, my Department is currently consulting with key stakeholders across the country. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

An applicant who has attained the age of 18 years may apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate by way of self-determination and, where their birth is registered in the State, they may subsequently apply for a birth certificate in their preferred name and/or gender.</p>  <p>  Section 12 of the Act provides that a person aged 16 and not yet 18 years old may apply to the court, through a parent or next friend for an exemption from the standard requirement of a minimum age for gender recognition of 18 years.  An application to the Court must be accompanied by a certificate from the applicant&rsquo;s treating endocrinologist or psychiatrist and also a certificate from an endocrinologist or psychiatrist who has no connection with the child.  This provision was included in order to balance the rights of children with the need to protect their interests at a vulnerable age.</p>  <p>  There is no provision in the Act for persons under the age of 16 years to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate.  Given the child welfare issues involved here I must be guided by my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Following enactment, I wrote to Minister Zappone requesting that her Department undertake research in the area of gender recognition for children to inform policy in the future.  I understand that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is currently conducting a consultation process with the relevant NGOs and young children on this issue.  The findings of these consultations are awaited.</p>  <p>  Section 7 provides for a review of the operation of the Act.  The review is due to begin in September 2017 and will include in its terms of reference the issue of gender recognition for children.  A report the findings and conclusions will be published within a year of the commencement of the review.</p>  <p>  Since commencement of the Act there have been 231 applications for a Gender Recognition Certificate.  Of these, 230 of were granted, including all nine applications in respect of 16 or 17 year olds.</p></reply>

The rate of payment to a person is related to the number of contributions made over the years into the Social Insurance Fund by the person.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension (contributory), all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.</p>  <p>  Where a person of working age was unable to work due to illness, they may have been entitled to claim an Invalidity Pension, depending on their circumstances.  Those in receipt of the personal rate invalidity pension at pension age would generally transfer automatically to the State pension (contributory) at the full payment rate.</p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.  While this payment is subject to a household means-test, there are very significant disregards which means that over 70% of such pensioners qualify at the full rate.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7 billion, is the largest block of expenditure in my Department, representing over 36% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.</p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the conditions for the State pension (contributory) are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  A number of significant reforms to State pensions were introduced in recent years which have allowed my Department to maintain the value of the State pension, and indeed increase it in the last two Budgets.  The main such changes in recent years are as follows &ndash;</p>  <p>1. The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided for the necessary amendments to increase the State pension age in line with the National Pensions Framework as set out in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  It discontinued the State Pension (Transition) for new claimants with effect from 1 January 2014, thereby standardising the State Pension age at 66 years.  It provided for an increase in the age for qualification for the State Pension from 66 years to 67 years from 2021, and a further increase to 68 years from 2028.</p>  <p>2. &ldquo;Developing the National Pensions System &ndash; Final Report of the National Pensions Board&rdquo; published in 1993, recommended that the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a contributory pension should be increased to 520 (i.e. 10 years).  The necessary legislation to effect these recommendations was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997 which provided for their implementation in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised at 260 from 2002, rising to 520 from April 2012.</p>  <p>3. As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced.  This resulted in one of the bands (in respect of those with a yearly average of 20-47 contributions) being replaced with three bands (in respect of yearly averages of 40-47, 30-39, and 20-29 respectively).  These additional bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life are likely to benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.</p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  Following completion of the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund later this year, a refined proposal will be developed.  My Department will conduct a period of consultation with relevant stakeholders including interest groups, representative bodies and the Oireachtas.  Following the consultation period, I will submit a proposal to Government seeking approval of the new approach.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by almost 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approximately 880,000 customers with direct eligibility to free travel with an annual allocation of &euro;80 million.  The scheme is available to all people aged over 66 living permanently in the State.  To qualify for the scheme, applicants who are under age 66 must be in receipt of a qualifying payment.  These are invalidity pension, blind pension, disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance or an equivalent social security payment from a country covered by EC Regulations or one with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement.</p>  <p>  There are no discretionary free travel passes issued.  If the free travel scheme was to be extended to people aged under 66 who are not eligible for a qualifying payment, an assessment process would be required for all such applications, changing the nature of the scheme.  Successive Governments have instead used existing underlying entitlements to confer eligibility for this scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) the Department of Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The service is delivered by two companies, Seetec and Turas Nua.</p><p>The service was rolled out on a phased basis over the period mid-2015 to July 2016.  The numbers referred initially were low but this has increased with over 94,000 jobseekers having commenced with the service by May 2017, this total figure is laid out by county in the following table.  Of these, some 71,000 had started their engagement with the JobPath service by the end of 2016.  Some 9,895 jobseekers under the age of 26 had engaged with the service by May 2017.</p><p>In the first four months of 2017 almost 23,000 customers had commenced their engagement period with the service, given this it could be estimated that perhaps circa 60,000 customers may start their engagement period with the service during 2017.</p><p>It is important to note that jobseekers may be supported through the service for up to 30 months - under the service jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months.</p><p>It will therefore take time to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period with the service) for complete and robust outcome data to be available.  With this in mind, it is intended that a full econometric evaluation of the service will commence later this year.</p><p>However for 2017, my Departments aim is to publish a report on performance of the service on a quarterly basis.  The first report was published on 17th January (and is available on the departments website) with the second report due for publication on the departments website week ending 19 May.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p>JobPath customers who had engaged with the service by county as of May 2017<table><tr><th>County </th><th>JobPath Customers</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>2462</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>2178</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>2310</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>8889</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>4581</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin </td><td>16608</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>4388</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>3465</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>4276</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>1906</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>2038</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>846</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>4851</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>2163</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>4118</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>1680</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>1871</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>1279</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>2907</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>708</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>1336</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>4934</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>3564</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>3146</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>5077</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>2447</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>94028</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The rationale for these rates is to prevent young unemployed people from entering longer term welfare dependency by providing a strong financial incentive to take up a job, training or education programme.  Should a young jobseeker on a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment participate on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.  This rate will be further increased to &euro;193 per week from September 2017.</p>  <p>  The National University of Ireland, Maynooth (NUIM) is undertaking a piece of research at the moment which is examining the effectiveness of the reduced rates in encouraging young jobseekers to avail of education, training, employment programmes and opportunities.  My Department has not commissioned the NUIM to undertake this research, rather, as part of an effort to encourage and promote research my Department has facilitated the NUIM access to the data from the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Longitudinal Database in order to undertake this research.  Initial results of the research were published as a working paper in April 2017 and this is available on the NUIM website.</p>  <p>  Under Pathways to Work 2016-2020, my Department is committed to review and report on the impact of the reduced payment rates for jobseekers aged 18 to 25.  This review will be finalised this year, and will take account of the results of the NUIM research.</p>  <p>  With effect from March 2017, rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s payments were increased for claimants of all ages as a result of measures I introduced in Budget 2017.  I have no plans for any further increases in rates at present.  Any such changes could only be considered in a budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring my Department identifies effective measures to incentivise and support young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  The best way to do this is through engagement processes and by incentivising them to avail of educational and training opportunities, thereby enhancing their employment prospects.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-16a.681.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017051600070#WRP01100"><p> I assume the Deputy is referring to JobPath as the Department does not administer a scheme called JobPass. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the state&rsquo;s Public Employment Service is managed by my Department and delivered directly by its own Intreo service as well as by contracted private companies, such as JobPath, Local Employment Service (LES) and Job Club providers.  These services have been designed by the department to augment and complement one another.  The Department has some 68 contracts in place for the provision of these services.</p>  <p>  JobPath is being delivered by two companies/contractors, Turas Nua and Seetec.  This element of the service was rolled out on a phased basis over the period mid-2015 to July 2016.  The numbers referred initially were low but this has increased with circa 94,000 Jobseekers having commenced with the service by May 2017, of these, some 71,000 had started their engagement with the service by the end of 2016.  In the case of the areas specifically mentioned by the deputy, some 1,400 people have commenced their engagement period with the service to date.  These clients were referred to the service from the Intreo Centre in Loughrea, and the Social Welfare Branch Offices in Ballinasloe, Gort and Tuam.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that jobseekers may be supported through the service for up to 30 months - under the service jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases Jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months.  </p>  <p>  It will therefore take time to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period with the service) for complete and robust outcome data to be available.  With this in mind, it is intended that a full econometric evaluation of the service will commence later this year.</p>  <p>  However for 2017, my Department&rsquo;s aim is to publish a cohort based report on the performance of the service on a quarterly basis.  The first report was published on the 17th January (this report is available on the department&rsquo;s website) with the second report due for publication (also on the department&rsquo;s website) shortly.  Given that only a small number of people have completed their full engagement period with the service these reports can only be treated as indicative, nevertheless the performance levels detailed in same are encouraging.</p>  <p>  In relation to ensuring that the outcomes of the service are suitable to the person, the Department was careful in designing the service to ensure that payments to contractors are conditional on Jobseekers not just finding a job but finding and sustaining their employment.  The companies are, for example, only paid a job outcome fee for each 13 week period of sustained employment of at least 30 hours per week.  The suitability of employment is therefore a key factor in ensuring that jobs are sustainable.  If people are placed into unsuitable jobs they are less likely to remain in employment and as a consequence the provider&rsquo;s fees will be reduced.  In addition the department has built in a number of controls related to the service, for example should one of the companies fall below the standards expected by the department in terms of performance, customer satisfaction or quality of service delivery the department can apply a sanction to the company concerned.  The department conducts audits and inspections and monitors customer satisfaction and performance of the companies on an ongoing basis.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As we met in a multilateral context, we did not have any substantive discussions outside the parameters of the Meeting.  However, the issue of human rights in the Gulf was raised during the Joint Council and Ministerial Meeting discussions.  It was noted that although human rights is an area where the EU and the GCC do not always agree, the dialogue must continue, even if this means tackling difficult issues.</p>  <p>  I travelled to Saudi Arabia last November, on what was my first visit to the Kingdom as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In advance of my trip to the Kingdom and during the visit, I was briefed on human rights issues in Saudi Arabia by my Department and by our Ambassador to Saudi Arabia.  I did not meet with my counterpart, Minister Al-Jubeir, during the visit as he was not in the country at the time.  However, I did meet with the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Nizar Madani, and we discussed human rights, including the death penalty and the position of women in Saudi society.  </p>  <p>  As I have stated on numerous occasions, there are many human rights issues in Saudi Arabia, including, but not limited to, women&rsquo;s rights, that are of great concern to me and to my Department.  I would always raise human rights issues on a visit to Saudi Arabia but, as noted above, have only been on one such visit to date.  My officials also raise these issues with their Saudi counterparts, here in Dublin, in Riyadh and in multilateral fora.  It is Ireland&rsquo;s policy to promote human rights whenever possible and appropriate, and my Department strives to maintain this principled position in all of its bilateral relations, including with Saudi Arabia.</p></reply>

I unreservedly condemn any intimidation, violence, or discrimination perpetrated against indigenous people and those seeking to defend their rights, whether in Brazil or elsewhere.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples visited Brazil in March of last year to identify and assess the main issues facing indigenous peoples there.  On that occasion, the Special Rapporteur visited the Guarani-Kaiow&aacute; people in Mato Grosso Do Sul.  The Special Rapporteur&rsquo;s report of August 2016 recognised that Brazil has in the past been a leader in the area of indigenous peoples&rsquo; rights and has made significant achievements in this area, including in constitutional provisions protecting the rights of its indigenous people.  However, the report also noted a worrying regression in the protection of indigenous peoples&rsquo; rights in recent years.</p>  <p>  Consequently, on 5 May 2017 Ireland used the occasion of the 27th Session of the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council in Geneva to express our concern at this regression in the protection of indigenous peoples&rsquo; rights in Brazil.  Ireland recommended that Brazil take further steps to protect human rights defenders, including those working in relation to the rights of indigenous peoples, by ensuring impartial, thorough and effective investigations into all cases of attacks, harassment and intimidation and the prosecution of all alleged perpetrators of such offences.</p>  <p>  In relation to the individual referred to by the Deputy, I am aware of their recent visit to Dublin.  While, for scheduling reasons, it was not possible to arrange a meeting on this occasion, Departmental officials at home and abroad engage regularly with human rights activists and civil society leaders in Latin America, including those working on indigenous rights.  In addition, the issue of the rights of indigenous peoples is the subject of ongoing attention by European Union Ambassadors in Brazil.  In this regard, Ireland and other EU Member States strongly support the mandate of FUNAI, the government agency responsible for enforcing the rights of indigenous peoples.

This is set out in the Passports Act, 2008.  Entitlement to Irish citizenship is in turn subject to the terms of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended.</p><p>Accordingly, the Passport Service is obliged to seek documentary evidence of Irish citizenship by birth, parentage/descent, or naturalisation before a passport application can be processed.  The Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade does not have the authority to declare an individual a citizen or recognise him/her as such in the absence of such evidence.</p><p>The Passport Service has advised that previous correspondence with the person concerned indicates that he may qualify for Irish citizenship through a grandparent who was born on the island of Ireland.  It should be noted, however, that the relevant legislation states that the Irish citizenship of individuals in this category commences only after inclusion on the Foreign Births&rsquo; Register (FBR).  The Passport Service can therefore only proceed with a passport application from this person once it includes an FBR certificate as evidence of Irish citizenship.</p><p>The fee for registering a foreign birth is &euro;270 for applicants over 18 and &euro;145 for applicants under 18.  These fees are set out in the Foreign Birth Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 47 of 2013).  There is no provision for waiving the fee in the legislation and currently there are no proposals to amend the fee.

This substantial investment has been supplemented by a further &euro;5.14 billion, the full allocation of which is being examined by the ongoing Capital Review.  Consequently, gross voted capital expenditure will grow from around &euro;4.2 billion in 2016 to almost &euro;7.3 billion in 2021, an increase of almost three-quarters in public capital investment in just five years.  This substantial increase has been achieved through the prudent and responsible approach to fiscal policy which continues to be taken by this Government which has been the linchpin of Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  Indeed the Commission&rsquo;s recent forecasts confirm that Ireland is yet again projected to be the fastest growing economy in the EU.</p></reply>

The CFRAM Programme is focusing on 300 areas - called Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) - that were designated in 2012 at being potentially significant risk from flooding.</p><p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) through its Engineering Consultants over the past number of years, and working with Local Authorities, embarked on extensive and detailed analysis to understand the risk of flooding in each of these areas.  Developing these flood maps has also involved extensive public consultation that has provided a great deal of local knowledge. </p><p>The flood maps are community based maps and provide a useful resource for planning and emergency response.  They also provide the level of flood risk for an area for the OPW to develop feasible flood relief measures.  The draft measures for these 300 areas were published in the 29 draft Flood Risk Management Plans, for public consultation last year. </p><p>The OPW Flood Maps are therefore intended for planning purposes and are not maps that designate individual properties at being at risk from flooding.  Draft flood maps which are available on the OPW website <i></i>were published for the purpose of consultation and cannot be used for commercial purposes. </p><p>The OPW is over the coming months finalising the Flood Risk Management Plans, that will include the final Flood Maps for the 300 AFAs and will be submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for his approval.  The OPW is currently enhancing its website to support the publication of the final maps and Flood Risk Management Plans.</p><p>In order to assist insurance companies assess the risk and take into account the protection provided by completed OPW flood defence schemes, the OPW has a Memorandum of Understanding with Insurance Ireland, the representative body of the insurance industry.  This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on these completed schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  Insurance Ireland members have committed to take into account all information provided by OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these protected areas.  To date OPW has provided details to Insurance Ireland on 17 completed schemes nationally and Insurance Ireland has advised that flood insurance cover is included in 83% of policies in these defended areas.  The OPW has recently provided details on a further completed scheme to Insurance Ireland. </p><p>The decision on whether to offer insurance, level of premiums charged and the policy terms applied are matters for individual insurers.  Insurance companies make commercial decisions on the provision of insurance cover based on their assessment of the risks they would be accepting on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>The insurance industry has its own flood modelling tools for assessing the level of risk to individual properties and it has highlighted to the OPW that it does not use the OPW Flood Maps to inform its flood modelling.</p><p>Any person with an insurance-related query or complaint can contact Insurance Ireland's Insurance Information Service (01 676 1914 or <i>iis@insuranceireland.eu</i>).  In addition, the Financial Services Ombudsman (1890 88 20 90) deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers.</p></reply>

The legislation required to allow for these pilot measures is included in the Heritage Bill 2016, which was published in January 2016.   </p>  <p>  The Bill recently completed its passage through Seanad &Eacute;ireann and will now go to Dail &Eacute;ireann.  In the meantime, the existing provisions relating to Section 40 of the Wildlife Acts remain in force.    </p>  <p>  The question relating to restrictions on farming in areas where burning has occurred is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  That Department operates the Basic Payment Scheme and other schemes including GLAS.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as appropriate, to investigate the causes of wild fires and, where evidence is forthcoming, to pursue appropriate enforcement under the Wildlife Acts or other legislation. </p>  <p>  The main source of wild gorse fires is thought to be the deliberate starting of fires without concern for the consequences.  Aside from such malicious activities, one of the main challenges is to encourage members of the public, (including landowners, farmers and recreational users of publicly accessible land), to act responsibly at all times, to be mindful of their own safety and the safety of others, to be mindful of the need to protect property, both publicly owned and privately owned and to appreciate the value of our natural heritage, particularly in our National Parks, Nature Reserves and Designated (Natura 2000) Sites.</p></reply>

The purpose of this project is to improve survival rates for those who suffer an out of hospital cardiac arrest through the development and implementation of an out of hospital cardiac arrest strategy.  This work will support the National Ambulance Service (NAS) and Community First Responder Ireland (CFR Ireland) in their commitment to improve clinical outcomes for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA). </p>  <p>  Both the NAS and CFR Ireland are working with other partners to enable a sustainable response to such events.</p>  <p>  The HSE National Community First Responder framework for Ireland declared that CFRs offer a valuable and complementary resource to emergency ambulance provision, positively impacts NAS response time and achieves improved survival for OHCA.  It demonstrated how the NAS and CFR Ireland intend to consolidate, enhance and implement further CFR schemes over the next five years through a National Community First Responder Framework.  Its ambitions over the next few years include increasing the availability of training in CPR in schools, work places and local groups and making Public Access Defibrillators more easily accessible with people knowing how to use them.  It also aims to:</p>  <p>  - Work in partnership with all relevant organisations (statutory, voluntary, community and private sectors) to increase the availability of Public Access Defibrillators;</p>  <p>  - Put in place effective arrangements to ensure that Public Access Defibrillators are mapped, maintained and accessible to the public;</p>  <p>  - Commence a public awareness campaign to increase the level of provision of CFR Schemes in geographical areas of priority.</p>  <p>  And so one of the means to help improve outcomes in this area is CFR groups.  These are people from local communities who are trained in basic life support and the use of defibrillators that attend a potentially life threatening emergency in their area.  They are then able to provide an early intervention in situations such as heart attack or cardiac arrest by providing, among other things, resuscitation and defibrillation.</p>  <p>  Cardiac First Responders (CFR) Ireland, launched in 2015, is the national umbrella organisation for Community First Responders Groups.  CFR Ireland works with the National Ambulance Service, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council and the Centre for Emergency Medical Science UCD.  Both the NAS and CFR Ireland currently support over 145 Community First Responder schemes throughout Ireland, who train community members to provide emergency care support.</p>  <p>  If an emergency 999/112 call for cardiac arrest, choking, chest pain or breathing difficulties is made to the National Ambulance Service in an area where a CFR group is established, the on-duty CFR member gets a text from the National Ambulance Service at the same time that an ambulance is despatched with location and call details.  The First Responder then goes straight to the scene and administers initial care (defibrillation if required) until the National Ambulance Service Emergency resources arrive.</p>  <p>  National Lottery funding has been in the past the means of my Department to provide funding along the lines referred to by the Deputy.  However, applications for this funding stream have been primarily from individual groups in the local community and not local authorities.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's questions relate to service matters, I have arranged for the questions to be referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  </p>  <p>  In December 2016, I granted approval to the NTPF for the first tranche of funding in the region of &euro;5m for a waiting list initiative with the aim of ensuring that in excess of 2000 patients waiting more than 18 months for a daycase procedure will have received an appointment for their procedure by 30 June 2017.</p>  <p>  The NTPF has advised that the Initiative has commenced and patients are currently receiving their appointments.  Specifically, over 350 patients awaiting cataract procedures who would have been waiting for longer than 18 months by the end of June have been identified as appropriate to test the first clinical pathway for this outsourcing initiative. </p>  <p>  It may not be possible to make specific information on costs in relation to individual private hospitals available due to its commercial sensitivity, however the NTPF will be required to provide to the Department of Health, financial reports regarding the waiting list initiatives.</p>  <p>  In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services.  These plans have now been finalised and will be communicated shortly.</p></reply>

Water fluoridation is the adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the optimal recommended level for the prevention of dental caries (tooth decay).  Preliminary results from the research project "Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth" (FACCT), which is being conducted by UCC and supported by the HSE, indicate that children's oral health has been improving overall and that fluoridated communities continue to have lower levels of tooth decay than non-fluoridated communities.  The results of this research project are due to be published this year.  The annual cost of water fluoridation is approximately &euro;4 million.

This includes the nature of any such scheme, whether it would be on a statutory or non-statutory basis, whether it would apply retrospectively, the arrangements for eligibility, the vaccines that would be included in such a scheme, the criteria for determining an adverse effect, the burden of proof required, the assessment of the level of disability and how this would be conducted, the levels of award, the mechanisms for appealing any decision and how the scheme might interact with the legal process and litigation rights.  Regard is being given to the international experience with such schemes and to their potential applicability to Ireland.  In the course of its considerations, my Department is engaging with other Government Departments and relevant State agencies.  It is not appropriate for me, at this stage in the development of this proposal, to speculate about the detailed design or implementation of any future scheme.</p></reply>

The Health Service Executive (HSE) has in place Service Level Agreements with providers funded under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004, that set out the level of service to be provided for the grant to the individual organisation and requirements in relation to standards of care.  The HSE has established a Governance Framework to cover funding relationships with all Non Statutory Agencies.  It is the policy of the HSE that all funding arrangements with Section 39 agencies are formalised by complying with this Governance Framework.</p>  <p>  The HSE has implemented a measure of withholding 20% of funding from agencies which have not completed the necessary Governance Arrangement process within the required timeframe of 1 March 2017.  Every effort has been made by the HSE to encourage agencies to complete this process within the timeframe, including extending the timeframe to 1 April for some agencies.  Refusal to complete the Governance Arrangement due to pay restoration issues, is not acceptable to the HSE.</p>  <p>  With regard to the IWA specifically, this organisation was unable to complete these governance arrangements outlined above.  Consequently, 20% of their funding under their Service Level Agreement has been withheld.  The full funding will be returned to the agency on completion of the Governance Arrangement process.  </p>  <p>  As outlined to the Deputy in my reply of the 3rd May last, staff in Section 39 agencies were not subject to the provisions of the Public Service Agreements or the FEMPI legislation which imposed the associated pay reductions.  Accordingly, any arrangements offered by each service provider in relation to its employees terms and conditions, including rates of pay, may vary.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question in relation to the provision of personal assistant services relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy. </p></reply>

It is incorrect to state that the payscales of such organisations are 'linked' to those of the HSE.  Should they wish, Section 39 organisations or any private employers are free to choose to apply pay rates which are contained in the health sector pay scales, which are a matter of public record, to their staff. </p></reply>

The Department and the HSE are committed to utilising the key learning from the Winter Initiative to provide a framework around the preparation of similar initiatives in future years.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment made in the Programme for a Partnership Government, my Department has commenced the Health Service Capacity Review over recent weeks.  This Review will have a wider scope than previous exercises and will examine key elements of primary and community care infrastructure in addition to hospital facilities.  The Terms of Reference have been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  While the review will consider capacity requirements over the next decade or so, I am also anxious that it also provides a short-term focus and determines how capital and other investment over the coming years can be best targeted, given the current pressures being experienced within our hospital services.</p>  <p>  The review is being led by my Department and overseen by a Steering Group, which includes senior officials from my Department and the Departments of the Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, and experts with a clinical and academic background.  The Steering Group met for the first time in March, and is meeting again this month.  Also, an independent peer group of international health experts has been established to review and validate the review methodology and findings.  My Department has recently advertised a tender for technical, analytical and engagement expertise to assist in the Review process.  </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is also working with the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to conduct a mid-term review of the capital programme.  Future investment in healthcare infrastructure must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.  The HSE will continue to apply the available funding for infrastructure development in the most effective way possible to meet current and future needs, having regard to the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.   </p>  <p>  I look forward to the emerging findings of these Reviews later this year.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, the position as outlined in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 548, reference No. 26471, of 27 September, 2016, raised by the Deputy, concerning the small number of women who did not meet the criteria for either Scheme, remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  Government approved the establishment of the Lourdes Hospital Redress Board in 2007 following detailed consideration of the findings of the Lourdes Hospital Inquiry.  The Terms of Reference of the Redress Board, which were agreed by Government, were to provide compensation to women who were former patients of Dr Michael Neary, and who had unnecessary obstetric hysterectomies; and to women who were former patients of Dr Neary who were under 40 years of age when they underwent unnecessary bilateral oophorectomies, i.e. the removal of both ovaries or a remaining single functioning ovary at the time of obstetric hysterectomy, or as a gynaecological procedure.  A bilateral oophorectomy left the patient incapable of bearing any more children, as in the case of an obstetric hysterectomy, and in addition caused an immediate surgical menopause in the woman concerned.  The Redress Board determined that awards were payable in 119 cases.</p>  <p>  The Lourdes Hospital Payment Scheme was later established on an independent basis in November 2013 in keeping with a commitment in the Programme for Government to make awards to an estimated 35 women over 40 years who had a bilateral oophorectomy, or the surgical removal of a single functioning ovary, but whose applications were rejected on age grounds alone by the Redress Board.  In order to be compensated, each applicant had to have had an immediate menopause consequent upon the procedure and they had to show that the procedure was medically unwarranted.  Each application was carefully assessed and the Scheme made awards to 47 women who met the criteria under the Terms of Reference.  Thirty-eight applications were refused under the Scheme, because they did not meet the criteria for an award.  The reasons for refusal in each cases is set out in the Final Report of the Lourdes Hospital Payment Scheme, which is available on the Department's website.  Another fifteen applications were withdrawn.</p>  <p>  Both Schemes were administered independently and the medical records of all applicants were provided to the Administrator of each Scheme.  Judge Maureen Harding Clark administered the Lourdes Hospital Redress Board and the State Claims Agency administered the Lourdes Hospital Payment Scheme.  The Department of Health did not have access to women's medical records.</p>  <p>  Minister Varadkar, former Minister for Health, met Patient Focus during 2015 concerning a small number of women who were represented by that organisation, who did not meet the criteria to receive awards under either Scheme.  Following this meeting, Department officials, with the assistance of the State Claims Agency, who had dealt with the medical records of the women as part of its assessment of applications to the Lourdes Hospital Payment Scheme, carefully considered these cases and that of another woman, who had made representations to the Minister and Taoiseach and who was not a member of Patient Focus.  Despite being sympathetic to the women, it was determined that the procedures outlined were clearly outside the terms of the Lourdes Redress Board and the Lourdes Hospital Payment Scheme.</p>  <p>  As the situation remains unchanged since the meeting with Patient Focus and the consideration of these cases, my officials have advised that there is nothing further to be gained from a meeting with persons as requested by the Deputy.  It is of course, open to any woman to seek redress or compensation in the normal way in conjunction with her legal advisors, should she believe that she has a personal injury claim.</p></reply>

The HPRA highlights the fact that all medicines have some risks and a small number of people may develop side effects (also known as adverse reactions).  The clinician treating the patient balances the risks associated with a medicine in the context of the overall benefit of the medicine to the health of the patient and the condition being treated. </p>  <p>  The packaging of all medicines placed on the market must include a Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) leaflet, which sets out detailed product information intended for healthcare professionals.  This information is regularly updated as new data becomes available through various sources of post-marketing experience, including further studies, literature reviews, and evaluation of adverse reaction data.  The product information for authorised medicines is based on information submitted in the application dossier supplied by the company marketing the medicine.  The application is reviewed by experts assessing the dossier, and the product information is updated as appropriate, to reflect the outcome of that assessment.  </p>  <p>  All medicines are also supplied with a packaging leaflet intended for the information of the patient/consumer.  As the package leaflet is the part of the product information that is intended for patients, it uses patient-accessible language.  Product labels and package leaflets play an essential part in the safe and effective use of the medicine by both patient and healthcare professionals.</p>  <p>  Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.  Serotonin is a neurotransmitter chemical in the brain.  The mechanism of action is not fully elucidated, but fluoxetine is thought to work by enhancing the availability and activity of serotonin.  </p>  <p>  The HPRA, in conjunction with European counterparts, continues to review the safety of authorised medicines and takes appropriate regulatory action when necessary.</p></reply>

The timeframes for the other actions will operate over the lifespan of the policy which is 2016 - 2025.</p><p>The policy acknowledges that obesity prevention services in the community as well as specialist hospital services will need to be strengthened.

Among its recommendations was that approximately 10,650 Mental Health Whole Time Equivalents were required to fully implement the policy. </p><p>This figure was based on Ireland&rsquo;s then population of 3.917 million, as indicated in the 2002 census.  The population of Ireland today, based on the most recent confirmed Census figures in 2011, is 4.499 million.  Taking into account this demographic change, the required number of Mental Health Whole Time Equivalents is now 12,240.  As of November 2016, there were 9,576 Mental Health Whole Time Equivalents employed, a gap of 2,664, equalling 78% compliance.</p><p>Since 2012, an additional <font color="#222222">&euro;</font>140 million has been allocated to Mental Health Services.  This has facilitated the recruitment of over 1,150 new posts over the period 2012-16 to implement <i>'A Vision For Change'</i>.</p><p>In relation to Psychiatry of Old Age, staffing has increased in this area in recent years, with 29 teams of Psychiatry of Old Age in place in 2017 compared to 26 teams in 2015.  This is at 74% compliance with <i>'A Vision For Change'</i>figures, which recommended 39 teams nationally.  The expected increase in the population aged over 65 years and 85 years and over and the associated significant implications for the Psychiatry of Old Age services has been identified as a significant issue in the HSE National Service Plan 2017.  This action is clarified within this plan under the mental health strategic priority 3: to deliver timely, clinically effective and standardised safe mental health services in adherence to statutory requirements.  This commits the HSE to further enhancing the community mental health team capacity for Psychiatry of Old Age at a consistent level across all areas within available resources. </p><p><i>'A Vision For Change'</i>suggests one Psychiatry of Old Age team per 100,000 population.  CSO projections for 2021 predict a population figure of between 4.8 million and 5 million.  This would correlate to between 48 and 50 Psychiatry of Old Age teams. </p></reply>

Budget 2017 provided significant additional funding for mental health, which means that the HSE funding for this key care programme will increase from around &euro;826m in 2016 to over &euro;850m this year. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 made allowance for an additional &euro;35 million for services to be initiated in 2017.  Key priorities being addressed in the HSE 2017 Service Plan include youth mental health, further improvement to child &amp;amp; adolescent (CAMHS) and adult services, older people's services and further enhanced out-of-hours response for those in need of urgent services.  Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with this increased allocation will be some &euro;15 million.  There will also be a further additional spend of &euro;9.5 million in mental health associated with increased pay rates.</p></reply>

On foot of the conclusions from the HPRA&rsquo;s report I announced my intention to establish an access programme for cannabis-based treatments, for patients under the care of a medical consultant, for the following medical conditions:</p><p>- spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis resistant to all standard therapies and interventions;</p><p>- intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, despite the use of standard anti-emetic regimes;</p><p>- severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy that has failed to respond to standard anticonvulsant medications.</p><p>The HPRA Report did not recommend the inclusion of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease in the access programme.  This position will be kept under review, and if better clinical evidence becomes available in future, the inclusion of such conditions can be reconsidered. </p><p><i>(ii) </i><i><i>Ministerial licence application route </i></i></p><p>It is the decision of a clinician to prescribe a particular treatment, including cannabis for medicinal purposes, for a patient under their care.  As Minister for Health I have no role in the clinical decision-making process.</p><p>Under the existing arrangements the role of a Minister for Health comes into play when an application for a licence to prescribe medicinal cannabis has been received by the Department of Health from a clinician.  In such cases it is open to me to consider granting a licence under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, for access to medical cannabis for that named patient, where the proposed course of treatment has been endorsed by the patient&rsquo;s consultant who is responsible for the management of that patient, and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.  One such licence has already been granted under this mechanism.</p><p>The main elements of an application submitted under the Misuse of Drugs legislation for a licence for cannabis for medicinal use must include: </p><p>- An outline of the treatment the patient has received to date and justification from the doctor as to why it is appropriate in their patient&rsquo;s specific circumstances to prescribe a Schedule 1 drug;</p><p>- Details of the cannabis-based product which it is proposed to prescribe and administer to the patient;</p><p>- The source of the cannabis-based product;</p><p>- The arrangements for the ongoing monitoring and care of the patient once the cannabis-based treatment has commenced.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s agenda in this regard is clearly set out in the current National Disability Strategy (NDS) which is based on a non-condition specific approach to the delivery of public services and the mainstreaming agenda.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality has responsibility for providing a focal point for the promotion and co-ordination of disability policy.  In this context, the Department coordinated the development of a Programme of Additional Actions in relation to Autism in conjunction with the National Disability Authority through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.</p>  <p>  The Programme of Actions on Autism is in keeping with the cross disability, whole of government, social model of disability approach set out in the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan (2013-2016) but recognises that an increased understanding of autism across the public sector is required to ensure that the implementation of the NDSIP addresses the needs of people with autism on an equal basis to other people with disabilities.</p></reply>

Emergency resources are now deployed on a regional, rather than on a local basis, and the NAS is moving away from ambulance provision from fixed bases to dynamic deployment.  This means that resources can be used across a region, so that if demand increases in one area, other resources can provide cover as required.  New bases have been established at Tuam and Mulranny and a deployment base has been established in Loughglynn. </p><p>The Capacity Review, published last year, identifies particular difficulties serving rural areas.  The Review indicated that the only practical way to improve first response times in rural areas is through voluntary Community First Responder (CFR) schemes.  The further development of a comprehensive national programme of CFR schemes has therefore been prioritised in the HSE National Service Plan 2017.  The NAS continues to work with local CFR Groups across the country to enhance services and greatly values their continued commitment and support. </p><p>In addition, the NAS is supported by the Emergency Aeromedical Service (EAS), a helicopter based transport service, which was established on a permanent basis in 2015 and provides rapid access to appropriate treatment for very high acuity patients, specifically where land ambulance transit times would not be clinically appropriate.  The service operates seven days a week in daylight hours and is specifically targeted at the West, with the highest demand for the EAS coming from Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  </p><p>The issue of voluntary ambulance groups responding to calls was also raised at my meeting with this Group.  I have been advised that in order for the NAS to dispatch a voluntary ambulance, the voluntary provider must meet the required Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) standards.  I would therefore encourage the local voluntary providers to work with the NAS to progress this approach.</p><p>I wish to assure you that the NAS is committed to the provision of a safe, patient focused pre-hospital emergency care service and will continue to develop services in the West and across the country. </p><p>The <i>Programme for Partnership Government</i>commits to additional annual investment in terms of ambulance personnel and vehicles.  &euro;7.2m additional funding was provided to the NAS in 2016, including &euro;2m development funding.  An additional &euro;3.6m has been provided in 2017, which includes &euro;1m to fund new developments.</p></reply>

The Annual Report of the National Treasury Management Agency notes that the SCA resolves the majority of claims by negotiating a settlement, either directly with the plaintiff's legal advisors or through a process of mediation.  In 2015 97% of clinical negligence cases which were handled by the SCA were settled without the necessity for a contested court hearing.  </p><p>The SCA has supplied a report on the information requested by the Deputy.  The data is extracted from the <i>National Incident Management System</i>(NIMS), a system which it hosts for the Health Service Executive, other healthcare enterprises and Delegated State Authorities.  </p><p>The following tables show details on claims finalised for the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health from 1 January 2011 to 11 May 2017 under the following case outcomes:  Settlement Agreed, Case Discontinued/Claim Statute Barred, Indemnity Received, Outside the SCA remit, Case Dismissed and Court Award.  A claim in this context refers to a notification of intention to seek compensation for personal injury and/or property damage where it is alleged that the State was negligent.  The application may be in the form of a letter of claim, an InjuriesBoard.ie application or a written or oral request.  A finalised claim refers to when a claim and all other matters associated with it have been agreed, e.g. costs.  There may still be some associated payments and reimbursements outstanding on finalised claims.  </p><p><i>Table 1</i>Number of Claims by Claims Finalised Year (2011 - 2017) </p><p><b>Number of Claims</b><table><tr><th></th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013*</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017 to 11/5/17</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Settlement agreed</td><td>343</td><td>376</td><td>461</td><td>540</td><td>566</td><td>658</td><td>292</td><td>3236</td></tr><tr><td>Case Discontinued/Claim Statute Barred</td><td>148</td><td>169</td><td>189</td><td>255</td><td>362</td><td>362</td><td>197</td><td>1682</td></tr><tr><td>Indemnity Received</td><td>54</td><td>58</td><td>58</td><td>149</td><td>105</td><td>269</td><td>24</td><td>717</td></tr><tr><td>Outside SCA Remit</td><td>22</td><td>15</td><td>13</td><td>25</td><td>30</td><td>19</td><td>14</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>Case Dismissed</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>11</td><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Court Award</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>17</td><td>3</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>573</td><td>628</td><td>732</td><td>985</td><td>1082</td><td>1334</td><td>532</td><td>5866</td></tr></table>*Please note that in 2013 there was one case that was 'Settlement Agreed' after a Court award appeal</p><p><i>Table 2</i>Paid Total by Claims Finalised Year (2011 - 2017)  </p><p><b>Paid Total (&euro;&rsquo;000)</b><table><tr><th>YEAR</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017 to 11/5/17</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Settlement agreed</td><td>56,370</td><td>56,769</td><td>61,478</td><td>77,282</td><td>77,380</td><td>91,293</td><td>47,074</td><td>467,646</td></tr><tr><td>Case Discontinued/Claim Statute Barred</td><td>753</td><td>903</td><td>878</td><td>606</td><td>2,300</td><td>701</td><td>2,135</td><td>8,276</td></tr><tr><td>Indemnity Received</td><td>606</td><td>491</td><td>310</td><td>563</td><td>389</td><td>162</td><td>436</td><td>2,957</td></tr><tr><td>Outside SCA Remit</td><td>0</td><td>11</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Case Dismissed</td><td>283</td><td>255</td><td>571</td><td>359</td><td>297</td><td>1,565</td><td>38</td><td>3,368</td></tr><tr><td>Court  Award</td><td>808</td><td>3,519</td><td>2,567</td><td>2,934</td><td>1,472</td><td>2,645</td><td>7,143</td><td>21,088</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>58,820</td><td>61,948</td><td>65,804</td><td>81,744</td><td>81,843</td><td>96,368</td><td>56,826</td><td>503,353</td></tr></table>Definitions for the terms used in the tables:</p><p>(i) 'Settlement Agreed', - i.e. a negotiated settlement has been agreed with the Plaintiff for damages or an Injuries Board award accepted.

Instead, these State bodies operate under State indemnity, a self-insurance model whereby the State bears the financial risk associated with the costs of claims.  Acting as the State Claims Agency (SCA), the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) manages personal injury, property damage and clinical negligence claims brought against the HSE.  The Agency utilises and promotes an integrated approach to risk and claims management as suggested by international best practice.</p>  <p>  This approach to insurance is set out in the Public Financial Procedures (Department of Finance, 2008, C8, Section 11): &lsquo;the general rule is that no insurance should be effected against the risk of any loss which, if it arose would fall wholly and directly on public funds.  This is based on the understanding that the risks for which the Government is liable are innumerable and widely distributed, and that losses maturing in any one year are never so large as to materially disturb the financial position of the year, so that it is cheaper in the long term for the Exchequer to carry its own insurance'. </p>  <p>  The SCA is not the insurer or proxy for insurer, so the HSE does not pay a premium to the SCA.  However, there are some insurable risks which are not covered by State indemnity.  In this regard, I have referred the question to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Drinkaware.ie is funded by the alcohol industry.  The Department's position is that the alcohol industry, similar to the tobacco industry, has no role in influencing public health policy.  However, I and other Ministers have met with and listened to numerous alcohol industry representatives.</p>  <p>  I had the pleasure of recently launching a Health Service Executive website and information campaign on the harms of alcohol under the title - askaboutalcohol.ie.  The central tenet of the website and information campaign is about how much we are drinking, how it affects our physical and mental health, and how we can gain more by drinking less.  The Deputy may have heard the campaign information broadcast on radio over the past couple of months.  The website and the associated information campaign will play an important role in providing public health information on alcohol.</p>  <p>  Reducing overall consumption of alcohol is one of this Government&rsquo;s public health priorities.  The current levels of consumption and patterns of drinking (e.g. drinking to excess regularly) are causing significant harm to individuals, their families and society.  In this context the Government approved the publication of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill and it is included in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  Askaboutalcohol.ie and the associated communications campaign is part of a suite of measures included in the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill to reduce the number of people engaged in the harmful use of alcohol.</p></reply>

This legislation is the responsibility of the Department of Justice.  The legislation amongst other issues, deals with conduct in licensed premises.

In the 2017 budget, an additional &euro;3m has been provided for a number of measures aimed at improving the health outcomes of those affected by addiction issues.  The increased funding will support the development of a pilot supervised injection facility in Dublin city centre, the wider availability of alternative opiate substitution treatments for those who are not suited to methadone, improved services for under 18s and more detoxification beds. </p>  <p>  Drug and Alcohol Task Forces play a key role in assessing the extent and nature of the drug problem in their areas and in coordinating action at local level, so that there is a targeted response to the problem of substance misuse in local communities.  Every effort has been made to protect the budgets of Drug and Alcohol Task Forces in recent years.  In excess of &euro;27.6m has been allocated to the Task Forces for community-based drugs initiatives this year, the same amount provided in 2014, 2015 and 2016.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has commissioned external consultants to develop a performance measurement framework to assist in measuring the effectiveness of Drug and Alcohol Task Forces.  The framework will provide a mechanism to target funding allocations on the basis of objective criteria, having regard to the drugs situation in the Task Force catchment areas and other demographic factors.  It will also inform the question of how best to align Drug and Alcohol Task Forces in order to address locally identified needs.  I understand the findings of the consultants report have been considered by the steering group in the context of the development of the new National Drugs Strategy. </p>  <p>  The funding available to address substance misuse will be kept under review in the context of the overall resources available to the health services and the most effective utilisation of those resources.</p></reply>

To ensure that the benefits of the &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant&rsquo; categories are targeted at those who have a genuine interest in farming as a career, Ireland included agricultural education at FETAC level 6 standard or its equivalent as a requirement to qualify for the schemes.  Under the 2015 National Reserve and Young Farmer scheme Ireland introduced increased flexibility in order to maximise the number of eligible applicants into the schemes and students of agricultural education were included if otherwise eligible.  However this flexibility did not receive the approval of the EU Commission.  Therefore, successful applicants under the 2017 National Reserve and Young Farmers Scheme must have completed their agricultural educational qualification by 15 May 2017.</p>  <p>  Where an applicant has fully completed all aspects of their course by 15th May but has not yet been verified as successful or received final certification, a Confirmation of Education Form should be submitted with the young farmer&rsquo;s application.  This form is available to download on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The form is to be filled out by a representative of the college to confirm that the applicant has fully completed all aspects of the course by the 15th May 2017.</p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the National Reserve and Young Farmers Scheme, including educational qualifications, are made in consultation with the Direct Payments Advisory Committee which includes members of the main farming bodies, and agricultural education and advisory services.

When we have more clarity regarding what kind of relationship that the UK wants, we will work closely with our EU partners in trying to seek a new relationship with the UK.</p>  <p>  The UK could seek to limit access to their waters and/or try to gain larger quota shares at the expense of others.  However, that could only happen if the UK were content to ignore the potential repercussions that would certainly arise from the EU side.  </p>  <p>  Any attempt by the UK to alter the status quo at the expense of Ireland and others must, and will be, resisted strenuously.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the negotiations that will take place over the next few years are not a renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The CFP remains in place and will be reviewed in the normal way from 2019.  The current Common Fisheries Policy came into force on the 1st of January 2014.  The European Commission are obliged to report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the current Policy before 31st of December, 2022.  </p>  <p>  In the normal course of events, it would be expected that the Commission would begin the process of review by publishing a Green Paper followed by a public consultation at least 2/3 years prior to December 2022.  However, that possible timetable may well be impacted by the Brexit negotiations.</p>  <p>  In the immediate future, it is the Brexit negotiations that will be my absolute priority.  When the review of the CFP does begin, I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will, as always, be fully engaged to ensure the best possible outcome for our fisheries sector and the coastal communities reliant upon it.</p>  <p>  The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) provides the framework for the long term sustainability of fish stocks around our shores, the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processing industry while supporting our families and communities that depend on the sea for their livelihood.</p>  <p>  The overall EU budget available for the EU seafood sector in the next funding period will be the subject of future budget negotiations between the EU institutions.  In the absence of the UK, the overall budget of the Union is likely to be lower, so difficult negotiations can be expected.  The relative share of the EU seafood funding is determined by the Commission having regard to criteria specified in the EMFF Regulation and new criteria will be set out in a new funding regulation.  These criteria will be an important focus of Ireland&rsquo;s negotiating position for the next programming period and I will be seeking to ensure that they reflect Ireland&rsquo;s needs.</p>  <p>  I am and will remain in close contact with fisheries stakeholders as all of these issues develop and will continue to work with them to ensure that we are all fully prepared for what are likely to be extremely complex negotiations for both the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU and the subsequent CFP reform.</p></reply>

Similarly a range of supports in relation to forestry are provided under the Forestry Programme 2014 to 2020.</p>  <p>  Under Pillar 1, my Department makes annual payments of &euro;1.2bn to approximately 124,000 farmers under the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS).  As part of CAP reform Ireland has implemented the convergence model under the BPS between 2015 and 2019.  All entitlements held under the Basic Payment Scheme are subject to convergence.  Farmers who hold entitlements that have an Initial Unit Value that is below 90% of the Basic Payment Scheme national average will see the value of their entitlements increase gradually over the five years of the scheme.  By 2019, all entitlements for all farmers in Ireland will be at least 60% of the National Average value.</p></reply>

While good progress has been made to date, with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland advising that 9.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirements in 2015 were met from renewable sources, meeting the 16% target remains challenging.</p><p>The Renewable Energy Directive provides a comprehensive framework for Member States to work towards achieving individual and EU renewable energy targets including mechanisms for countries to work together such as statistical transfers, which allow Member States to meet their targets by purchasing credits from Member States that overachieve on their renewable targets.  </p><p>The focus remains firmly on meeting our 2020 target and a number of interventions have been taken to support renewable energy, including the Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff supports.  New measures are also in development including a Renewable Electricity Support Scheme and a Renewable Heat Incentive.  In any event the cost of purchasing statistical transfers, should any potential shortfall in Ireland's target arise, has yet to be established and will depend on a number of factors, particularly available supply and market costs.</p><p>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) in a document entitled Ireland&rsquo;s Energy Targets &ndash; Progress, Ambition and Impacts (published in April 2016) has estimated that the cost to Ireland of not meeting our overall renewable energy targets may be in the range of &euro;65 million to &euro;130 million for each percentage point Ireland falls short of the overall 16% renewable energy target.</p></reply>

The advice identified that amending legislation is required to provide explicit powers to Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) to summarily prosecute offences under the Fisheries Acts and, consequently, a number of prosecution cases nationwide, including some related to the Gweebarra fishery, have had to be withdrawn.  The withdrawal of cases, therefore, arises because of a technical issue with the 2010 Act.  This issue impacts on all fisheries including the Gweebarra.  My Department advised IFI of the relevant position and amending legislation is being progressed as a matter of priority. </p>  <p>  In the interim, all current provisions and offences of the Inland Fisheries Acts continue in full force and effect.  Consequently, anyone who commits an offence remains liable to prosecution within the statutory time frame for initiation of legal proceedings. </p>  <p>  Separately, the issue around fishing rights and title as regards the Gweebarra is entirely a civil matter.  This issue is not connected with, or impacted by, the technical issue with the 2010 Act, which relates exclusively to criminal matters.  The withdrawal of criminal proceedings was not, as suggested by the Deputy's question, in regard to a dispute over fishing rights.  </p>  <p>  As such, a conflation of the two issues could represent a misunderstanding of the situation and is likely to be misleading.  I am happy to clarify matters in that regard.  IFI is fully committed to the on-going protection of the Gweebarra fishery in accordance with the High Court judgement delivered on 19 December 2012.</p>  <p>  I am also advised that anglers wishing to fish the Gweebarra fishery are required to have a valid licence and permit which are locally available.</p></reply>

Recognising this frustration, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the NBP State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.  The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I, together with Minister Humphreys, have established an Implementation Group.  This group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys.</p>  <p>  The first meeting of the Implementation Group took place on 8 March, and was followed by a series of bilateral meetings with action holders.  These discussions have formed the basis of the first quarterly progress report, which I, together with Minister Humphreys, expect to publish shortly.  This report will show that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force, other initiatives are under way to enhance services across the State.  I have signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with a 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.</p>  <p>  In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.</p>  <p>  In terms of commercial investment, mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  However, as mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets and the capacity of the network, as well as by and proximity to mobile telephone antennas.</p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

Typical measures that are provided include attic and cavity wall insulation, low energy light bulbs, lagging jackets and energy advice.  To date, the scheme has upgraded more than 120,000 homes throughout the country.     </p>  <p>  Since the scheme is 100% Exchequer financed I must balance the depth of the renovations that the scheme can offer against the number of people the scheme can help each year.  The cost to the State of the average home upgrade under the Warmer Homes scheme is around &euro;2,500.  External wall insulation can cost between &euro;10,000 to &euro;20,000 per home, depending on the size of the home in question. As such, providing external wall insulation to every home with solid walls would mean the scheme would be helping much fewer people each year.</p>  <p>  As I announced at the Energy Poverty Conference in March, the Warmer Homes scheme is being expanded to offer deeper renovations on a limited basis to those people living in the worst performing homes in terms of energy efficiency.</p>  <p>  Every person who applies to the Warmer Homes scheme has their home surveyed by a professional contractor working on behalf of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  When those surveyors find an applicant who is living in a home that is in a particularly poor condition they will recommend the person for a deeper set of measures. The measures that will be recommended will depend on what the surveyor finds.  However, in general, the surveyors will look at factors including the age of the home, the construction of the wall, the age of the heating system or whether such a system is in place.  SEAI are currently recruiting contractors to deliver these deeper measures and I expect works to start this July.</p>  <p>  I have also amended that scheme so that applicants who received measures under the scheme previously and meet the scheme's current eligibility criteria will now be able to receive cavity wall insulation if it is deemed suitable for their home by an SEAI appointed technical surveyor.  </p>  <p>  I would also note that the Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing pilot scheme is currently operating in the Deputy's constituency.  Under this scheme, people over 55 or families with children up to 12 who are suffering from an acute respiratory condition such as COPD or asthma can apply for a deep energy efficiency upgrade.  The upgrades available under Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing are deeper than the standard Warmer Homes measures and include external wall insulation, boiler and heating system replacement and windows and doors where appropriate.  In each case the actual upgrade provided will depend on an SEAI professional assessment of the home.</p>  <p>  The aim of the Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing scheme is to gather evidence on the multiple benefits that energy efficiency can bring such as decreased health costs, improved wellbeing and better social inclusion.  It is by gathering the evidence for these wider benefits of energy efficiency that we can continue to build the case for increased investment through programmes like Warmer Homes and Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing.  I urge the Deputy to bring this scheme to the attention of her constituents.</p></reply>

My Department received a request for significant additional funding of &euro;5.5m in November 2015 but were unable to facilitate that request at that time as there was no funding available.  Waterford City and County Council has recently submitted some details of costs being incurred on ongoing works on the Greenway and the question of funding for those works is currently being considered by my Department having regard to available resources.

The decisions on the transport elements of the Capital Plan were framed by the conclusions reached in my Department&rsquo;s Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.  Based on the findings in that report it is envisaged that maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority over the next period and the bulk of the roads capital budget, over &euro;4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already underway.  In this context it was not possible to include a range of projects in the Plan given the overall funding envelope available.</p>  <p>  As regards the possibility of additional funding within the Plan period, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has started the Capital Plan review and has indicated that the additional capital funding for allocation across all Departments totals &euro;2.6 billion.  My Department is seeking additional funding for a package of measures, including regional and local roads.  While there is a strong case for additional funding for the transport sector, which was reflected in the Action Plan for Rural Development, there are a multitude of possible national, regional and local projects around the country, the cost of which far exceed available funding.  The final decisions on allocations are matters for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and Government as a whole.</p></reply>

The Final Report of the Tribunal made a total of 64 recommendations relating to its inquiry into those planning matters and payments and included among those 64 was a recommendation that appointments to the Board of the National Transport Authority (NTA) be made by an independent authority rather than the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p>The Deputy is as aware as I am that the remit of the NTA extends far beyond its important role in ensuring better integration of transport and land-use planning in the Greater Dublin Area.  The NTA is the key agency involved in the regulation of public transport services and delivery of public infrastructure not just in the GDA but the State as a whole:</p><p>- It has responsibility for the provision of all PSO bus and rail services across the State through the award of public service contracts with operators; </p><p>- It monitors and reports on the performance of those operators and can reward and penalise operators based on their performance; </p><p>- It licenses and regulates all commercial bus services in the State; </p><p>- It is responsible for the development of integrated ticketing and passenger information in relation to public transport services across the State; </p><p>- It invests in bus infrastructure and cycle facilities throughout the State; </p><p>- It administers and oversees the Rural Transport Programme; </p><p>- It is the designated national authority in relation to passenger rights in bus, rail and maritime transport; and </p><p>- It has a particular role in the GDA in terms of public transport infrastructure delivery.</p><p>So as can be seen from the above, the NTA's role is much broader than that of a purely land-use focussed planning authority, such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la for example.  Its role in relation to land-use planning is primarily to ensure consistency between the adopted land-use plans of local and regional authorities in the GDA with the transport strategy as developed by the NTA.</p><p>The Deputy is aware that in addition to the generally applicable Guidelines on State Board Appointments, appointments to the Board of the NTA must also comply with my Department's new Principles and Procedures, which I have introduced and which complement the Public Appointments Service-led process.</p><p>I am satsified that there are robust and transparent processes in place to ensure suitably qualified and independent persons are appointed to the Board of the NTA.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the local authority's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  Maintenance of private laneways/roads not taken in charge by local authorities is the responsibility of the landowners concerned.  Due to the major cutbacks in roads funding it was necessary for my Department to cease making separate allocations to local authorities in respect of  the Local Improvement Scheme (LIS).  The approved scheme remains intact and local authorities can use a proportion of State grant funding for LIS should they wish to do so.</p>  <p>  While there is a modest increase in funding for roads this year, it will take some years yet under the Capital Plan to restore "steady state" funding levels for regional and local roads.  The primary focus has to continue to be on the maintenance and renewal of public roads.  Local authorities can continue to use a proportion of their Discretionary Grant for the Local Improvement Scheme in 2017.</p>  <p>  In light of the provision in the Programme for Government indicating that, as the economy recovers, the Government will promote increased funding for Community Involvement and Local Improvement Schemes, I will review the scope for making a separate grant allocation once the planned Review of the Capital Plan is completed.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-16a.1459.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017051600085#WREE04800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 560 to 565, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  As with most sectors, Brexit has profound implications for the European aviation sector.  But each sector is also different: one of the big differences for international civil aviation is the fact that it is governed by a unique legal regime under the 1944 Chicago Convention.  This makes the legalities around Brexit quite different to other areas.  For instance unlike most other areas, trade in aviation services are usually excluded from general international trade and investment agreements and instead are governed by a complex web of bilateral agreements between states.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's questions cover a number of the most important issues that Brexit raises for civil aviation.  I answered a number of questions from the Deputy relating to Brexit and aviation on 2 May (questions 1323, 1324, and 1325) and my answer outlined how aviation matters fit in to the whole-of-government approach to Brexit.  Since then the Government has also published a comprehensive document outlining its approach to the Brexit negotiations, which includes a section dealing with transport.</p>  <p>  In relation to transitional arrangements the Government has outlined that Ireland's position is that, in order to provide certainty and continuity, a transitional arrangement, bridging the gap between a withdrawal agreement and a future relationship agreement, will be necessary and should be provided for.  The particular importance for aviation of such transitional arrangements has been emphasised during the process for the development of the Government's approach, including for the reason correctly highlighted by the Deputy, that airlines plan their routes and sell seats up to a year in advance.  Other sectors face similar planning issues, which is why certainty and an orderly withdrawal is being prioritised.</p>  <p>  The EU-US Open Skies Agreement is one of over a thousand international agreements which the EU has entered into on a whole range of issues.  It is the most important EU aviation agreement.  There are a range of possibilities as to how Brexit may impact on this agreement and other similar aviation agreements with third countries.</p>  <p>  A similar range of possibilities arises in relation to the European Aviation Safety Agency. EASA currently has a range of different relationships with non-EU states.  Some non-EU states have full membership of EASA, while others have observer status, bilateral agreements and/or working arrangements.  The UK has played an important role in developing the European aviation safety regime and no doubt it will continue to do so after Brexit.</p>  <p>  In relation to Ireland's bilateral aviation agreement with the UK, this was first put in place in 1946 and was last updated in 1988.  Other Member States have similar agreements in place.  The future status of such agreements will depend on the outcome of the future relationship negotiations with the UK.</p>  <p>  All the above issues do of course pose risks for future air connectivity within Europe.  The Government has been clear that its approach is aimed at minimising the impact of Brexit on our trade and economy and an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  The Government recognises that there is a desire to have clarity and certainty on every detail of the future EU-UK relationship as quickly as possible.  However, we also need to be realistic about the process we are heading into, and the time it will take to reach a full conclusion.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for highlighting these important issues.  However, it is too early in the Brexit process to speculate in any detail on the possible impacts or outcomes.  These questions relate to the future relationship of the EU and the UK in aviation and much depends on progress that can be made during the negotiations on such matters.  Ireland will be ready for those negotiations when they begin and the necessary preparations and consultations are already in place.</p></reply>

The data available shows that progress is being made towards achieving this goal, with 173 site visits recorded in the first quarter of this year.

The Agency therefore requires an adequate supply of marketable serviced land and buildings that can be offered to investors.

This objective is met with the provisions of section 358, which provide that a small company is eligible for an exemption from audit.</p>  <p>  Recital 43 strikes a balance between the requirements of small companies and the interests of third parties that rely on the financial transparency of those companies.  Accordingly, Recital 43 goes on to say that &ldquo;this Directive should not prevent Member States from imposing an audit on their small undertakings, taking into account the specific conditions and needs of small undertakings and the users of the financial statements.&rdquo;  Users of financial statements rely on those financial statements being accurate, meaningful and up to date.  This is an important protection for third parties doing business with small companies, such as suppliers and other creditors.  As a result, it is important that companies file their financial statements on time.  Section 363 is intended to encourage small companies to file their annual returns and accompanying financial statements in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  As small companies can have more than 9 months from the end of their financial year to prepare and file their financial statements, the obligation to file on time is not a significant administrative burden.  As things stand, 90% of all Irish registered companies manage to file on time.  The loss of the audit exemption for late filing is an appropriate and proportionate response given the importance of timely financial information for third parties.</p>  <p>  The audit exemption is not a right for small companies under EU law.  However, I understand that the audit exemption for small companies is provided for in most, if not all, other EU Member States.  I am not aware of the conditions that apply to eligibility across the EU.</p></reply>

There include the development of a Brexit Working Capital Guarantee Scheme and scoping out the need for a longer term Business Development Loan Scheme which would assist firms in investing for a post-Brexit environment.</p>  <p>  Further analysis on Brexit trade impacts by my Department includes: </p>  <p>  - funding a research project being undertaken in close cooperation with InterTrade Ireland by the ESRI to improve our understanding of the impact on cross border trade of different trade and tariff regimes which might be imposed following Brexit.  This will provide useful data on the extent and concentration of cross border trade, including information on this trade by product and firm types and barriers to trade.  Work is nearing completion I expect will be published shortly. </p>  <p>  - undertaking qualitative research to examine the implications for the most exposed enterprise sectors - in terms of trading and economic relationships - of the UK being outside of the European Single Market and Customs Union.  This research is at the firm level and will inform an assessment of the way in which Brexit will affect individual sectors of the economy, and will be completed by the end of this year. </p>  <p>  - currently in the market seeking consultants to undertake a piece of work profiling the composition of trade and investment flows for Ireland and a range of EU Member States with the UK.  This will provide an evidence base to inform Ireland&rsquo;s policy positions as part of the wider negotiation on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU.  I expect this work also to be completed by the end of this year. </p>  <p>  - reviewing our enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025, which will be completed this year.</p></reply>

It should be remembered that this will continue to give Ireland access to a market of 450 million people, even after the UK&rsquo;s departure.</p>  <p>  While Government is working to ensure a close future trading relationship between the UK and the EU, our position is that access to the Single Market must be on the basis of all four freedoms &ndash; free movement of goods, services, capital and people.  The EU's Guidelines for the upcoming negotiations with the UK make it clear that there can be no "cherry-picking" of individual aspects of the Single Market.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently advocated greater progress being made in further strengthening the Single Market, and this will be especially important once the UK becomes a competitor on the EU's doorstep.  As recently as November last, I led an initiative where my Ministerial counterparts from nine other Member States and I signed a joint letter to President Juncker calling on the European Commission to be ambitious in advancing the Single Market for services.  This demonstrates the positive influence that Ireland can bring to shaping the future success of the Single Market, through building alliances with a wide range of Member States across the Union, and which can ultimately enhance the benefits accruing to Irish businesses and consumers.</p></reply>

As the global investment climate continues to evolve, we will adapt accordingly - as we have done in the past - and make sure that Ireland continues to secure new FDI projects and the jobs that go with them. </p>  <p>  Our capacity to continue winning such new investment, despite geopolitical changes, will be aided by the underlying strengths of our FDI offering.  These include our talented workforce, pro-enterprise business environment, first-rate education system and our proven track record as a home to global businesses.  Our continued membership of the European Union and Eurozone has also become particularly important.  </p></reply>

This means that the two-year exit process has now commenced.</p>  <p>  It is hard to predict at this stage the full impact of Brexit.  Much will depend on the nature of the future trade deal that will be negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations are likely to be complex and multifaceted. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Ireland secured support in the recently published negotiating Guidelines.  These Guidelines reflect Ireland's unique concerns regarding the withdrawal negotiations &ndash; to support and protect the achievements, benefits and commitments of the Peace Process, to avoid a hard border, and to protect the Common Travel Area, in conformity with EU law.  </p>  <p>  There is a whole of Government approach in place focusing on Brexit issues and my Department and its agencies are to the forefront of this effort.  </p>  <p>  In March of this year, the Government published a new Trade Strategy, Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World which supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification - promoting diversified export markets in light of the potential impacts of Brexit is a key priority for my Department.  This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth.  The programme of trade missions and trade events for 2017 includes a substantive focus on the EU and third country markets.  In 2017, we have 42 Minister led trade missions to existing and emerging markets.  These have been orientated to reflect an increased focus on EU markets.  Enterprise Ireland is consistently working with client companies focussing on enhancing their competitiveness, capability and levels of innovation to assist them to diversify into new markets. </p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s suite of Free Trade Agreements with 3rd Countries help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish firms.  These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be important for Ireland.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements giving Irish Firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is consistently working with client companies focussing on enhancing their competitiveness, capability and levels of innovation to assist them to diversify into new markets.</p>  <p>  The UK's departure serves to reinforce the importance of the EU's Single Market for the 27 Member States who remain.  Ireland has been a consistent supporter of the Single Market and we have consistently advocated the need to make further progress in the free movement of Services.  Ireland was a cosignatory of a like-minded Ministerial letter to the Commission in this regard last November.  Ireland has also been active at EU level in terms of making progress in relation to the Digital Single Market. </p>  <p>  We must focus on strengthening the institutions of the EU, developing our existing trading relationships and building new ones. </p></reply>

Innovation and technology enable companies to make products and services that are better, cheaper or more novel than those in global markets.  Thus, in order to export and scale, companies must innovate and embrace technology.</p><p>Product lifetimes in global markets are incredibly short (1-3 years) thus necessitating a continuous stream of new and improved products.</p><p>The 2016 report &ldquo;Economic and Enterprise Impacts from Public Investment in R&amp;amp;D in Ireland&rdquo;, published by the Department, has shown that investment in R&amp;amp;D results in improved job creation and enterprise performance, for example: </p><p>- Firms that invested in R&amp;amp;D grew employment by 14% between 2000 and 2014 while those that did not invest in R&amp;amp;D saw employment decline by 40% </p><p>- R&amp;amp;D performing companies grew exports by 181% between 2003 and 2014 compared to a loss of 42% in exports for non- R&amp;amp;D performing companies over the same period </p><p>- R&amp;amp;D activity was identified as being one characteristic of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland client firms that resulted in a growth in sales and exports since 2003.  During the recession, these firms exhibited greater resilience than non-R&amp;amp;D active firms and increased their contributions to sales, exports and employment </p><p>- For Enterprise Ireland client firms funded through the agency&rsquo;s R&amp;amp;D scheme, there was an 8% growth in net employment (22,003 jobs to 23,739 jobs) between 2002 and 2012.  In comparison, there was a 6.2% decline in employment in the total Enterprise Ireland client base over the same period (131,144 jobs to 119,935 jobs). </p><p>The figures above clearly show the importance of research, development and innovation as a driver of firm growth and job creation. </p><p>Going forward, and in order to support companies increase job creation and exports, Enterprise Ireland will continue funding its critical existing innovation supports along with the development of new supports which include: </p><p>- A new programme for Business Innovation targeted at driving innovation beyond selling products based on technical innovations providing more customer focussed process and service solutions; </p><p>- A Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Initiative which is a cross-government process allowing public bodies to use public procurement to source R&amp;amp;D and innovative solutions to solve identified &lsquo;challenges&rsquo;.  This initiative is already providing significant business opportunities for innovation focused companies;</p><p>- New initiatives to equip graduates and researchers in the higher education system with the key skills required by the enterprise base.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy 2017 &ndash; 2020 is cognisant of the future needs of Irish enterprise and the challenges they face such as Brexit.  Driving innovation and competitiveness are key pillars of this strategy aimed at supporting companies drive their global ambition and reach.  Supporting companies to innovative will be critical for Enterprise Ireland to create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 and to sustain the existing record level of jobs.</p></reply>

Employment growth is spread across all regions and all sectors of the economy.</p>  <p>  The goal of this Government is to support the creation of an additional 200,000 jobs by 2020 with 135,000 outside Dublin.  This is a whole of Government effort and is delivered through our integrated Action Plan for Jobs.</p>  <p>  The CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) is the official source of employment data in the State.  The most recent figures available are for Q4 2016.  According to the CSO, the numbers employed in the industry sector increased by 11,100 during 2016, bringing total employment to 258,500 people. </p>  <p>  The annual jobs target is agreed in the Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; the target for 2017 is to help create up to an additional 45,000 jobs across all sectors and all regions. </p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plans for Jobs aim to have an additional 10% to 15% at work in each region by 2020.  The first progress reports on the implementation of the eight regional Plans, covering the period to June 2016, were published in December 2016.  While progress in the implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs is at an early stage, the signs are good.  Employment is growing in all regions.

Of these, 14,535 were permanent/full-time jobs, while the remaining 4,238 jobs were of a temporary or part-time nature.  The total number of manufacturing jobs among the enterprise development agencies in 2016 amounted to 210,958, of which 188,722 were permanent/full-time jobs, and the remaining 22,236 were temporary/part-time jobs. </p></reply>

The certainty, predictability and clear signal that this sends to enterprise - including both Irish owned and foreign owned entities establishing and doing business from here - remains essential.  This certainty has become even more important in the current dynamic and uncertain geopolitical landscape.</p>  <p>  With successful enactment of the KDB (Certification of Inventions) Act 2017, subject to commencement order in the coming weeks, it will benefit companies of all sizes.  </p>  <p>  The KDB (Certification of Inventions) Act 2017 which applies to certain small and medium sized companies facilitates their ability to avail of it without the need for public disclosure of their innovative concept.  The Act is intended to open up the opportunity for companies across a broad spectrum including companies in incubation units right through to high-potential start-ups in all industry sectors once they are generating income resulting from research and development activities.  The scheme should serve to significantly boost innovation and investment in research and development in Ireland and to generate economic benefit and jobs.</p>  <p>  The KDB complements the existing suite of initiatives and supports available to companies that undertake R&amp;D activities in Ireland across the lifecycle of research and development - including R&amp;D tax credits, RD&amp;I grant supports, support for technology acquisition (S291A), significant state investments in National Research Centres and knowledge transfer infrastructures, and advisory supports for accessing Horizon 2020 funding - providing a competitive proposition for business investment. </p></reply>

These enterprises provide jobs for our citizens and contribute to funding the provision of public services.</p>  <p>  The Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP) will be particularly important in the context of Brexit.  The individuals that this programme targets are senior individuals who often input into the decision as to where the company will locate new projects.  The SARP helps to support IDA Ireland to deliver the challenging targets set out in their strategy.</p>  <p>  In response to the challenges of Brexit, Budget 2017 included the extension of the SARP to 2020.</p>  <p>  In terms of work permits, the Irish State&rsquo;s general policy is to promote the sourcing of labour and skills needs from within the workforce of Ireland, the European Union and other EEA states.  Policy in relation to applications for employment permits remains focused on facilitating the recruitment from outside the EEA of highly skilled personnel, where the requisite skills cannot be met by normal recruitment or by training.  </p>  <p>  The employment permits system is ordered through a list structure: the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List, which lists occupations in high demand in the Irish labour market and the Ineligible Categories of Employment List, which lists occupations for which there is ample capacity already in the Irish/EEA labour market.  An evidence-based review of these lists is conducted by my Department twice a year in order to keep the orientation of economic migration firmly in step with the precise needs of the labour market.  My Department has an ongoing public consultations, the most recent just closed on 27th April, to ensure that precise needs of the labour market are reflected.</p>  <p>  Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA, an employment permit may be sought in respect of a non-EEA national who possesses those skills.  For occupations that are not on the Ineligible List and are not on the Highly Skilled List, an employment permit may be sought subject to a labour market needs test being conducted.  All applications are processed in accordance with the Employment Permits Act 2006, as amended and are dependent on a specific job offer.</p></reply>

This grant scheme then passed to the Family Support Agency (FSA) when it was established in 2003 and subsequently to Tusla on establishment in January 2014. </p>  <p>  Up until 2011 applications were invited through an annual public advertisement, however in 2011 due to austerity this scheme was closed and no new applications have been accepted since 2011.  Since 2011 the grantees who received funding in 2011 have continued to receive an annual grant equivalent to their 2011 grant.  This Counselling Grants Scheme is for a total of &euro;245,900 annually and currently there are only 64 grantees nationwide benefitting from this scheme.  With over 4,000 schools in Ireland 64 grantees means that less than 2% of schools are in receipt of support from this scheme currently.</p>  <p>  The Counselling Grants Scheme which was originally established to provide counselling support for children affected by bereavement or loss was affected by austerity cuts in 2010.  The need for bereavement and loss counselling still exists in schools right around the country however without a significantly increased budget it is unfair and unethical to continue providing support to a small number of areas (64 grantees) while excluding all other schools from the scheme.  Opening up the scheme nationally with a current budget allocation of &euro;245,000 is not an option as this equates to less than &euro;60 per school.  Hence the decision was made to cease the scheme in its current format.</p>  <p>  Tusla Educational Welfare Services is very supportive of the provision of appropriate school counselling supports and the option of continuing the scheme with adequate funding to provide the opportunity to all schools and School Completion Programmes nationally.  All School Completion Programmes have been requested to identify unmet needs as part of their annual plan for 2017/18.  Responses identifying gaps in service, including counselling provision for bereavement and loss, are currently being reviewed by Tusla Educational Welfare Service. </p>  <p>  Tusla received a significant number of correspondences in relation to counselling grants and in the interests of ensuring consistent messaging it was decided to prepare one comprehensive response which was forwarded to all the people who had submitted correspondence. </p></reply>

There are also a number of childcare schemes available under the Training and Employment Childcare programmes for parents participating in certain training courses, on community employment and those on Department of Social Protection (DSP) employment programmes.

Membership of the Forum, which is chaired by the Department of Defence, includes representatives from the Defence Forces, an Garda Siochana, Curragh Racecourse, Curragh Racehorse Trainers and Kildare County Council.  The Forum also considers inputs from other representative groups of stakeholders and interested parties as required.</p>  <p>  To date there have been three meetings of the Forum.  Issues discussed have included illegal encampments, illegal parking, dumping, over grazing and the ongoing management, maintenance and protection of the Curragh Plains.  A number of actions were agreed by the members of the Forum to assist in addressing these issues. </p>  <p>  In line with agreed actions, a review of the Curragh Bye-Laws and the Curragh of Kildare Act is progressing with a view to identifying what amendments can possibly be made to provide greater powers to deal with the issues of illegal encampments, illegal dumping, illegal parking and the other key issues identified by the Forum. </p>  <p>  In addition, my officials have recently introduced revised procedures regarding the branding and documenting of sheep grazing on the Curragh Plains.  These changes will assist in having greater control of the numbers of sheep grazing.  Actions to address over grazing will also be progressed in 2017.   </p>  <p>  Plans are being prepared to facilitate progress of a number of other agreed actions including signage and the development of facilities on the Curragh environs.  There are currently no dates agreed for further meetings but my officials are available to meet with members of the Forum to discuss key issues as they arise.   </p>  <p>  I am well aware of the many issues which need to be addressed in the context of the day to day management and use of the Curragh Plains and consequently am supportive and appreciative of the work being undertaken by the Forum.  I am confident that in working together, the members of the Forum will provide the resolve and expertise to greatly assist in the identification and implementation of solutions to the problems which need to be addressed.</p></reply>
