    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-01a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100060#WRA00700"><p>I can assure the Deputy that I am in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner in relation to the measures which are being taken to combat crime and enhance public safety in the city centre area. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na make full use of the extensive range of legislation which is in place to address street crime and anti-social behaviour, including knife crime and drug related crime.  In this regard there is a comprehensive and robust legal framework in place with respect to knife crime including strong Garda powers to search without a warrant and penalties of up to five years imprisonment.</p>  <p>  Tackling this type of crime is central to the overall and ongoing implementation of the Dublin City Centre Policing Plan.  This involves a high-visibility uniformed presence on key thoroughfares, as well as the use of undercover Garda&iacute; as appropriate. As part of the Garda Plan a range of dedicated policing operations and measures are in place including Operation Spire and Operation Pier which target crime with concentrated high-visibility patrolling, as well as a special operation to enhance public order policing on the Liffey boardwalk. Drug crime is further targeted by covert operations such as Operation Viking and Operation Clean Streets.</p>  <p>  The resumption of Garda recruitment and the deployment of newly attested Garda&iacute; are of course key components in providing visible policing in the city centre and elsewhere.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Garda responses, I am sure the Deputy would concur that the issues involved are not simply policing ones. He will also recall that I have previously met with the key state agencies and other stakeholders in relation to various actions which are aimed at improving the general environment in Dublin City Centre, and strongly support this ongoing work. </p>  <p>  In relation to the concerns which have been expressed about drug misuse in the city centre, the Deputy will be aware that  the Government's overall response to the problem of drug misuse, is set out in the National Drugs Strategy for the period 2009-2016. The Strategy is being delivered under the stewardship of my colleague, Minister of State &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, and it provides a coordinated and comprehensive response founded on a partnership approach and work is already underway in planning the development of the new Strategy post 2016.</p>  <p>  I think it is generally accepted that the complex issues which contribute to drug addiction and related behaviours must be addressed in a coordinated and cross-cutting manner.  In response to the particular issues arising in Dublin City Centre a multi-agency street outreach approach is being used to work with vulnerable and high-risk individuals and an offender management programme is being piloted to address repeat offending in the Dublin City area.  These measures, combined with the Government's initiatives to tackle homelessness, are helping to address the broader aspects of the problems referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, the Deputy will also be aware that I strongly support the continued close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dublin City Council and other agencies as well as ongoing consultation with key stakeholders, such as the Dublin City Business Forum.  My Department is maintaining contact with these cooperative initiatives, and I understand that positive feedback is being received in relation to the policing measures being employed by the Garda authorities, and their level of engagement with business and community interests.</p></reply>

In excess of &euro;5 million is being committed to support Operation Thor. This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.</p>  <p>  This special, targeted operation has to be seen in the context of the major investment that this Government is making in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 Garda&iacute; recruited since this Government reopened the Garda College in September 2014. It will also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing. This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles. We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.</p>  <p>  So far this year the Cork City Division has been allocated 7 newly attested Garda&iacute; and 24 new Garda cars as a result of this increased investment.</p>  <p>  Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner, in consultation with her senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including the additional allocation of the &euro;5 million to support Operation Thor.  The Commissioner has assured me that she will aim to maximise the use of these additional resources. A large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders. Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars. Targeting these prolific offenders is a priority, consequently the allocation of resources under Operation Thor will be intelligence led and based on analysis of crime patterns  by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The aim is to deploy resources in advance of where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na anticipate crime might take place in order to prevent the crime occurring.</p>  <p>  In this context the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to detail the additional resources that will be made available to any one County under Operation Thor.  However the Commissioner will continually review the allocation of resources under the Operation, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities across the Garda Regions so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  I am confident that this comprehensive operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by Government investment, will help disrupt the activities of burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders and will improve the safety of all our communities across the country.</p></reply>

Nor was it designed to make findings. Its purpose was to triage the allegations to see whether further action was needed and what that action would be.	It is also important to emphasise that the range of matters covered by the cases referred to the Panel was very wide.  They included property disputes, probate issues, disputes between neighbours, dissatisfaction with the outcome of civil and criminal court actions as well as decisions of the DPP and GSOC.  These are all matters in which I, as Minister, have no role.  Nevertheless, they were considered by the Panel despite the fact that, at face value, they were outside the remit of the IRM.</p>  <p>  I am happy to say that the Panel has provided recommendations to me in all 320 cases submitted to them and has therefore largely concluded its work.  The issuing of notification letters to complainants commenced on 29 June.  To date, 298 complainants have been notified of the outcome of the review of their cases. Letters will continue to issue to all complainants until the process is completed.</p>  <p>  I am mindful that all complainants are anxious to know the outcome of the review of their case and every effort is being made to conclude the process.  In each case a summary is prepared together with a draft letter to the complainant.  Mr Justice Roderick Murphy is continuing to review the summaries and the draft letters of notification to ensure that they are a fair and accurate reflection of the recommendations made by counsel.</p>  <p>  I have previously assured Deputies that where further investigation is recommended by the review then that will occur. Where cases have resulted in recommendations for further action, I have accepted those recommendations.  These include referral to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC), requesting a report from the Garda Commissioner in accordance with section 41(2) of the Garda S&iacute;ochana Act 2005, establishment of an inquiry under section 42(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, establishment of a non-statutory inquiry, appointment of a Legal Advisor.</p></reply>

In excess of &euro;5 million is being committed to support Operation Thor. This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.</p>  <p>  This special, targeted operation has to be seen in the context of the major investment that this Government is making in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 Garda&iacute; recruited since this Government reopened the Garda College in September 2014. It will also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing. This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles. We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.</p>  <p>  Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner, in consultation with her senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including the additional allocation of the &euro;5 million to support Operation Thor.  The Commissioner has assured me that she will aim to maximise the use of these additional resources. A large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders. Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars. Targeting these prolific offenders is a priority, consequently the allocation of resources under Operation Thor will be intelligence led and based on analysis of crime patterns  by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The aim is to deploy resources in advance of where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na anticipate crime might take place in order to prevent the crime occurring.</p>  <p>  In this context the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to detail the additional resources that will be made available to any one County under Operation Thor.  However the Commissioner will continually review the allocation of resources under the Operation, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities across the Garda Regions so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  I am confident that this comprehensive operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by Government investment, will help disrupt the activities of burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders and will improve the safety of all our communities across the country.</p></reply>

The Government Legislative Programme which was published on 22 September includes the Judicial Council Bill amongst those Bills which are expected to be published in the period from the commencement of the current Dail session to the start of the next session.  The Bill has been the subject of extensive consultation with the judiciary, and my Department is working closely with the Office of the Attorney General to bring it to an early conclusion.  I remain committed to advancing this legislation within a speedy timeframe.</p>  <p>  As regards judicial appointments, a consultation process relating to the system of such appointments was conducted in 2014 with the intention of instituting reforms to enhance the current system. The need to ensure and protect the principle of judicial independence was a significant factor in initiating the consultation process.  Further, while the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board process was a model of best practice in its day, almost 20 years from its establishment it was considered worthwhile to review the operation of the entire judicial appointments system to ensure it reflects current best practice, that it is open, transparent and accountable and that it promotes diversity.</p>  <p>  There was a significant response to the call for submissions and, arising from the consultation process, draft legislative provisions to reform and update judicial appointment procedures are being prepared by my Department.  The review, and reform of this area which is of critical importance to the functioning of our system of justice, provides an opportunity to determine how to best respond to the expectations and needs of a modern State.  I anticipate that legislation in the matter will be published in 2016.</p></reply>

There are a number of different offences related to assault, the more serious of which carry heavy penalties.The legislation provides maximum penalties, and in considering sentencing in a given case a judge may consider any relevant aggravating factors, including the age and vulnerability of the victim, which might warrant the imposition of a relatively higher sentence to a similar case where such factors did not arise. There is also statutory provision to allow the DPP to appeal a sentence on grounds of undue leniency.</p>  <p>  While specific crime prevention measures are a matter for the Garda authorities, I am of course concerned that we do all that we can to support and protect elderly and other vulnerable people in our communities.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government is making very significant investments in policing. The resumption of Garda recruitment has provided for the training of 1,150 new Gardai by the end of 2016, increasing the number of Garda&iacute; available for frontline duties. In addition, the expansion and upgrading of the Garda fleet and modernising Garda technology and systems will support more flexible and responsive patrolling, increasing the visible police presence and providing reassurance for our communities, including elderly and more vulnerable persons.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately we have seen several incidents where elderly people were assaulted in the course of burglaries and the Deputy will be aware that we now have a strategy in place under Operation Thor to significantly step-up our response to this form of criminality. Operation Thor is a multi-strand national anti-crime and anti-burglary operation which has been in the planning for several months. It was launched both as a follow-on to recent announcements regarding investment in policing and to coincide with the advent of longer winter nights.</p>  <p>  The strategy being pursued under Operation Thor will entail a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, including additional high-visibility patrols and increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network, as well as a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities as well as enhanced supports for victims.</p>  <p>  Insofar as the particular needs and concerns of the elderly are concerned, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Older People Strategy promotes actions to support and respond to the needs and expectations of older people on an ongoing basis.  This strategy is pursued through various community policing initiatives and crime prevention programmes carried out in partnership with local communities such as Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert.</p>  <p>  The Garda authorities strongly support the ongoing development of these partnership initiatives, and I as Minister greatly value this work. In fact, I have secured a doubling of the funding for these types of initiatives to be funded by my Department in 2016.

Implementation of this programme, including the reforms recommended by the Inspectorate, is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform, chaired by An Taoiseach.</p><p>Following the publication of the Report, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na established an Implementation Steering Group to focus on the implementation of the short<font color="#2F2F2F">, </font>medium and long-term recommendations in the Report.  To assist in the overall reform process a Strategic Transformation Office has been established at Garda Headquarters to coordinate the implementation of the reforms arising from the Inspectorate&rsquo;s report.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has taken a number of important steps to address the issues identified including the establishment of a new Data Quality Team within the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), and the piloting of a new incident recording process to test data review processes. Arising from and building on this work, the Commissioner indicated that further measures will be rolled out to enhance accountability, governance and oversight of investigations.</p><p>In light of the concerns raised by the Inspectorate about the recording of crime data, and the implications for the Official CSO Recorded Crime Statistics, the CSO conducted an in depth review of the crime figures and published its analysis of these matters on 30 June this year. The work of both the CSO and the Garda Inspectorate identified common issues of concern in relation to Garda crime recording processes and systems.  Many of these issues have no doubt built up over time and it is true to say that similar issues have also been found with police data in other jurisdictions.  CSO's analysis clarified and quantified the issues which were identified by the Inspectorate in relation to crime recording.  Notwithstanding these issues, the CSO concluded that the data are of sufficient quality to allow publication of crime statistics, on the basis that care should be taken in their interpretation in light of the report&rsquo;s analysis.  The CSO is working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address these issues and will repeat their analysis at regular intervals to monitor data quality.</p><p>I might also draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to other work being led by the CSO which is chairing an Expert Panel to examine the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendations on crime statistics, including with a view to the development of new crime counting rules.</p><p>I am pleased that there is a programme of work in place to address the issues identified by the Inspectorate so that we can be satisfied that we have accurate, reliable data on crime. This work will be well supported by the very substantial additional provision of &euro;205 million for new technology and information systems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is provided in the Government Capital Plan 2016 - 21.  This level of investment underlines my commitment to progress the important reforms of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na identified by the Garda Inspectorate.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-01a.73.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100061#WRB03100"><p>Operation Thor is a multi-stranded national operation which builds on previous and current Garda operations to tackle crime, particularly burglaries the number of which, as we know, increase with the advent of the long winter nights, in both urban and rural communities nationwide.  In excess of &euro;5 million is being committed to support Operation Thor. This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.</p>  <p>  This special, targeted operation has to be seen in the context of the major investment that this Government is making in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 Garda&iacute; recruited since this Government reopened the Garda College in September 2014. It will also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing. This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles. We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.</p>  <p>  Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner, in consultation with her senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including the additional allocation of the &euro;5 million to support Operation Thor.  The Commissioner has assured me that she will aim to maximise the use of these additional resources. A large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders. Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars. Targeting these prolific offenders is a priority, consequently the allocation of resources under Operation Thor will be intelligence led and based on analysis of crime patterns  by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The aim is to deploy resources in advance of where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na anticipate crime might take place in order to prevent the crime occurring.</p>  <p>  In this context the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to detail the additional resources that will be made available to any one County under Operation Thor.  However the Commissioner will continually review the allocation of resources under the Operation, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities across the Garda Regions so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  I am confident that this comprehensive operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by Government investment, will help disrupt the activities of burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders and will improve the safety of all our communities across the country.</p></reply>

I would again make the point that all of us in this House must be very careful in discussing individual cases of whistleblowing.  Protection for whistleblowers rightly prioritises the confidentiality of the process, which is central to the efficacy of the process.</p>  <p>  Prior to the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 coming into operation, whistleblowing by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was provided for under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Confidential Reporting of Corruption or Malpractice) Regulations 2007, which provided for the appointment of an independent Confidential Recipient to whom Garda members, and civilian support staff, could report, in full confidence, instances where they believed there may have been corruption or malpractice within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  This system was replaced by the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which came into operation on 15 July 2014 as part of this Government's comprehensive approach to enhance the protection available to whistle blowers, including Garda whistleblowers.  GSOC was prescribed under the Act as a body to receive protected disclosures on Garda matters.

I am assured that Garda management in the Dublin Metropolitan Region keep this deployment under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, including with respect to concerns about public order and anti-social behaviour, so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of policing resources. The very significant additional Garda resources which the Government is now making available will undoubtedly support enhanced policing and public safety in all areas, including Dublin City.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that a Public Order Unit is in place in the Dublin Metropolitan Region since 2004, and is deployed as required. The Unit is highly skilled and trained to deal with public order incidents of all gravity up to and including riot. In addition, the Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have developed a clear strategy to address public order concerns within the framework of the Dublin City Centre Policing Plan which has been operational since June 2013.  Garda actions under the Plan include dedicated high visibility patrols in key commercial and public thoroughfares.  These patrols are informed by crime trends, demand studies and footfall in the areas in question, and include dedicated patrols on weekend nights to deal with public order issues in the city centre.</p>  <p>  The Garda approach includes focusing resources on specific areas of the city according to need.  As part of this, a number of targeted city centre policing operations are in place. These operations include Operation Spire, which provides for a high visibility policing presence specifically on O&rsquo;Connell Street at critical times to address anti-social behaviour, drug dealing and related crime.  The operation is designed as a preventative measure and the area is patrolled by uniform patrols supplemented as required by Crime Prevention Unit and Divisional Crime Task Force personnel. The City Centre policing plan is also supported by other operations including Operation Pier which focuses on the Pearse Street District, as well as Operation Viking and Operation Clean Streets which further target the sale and supply of illicit drugs in the city centre.</p>  <p>  Addressing the factors which contribute to public order issues also requires communication and cooperation with a range of relevant stakeholders and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages extensively with business and community interests with respect to crime prevention, enforcement and policing concerns.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 2,000 full-time-equivalent civilian support staff in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na making up 14% of the overall Garda workforce.  Civilian personnel wholly or largely staff several vital operational support areas such as the Garda Central Vetting Unit, the Garda Information Services Centre, and the Fixed Charge Processing Office  They also provide vital support services in a wide range of areas, such as human resources, training &amp;amp; development, IT and telecommunications, finance and procurement, internal audit, research and analysis, accommodation and fleet management, scene-of-crime support and medical services.  In doing so, they release highly trained Garda&iacute; from administrative tasks to operational policing.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that the overall composition of the Garda workforce achieves the right balance between highly trained Garda&iacute; and professional, skilled civilian staff.  Having regard to international experience, there is undoubtedly value in exploring further opportunities for increasing the ratio of civilians to Garda&iacute;, and for releasing Garda&iacute; from administrative and other positions to front-line duties. </p>  <p>  The process which is currently ongoing to civilianise border control functions at Dublin airport and the transfer of these responsibilities from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is an excellent example of this.  The first phase of that project is now completed with civilian staff of INIS operating all passport controls in Terminal 1 on a 24/7 basis from 22 June, 2015.  The civilianisation of front-line immigration checks in Terminal 2 is under way with civilian staff operating checks at the transit desk in that Terminal since October, 2015.  The move to a 24/7 civilian operation in Terminal 2 will be completed over the coming months.  I am also looking at deploying civilian officers to other major ports of entry to the State where this makes sense from a cost and efficiency perspective.</p>  <p>  Further work in this area will be progressed in conjunction with the Garda Commissioner in the context of the report of the Garda Inspectorate of its review under the Haddington Road Agreement.  The terms of reference of that review include all aspects of the operation and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including the structure, organisation and staffing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the deployment of members and civilian staff to relevant and appropriate roles.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding the deliberations of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on this matter, I am committed to tackling the lengthy delays in the protection system.  A number of initiatives have already been taken to deal with the number of cases on hand, including the scheduling of interviews on Saturdays, the transfer of subsidiary protection application processing to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the establishment and subsequent enhancement of a legal panel to assist the Commissioner with this work, and the appointment of additional members to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. </p>  <p>  As I also mentioned in my response to the Deputy on 10 November last, one of the key recommendations in the Working Group Report is the early enactment of the International Protection Bill which will provide for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection, which is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process.  The Bill provides for the transfer of responsibility for the processing of protection applications from the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner to the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is intended to establish a Protection Office within the Department for this purpose.  The Bill also provides for the establishment of an independent International Protection Appeals Tribunal. The new procedure will significantly streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications and will reduce the length of time that persons spend in the Direct Provision system.  Existing best practice will be protected and embedded within the new regime.  The Deputy will be aware that I published the Bill last week with a view to have it enacted by year end.</p></reply>

In excess of &euro;5 million is being committed to support Operation Thor.  This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.</p>  <p>  This special, targeted operation has to be seen in the context of the major investment that this Government is making in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 Garda&iacute; recruited since this Government reopened the Garda College in September 2014. It will also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing.  This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles.  We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.</p>  <p>  Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime.  These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner, in consultation with her senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including the additional allocation of the &euro;5 million to support Operation Thor.  The Commissioner has assured me that she will aim to maximise the use of these additional resources.  A large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders. Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars.  Targeting these prolific offenders is a priority, consequently the allocation of resources under Operation Thor will be intelligence led and based on analysis of crime patterns  by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The aim is to deploy resources in advance of where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na anticipate crime might take place in order to prevent the crime occurring. </p>  <p>  In this context the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to detail the additional resources that will be made available to any one County under Operation Thor.  However the Commissioner will continually review the allocation of resources under the Operation, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities across the Garda Regions so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  I am confident that this comprehensive operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by Government investment, will help disrupt the activities of burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders and will improve the safety of all our communities across the country.</p></reply>

As well as making clear Member States&rsquo; solidarity with France, the focus of Ministers&rsquo; was ensuring an appropriate and unified response to the attacks, including all reasonable measures to counteract the terrorism threat.  In this regard, the Council Conclusions of 20 November 2015 underline the importance of accelerating the implementation of all areas covered by the statement on counter-terrorism issued by the Members of the European Council on 12 February 2015 and in particular of the following measures: the EU Passenger Name Record (PNR) directive, firearms, controls of external borders, information sharing, terrorist financing, and the criminal justice response to terrorism and violent extremism. </p><p>At the meeting on 20 November, I expressed on behalf of Ireland my deepest sympathy to the French Government and to the people of France.  I offered Ireland&rsquo;s support for the Council Conclusions, and in particular the proposals put forward by France.</p><p>In referring to the critical importance of cooperation between the police and intelligence services in combatting terrorism, I expressed my view that enhanced access for EU police and security services to data and intelligence sharing has a critical role in the fight against terrorism.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na already makes full use of the range of information sharing means available to them, including Interpol, Europol and especially bi-lateral information exchange.  I added that we must always be careful to ensure that any additional measures we consider enhance rather than complicate that existing co-operation.</p><p>In relation to the European Passenger Name Record Directive, the Council emphasised that the Directive should include internal EU flights in its scope, provide for a sufficiently long period during which the PNR data can be retained in non-masked-out form and that the Directive should not be limited only to crimes of a transnational nature. I confirmed that Ireland fully supports the compromise proposals put forward by the Presidency in relation to the Directive in the interests of securing early agreement with the European Parliament before the end of 2015.  I am satisfied that the Council&rsquo;s general approach on the PNR proposal, which was established in April 2012 and supported by Ireland, contains a robust set of bespoke safeguards for privacy and data protection in the context of a proportionate framework for providing law enforcement access to PNR data to support the fight against terrorism and serious crime.</p><p>In relation to other issues discussed, I indicated Ireland&rsquo;s support for the proposals relating to terrorist financing, given the fact that disrupting the flow of funds to terrorists is a vital aspect of combatting their activities.

The Deputy should be aware that the overall bed capacity of the Irish Prison System is 4,116. On 26th November, 2015 there were 3,777 prisoners in custody.  This represents a capacity rate of 92 per cent. </p><p>On 14 October 2015, there were 3,685 prisoners in custody. Of that total, 2,040 (55 per cent) prisoners were accommodated in single cells.  There were 660 cells accommodating 2 prisoners (1,320 or 36% of prisoners), 85 cells accommodating 3 prisoners (255 prisoners) and 16 cells accommodating 4 or more prisoners (70 prisoners) of which 12 were dormitory room style accommodation in Shelton Abbey Open Centre. </p><p>I can inform the Deputy that all committals are assessed upon arrival to prison and matters requiring interventions, such as mental health issues and anger management are identified and assessed.  Further, throughout the period of their incarceration, prisoners will be reviewed in order to establish the most practical and suitable programmes available to them to address factors impacting on their likelihood to re-offend upon release.  This assessment process also seeks to ensure that wherever possible, prisoners are accommodated in cells appropriate to their needs.  Some prisoners are more suited to multi-occupancy cells, while others are more suited to single-cell occupancy.</p><p>I wish to add that the Director General of the Irish Prison Service accepted the recommendations contained in the Report of the Commission of Investigation into the Death of Gary Douche (commonly referred to as the McMorrow Report).  A &quot;Cell Sharing Risk Assessment Policy&quot; has been drafted and is currently being piloted in Midlands Prison.  It is intended to roll-out the Assessment tool throughout the Estate in order to improve the safety of prisoners and staff alike.</p></reply>

Checks carried out show a previous UK immigration history in respect of a substantial number of these applicants.  This year the number of applications for asylum is expected to reach over 3,300 compared to 1,448 last year.  A large portion of this increase can be attributed to persons with previous UK immigration histories.</p>  <p>  This matter has been raised at the highest levels between officials of the Department and the UK Home Office, specifically at meetings of the Common Travel Area Forum jointly chaired by the Acting Director of the INIS and his UK counterpart.  Arising from this meeting a joint operation to detect illegal immigrants has been undertaken by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and the UK Border Force to carry out checks at the ferry ports.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is enhanced cooperation with the respective agencies and with the UK to fast track some applications under the Dublin Regulation to return the persons concerned to the UK as quickly as possible.  A similar project is under way to fast track substantive asylum cases through to deportation stage and efforts are underway to enforce a number of Deportation Orders already processed where the applicants have been refused refugee status and leave to remain.</p>  <p>  The immigration service works closely with the UK authorities to monitor and address any immigration abuses between the two countries and share relevant information on an ongoing basis in this regard.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to compile the figures sought by the Deputy without expending a disproportionate amount of scarce resources.  However, I can say that immigration controls at ports of entry to the State remains a crucial element of enforcement and the numbers of refusals of leave to land this year are expected to be significantly up on last years figure of 2,615.  In that regard, it should be noted that in accordance with Section 4 of the Immigration Act, 2004, one of the grounds that a person can be refused leave to land is if the person concerned intends to travel (whether immediately or not) to the UK and would not qualify for admission had they come directly to the UK.</p></reply>

In excess of &euro;5 million is being committed to support Operation Thor.  This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.</p>  <p>  This special, targeted operation has to be seen in the context of the major investment that this Government is making in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 Garda&iacute; recruited since this Government reopened the Garda College in September 2014.  It will also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing.  This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles.  We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.</p>  <p>  Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime.  These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner, in consultation with her senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including the additional allocation of the &euro;5 million to support Operation Thor.  The Commissioner has assured me that she will aim to maximise the use of these additional resources. A large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders.  Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars.  Targeting these prolific offenders is a priority, consequently the allocation of resources under Operation Thor will be intelligence led and based on analysis of crime patterns  by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   The aim is to deploy resources in advance of where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na anticipate crime might take place in order to prevent the crime occurring.</p>  <p>  In this context the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to detail the additional resources that will be made available to any one County under Operation Thor.  However the Commissioner will continually review the allocation of resources under the Operation, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities across the Garda Regions so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  I am confident that this comprehensive operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by Government investment, will help disrupt the activities of burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders and will improve the safety of all our communities across the country.</p></reply>

I recently announced a doubling of the funding for Crime Prevention Initiatives supported by my Department, including the important work carried out by Crimestoppers and the Community Alert programme, and a total of &euro;397,000 will be provided for this purpose in 2016.</p>  <p>  My Department has for many years provided funding to support the Community Alert Programme, which is operated by Muintir na Tire in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This funding is not used to provide direct assistance to local Community Alert (or Text Alert) Groups, but is allocated for the employment and associated costs of the national Community Alert programme, including the employment of regional Development Officers.  These Development Officers provide support to Community and Text Alert schemes and offer advice on how to establish new schemes.

In addition, Garda crime prevention officers are available to give advice to householders, community groups and businesses and there is also a range of crime prevention advice published on the Garda website.</p>  <p>  As part of the recently announced drive to counteract burglary under Operation Thor, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have implemented a public awareness campaign to inform people on how they can enhance the security of their homes and property.  The theme of the campaign is "Lock Up. Light Up." and includes a national and local advertising campaign including coverage on radio, in newspapers and on social media, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's social media channels which have over 300,000 followers. In addition, crime prevention officers are currently distributing 100,000 leaflets with key information and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are using all media opportunities on local and national radio to promote the campaign.</p>  <p>  The media campaign ran initially during the week of 16 November 2015 and it is envisaged that it will run again in January and February 2016.</p></reply>

This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.</p>  <p>    This special, targeted operation has to be seen in the context of the major investment that this Government is making in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 Garda&iacute; recruited since this Government reopened the Garda College in September 2014.  It will also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing.  This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles.  We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.</p>  <p>  Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime.  These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner, in consultation with her senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including the additional allocation of the &euro;5 million to support Operation Thor.  The Commissioner has assured me that she will aim to maximise the use of these additional resources. A large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders. Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars.  Targeting these prolific offenders is a priority, consequently the allocation of resources under Operation Thor will be intelligence led and based on analysis of crime patterns  by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The aim is to deploy resources in advance of where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na anticipate crime might take place in order to prevent the crime occurring.</p>  <p>  In this context the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to detail the additional resources that will be made available to any one County under Operation Thor.  However the Commissioner will continually review the allocation of resources under the Operation, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities across the Garda Regions so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  I am confident that this comprehensive operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by Government investment, will help disrupt the activities of burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders and will improve the safety of all our communities across the country.</p></reply>

The current assessment of the threat to Ireland from this source is that while an attack here is possible, it is unlikely and there is at present no specific information that an attack on Ireland is planned.  The level of threat from this source is kept under constant review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly in the light of ongoing developments and the current international climate.</p>  <p>  The Garda Authorities are taking the security measures necessary, proportionate to the threat, and all the relevant agencies here co-operate closely in respect of any threats identified.  Unfortunately, there is a small number of people here whose activities are a cause for concern in terms of supporting terrorism and extremism.  They will continue to be monitored and, where evidence is available of criminality, they will face the full rigour of the law.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will understand that, of their very nature, the detail of security measures should not be disclosed publicly.  However, in general terms, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will take all possible steps to deal with any threat to this country combining its intelligence base with a well-trained, armed special intervention capacity and a range of other national policing resources.  Where necessary, the considerable skills and resources of the Defence Forces are also available in aid to the civil power.  Of course, this is an international problem and the Garda Authorities will continue to co-operate very closely with their EU and other international security and intelligence counterparts in responding to it.</p></reply>

The direct savings from the Programme as highlighted by the Deputy are modest.  However, it is important to recall that the primary objective of the Programme was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  In its review of the Garda Station Network, Garda management concluded in relation to certain stations, resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.</p>  <p>  The Programme supports the provision of a modern 21st century policing service for both urban and rural areas and  allows  front line Garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility, and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  As a result of the Programme, communities have benefited from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which has enabled An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an improved policing service to the public.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the rationalisation of stations, efforts have been directed towards ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to deliver highly-mobile and responsive Garda patrols in both rural and urban communities.  In renewing the Garda fleet to support front line Garda responses over 640 new vehicles are coming on stream since the start of 2015.  So far this year 370 new vehicles have come on stream including new specialised vehicles with a further 260 vehicles between now and the end of the year.  This investment will provide the Garda&iacute; with additional high powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, cars for surveillance and covert operations, motor cycles for high visibility road policing and vehicles for public order policing.  This investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides an additional &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles over the life time of the Plan.  The increased budget allocation for 2016 will also facilitate additional funding for Garda surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing.</p>  <p>  This substantial level of investment will be accompanied by the continued renewal of Garda personnel with 600 new Garda to be recruited next year on top of the 550 to be recruited by the end of this year.  As the Deputy will be aware, I recently announced the commencement of the 2016 recruitment campaign for new members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It underscores the Government&rsquo;s commitment to seamless ongoing recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that the Service is renewed and has the capacity to provide effective policing services throughout the country.  The 600 new Garda&iacute; to be recruited next year will bring to 1,150 the total number of new recruits since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  So far 295 of these recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are on the ground in communities nationwide.</p>  <p>  The totality of this investment will ensure that Garda&iacute; have the necessary tools and manpower to tackle the scourge of highly-mobile criminal gangs and to disrupt crime, particularly burglaries, across our communities.</p></reply>

In excess of &euro;5 million is being committed to support Operation Thor. This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures. </p>  <p>  This special, targeted operation has to be seen in the context of the major investment that this Government is making in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 Garda&iacute; recruited since this Government reopened the Garda College in September 2014. It will also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing. This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles. We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.</p>  <p>  Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner, in consultation with her senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including the additional allocation of the &euro;5 million to support Operation Thor.  The Commissioner has assured me that she will aim to maximise the use of these additional resources. A large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders. Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars. Targeting these prolific offenders is a priority, consequently the allocation of resources under Operation Thor will be intelligence led and based on analysis of crime patterns  by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The aim is to deploy resources in advance of where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na anticipate crime might take place in order to prevent the crime occurring.</p>  <p>  In this context the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to detail the additional resources that will be made available to any one County under Operation Thor.  However the Commissioner will continually review the allocation of resources under the Operation, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities across the Garda Regions so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  I am confident that this comprehensive operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by Government investment, will help disrupt the activities of burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders and will improve the safety of all our communities across the country.</p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to work to disrupt and to bring an end to the activities of these groups and will continue to give priority to this.  They work in very close co-operation with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in this regard.</p>  <p>  Ireland, like other democratic states, cannot consider itself immune from the threat posed by international terrorism and extremism.  The current assessment of the threat from this source is that while an attack here is possible, it is unlikely.  There is not at present any specific information that an attack on Ireland is planned.  The level of threat from this source has been reviewed since the attacks in Paris on 13 November.  It is kept under constant review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly in the light of ongoing developments and the current international climate.</p>  <p>  The Garda Authorities have been taking all necessary security measures proportionate to the threat and all the relevant agencies here co-operate closely in respect of any threats identified.  The Deputy will understand that, of their very nature, the detail of security measures should not be disclosed publicly.  In general terms, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will take all possible steps to deal with any threat to this country combining its intelligence base with a well-trained, armed special intervention capacity and a range of other national policing resources.  Where necessary, the considerable skills of the Defence Forces are also available in aid to the civil power.</p>  <p>  Of course, this is an international problem and the Garda Authorities will continue to co-operate very closely with their EU and other international security and intelligence counterparts in responding to this shared threat.</p>  <p>  In respect of the resources available, given that the threat from international terrorism and extremism is an evolving one the Garda Commissioner is carrying out a review at present and will let me know what additional requirements may arise.</p></reply>

In excess of &euro;5 million is being committed to support Operation Thor. This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures. </p>  <p>  This special, targeted operation has to be seen in the context of the major investment that this Government is making in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 Garda&iacute; recruited since this Government reopened the Garda College in September 2014. It will also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing. This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles. We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.</p>  <p>  Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner, in consultation with her senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including the additional allocation of the &euro;5 million to support Operation Thor.  The Commissioner has assured me that she will aim to maximise the use of these additional resources. A large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders. Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars. Targeting these prolific offenders is a priority, consequently the allocation of resources under Operation Thor will be intelligence led and based on analysis of crime patterns  by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The aim is to deploy resources in advance of where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na anticipate crime might take place in order to prevent the crime occurring.</p>  <p>  In this context the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to detail the additional resources that will be made available to any one County under Operation Thor.  However the Commissioner will continually review the allocation of resources under the Operation, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities across the Garda Regions so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  I am confident that this comprehensive operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by Government investment, will help disrupt the activities of burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders and will improve the safety of all our communities across the country.</p></reply>

In this regard the Deputy will be aware of the very significant investment which the Government is making to update and upgrade Garda vehicles and technology with a total of &euro;205 million being provided in the Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021.</p>  <p>  All of these important investments in policing capacity are supporting enhanced Garda measures to deal with crime, in particular through the recently launched Operation Thor which is providing a coordinated and robust response to criminal gangs engaged in burglary and related criminality.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-01a.207.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1098" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100063#WRD05200"><p>The process of parliamentary reform is an ongoing one. The Programme for Government outlined an ambitious agenda for D&aacute;il Reform to be introduced in a phased process over the lifetime of the Government.  On foot of this, since 2011 the operation of the D&aacute;il has been steadily reformed to enhance the legislative role of elected members and improve the working of the House.The measures introduced have included the following.</p><p>The number of D&aacute;il sitting days has been significantly increased by reducing the length of D&aacute;il breaks at Christmas, Easter, public holidays and the summer and introducing regular Friday sitting days. During the 45 months the FF, Green &amp;amp; PD Government was in office the D&aacute;il sat 349 days &ndash; an average of 93 days a year. The FG &amp;amp; Labour Government has been in office 56 months and the D&aacute;il has sat for 576 days &ndash; an average of almost 124 days a year, an increase of 31 more sitting days per year. </p><p>The first phase of the D&aacute;il Reform Programme was introduced in the summer of 2011 and included:</p><p>-  An additional Leaders' Questions session on Thursdays, taken by the T&aacute;naiste</p><p>-  Topical Issues Debates to replace the outmoded Adjournment Debates, so as to give Deputies an opportunity to raise issues direct with Ministers from the relevant Department</p><p>-  Friday sittings to enable Deputies to play a fuller role in the legislative process by introducing their own Bills and having those Bills debated on the floor of the D&aacute;il</p><p>-  A mechanism for appeal to the Ceann Comhairle if a Deputy is unhappy with the reply received to a Parliamentary Question</p><p>-  A Pre-Legislative review system where by Ministers could provide the Heads of a Bill to the relevant Oireachtas Committee to review before the Bill was published</p><p>-  Restructuring of the Oireachtas Committee system by reducing the number of Oireachtas Committees from 25 to 16</p><p>-  Introducing a new Oireachtas Committee chaired by an Opposition Deputy to work with Ombudsmen's offices and review petitions. </p><p>In the summer of 2012, further reforms to the Oireachtas Committee system were introduced, which streamlined the structure and provided an additional focus on areas of priority such as Jobs and Agriculture.</p><p>In September 2013 the Government announced the second phase of D&aacute;il Reforms and the D&aacute;il debated and approved changes to Standing Orders in October 2013. These reforms are being phased in and include changes to enable more public involvement in the law-making process:</p><p>-  A Pre-Legislative Stage at an Oireachtas Committee is now a general requirement for non-emergency legislation.  A Minister who does not bring a Bill to Committee for Pre-Legislative Stage is required to explain that decision to the D&aacute;il.</p><p>-  The new Pre-Legislative Stage allows for an unprecedented and extensive engagement by the public in law-making. The Committee can consult with experts and civic society groups; crucially, this takes place before the legislation is drafted.</p><p>-  Where there has been a Pre-Legislative Stage, the Chair or Vice Chair of the Committee has an opportunity to outline the Committee's work to the members of the D&aacute;il during the Second Stage debate after the Minister and main opposition spokespeople have spoken on the Bill.</p><p>In addition, each year the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste will address the D&aacute;il setting out the Government&rsquo;s annual priorities, with Ministers setting out their Department&rsquo;s plans.</p><p>The role of Oireachtas Committees in the Budget process has also been expanded.</p><p>There has been a reduction in the number of Legislative Programmes to two per year.</p><p>The time available for legislative debate in the D&aacute;il has been increased, by increasing the total number of sitting days, extending the length of sitting days and starting at 9.30 am on Wednesdays and Thursdays. </p><p>The way legislation is debated in the Chamber has been improved:</p><p>-  At First Stage, the proposer of a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill now has five minutes to outline the purpose of the Bill to the D&aacute;il and explain the reasons for proposing it.</p><p>-  Where proposed legislation has been the subject of Pre-Legislative Scrutiny, at Second Stage the Chair or Vice Chair of the Committee which considered the Bill at Pre-Legislative Stage has a speaking slot, of the same length as that of the Minister and Opposition Spokespeople, to report to the D&aacute;il on the Committee's findings.</p><p>-  At the end of the Second Stage debate, 45 minutes may be allowed for concluding remarks by Deputies, chosen by the Ceann Comhairle, who have previously spoken. </p><p>The number of Friday sittings has been expanded and the D&aacute;il now sits every second Friday to debate Private Members' Bills and Committee Reports selected using a lottery system. This has encouraged a rapid growth in the number of Bills introduced by Deputies, from 14 published in 2010 to 53 published in 2014.  The new Friday sittings also allow Committees, for the first time, to seek directly to have their own reports debated in the D&aacute;il. </p><p>The system of Topical Issues now requires the Minister or a Minister of State from the relevant Department to reply; if this is not the case, the Deputy who raised the issue can have it deferred until a Minister or Minister of State from that Department is available.</p><p>The time allocated to Oral Parliamentary Questions to Ministers has been standardised to 75 minutes. An ordinary Oral Question will be answered only if the Deputy tabling the Question is in the Chamber when it is reached, and the Deputy is given a brief period, of 30 seconds, to outline the question. </p><p>The Government also passed the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges &amp;amp; Procedures) Act 2013 and the Standing Orders to establish an Oireachtas Inquiry system are now in place. The Banking Inquiry is the first Oireachtas Inquiry established under this new legislation.</p><p>The Convention on the Constitution's 7th Report, on the issue of D&aacute;il Reform, is currently being considered and a response is expected on this over the next few months. </p><p>D&aacute;il Reform is an ongoing process and the Government intend to bring forward a further package of reforms for consideration.</p></reply>

The former employer of the persons concerned has not engaged in any of these processes and therefore the persons are not covered by the provisions of the 1984 Act. </p>  <p>  The Department continues to review the position to establish what, if anything, can be done to progress payments to individuals in situations where employers cease trading without engaging in a formal winding-up process and owe moneys to their employees. The Department is consulting a range of interested parties, including the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Revenue Commissioners, in respect of these issues. Officials from the Department will continue to engage with all relevant parties to try to progress the matter. There are very difficult legal issues that need to be addressed and the potential impacts that any proposed policy development might have must be considered. </p>  <p>  I am not in a position to indicate at this stage when the review will be completed. We do not yet have a legal solution to it because there are all sorts of consequences that might flow from taking a legal position that was not carefully worked out.

The free travel scheme is available to all people aged over 66 living permanently in the State. Applicants who are under age 66, including those with learning disabilities, must be in receipt of a qualifying payment in order to qualify for the scheme. The qualifying payments for those aged under 66 are invalidity pension, blind pension, disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance or an equivalent social security payment from a country covered by EC Regulations or one with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement. Free travel is provided for people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance to facilitate their caring role and support their social inclusion. </p>  <p>  There is a provision for free travel passes for visually impaired children who satisfy the medical conditions for the blind pension. The provision is a long standing one based on supports for the blind, including the blind pension that predated other supports for the disabled. </p>  <p>  Children with other disabilities may qualify for the domiciliary care allowance. This is a monthly payment of &euro;309.50 for a child with a disability. The allowance may be used for the additional costs involved in caring for the child and this may include additional transport costs. On most transport services children under sixteen years of age are charged fares at special concessionary child rates.</p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the free travel scheme to persons who are not in receipt of a primary qualifying payment would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) the Department of Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant. The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary. Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  Where the travel costs are non-recurring, the SWA scheme provides for exceptional needs payments to be made to assist with essential, once-off expenditure in exceptional circumstances. There is no automatic entitlement to such payments. Again, every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. The ENP scheme is not intended to cover circumstances where responsibility for the payment or the expenditure rests with another Government Department or Agency.</p></reply>

In 2014 average appeal processing times for an oral hearing had almost halved to 28.6 weeks and the average time taken to process appeals involving summary decisions had also significantly reduced to 21.1 weeks.  This downward trend in overall appeal processing times has continued to date in 2015 to 25.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 18.3 weeks for a summary decision.  Appeal processing times are closely monitored on an ongoing basis.  </p><p>The reduction in processing times reflects the significant resources which have been invested in the Social Welfare Appeals Office over the last number of years.  </p><p>In addition the Department has undertaken a process of reform in many of its scheme areas aimed at reducing the time taken to respond to requests for submissions in relation to appeals. Appeal processing times are kept under continual review in the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p><p>In addition to the improvement in processing times, these measures have also led to a significant reduction in the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 9,394 at 26 November 2015.</p><p>Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  The system is flexible and accessible and <font color="#2F2F2F">allows multiple reviews and submissions of fresh evidence at all stages.</font>For logistical reasons the process takes longer when an oral hearing is required.</p><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p><p><b>Appeals processing times by scheme 01/01/2014 &ndash;

The Short Term Enterprise Allowance provides immediate access to those who qualify for jobseekers benefit wishing to set up a business.  Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to jobseekers benefit. The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are on social welfare payments to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment over two years - 100% in year 1 and 75% in year 2.  Business proposals must be recommended by a local development company or enterprise office before an application is considered for payment of the allowance.</p>  <p>  To date, there are 435 people availing of the Short Term Enterprise Allowance and 11,900 people availing of the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance, 6,228 of these were awarded in 2015.  Given the nature of the application development process, the Department does not collate statistics on claim processing times with applications received being approved where the applicant is eligible.    Generally, processing time for the award of the BTWEA is relatively short if the applicant has fulfilled the conditions of the scheme.</p></reply>

This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments. Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.</p>  <p>  A person in respect of whom an adult dependent allowance is paid under another&rsquo;s Jobseeker Allowance payment is not required to be unemployed (i.e. available for and actively seeking employment). Such a person may however opt to apply for Jobseekers Allowance and become subject to the normal conditionality of the scheme. The Department facilitates such requests through a mechanism known as &lsquo;claim-splitting&rsquo; whereby the total amount due to a couple is divided into two separate claims. In such situations both members of a couple hold a claim in their own right and have access to the full range of activation supports in line with the normal criteria. </p>  <p>  In addition, in line with the commitment in Pathways to Work, a range of services are available to non-employed persons who are not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment. For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status. </p>  <p>  Unemployed persons not in receipt of payments may be eligible to avail of upskilling opportunities, for example through ETB training for unemployed people (at present there are 1,009 upcoming day courses and 552 upcoming evening courses). Although not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course, they may receive some support for expenses on travel, meals and accommodation.</p>  <p>  An updated Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy is under development within the Department of Social Protection and it is intended to bring this strategy to Government for approval shortly. While the new strategy is still being formulated I expect that it will reflect labour market changes in our economy. In particular whereas the existing strategy was formulated during a period of very high unemployment and focussed on supporting people who are unemployed the new strategy is likely, given the reduction in unemployment and on-going growth in employment, to augment this focus by, in addition, seeking to support an increased level of labour market participation in order to ensure that economic growth can be sustained. The strategy will therefore focus on consolidating previous reforms and on continued prioritisation of key cohorts; as well as considering the expansion of activation services to other cohorts.</p></reply>

It must also be noted that the employer in this situation is the sponsoring organisation and not F&Aacute;S (or the Department of Social Protection (DSP) which now has responsibility for CE).  </p>  <p>  The annual cost of introducing a defined contribution scheme for CE Supervisors was estimated at &euro;3.75m in 2008 by F&Aacute;S. In line with good accrual accounting practice, a one-year provision for the pension claim was made in the F&Aacute;S accounts should the debt materialise. The system of accounting used in F&Aacute;S is the Accrual Accounting method which recognises potential economic events regardless of when the actual cash transaction occurs. This meant that the accrual of &euro;3.75m in 2008 for CE supervisor pensions was simply a provision for an event that may occur (i.e. no actual cash was transacted).  No subsequent provisions were made on transfer of responsibility for the CE programme to the DSP in October 2010.  The Department works under the Cash Accounting method.</p></reply>

These contributions entitle them to access social insurance benefits, including State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardians payment (contributory), maternity benefit and adoptive benefit.  This contrasts with a combined employer and employee PRSI rate of 14.75% paid in respect of most employees, who can then access the full range of social insurance benefits.</p>  <p>  Self-employed workers who become unemployed or ill can establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p>  <p>  In its 2013 report, the Advisory Group on Tax and Social examined issues relating to the provision of social insurance cover for the self-employed on a cost-neutral or cost-reducing context.</p>  <p>  The Group was not convinced that there was a need to extend cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to the self-employed as almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  The Group did, however, find that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted, in cases related to long term sickness or injuries, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.</p>  <p>  In this regard the Group recommended that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  Based on the 2010 report on the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund an increase in the region of 17% would be required for the core contributory State pension plus invalidity pension for the self-employed.  This takes account of the 15% needed to provide the core full-rate State pension, which compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.</p>  <p>  While I am anxious to expand the level of social insurance entitlements for the self-employed, any such change would have to be funded by an appropriate level of contribution.</p></reply>

The budget for CE for 2015 is &euro;373.3 million.</p>  <p>  Significant improvements have been made to the operation and governance of CE since 2012 and these continue in 2015. These improvements have taken place in the context of a changing profile of participants on CE in a challenging economic environment.</p>  <p>  In the past two years, the Department has introduced a special programme for participants entering CE to work on schemes providing early childhood services.  A similar programme is being introduced for participants entering social care services.  The conditions of participation for these groups have been adjusted to accommodate participants engaging in FETAC Major Awards at Level 5 which is the basic entry requirement to employment in these sectors. CE participants on these schemes are permitted to remain for up to a maximum of 3 years continuous participation, on annually renewable contracts and subject to satisfactory engagement in the completion of training and work practice. These conditions apply to all CE participants in these streams.</p>  <p>  The Department recently launched a new Programme Framework for CE Drug Rehabilitation schemes.  The community and voluntary sector and CE sponsoring organisations have made a valuable contribution to the design and content of the programme. Workshops have been provided to CE sponsors and to Departmental staff on the objectives and operation of the Framework which will commence in mid-January 2016. Referred clients can have up to 4 years duration on a rehabilitation scheme and support workers can have up to 3 years continuous participation with annual review provided they are engaged in a relevant major award.</p>  <p>  The Department seeks to improve its labour market programmes, including CE, on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

CESI is the UK&rsquo;s leading not-for-profit company dedicated to tackling disadvantage and promoting social inclusion in the labour market. Based on its knowledge of  how contracted employment services operate in other States CESI provided advice with regard to the design of the JobPath model including detailed financial modelling of a payment by results approach in Ireland.  CESI also assisted with the preparation and delivery of presentations at open consultation fora prior to and during  the procurement process for JobPath itself, with responding to queries from actual and potential tenderers during the procurement process and with the assessment of tenders, in particular the modelling of contract finances based on the prices and performance offers received from tenderers. Given the nature of the financial analysis I believe that publication of the CESI work would undermine the State&rsquo;s ability to secure best outcomes from the existing contracts or indeed from any contracts that might be placed in future years. Accordingly I do not plan to publish the analyses provided by CESI.</p><p>With regard to the procurement process for JobPath the Department issued a Prior Information Notice (PIN) on 1 July 2013 in which it advised the market that it was considering the potential of contracting third party providers of employment services. The Department held 2 information sessions on 26 July 2013 at which it outlined its thinking in relation to how JobPath might operate and invited attendees to provide feedback.  There were over 200 attendees at these sessions. On 7 November 2013 Enterprise Ireland hosted a capacity building and networking event for those interested in providing JobPath services. On 12 December 2013 the Department published a Request for Tenders (RFT). In conjunction with CESI the Department held a &ldquo;technical information session&rdquo; on 9 January 2014 at which a detailed explanation was provided to potential bidders on how to complete the &ldquo;JobPath Tenderer Bid Spreadsheet&rdquo; which was required to be submitted as part of a JobPath tender.  Over 50 attendees were present. The closing date for receipt of tenders was 28 February 2014. Contracts were awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender based on the following criteria (i) cost, (ii) implementation of services, (iii) delivery of services and (iv) contract management and governance. Full details of the JobPath procurement requirements and evaluation criteria used during the tender process are set out in the &ldquo;Request for Tenders for the Provision of Employment Services (JobPath)&rdquo;, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>The procurement process was conducted in accordance with Irish and EU procurement rules. The procurement process was overseen by a board that was chaired at Assistant Secretary level and included an independent external member who was formerly a commissioner of a regulatory body. The board was advised by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office as well as the National Development Finance Agency. The outcome of the process and the recommendation to award contracts were reviewed with D/PER and the final decision to proceed to contract was made by Government. The successful companies were Turas Nua and Seetec.  As is the case with  CESI analyses it is not intended to publish the successful tenders as they contain commercially sensitive information and the bid process is confidential. In any event, to do so would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the contracts now in place and any future procurement that may be undertaken.</p><p>Turas Nua is a new joint venture between FRS recruitment, based in Roscrea, and Working Links, a not for profit UK service provider.  It has been acknowledged by Working Links that some members of its staff incorrectly recorded employment and training placement for jobseekers under the 'New Deal', the precursor programme in the UK to the Work Programme. However the Department of Work and Pension (DWP) has publicly stated that the errors occurred in 2008 as a consequence of its heavy reliance on paper-based transactions and that it is satisfied that these cases were investigated thoroughly by Working Links (the amount involved represented less than 0.05% of the payments at the time) and that appropriate actions were taken, with the associated amounts being repaid. DWP has subsequently awarded additional contracts to Working Links.</p><p>Seetec was accused of fraudulent activity by former staff members in 2013. This alleged fraud related to claims that Seetec inflated employment outcomes for people with disabilities under the 'Work Choices' programme in the UK (referenced in the May 2014 article).  The DWP has publicly refuted these claims and advised the UK&rsquo;s Public Accounts Committee that it has investigated the claims and found no wrongdoing.  The Work Choice programme is designed for persons with disabilities - the clients selected for referral to JobPath do not include such clients.</p><p>It is important to note, that neither of the above companies has been sanctioned by the DWP for any fraudulent activity. The Department is however cognisant of experiences in other jurisdictions with regards to the provision of such services and these have influenced the design of JobPath.  The Department is satisfied, for example, that the potential for the inflation of outcomes will be controlled in Ireland through the use of data matching with Revenue Commencement of Employment records and the Department&rsquo;s own welfare payment systems.</p><p>Significant safeguards have been built into JobPath. These include a service guarantee to ensure that all participants receive a baseline level of service. Both companies will be subject to regular on-site inspections and audits (including examination of financial records) to ensure that JobPath is delivered in accordance with contractual obligations and the Department will undertake customer surveys to determine the level of jobseeker satisfaction with the services provided by the JobPath provides. As payments are linked to sustained employment outcomes (jobs must provide work of at least 30 hours per week for a period of at least 13 weeks with a maximum of four outcome fees being paid in arrears over a 52 month period) providers are incentivised not just to find, but also to sustain, employment for clients.  As part of the bid process providers offered and committed to target employment placement rates and payment penalties can be applied if performance is less than the level committed. Payment penalties can also be applied if service quality, as assessed through Department audits or customer surveys, does not meet required standards. In addition payment rates are linked to employment levels in the economy with automatic discounts being applied if employment levels exceed defined levels set out in the RFT.  I am satisfied that these safeguards, that were not a feature of the Work Programme model in Great Britain, protect the State&rsquo;s interests.</p></reply>

This chip uses cryptographic protocols (using cryptographic keys protected within the secure hardware and by a secure operating system) to allow authentication of the card.  It contains a limited amount of data relating to the card and the cardholder. Some of this data is publically available to any terminal capable of reading contact smart cards - broadly, the data that is visible on the face of the card, for example name, PPSN, facial image, card expiration date. Other data is private, for example, nationality and mother&rsquo;s birth surname. This data is only available to terminals or servers that have been provisioned with secret cryptographic keys in secure hardware by the Department. For security reasons, it is intended to only provide such keys in strictly limited and controlled circumstances associated with the statutory uses of the PSC. </p>  <p>  The Free Travel Variant of the PSC also contains a contactless chip, containing high security features, that facilitates free travel for cardholders, using the infrastructure developed by the National Transport Authority (NTA) to support the Leap card.

If, however, the individual becomes resident for tax purposes in Belgium rather than Ireland, he or she could only be taxed in Ireland on so much of the income from any of his or her professional activities or duties as is derived from the performance of those activities or duties in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of information to taxpayers by the Revenue Commissioners, I am also informed that opinions or confirmations are provided to taxpayers in order to provide clarity and certainty in relation to the applicable tax/duty rules so that taxpayers can file a correct tax return and comply fully with their tax and duty obligations.  While opinions/confirmations are not binding on Revenue, and it is open to Revenue officials to review the position when a transaction has been completed and all the facts are known, generally Revenue will follow an opinion/ confirmation once it can be shown that all relevant information was disclosed and the position did not diverge or deviate from that which was outlined in the information provided in relation to the request for the opinion/confirmation.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that where, following a review or further consideration, Revenue revises its position, the taxpayer will be given notice of the revised position.  In such a case, Revenue will not seek to retrospectively apply a tax/duty charge where it can be shown that all relevant information was disclosed, either at the time the application was made or following a request from Revenue for clarification, and that the information as then disclosed does not diverge from the actual facts.</p>  <p>  I am informed also that, as part of its strategy to deploy compliance resources appropriately in order to maximise tax recoveries from the non-compliant and to minimise the administrative burden placed on largely compliant customers, the Revenue Commissioners, in 2013, initiated a programme of interventions to address non-compliance by some individuals who were providing their services through personal services companies.  In 2014, over 400 audits of contracting companies and a further 300 audits of their directors were concluded, yielding &euro;10.5 million. Over 80% of the audits conducted on companies and their directors resulted in a tax settlement.  In its Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2014, the Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General found that the audits carried out by Revenue under this initiative were targeted effectively.</p>  <p>  Should the Deputy and the individual wish, I will pass further details of the case to the appropriate area in the Revenue Commissioners who will be glad to assist the individual concerned in determining his or her tax position taking account of his or her particular circumstances.</p></reply>

These reliefs are separate and distinct. </p>  <p>  Retirement relief is available to business owners over the age of 55, and allows them to dispose of business assets free from CGT within limits. The operation of CGT retirement relief differs as between persons aged 55 to 65 and persons aged 66 and over. For individuals aged 55-65, the relief applies to the disposal of assets valued up to &euro;750,000 where the assets are transferred outside the family.  Where the disposal is made to a child or favourite niece/nephew, there is no monetary limit to the relief. For individuals aged 66 years and over disposing of business or farm assets outside the family the relief applies to assets valued up to &euro;500,000. For individuals aged 66 years and over disposing of business or farm assets to a child or nephew/niece who has worked full time in the business/on the farm for the previous five years, the relief can be claimed up to a consideration or value limit of &euro;3 million. No changes to these limits or other conditions of CGT retirement relief were introduced in Budget 2016 or Finance Bill 2015.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2016 I announced the introduction of a revised CGT entrepreneur relief, which will allow for a reduced 20% rate of CGT  on the disposal of qualifying business assets up to a lifetime limit of &euro;1 million of qualifying gains with effect from 1 January 2016. There is no condition relating to the age of the entrepreneur. The relief is available to farmers in respect of the disposal of assets used in the farm business, subject to meeting the conditions of the relief. The legislative provisions giving effect to the CGT entrepreneur relief are included in section 35 of Finance Bill 2015, as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. This relief for entrepreneurs does not replace retirement relief, which continues to operate as before. </p></reply>

Firstly, an exemption is available for residential properties .</p><p>In addition, there are two different types of relief available in respect of properties that are occupied by people who are incapacitated or who have a disability. The first is an exemption from LPT for properties that have been constructed, adapted or acquired because of their suitability for occupation by individuals who are permanently and totally incapacitated to such an extent that they are unable to maintain themselves and whose condition is so severe that it dictates the type of property they can live in. The second relief takes the form of a reduction in the chargeable value of a property that has been adapted to make it more suitable for occupation by a person with a disability, where the adaptation work has resulted in an increase in the chargeable value of the property and the payment of additional LPT.  I propose to bring legislation before the Oireachtas shortly to give effect to recommendations in the recent Report on the Review of the LPT in relation to changed approaches to the implementation of <i>inter alia</i>the reliefs from LPT in respect of properties occupied by persons with disabilities. </p><p>There are also payment deferral options available to certain property owners whose income is below specified  thresholds or who have experienced personal insolvency or financial hardship, during a particular year. In these situations, a property owner is entitled to defer payment of his or her LPT liability, in full or partially. The thresholds for full deferral are &euro;15,000 per annum for a single person or &euro;25,000 for a couple and &euro;25,000 (single) or &euro;35,000 (couple) for deferral of 50% of the liability. These thresholds can also be increased by an amount equivalent to 80% of any annual mortgage interest payable on the person's main residence.  </p><p>Interest is charged on LPT amounts deferred at a rate of 4% per annum instead of  the 8% interest charge applied to late or non-payment of LPT. </p><p>For those who qualify for deferral but do not wish to defer their payment, or those who do not qualify for deferral because they do not meet the necessary criteria, Revenue has provided a wide range of payment options, some of which can be phased over the course of the year including deduction-at-source from payments received from the Department of Social Protection. </p><p>If the Deputy wishes to provide details of any particular case, I will ask my officials to pass this information to Revenue in order that a specific response can be provided regarding any options available.</p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and maintain revenue to reduce the budget deficit. It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced, and is applied at a low rate on a wide base.  </p><p>The USC, like the Income Levy before it, does not apply to social welfare payments, such as the contributory and non-contributory State pensions, or payments of a similar nature.  However occupational pensions, including occupational pensions of retired civil servants, are liable to the USC if the payment is greater than the exemption threshold, which for 2015 is &euro;12,012.  </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, delivering on a commitment in the Programme for Government, the USC was reviewed by my Department in the lead up to Budget 2012. The report is available on my Department's website at <i>www.finance.gov.ie.</i>The issue of USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public servants who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of that review.  Such individuals are (or were) liable to modified rate PRSI, which does not generate an entitlement to the State Pension.</p><p>The Government decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these individuals from the USC charge as it would be very costly and difficult to achieve, and it would involve all income earners with the equivalent income benefiting from the exemption.  In addition, it would also undermine the principle of the USC being applied to income with few exceptions. </p><p>However, as a result of the review of the USC, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum. Budget 2015 provided for a further increase in the exemption threshold to &euro;12,012 and I announced in my recent Budget speech that this threshold will increase to &euro;13,000 per annum from 1 January 2016. It is estimated that over 700,000 income earners will not be liable to USC at all from next year.  </p><p>This exemption threshold equalises the position for single individuals whose sole source of income is the State Contributory Pension with Public Service pensioners whose pension is at an equivalent level. Furthermore, I intend to continue to reform the tax system in future budgets should we be returned to Government and subject to having the required fiscal space.  </p><p>For the reasons outlined, I have no plans to amend Finance Bill 2015 to change the application of the USC on Public Service pensions. I would point out that the changes to the income tax system included in Budget 2015 mean that individuals who paid Income Tax and /or USC in 2014, including pensioners, are seeing a reduction in their tax bill this year where incomes are equal. Budget 2016 is now continuing this process of reducing the tax burden on low and middle income earners including, among other changes, a decrease in the three lowest rates of USC announced to take effect from January 2016.</p></reply>

A key priority for the National Payments Plan is to reduce overall cheque usage in Ireland to EU levels. In this regard Revenue is currently processing almost 98% of tax payments (by value) and 84% of tax repayments (by value) through electronic channels. Further system upgrades in early 2016 will increase the number of tax repayments suitable for repayment through electronic channels.</p>  <p>  While Revenue's preference is for customers to pay and file online using Revenue's Online Service (ROS), payments can also be made by Direct Debit, Single Debit Authority, which operates like an 'electronic cheque' and enables once-off payments to be made directly a bank account, or by credit/debit card. </p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed to me that while its strong preference is to process all payments via the various electronic channels, this does not mean that it will refuse a cheque payment from a taxpayer.  However cheque payments are more expensive for both the taxpayer and for Revenue and staff will always encourage customers to consider the cheaper electronic methods.</p>  <p>In regard to tax repayments, Revenue will transfer the amount owed directly to the taxpayer's bank account where systems permit and the relevant details are available. The electronic transfer means that the funds are available to the taxpayer/business much quicker than if repaid by cheque. However, in situations where it is not possible or the necessary bank account details are not available to facilitate an electronic transfer then a refund can be made by cheque.</p></reply>

This is one of the recommendations in the Review of the Local Property Tax submitted to me by Dr. Don Thornhill, which has been published on the Department of Finance website.  The postponement of the revaluation date means that home owners will not be faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values  and it gives sufficient time for the other recommendations in Dr Thornhill's report to be considered in full. I propose to bring legislation to give effect to the postponement before the Oireachtas shortly. This legislation will also give effect to two of the recommendations in the review report in relation to changed approaches to the implementation of the pyrite exemption from LPT, and reliefs from LPT in respect of properties occupied by persons with disabilities, both of which are being implemented on an administrative basis by the Revenue Commissioners at my request.</p>  <p>  Issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Report will be a matter for consideration by the next Government.</p></reply>

The Central Bank published two Economic Letters in July 2015; 'Switch and Save in the Irish Mortgage Market' and 'Mortgage Interest Rate Types in Ireland'. These reports are available on the bank's website at the following links:</p><p>and .  The report on switching examined how many borrowers could save by switching provider, the costs involved in switching, the numbers switching and initiatives that would benefit borrowers, including increased information and greater transparency on mortgage products. The report on mortgage interest rate types looked at the number of borrowers on different interest rate types, the propensity of contracts to change rate type over time and the level of instalments for different mortgage contract types. </p><p>These reports do not directly relate to the issues raised by the Deputy in his question.  Nonetheless, as the Deputy will be aware, I have taken steps to ensure that the banks provide options for mortgage holders to reduce their monthly repayments. Last May, I requested a report from the Central Bank on the topic which was subsequently published on my Department's website and on the Central Bank's website. This report was entitled 'Influences on Standard Variable Rate Pricing in Ireland' and is available here: . </p><p>This report found that the spread between official ECB rates and the standard variable rate is relatively high and that new lending rates are above average compared to European peers. However, they noted that the pricing of loans reflects three main factorscredit risk, competition and bank profitability. Credit Risk is influenced by the high level of non-performing loans and the lengthy and uncertain process of collateral recovery; Competition is weak and this is not unrelated to the credit risk as new entrants may be deterred from entering the Irish market; Bank profitability is constrained by legacy issues. Profitability is needed to build capital buffers and to meet increasing regulatory requirements. </p><p>It should also be noted that the interest rate charged by banks is determined taking into account a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding.</p><p>Last May I met with the six main mortgage lenders and outlined my view that the standard variable rate being charged to Irish customers was too high. The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers.</p><p>In September I concluded a series of follow up meetings with these banks and the reality is that the majority have put options in place to allow borrowers reduce their repayments. These options range from lower variable rates to new suites of variable rates based on loan to value and reductions in fixed rates. </p><p>While it is a matter for each individual borrower to decide what suits their circumstances, I encourage both new and existing borrowers to see what is available to them in their circumstances or, for existing customers, to consider moving to another bank, where possible, if the offer is not satisfactory. In this regard, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) website www.consumerhelp.ie is a valuable source of information on the rates charged by various financial institutions.</p><p>You may also be aware that on 12 November the Central Bank published a consultation paper on proposed increased protections for variable rate mortgage customers. This is called Consultation Paper CP98 and is available on their website. The suggested measures fall under three broad categories: </p><p>- Lenders would be required to publish a summary statement of the factors that impact on their variable rate and the criteria and procedures that apply to setting such rates; </p><p>- On an annual basis lenders would be required to notify variable borrowers of alternative mortgage options.  They would also have to notify borrowers of these options when increasing SVR rates and provide borrowers with a link to the Competition and Consumer Protection (CCPC) website to assist borrowers who wish to switch; </p><p>- The Central Bank is consulting on increasing the notification period for variable rate increases (it is currently 30 days) and they are also consulting on a proposal to require the lender to state the reason for changing the rate. </p><p>The closing date for submissions to the public consultation is 12 February 2016.  </p><p>This initiative should increase transparency around the factors which influence a banks' standard variable rate pricing.</p></reply>

These amendments were passed by the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  USC rate bands for employees are divided equally across the year, assuming a 52-week or 26-fortnight year.  However a calendar year consists of 52 weeks and 1 day, or 52 weeks and 2 days in a leap year.  As a result, once every 5 to 6 years for weekly-paid employees the additional day will be a payday, resulting in 53 paydays falling within the calendar year.  Similarly, once every 10 to 12 years a 'fortnight 27' arises for fortnightly paid employees.  As no USC rate bands remain for that year, the full amount of the pay is liable to higher rates of USC, resulting in a lower net income for the employee in that week or fortnight.</p>  <p>  The same issue arises for income tax purposes, and regulations provide for an additional set of credits and rate bands to be allowed in a 'week 53' or 'fortnight 27' year.  The amendments that were made to the Finance Bill will provide for additional USC rate bands to cater for the additional payday which falls within the calendar year, so that individuals will not have a larger USC liability solely because of the weekday on which their salary payment falls. This will bring the application of USC into line with that of income tax.</p>  <p>  The amendments also ensure that those who are exempt from USC due to low income do not become liable to USC on all of their income solely as a consequence of the additional day in the calendar year being a payday.  It similarly provides that those who benefit from the exemption from the higher rates of USC, including those over 70 and medical card holders whose income does not exceed &euro;60,000, will not inadvertently become liable to higher rates of USC as a consequence of the additional payday falling within the calendar year.</p>  <p>  These amendments will come into effect for the current year which means that individuals affected by this issue who are due to be paid on 31 December this year will benefit from the changes. In cases where payroll providers do not implement the changes within sufficient time for the benefit to be provided to employees in their last salary payment of this year, the relevant refund may be claimed back from the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

This is not sustainable, as the State cannot afford to continue to purchase works, goods and services in a manner that undermines the level of services it can deliver.</p>  <p>  The central procurement frameworks and contracts established by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) have been designed to optimise benefits including savings to the State through the strategic aggregation of its buying power. Aggregation arrangements such as multi-supplier frameworks can, where appropriate, address local supplier issues.  </p>  <p>  The reform of public procurement in Ireland is being carried out in a manner that recognises the clear importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in this country's economic recovery.  The Guidance to Contracting Authorities (Circular 10/14) issued by OGP in April 2014 encourages public bodies to break large contracts down into lots where reasonable to do so. Lots may be based on goods or services descriptions, usage patterns, size and nature of customer demand and/or geographical location. Lots enable smaller businesses to compete for smaller elements of a larger contract. However it has to be done in a way however that does not expose the State to undue risk or significant management overheads.</p>  <p>  The implementation of procurement reform is still at a very early stage.  Procurement savings of &euro;100m over 2013 and 2014 have been reported by the OGP and its partner sector sourcing organisations. These forecast savings benefits represent only those cost reductions that can be estimated with a degree of confidence.  I am confident that the Government target of between &euro;450 - 500 million in procurement savings can be achieved as implementation of the programme progresses.</p>  <p>  Public procurement savings are necessary to enable public service organisations deliver much needed services within tighter budgets and to deliver value for money to the taxpayer.</p></reply>

It is the combination of these factors rather than any one factor that has contributed to an increase in overpayments.</p><p>1.  Non-compliance with the standard self-service processes that were introduced as part of the roll out of shared services across the Civil Service.  Employees are now responsible for notifying their own absences and forwarding medical certificates in a timely manner, and managers are responsible for updating the absence record and return to work notification process, all through self-service. These features are standard self-service processes in many other public and private organisations, but were only introduced as self-service responsibilties into the Civil Service for the first time in 2013. When these responsibilities that are part of the standard process are not completed in a timely fashion, this significantly increases the risk of overpayment.</p><p>2.  The issue of non-compliance with procedures or missing medical certifications is being addressed by management in each participating Public Service Body. My Department continues to engage with local HR Departments to assist them address the issue of non-compliance with the absence reporting process itself and to have a positive impact on their own Departmental overpayment balance. The data is showing a positive trend.</p><p>3.  The new Public Service Sick Leave Scheme (2014) whereby people are reaching the limits of paid sick leave quicker than they previously would have, has made a very significant contribution to reducing absenteeism across the Public Service. However, an unintended consequence of reduced access to paid sick leave has been an increase in the number of overpayments. This can also be seen in organisations that are not serviced by PeoplePoint. A review of this circular is currently underway within my Department to evaluate and address any operational difficulties with it.</p><p>4.  Another key factor giving rise to overpayments is that the majority of staff are paid in advance as opposed to arrears. As a result there is an inherent overpayment built into the system when a sick leave limit is exceeded. Once an organisation becomes a customer of PeoplePoint, the responsibility for recouping any monies owed transfers to PeoplePoint, regardless of the cause or date of overpayment.  A single civil service recoupment policy was developed by my Department in March of this year which sets out the standard procedure for recouping money from any staff member when an overpayment occurs.  This policy addresses a number of issues including the principles underpinning the recoupment of overpayments; the recoupment process itself; non-standard arrangements and repayment options.</p><p>5.  When PeoplePoint began operating in 2013, a large number of new staff were hired into PeoplePoint.  The length of time required to upskill so many new staff contributed to some delays in processing leave and absence transactions in the past. This issue has been addressed through training and development and quality checks, and there is close monitoring of key performance indicators against service levels targets and these are being met.</p><p>Significant progress has been made on the issue through prioritisation and a highly collaborative effort across Accounting Officers, HR Departments and Payroll Centres. A robust communication plan is in place to educate and alert managers on the impact of failing to carry out their responsibilities in the absence process that causes overpayments. Monitoring and reporting on overpayments occurs on a monthly basis to the HR Shared Service Centre Programme Board and on a bi-monthly basis to the Shared Services Steering Board comprising Secretaries General.</p><p>In relation to data protection, a <b>Data Protection Policy for Shared Services</b>(March 2014) is in place for all shared service centres, and this includes PeoplePoint. Each operation has a fully trained Data Protection Compliance Officer (DPCO) in place. The DPCO is supported by the Operations Governance Manager in Corporate unit of the National Shared Services Office. Compliance officers are ready to respond to any breach of security swiftly and effectively. All staff in operations receive data protection training at induction, and refresher training on an annual basis.</p><p>The reporting of data breaches within operations is managed through the DPCO who gathers the data on the breach. Any breach is treated with the utmost seriousness. A breach is investigated, reported and assessed through a root cause analysis approach. A process in in place in each operation to report breaches to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, the Customer Department Data Controller, the data subjects as appropriate under the guidance of the Customer Department Data Controller, D/PER Data Controller and the Department of Social Protection.</p></reply>

Any application received will be assessed under the eligibility criteria, which include a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding.</p><p>Fingal County Council applied for and was approved funding of &euro;57,800 under this scheme in 2012 to carry out a Coastal Erosion Risk Management Study of Portrane to Rush which included Burrow Beach. The funding was drawn down in 2013 following completion of the study.</p><p>Following the severe storms of Winter 2013/2014 total funding of &euro;200,000 was provided via the Vote of the OPW to Fingal County Council following a Government decision for repair works to damaged coastal protection infrastructure, which included projects at Burrow Beach.</p><p>No applications have been received for a project at Claremont beach.</p><p>It is a matter for the local authority to prioritise and progress works.</p><p>The OPW is currently undertaking a national public consultation on draft flood maps until 23rd December, 2015. Draft maps are available to view online at or in the books of maps located at local authority principal offices. These are predictive draft flood maps in accordance with the requirement of the EU Floods Directive 2007 (2007/60/EC) and show risk from fluvial (river) and coastal flooding. They assume that the topography of the shoreline is constant and do not make allowances for erosion.</p><p>The OPW has undertaken a national assessment of coastal erosion (including erosion rates) under the Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) and the results of this study have been published on the OPW website.

It is a long established and proven location for international business with a particularly strong track record as a centre for manufacturing excellence.</p>  <p>  There are currently 116 FDI client companies employing 14,575 staff across the region.  This represents 10% of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s total client company portfolio. The region&rsquo;s success has led it to become the 3 largest region by number of FDI companies, even though it is only the 6th largest regional population centre.</p>  <p>  As Limerick is the gateway of the region, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s Mid-West regional office carries the logo &lsquo;Invest in Limerick&rsquo;, which allows e-mail recipients the option of clicking on the logo to follow a link to the Connect and Invest/Limerick web site. The logo is included as a means of encouraging extra traffic to the site and encouraging extra client meetings where the whole of the Mid-West region can be promoted, including Clare and North Tipperary.</p>  <p>  &lsquo;Invest in Limerick&rsquo; is an interactive experience designed for use on tablet, smartphone and PC. Information on location, education, lifestyle and existing IDA Ireland client companies and indigenous companies is provided through images, video and text, which are continuously updated.</p>  <p>  While significant new names businesses across a broad range of internationally-traded services have been attracted to the region in recent years, it has also maintained its position as a manufacturing location with newly arrived projects of scale from companies such as Regeneron, J&amp;J, Ethicon Bio Surgery, Optel Vision and Amax Technologies complementing long established entities such as Analog Devices, J&amp;J Vistakon, Cook Medical, Zimmer, Molex, Element Six and Proctor and Gamble.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s FDI clients are primarily located in 4 Mid-West locations; Limerick City/County, Shannon, Ennis and Nenagh.  Mid-West FDI employment represents 8.5% of IDA total employment with an average company size of 122 employees.  Employment in Mid-West FDI companies increased by 1,208 in 2014.</p>  <p>  Finally, IDA Ireland assumed responsibility for FDI engagement with the Shannon area/companies in January 2014.</p></reply>

Developing all-island initiatives and cooperation can, in certain circumstances, better build our competitive advantage internationally.</p><p>Extensive links have been forged by EI with various agencies and bodies in Northern Ireland and that Agency&rsquo;s work in this context has focused on liaison with, and participation in - the Ireland Fund; Joint Business Council; International Fund for Ireland; Special EU Programmes Body; the North South Secretariat; as well as local authority- led cross border networks.</p><p>In particular there is close co-operation between <i>Invest Northern Ireland</i>(INI) and EI. A Memorandum of Understanding is in place between EI and INI to enable clients of both agencies to access market services, trade missions/fairs, and seminars of one another and to provide INI clients with access to EI management development programmes such as <i>Leadership 4 Growth</i>and the <i>International Selling Programme</i>. Regular bi-lateral discussions and meetings are held between the various parties.  There is also close collaboration between EI, INI and InterTrade Ireland (ITI) on the specific Cross Border programmes which are run by the latter body, in order to ensure effective operation and non-duplication.  </p><p>Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland cooperated in relation to a Trade Mission to Singapore in December 2013 which was specifically targeted at companies from both jurisdictions who are active in the aerospace sector. I was delighted to have been involved with the Northern Ireland Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment Ms. Arlene Foster MLA, in shared promotional events on that Trade Mission.</p><p>In relation to IDA Ireland, that Agency cooperates with INI in the context of regional and all-island economic development, recognising appropriate opportunities to pursue mutually beneficial cross border co-operation on aspects of economic policy and infrastructure/spatial planning. An example of shared co-operation between IDA and INI was the jointly developed North West Business Technology Zone (NWBTZ). The fundamental aim of this initiative was to capitalise on the combined strengths of Letterkenny and Derry City as an economic corridor. The focus was on developing compatible infrastructure and property solutions, which are now in place, to assist in the enhancement of the region&rsquo;s attractiveness for investment.</p><p>Where appropriate, IDA Ireland and INI co-operate on company visits where both jurisdictions are being considered by foreign companies.  These visits are, in the main, usually initiated by IDA&rsquo;s network of overseas offices.  However, it should be noted that IDA Ireland competes with INI Ireland for inward investment in certain areas.</p><p>The economies of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland both have a highly educated workforce and the IDA highlights this competitive advantage to perspective investors. To this end, the skills pool available both North and South of the Border are presented to potential investors as a key competitive advantage of investing in the Border region on the island of Ireland. For example, PayPal now located in Dundalk, made a decision to invest in this location based on the pool of skilled staff it could recruit from the large catchment area incorporating both sides of the Border. Its operation is now a significant employer in the region, having had a number of investment expansions since initially established.</p></reply>

It is an ambitious strategy, with the objective of delivering growth over the next decade that is sustainable, led by strong export performance, builds on our sectoral strengths, and that is underpinned by innovation, productivity, cost effectiveness and competitiveness. We aim to build resilience into our economy so that we do not suffer again as we have done in the past number of years.</p><p>We have 135,800 more people at work than when we launched our first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012. Our export performance has been exceptional, with exports by Enterprise Ireland clients at a record of &euro;18.6bn last year. Employment in EI and IDA supported firms has grown by over 40,000 since 2012.</p><p>We set a target in 2012 to increase employment by 100,000 by 2016. We achieved that ambitious target and have now exceeded it. We want to go further and to replace all the jobs lost during the recession and to realise sustainable full employment over the longer term.</p><p>Enterprise 2025 is a strategy that aims to build an economy that will not just achieve full employment but will sustain it in the long term. It has the commitment across government to take focused actions to deliver growth that is sustainable, led by strong export performance and underpinned by innovation, productivity and competitiveness.</p><p>The ambition in Enterprise 2025 is that unemployment in all regions will be within 1 percentage point of the national average.  Although challenging, this can be realised and the strategy is about all regions benefitting from employment growth that is sustainable over the longer term.</p><p>The policy focus through the North East/North West Regional Action Plan for Jobs, the enterprise development agency strategies and the Local Economic and Community Plans, as well as the forthcoming Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies are directly pertinent in this regard (cohesive and connected strategies that take both a national, top-down perspective and a bottom-up approach to leverage regional strengths and commitment are crucial to achieving the ambition). A continued and sustained focus on addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, delivering broadband infrastructures, strengthening the interconnections between HEIs, research institutes and enterprises will all influence the outcome.</p><p>The North East/ North West Action Plan for Jobs, launched yesterday, 30 November, aims to deliver 28,000 extra jobs in the counties of Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal by 2020.  Key sectors targeted as part of the plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agri-food, manufacturing/engineering and tourism, as well as areas targeted for future growth like digital payments, cleantech and creative services.  <font color="#2F2F2F">Among the 152 actions in the plan to be delivered over the period 2015-2017 include:</font></p><p>- Achieve an increase of at least 25% in the number of start-ups in the region, and a 25% improvement in the survival rate of new businesses;</p><p>- Increase the number of IDA investments in the region by 30-40% up to 2019. This will result in a minimum of 61 additional projects for the North East/North West region by 2019;</p><p>- Progression of a Digital Payments Cluster along the M1, building on the success of companies such as PayPal, eBay, State Street, Vesta and Yapstone already established to act as a magnet to other indigenous and FDI companies in this sector;</p><p>- Establishment of a North East Regional Skills Forum to ensure the flow of critical skills to enterprises in the region;</p><p>- The Local Enterprise Offices will disburse over &euro;2.2million in grant funding, and provide training and mentoring support to over 1,500 business-people per year in the region;</p><p>- A Regional Innovation Forum for the North East/North West region to help support more companies to innovate and engage in R&amp;amp;D.</p></reply>

The games sector in Ireland encompasses a breadth of areas including, for example games localisation, games development, platform development/porting, technology development/middleware, publishing and customer and community management activities and involving both foreign owned and Irish owned operations.</p>  <p>  Because of how data is classified, and the nature of the sector itself, tracking of employment in the games industry and related activities proves challenging. Analysis undertaken by Forf&aacute;s in 2011 estimated that total employment in the sector stood at around 2,200 having experienced a five-fold increase from a low base of an estimated 400 in 2004. This was driven mainly by rapid growth in foreign direct investment in the sector over the period, particularly in activities such as customer and technical support, community management and games localisation. In tandem with this growth, there has also been considerable expansion within the broader consumer internet sector (including social media and mobile internet) to which a large part of the games industry is inextricably linked and with other related activities such as software development, financial services, online gambling, information security, animation &amp;amp; film production, and creative arts (music, art, literature).This is a broad sector that continues to evolve and faces considerable disruptive competitive forces globally &ndash; forces that are shifting the nature of the activities, channels to market, players and competitors &ndash; although there are more recent indications of greater stability in the market. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, Ireland continues to attract foreign investment in the wider sector and continues to have a hotbed of very early stage start-ups and independent games designers, with new entrants every year. The Irish owned element of the Irish games cluster is still relatively young by international standards but its reputation is growing and awareness within the investor community to the attractiveness of the Irish games sector is increasing. A number of Irish games startups (in middleware and content) have raised seed and follow on series &lsquo;A&rsquo; funding investments over the last 24 months. Current exports from the Irish owned segment account for over 95 percent of their turnover and are oriented towards the UK and North American markets in the main. </p>  <p>  In response to PQ 318 of 29 September (two months ago), I highlighted the fact that many of the actions set out in the Forf&aacute;s report (2011) have been delivered upon since I established the Games Cluster Development Team in 2012. For example: </p>  <p>  -  a pilot &ldquo;hothouse&rdquo; initiative for undergraduate and Post-Leaving Certificate courses was devised and run in late 2013, which saw students from games, animation and multimedia courses working in multi-disciplinary teams on projects supported by an industry mentor;  </p>  <p>  -  a leading games expert visited Ireland for six weeks in September and October 2014 as part of a Fulbright U.S. Specialist Award in conjunction with the HEA and carried out master classes and curriculum reviews of Digital Games courses at a number of Irish universities and colleges; </p>  <p>  -  EI&rsquo;s Competitive Start Fund (&euro;50k equity) has had a significant impact on the early stage indigenous games sector since December 2010. Over this period, EI has funded over 20 Games companies to date. The cohort has also availed of a number of start-up management development programmes; </p>  <p>  -  IDA Ireland sees indications of a stronger pipeline for production activities in the closely related animation sector post the enhancement of section 481.  </p>  <p>  - CEOs are collaborating in a structured way to grow the cluster to the next stage of international growth through industry representative groups such as Games Ireland. Indigenous indie developers have recently set up a new representative body called &lsquo;Imirt&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  As with other companies in the technology and creative sectors, games companies can avail of the range of direct supports provided by the enterprise agencies such as the Seed Capital fund, In-market and Management development, R&amp;D funding and tailored company expansion packages. A range of financial instruments also exists to assist companies which are not sector specific. </p>  <p>  The enterprise development agencies have worked to heighten awareness within the sector of the existing R&amp;D supports available to the Games sector. They held a number of R&amp;D supports workshops and issued an enterprise friendly guide on R&amp;D tax credits which included examples of relevance to games companies. </p>  <p>  Games companies that can avail of existing R&amp;D supports and R&amp;D tax credits may be in a position to avail of the recently announced Knowledge Development Box (KDB) which will be provided for in the Finance Bill. There will also be a mechanism put in place to facilitate small and medium sized enterprises with income of less than &euro;7.5 million arising from IP and group turnover of &euro;50 million which will be introduced during 2016.  The Capital Gains Tax Entrepreneur Relief  introduced in Budget 2016 will also be available to those operating in the games sector (subject to certain criteria) as will the Earned Credit Income credit for self-employed and the extended 3 year corporation tax relief for start-up companies. Other non-sector specific longstanding tax related investment incentives include the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) and Start up Refunds for Entrepreneurs (SURE).</p>  <p>  It is important to note that Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness for business investment across a range of sectors involves range of factors that can influence location decisions. For example, the talent base associated with, and relevant to, the games sector is a significant attractiveness factor. Ireland also possesses a long history and tradition in technical and creative content development, through our innate storytelling abilities seen through the success of our animation industry to the international recognition of Ireland today as a centre of excellence for technology investment. Investment in Ireland&rsquo;s broadband/internet infrastructures also has had a strong role to play in underpinning new activity in the games sector in recent years. </p>  <p>  We have recently launched Enterprise Policy 2025 which sets out the ambition to have 2.18 million people in employment by 2020. The strategy spans a range of sectors including the ICT and creative sectors, of which the games industry is a part. Through the enterprise development agencies, and together with the industry, and we will work to ensure the employment growth potential of this dynamic sector is realised.</p></reply>

Over 20,000 jobs have been created in the North East/North West region, which includes Donegal, since 2012. Jobs supported by the Enterprise Agencies in the region - IDA, Enterprise Ireland, and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta - have increased by 2,877 since the beginning of 2012. Unemployment in this region has fallen from a high of 17.8% to the current rate of 9.3% since the Action Plan for Jobs was launched.</p>  <p>  The objective of the Regional Action Plans is to capitalise on the strengths and assets of each region to further maximise enterprise growth and job creation.  The initiative is building on the success of the national Action Plan for Jobs, and encouraging regional stakeholders - including enterprise agencies, Local Authorities, higher education institutions, other public bodies and the private sector - to come forward with innovative ideas to boost job creation in their own region.</p>  <p>  The purpose of these Regional Action Plans is to build on existing strengths and opportunities in each region, and while individual plans may reference infrastructure issues, it is not the intention to address such issues within these plans as these are prioritised within the Government&rsquo;s National Capital Expenditure Framework in the areas where it can achieve greatest benefit and value for money.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for the North East/North West, which includes Donegal, was launched on Monday 30 November. The plan identifies collaborative measures that will enable the region as a whole to realise its economic potential and create jobs.</p>  <p>  Key targets for the North East/North West region are to increase employment by 10 to 15% over the period to 2020, win 61 FDI investments by 2019, increase the number of start-ups in the region by a minimum of 25%, and improve the survival rate of new businesses by 25%.</p>  <p>  A number of actions target the particular strengths and assets of the North West. IDA will collaborate with Enterprise Agencies, ETBs and Institutes of Technology to develop a marketing proposition to support an Insurance and Technical Services cluster; Udaras na Gaeltachta will support the creation of 300-500 new jobs in Gaeltacht regions; a North West Skills Forum will be established to increase the flow of critical skills to the region; F&aacute;ilte Ireland will promote and market the Wild Atlantic Way and will examine the development of new loops to encourage a greater spread of visitors to the region; and the development of a Renewable Energy Innovation Centre at Killybegs will be explored to maximise the potential of the North West&rsquo;s natural resources.</p>  <p>  In addition, as part of its property programme, IDA has committed to investing in new property solutions in Sligo and Dundalk, amongst other centres, over the next three years.</p>  <p>  All regional Action Plans will be supported by investment of up to &euro;250 million over the next five years, including &euro;150 million for a property investment programme by IDA Ireland.  The intention is that a further sum of up to &euro;100 million will be made available over the next five years through three competitive calls to be administered by Enterprise Ireland. These competitive calls will be targeted at innovative and collaborative approaches to support job creation across the regions.</p></reply>

Migration through the permits system is intended to complement the primary policy objective of Government, the up-skilling of the resident population at all levels.</p>  <p>  Prior to September 2015, there were very limited options for meat boners to access the employment permits system.  This is because the occupation was on the Ineligible Categories of Employment List (ICEL), which is set out in Regulations. This List is reviewed and updated bi-annually, a process that involves a formalised and evidence-based approach. My Department obtains and considers advice from the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SMLRU) in SOLAS, as well as consultation with key stakeholders including Government Departments, agencies and industry representatives.  In their Annual Skills Bulletin 2015, the EGFSN states that attracting and retaining skilled butchers/de-boners remains a challenge for the meat industry in Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department, together with the Department of Social Protection, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Education and Skills, conducted extensive discussions over many months with the industry.  During these discussions the meat industry made commitments to create additional employment and engage in training and upskilling of their existing employees, if they were given access to the permit system. On foot of these commitments, I signed Regulations on 1 September, providing for a limited number of employment permits for meat boners at a remuneration level of &euro;27,500 or more per annum.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will report to me on the industry&rsquo;s progress in meeting their employment creation and training commitments and no further permits will be granted to the sector unless the Government is satisfied that these commitments are being met.</p></reply>

Own Resource Income refers to revenues derived from for example redemption of shares and dividends from equity investments, grant refunds, rental income etc.</p>  <p>  EI received &euro;77.5m exchequer funding for administration and general expenses for 2015.</p>  <p>  EI does not maintain cash reserves over and above its working capital requirements. EI draws down its exchequer funding on a weekly basis from my Department. It only draws down funds that are expected to be paid during these periods less any estimated own resource income receipts. Where the estimated own resource income receipts plus exchequer funding exceeds the estimated expenditure the exchequer requirement is reduced accordingly. This ensures exchequer funds are only drawn down when required and EI&rsquo;s cash book balances are kept to a minimum where possible.</p>  <p>  The anticipated end of year position is that EI will have spent the total exchequer and ORI allocations, thus fully meeting its 2015 commitments.</p></reply>

Prior to that date, the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine was focussed on animal welfare as it related to farmed animals.  Wider animal cruelty issues were dealt with under the Protection of Animals Act 1911 which was within the remit of the Minister for Justice.</p>  <p>  The Animal Health and Welfare Act provides a framework within which the welfare of animals can be safeguarded and I am hopeful that the significantly increased levels of penalties for offences of animal cruelty provided for under the Act will act as a deterrent to animal welfare abuses. It is worth noting that the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 has significantly expanded the range of legal requirements around animal welfare. New provisions include the requirement on owners to ensure that animals under their control had adequate supplies of food and water, shelter and veterinary care.</p></reply>

The Control authorities have on-going information in relation to the vessels operating in the Irish Exclusive Fisheries zone including their activities and characteristics. Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service. As Minister, I am precluded from getting involved in operational matters including in relation to law enforcement.</p>  <p>  Article 10 of Control Regulation 1224/ 2009 requires all fishing vessels exceeding 15 meters in overall length to fit and maintain in operation an Automatic Identification System (AIS) which meets the performance standards of the IMO SOLAS Convention.</p>  <p>  Monitoring of fishing vessels in the Irish Exclusive Fisheries Zone is undertaken by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Naval Service using the Fisheries Monitoring Centre which has access to both AIS and VMS data for fishing vessels. The use of AIS positioning data through satellite technology enables vessels to be visible at all times. Public website systems do not have access to the same technology and because of this some vessels&rsquo; AIS data will not always be visible on these public websites.</p>  <p>  Monitoring of the AIS data for these vessels over the past number of weeks in the Fisheries Monitoring Centre has revealed no instances of non-compliance with the AIS regulations.</p>  <p>  Any non-compliances with fisheries regulations in the Irish Exclusive Fisheries Zone will be dealt with under the parameters of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006.</p></reply>

This has included a large scale systematic and targeted survey of forests, nurseries, hedgerows, agricultural environmental schemes and roadside plantings across the whole of the country which commenced at the beginning of July. The field element, laboratory testing, and analysis have recently been finalised and the outcomes of the survey and other work are currently being assessed.</p>  <p>  In addition, a review of policy in relation to the disease is being carried out by my Department in co-operation with colleagues in DARD in Northern Ireland following the outcome of the summer surveys.</p>  <p>  Preliminary results show that due to the high number of findings of ash dieback, especially in native hedgerows, Ireland would not be in a position to apply to the EU for Protected Zone status for the disease. The possibility of removing the embargo on ash sales under a plant passport system for nurseries, for plants which have been free of the disease for at least two years, is being considered.</p></reply>

It is a set of rules for managing EU fishing fleets and for conserving stocks. The CFP operates within the international framework of the Law of the Sea.</p>  <p>  Control of the vessel within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone is a matter for the Irish control authorities who monitor fishing activity of all vessels operating the area.  The Control authorities have on-going information in relation to the vessels operating in the Irish Exclusive Fisheries zone including their activities and characteristics.  Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service. As Minister, I am precluded from getting involved in operational matters including in relation to law enforcement.</p>  <p>  In relation to the overall framework for fisheries control in the EU, in October 2009 a new regulation dealing with fisheries controls was adopted. Council Regulation 1224/2009 establishes a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy. Control and inspection is now focused where it is most effective through an approach based on systematic risk analysis. Inspection procedures are standardised and harmonised for all stages in the market chain, including transport and marketing.  The Control Regulations were introduced so that there is a common EU level playing field and to provide for an effective range of controls across EU waters.</p>  <p>  One of the key elements of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy is the introduction of a phased ban on the discarding of unwanted fish catches. The first part of the landing obligation, the ban on discarding pelagic stocks such as herring and mackerel, came into effect on the 1 of January 2015. The EU Commission adopted a Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1393/2014 on 20 October 2014 which implements a discard plan for certain pelagic fisheries in north-western waters in line with the recommendation of the North West Waters Member States Group.</p>  <p>  A Control Experts Group from the North West Waters Regional Group of Member States has been set up and has produced a draft set of recommendations on additional control measures for the pelagic sector in respect of the landing obligation in pelagic fisheries. The views of the Pelagic Advisory Council in accordance with article 18 of the CFP basic regulation (EU No 1380/2013) on the recommendations have been received and will be fully considered.</p>  <p>  The draft recommendations are being considered by the NWW Member States Group. The measures recommended by the Control experts cover a range of actions including the use of cameras or other remote sensing equipment on all large pelagic vessels, both freezer vessels and our own RSW (Refrigerated Seawater Tank vessels) to support the landing obligation. It also recommends control observers &ldquo;for individual trips to address dynamically - assessed risks of a more transient nature.&rdquo; It is important to note that the flag Member State would be responsible for placing control observers on its vessels and funding is a matter for each Member State. I consider that any strengthened control measures must provide tools to both the flag Member State and the coastal Member State to better monitor and control fishing activities. We will continue to work closely with the North Western Waters Member States to identify the control actions that are most useful so that the landing obligation is fully respected.</p></reply>

As part of that programme, I sanctioned &euro;150,000 for site investigation works at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre, the report on this site investigation will include vital information on the nature of the material to be dredged in any future dredging project. It is anticipated that the Report on the Site Investigation will be issued in early 2016. This information is necessary for the preparation of a Dumping at Sea licence application which will be required before any dredging project can commence.</p>  <p>  The information from the report is also necessary before an informed estimate of the cost of a dredging project in Howth can be made.  As with all other developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, a dredging project at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre will be considered under future Capital Programmes on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing priorities.</p>  <p>  I am considering the suite of projects for inclusion in the 2016 programme, in addition to commitments on possible longer term projects and I will make an announcement on these issues in due course.</p></reply>

The Forum has met on six occasions and stakeholders have agreed to a broad range of outcomes which address issues of concern for the sector in areas such as weight and age specifications, the Quality Payment system, live exports and producer organisations. At the November Roundtable last year, agreement was reached between MII and farm bodies on a range of outcomes covering a range of aspects in the beef sector. I expect all of the participants at the Beef Roundtable to adhere to the agreements reached.</p>  <p>  Questions of price and market specifications are matters to be determined solely between the purchasers and the sellers of cattle. Prices paid for cattle are determined by supply and demand market dynamics and by a range of other factors such as disposable income, consumer preferences and competition from other meats and sources of protein.  As with any Minister for Agriculture in the EU, I can have no role in influencing commodity prices in Ireland. I do note however that 2015 has been a relatively positive year for beef prices in Ireland with the yearly average to date up 8% on last year. </p>  <p>  Of course, the best interests of this very important industry will ultimately be served by ensuring a continuing supply of high quality cattle to the processing sector, and, subject to market context, this objective can be best achieved by providing a reasonable level of remuneration to suppliers for their efforts. I would also encourage processors to ensure that their systems for determining price are as open and transparent as possible to the farmer and that any adjustments or changes regarding specification criteria are clearly communicated and have regard to the realities of the production cycle.</p></reply>

In addition, within the 6 to 12 miles zone access is restricted to the south coast. Ireland has designated Natura sites in off shore waters to protect vulnerable deep-sea habitats. This Department is not responsible for the designation of Natura sites.</p>  <p>  Under the Common Fisheries Policy, Council Regulation (EC) No 812/2004 of 26/4/2004 sets down measures concerning incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries. The Regulation requires that, inter alia, Member States design and implement monitoring schemes for incidental catches of cetaceans using observers on board the vessels flying their flag and with an overall length of 15m or more, for defined fisheries. The fisheries subject to this requirement includes pelagic fisheries. </p>  <p>  The Regulation does not require that every vessel carries an observer and the Regulation puts the obligation on the Flag Member State to design and implement the scheme rather than the vessel or the coastal state in whose waters the fishing takes place. It is a matter of competence for the Flag Member State of the vessel concerned to ensure that observers are onboard where required under their national scheme. Ireland has submitted its Annual report for 2014 to the EU Commission in respect of the Irish fishing fleet.</p></reply>

The Control authorities have on-going information in relation to the vessels operating in the Irish Exclusive Fisheries zone including their activities and characteristics. Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service. As Minister, I am precluded from getting involved in operational matters including in relation to law enforcement.</p>  <p>  The SFPA has advised me that it actively monitors the activity of the large pelagic freezer trawlers within Irish Exclusive Fisheries Zone and that these vessels have now left the area.</p>  <p>  The SFPA has monitored the movements of these vessels when they were in the EFZ through VMS and declared catches through ERS. In general terms it advised that its monitoring indicated particular compliance risks around vessels with entitlements for individual species of fish. This risk assessment had informed the SFPA&rsquo;s identification of some of those vessels as a high priority for at-sea inspection, and aircraft surveillance. </p>  <p>  The SFPA is reliant on the seagoing fishery patrol activity of the Naval Service to verify compliance of vessels not landing into Ireland. Boarding vessels of this size at sea creates specific challenges and during the period when the vessels were in the EFZ, the operational decision of the naval service has been that weather has been too severe. </p>  <p>  In relation to the overall framework for fisheries control in the EU, in October 2009 a new regulation dealing with fisheries controls was adopted. Council Regulation 1224/2009 establishes a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy. Control and inspection is now focused where it is most effective through an approach based on systematic risk analysis. Inspection procedures are standardised and harmonised for all stages in the market chain, including transport and marketing. The Control Regulations were introduced so that there is a common EU level playing field and to provide for an effective range of controls across EU waters.</p></reply>

The Justice and Home Affairs Council held an emergency meeting in the week following the appalling attacks in Paris on 13 November and Ministers were at one in seeking an appropriate and unified response to those attacks, including all reasonable measures to counteract the terrorism threat.  In this regard, the Council Conclusions of 20 November 2015, agreed by all the Member States, underline the importance of accelerating the implementation of all areas covered by the statement on counter-terrorism issued by the Members of the European Council on 12 February 2015 and, in particular, of the following measures: the EU Passenger Name Record (PNR) directive, firearms, controls of external borders, information-sharing, terrorist financing and the criminal justice response to terrorism and violent extremism.</p>  <p>  In referring to the critical importance of co-operation between the police and intelligence services in combating terrorism, I expressed my view that enhanced access for EU police and security services to data and intelligence-sharing has a critical role in the fight against terrorism.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na co-operates closely with it EU counterpart services and it makes full use of the range of information-sharing means available to them, including through Interpol, Europol and bi-lateral channels.</p>  <p>  That said, opportunities that we consider could further enhance that co-operation must be pursued.  In this regard, I am determined that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have access to the Schengen Information System for terrorism and criminal purposes and I am arranging that the necessary steps in this regard will now be taken as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  In relation to the EU PNR Directive, I confirmed at the Council that Ireland fully supports the aim of securing early agreement with the European Parliament given the importance of ensuring that for the purposes of combating terrorism and serious crime law, enforcement services can have access to PNR data in the context of a robust framework of safeguards for privacy and data protection.</p></reply>

It is fortunate that in Ireland there appears to be little tolerance for the open expression of extremist views directed against individuals and minority groups.  It is recognised that certain media, and in particular, social media, do provide a platform for the expression of views which can sometimes be characterised as intemperate or immoderate at best and at times, verging on the openly racist.  However, this is a phenomenon that is certainly not limited to the area of concern raised by the Deputy.  </p>  <p>  It is widely recognised that it is very difficult to combat or address such viewpoints without engaging civil society in a broader discourse centred around the values of pluralism, civility and tolerance; qualities which in my view find abundant expression in our civil and political discourse.  Unfortunately, there are those in every society who use tragedies such as the Paris attacks to denigrate those who are perceived as &ldquo;different&rdquo; or in some way perceived as &ldquo;separate&rdquo;. Fortunately, the overwhelming majority of people in our society actively oppose the expression of such extremist viewpoints.  In addition, it is a feature of Irish political life that no political party espouses extreme right-wing views on immigrants which I take to indicate that there is little support amongst the public for such extreme opinions. </p>  <p>  As part of the recent Government decision establishing the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, the Government asked for a Communications Strategy and Implementation Plan to be developed, bearing in mind the issues which might arise during the course of the Programme&rsquo;s implementation.  This matter will be considered at the next meeting of the Taskforce which the Government established to oversee the Programme.  Without seeking to pre-empt what the Communications Strategy and associated Plan might propose, I anticipate that it will address the area of concern raised by the Deputy by ensuring the provision and widespread communication of accurate information thereby decreasing the opportunity for misinformation being used to peddle alarmist and extremist viewpoints.</p></reply>

Accordingly, where a young person under the age of 18 comes into conflict with the law, the principles of the Act apply.  </p>  <p>  A key principle in the Children Act relating to young offenders is that detention should be a last resort.  In support of this principle, the legislation facilitates the incremental application of a series of measures, ranging from diversion in the first instance through community based sanctions, to detention.</p>  <p>  The first main filter in the youth justice system is the Garda Diversion Programme, involving at different stages and depending on the seriousness of the offence, the informal caution (without supervision) and the formal caution (with supervision), including possible involvement with a Garda Youth Diversion Project (GYDP).  </p>  <p>  The second main filter is the range of non-custodial sanctions available to the courts including court orders for dismissal; conditional discharge; the payment of fines or costs; compensation and the binding over of parents, and orders imposing a community sanction involving a suite of Probation Service supervised sanctions. In supervising community sanctions, the Probation Service utilises a number of community based organisations with dedicated resources to work with young offenders.  </p>  <p>  Finally and as a last resort, detention may be used.  </p>  <p>  The operation of the above statutory framework is substantially supported by the significant investment by my Department in community based programmes which are directed at diverting young people from further involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour. These youth justice community programmes proceed on the basis of evidence that diversion programmes in the form of high quality preventative intervention can do more to reduce crime than more costly custodial sanctions. </p>  <p>  In 2015, just under &euro;17 million was allocated to Irish Youth Justice Service Community Programmes to administer Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs), Young Persons Probation Projects (YPPs) and a number of other youth diversion community-based projects. These programmes are managed in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the case of the GYDPs and the Probation Service in the case of YPPs.  </p>  <p>  From 2015, all GYDPs and four of the YPPs are being co-funded under the European Social Fund Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020.  They are being funded as a social inclusion measure to increase the education and employment opportunities available to young people and to divert them from any further involvement with the criminal justice system.</p></reply>

The current assessment is that while an attack here is possible, it is unlikely and there is no specific information that an attack here is planned.  The level of threat from this source is kept under constant review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda Authorities have reference to all relevant information, including international developments, in carrying out their assessments.  I discuss security matters on an ongoing basis with Minister Coveney and, as the Deputy will no doubt be aware, there is ongoing and close liaison at a senior level between our two Departments and between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters.</p></reply>

The purpose of the review was to triage the complaints to establish whether there was any action which I could take to further resolution of that complaint.  </p>  <p>  Recommendations by counsel were based on a review of the papers, and did not involve interviews or interaction with complainants or any other form of investigation, although counsel could where necessary recommend that I seek further information from persons or bodies. The Panel was independent and therefore no restriction was placed on the nature of recommendations which they might make. </p>  <p>  The position with regard to the conflict of interest highlighted in the attached correspondence has been explained to the person from whom the Deputy has received this correspondence, to their solicitor and to this House in reply to a number of Parliamentary Questions raising the matter. To reiterate, arrangements were put in place to ensure that if there is any conflict, or potential conflict, the conflicted counsel not only will not be involved in the particular complaint, but also will not be aware of which counsel was reviewing it. </p>  <p>  As regards the reference in the correspondence to the complaint against the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, my position in this regard is as stated in the Parliamentary Question to which the Deputy refers, the DPP is independent and I, as Minister, have no legal role in relation to its function.</p>  <p>  The Panel has provided recommendations to me in all 320 cases submitted to them and has therefore largely concluded its work.  The issuing of notification letters to complainants commenced on 29 June. To date, 298 complainants have been notified of the outcome of the review of their cases. Letters will continue to issue to all complainants, including the case referred to by the Deputy, until the process is completed.</p></reply>

The National Disability Authority (NDA) facilitated consultations with the Deaf Community in Ireland in 2012 at the Department's request in relation to actions that could make improvements in the lives of deaf people and submissions received from them were considered for inclusion where possible and appropriate in the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan (NDSIP) which was published in July 2013.  </p>  <p>  As part of the follow-up to that initiative, the first special themed meeting of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group (NDSIG) focussed on the issue of Irish Sign Language on 28 November 2013. This meeting brought together representatives of relevant Departments, the NDA, the Deaf Community and other relevant stakeholders with a view to further progressing the implementation of the NDSIP in this regard. </p>  <p>  The meeting reviewed the current situation across Government Departments and their Agencies with regard to promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language including in-service provision and provided the Deaf Community with the opportunity of presenting their experience of interaction with the Public Sector.  It also provided a useful opportunity to examine mechanisms which could promote the further use and recognition of Irish Sign Language and understand practical implications for service users.  Further to this meeting, the Deaf Community prepared a report to reflect their views on key actions and priorities. The intention is that the recommendations from this report will be reflected in the new National Disability Inclusion Strategy, through the incorporation of new actions and related performance indicators and timelines as appropriate.  Progress on all relevant actions will then be monitored as part of the Inclusion Strategy's monitoring process.  The focus therefore remains on the identification of mechanisms for the further promotion and recognition of Irish Sign Language with a view to promoting and supporting its use, thereby improving service delivery on the ground, rather than on the introduction of legislation or its designation as an official language.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the existing supports for use of Irish Sign Language in Ireland give a level of recognition and practical measures equal to, or above that, in countries which have formally recognised sign language.</p></reply>

So far 295 of those new recruits are fully attested and are on the ground in communities nationwide. On attestation, new probationer Garda&iacute; are assigned to stations throughout the country by the Garda Commissioner, where they are assigned to mainstream uniform policing duties. I am assured by Garda management that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and that 30 of these newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the DMR West Garda Division.</p><p>I was very pleased to announce the commencement of the recruitment campaign for 2016 last Friday, 27 November. It is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Garda Commissioner. Applications must be made through .  The closing date for applications is Tuesday 5 January 2016.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-01a.802.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100073#WRO02500"><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was approved by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 in response to the migration crisis which has developed in Southern Europe and as an act of solidarity with other Member States  Under this decision, the Government confirmed that Ireland will take in up to 4,000 persons over the next two years in order to give to give effect to the EU legal instruments it has opted into, with approval of the Oireachtas, in respect of relocation and the solemn commitments Ireland has also entered into in respect of resettlement refugees. </p>  <p>  Among the measures agreed under the Programme was the establishment of a Network of Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres (EROCs) which would be used to provide temporary accommodation in order to meet the basic needs of asylum seekers relocated from hotspots in Italy and Greece while their applications for refugee status are processed.  Under the provisions of the EU relocation programme, persons considered for relocation who will be accommodated in EROCs upon arrival, must be from countries with a recognition rate for asylum of at least 75%.  Accordingly, the expectation is that a large proportion of relocated persons will qualify for refugee status within a very short time and will leave the EROCs.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has committed under the Programme to take in additional resettlement refugees who must also be temporally accommodated in EROCs for the purposes of reception, orientation and integration training, prior to being resettled in communities across Ireland.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department, responsible for implementing the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), were tasked with the sourcing of suitable accommodation and orientation services for the proposed network of EROCs. This involves an assessment of information regarding available State properties provided by the Office of Public Works and a request for expressions of interest from commercial accommodation providers.  The commercial expressions of interest are being evaluated alongside the information provided by OPW in respect of State properties.  This process remains ongoing and it would not be appropriate for reasons of confidentiality and commercial sensitivity to identify the sites being considered or examined. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, independent of the commitments under the above Government Decision, the numbers of persons applying for protection in the State has already significantly increased this year and this has placed great pressure on available accommodation.  There is now a need to provide temporary accommodation for the new cohort of asylum seekers and programme refugees who are due to arrive in the State over the next two years under the IRPP.  Ireland has always ensured that persons who applied for international protection were never left without bed and board by virtue of an inability to provide for themselves.  If Ireland is to maintain this honourable practice then the State must be in a position to enter into contracts to give effect to its commitments and to avoid a situation where those seeking international protection and who cannot provide for themselves  are effectively rendered homeless. </p>  <p>  It is important to stress that under the IRPP the accommodation being sought for persons is for the limited period of time sufficient to determine their application for asylum and necessary orientation following the attainment of refugee status or in the case of resettlement refugees to allow for a period of orientation prior to resettlement.  A sub-group of the Taskforce established by the Government to oversee the implementation of the Programme is considering how persons temporarily accommodated in EROCs are to be moved from EROCs and housed in communities across Ireland. I am informed that this sub-group is expected to report to the Taskforce in the near future. This aspect of the work of the Taskforce is being led by the Department of the Environment, Community  and Local Government.</p></reply>

Section 4(3) of the Courts Service Act 1998 provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which are specified in section 5, and includes the management of the Courts.  Court funds which are held for the benefit of Wards of Court are private funds under the control of the Courts Service which, through its offices in the High, Circuit and District Courts, has responsibility for the management and investment of funds in court.  </p>  <p>  The investment arrangements for all court funds operate under a structured framework.  The Investment Committee of the Courts Service has an advisory role and its main function is to devise investment policy for court funds, oversee the recommendations received from its investment advisors, and to ensure compliance with best practice in the management of court funds. The Committee comprises members of the judiciary, representatives from the Courts Service and independent members.  The Committee is chaired by the President of the High Court and is also supported by external investment advisors.  The Courts Service also produces annual financial statements and is subject to both internal and external audit.  The audited financial statements are published each year in accordance with the Superior Court Rules and published on the Courts Service website at www.courts.ie. </p>  <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General is not currently empowered to audit Ward of Court funds. There was a proposal to appoint the Comptroller and Auditor General as auditor of the funds included in a draft Bill in 2010.  However it was not subsequently progressed as ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities led to the drafting of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 which will, when enacted, abolish the wards of court system. This Bill is scheduled to go before the Seanad for Committee Stage on 9 December 2015 and the aim is that the Bill will be enacted by the end of this year.</p></reply>

It was also stated that further information was being sought from the Garda authorities and that further communication would be made with the Deputy when the information was to hand.  I received further information from the Garda authorities relating to the case to which the Deputy refers and I regret the delay that has arisen in finalising a reply to the issues raised which is due to an administrative oversight. </p>  <p>  Following the Barron Inquiry's report, a dedicated team of Garda&iacute; was appointed to re-examine the case to see if there was any possibility of bringing any or all of the four suspects who had come to light to justice.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that all mechanisms were fully utilised by the Garda&iacute; to liaise with the RUC and, later, the PSNI in respect of the investigation, including requests made in the framework of Mutual Legal Assistance.  Liaison was established with the PSNI who co-operated fully with the Garda investigation team.</p>  <p>  A number of new investigative lines of inquiry were developed and explored and a file on the matter was forwarded subsequently to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) recommending prosecutions.  However, the DPP directed on 8 October 2008 that no prosecutions should be taken on the basis of the evidence available.  You will appreciate, of course, that the DPP is independent in the performance of her functions in accordance with the provisions of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that the investigating Garda&iacute; sought information and clarification in respect of a number of matters from the authorities in Northern Ireland, through the PSNI's HET and through the established Mutual Legal Assistance mechanism.  The investigating Garda&iacute; inquired into the circumstances in which the authorities in Northern Ireland received early information on suspects in the murder and in this regard the Garda authorities are satisfied that they received full co-operation from the PSNI.</p>  <p>  While it is a matter of regret that those responsible for this case have not been brought to justice, I would reiterate that the Garda investigation file remains open and any credible new information that is brought to attention will be pursued vigorously by the investigators.</p></reply>

This includes personnel, Garda vehicles and the various technologies utilised to support front-line Garda&iacute; and intelligence-led operations against organised crime.  This process takes account of annual policing priorities determined by me as Minister for Justice in consultation with the Garda Commissioner as provided for under section 20 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are continually looking to ensure that the latest information, communications and forensic technologies are sourced and deployed to achieve their strategic objectives as set out in the context of their annual policing plans, as provided for in section 22 of the 2005 Act.  This policy is designed to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be properly resourced to meet the evolving needs of a modern effective police force and take advantage of proven up to date technological developments in crime detection and prevention as they occur.</p>  <p>  More generally, it is also the case that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, in its reports on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, benchmarks the performance of the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with best international policing practice.</p>  <p>  In terms of existing technology, the Deputy will be aware that a considerable amount of new Garda ICT solutions has been delivered over the past number of years.  These include the deployment of a secure national digital radio system (NDRS), the deployment and support of Garda and Community CCTV systems, an automated number plate recognition (ANPR) system, and the addition of many new functions to the PULSE system, which itself is further supported by a dedicated Garda data entry service in Castlebar.  The substantial additional investment of &euro;205 million in new technology and systems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provided under the Capital Plan 2016-2021 will facilitate progress on further important reforms arising from the Garda Inspectorate's report on Crime Investigation. Examples of the new systems to be developed through this investment include:</p>  <p> - new computer-aided dispatch to ensure responsive and coordinated deployment of Garda&iacute; in the community;</p>  <p> - mobile technology to give the Garda&iacute; secure mobile access to critical information when and where they need it;</p>  <p> - investigations management systems to ensure enhanced management of crime investigations; and</p>  <p> - upgrading the ANPR to  enhance policing of road safety and compliance.</p>  <p>  The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 Garda&iacute; recruited since this Government reopened the Garda College in September 2014. It will also provide additional funding for Garda surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing. This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles. We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles, as well as investment in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.</p>  <p>  In the area of forensics, the Garda authorities currently employ state-of-the-art automated fingerprint and ballistics identification systems which I am informed are at least on a par with those used by police forces in other EU jurisdictions.  The Deputy will also be aware of the recent launch of the national DNA database which has capacity to revolutionise the investigation of crime in Ireland.</p>  <p>  These and other new technological solutions, as well as the investment in resources, will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to provide effective policing services in respond to the evolving challenges of modern day criminal activity. </p></reply>

The Garda authorities work closely with their EU and other international counterparts, including Europol and Interpol, in the exchange of intelligence.  In this regard, as part of the major programme of investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that I am bringing forward there will be considerable investment in Garda information and communications technology, including connecting to the European Schengen Information System.  In the order of &euro;330 million will be allocated over the lifetime of the Government's Capital Programme to support crime investigation and to enhance intelligence-led policing.</p>  <p>  The primary special intervention capability is the Garda's armed Emergency Response Unit, which is specifically trained in counter-terrorism responses and hostage-type incidents.  The armed Garda Regional Support Units can provide further support in such incidents, as well as the providing regionalised armed support to other policing operations.  The Garda national units, including the Special Detective Unit, Organised Crime Unit and National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, play a key role in countering terrorism and serious crime and this is supported by the day-to-day policing work of every Garda member.  As the Deputy will know, Ireland benefits greatly from having An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as both its national police and intelligence service.</p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have the appropriate resources available to them to tackle threats from these sources but given the evolving nature of the terrorist threat and the need to adapt to respond to them, the Garda Commissioner is carrying out a review at present and will let me know of any additional requirements that may arise.</p></reply>

This priority is clearly reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for 2015.</p>  <p>  In tackling organised crime activity, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement operations and strategies aimed at targeting, dismantling and disrupting criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies. Multi-disciplinary approaches are also utilised to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted, including the use of the proceeds of crimes legislation, money-laundering legislation, and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau. </p>  <p>  In targeting such criminal groupings An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operate at local and community level, as well as national and international level in partnership with other policing agencies including Interpol and Europol. </p>  <p>  While we should not underestimate the difficulties which the Garda authorities face in tackling organised crime activity, we continue to see the significant results of their efforts in the arrests made and persons being brought before the Courts, as well as the ongoing drugs and firearms seizures made.  </p>  <p>   I can also assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is  committed to utilising all available resources in targeting such activity with significant recent investments being made through the recently launched Operation Thor.

These programmes offer purposeful activity to those in custody while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead law abiding lives on release.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.  </p>  <p>  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  Prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date. </p>  <p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015. There is a clear commitment to enhance sentence planning through Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole time teacher equivalents in partnership with the Irish Prison Service through the Education and Training Boards (ETB). The focus is on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and facilitates lifelong learning through helping prisoners cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release. </p>  <p>  A top priority for the Irish Prison Service is ensuring help for those with reading and writing problems and peer mentoring programmes are currently active in all of our prisons.</p>  <p>  The guiding principles which underpin the prisons' work and training service are to make available, work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody.  Training activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical skills which will help them secure employment on release.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled the Irish Prison Service to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.</p></reply>

A new Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Bill is currently being drafted which will update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board thus consolidating responsibility for legal aid schemes with the Board.</p><p>Civil legal aid is provided by the Legal Aid Board which is independent in the exercise of its functions, in accordance with Section 3 (3) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1994.  </p><p>However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made of the Board and I have been advised that the Board has carried out a number of initiatives to improve the service it delivers:</p><p>- The Board continues to make effective use of private practitioners in District Court cases to help reduce the number of clients waiting for legal services.  The use of private practitioners is designed to improve access to legal aid services in situations where a law centre is not in a position to provide a timely service. 5,194 cases were referred to the District Court Private Practitioner Scheme in 2014, a decrease of 8% on the 2013 figure of 5,640.</p><p>- The &quot;triage&quot; system of providing early advice to clients was implemented in 2012 as a means of responding to the increased demand.  The objective of this approach is to ensure that every applicant gets an advice appointment with a solicitor on a timely basis.  An evaluation of the triage approach took place in 2014 and determined that it was effective and it is now in place in all law centres.</p><p>- Since the Family Mediation Service came within the remit of the Legal Aid Board in November 2011 a very strong emphasis has been placed on reducing waiting lists nationally to ensure that the service complements that of the Board&rsquo;s law centres and that people who wish to try and resolve matters through mediation are not waiting longer than three months for an appointment with a mediator. The total number of cases dealt with by the mediation service in 2014 was 2,262 which was 6% higher than the number of cases (2,131) dealt with in 2013.  There were 888 agreements reached which is 15% higher than the 2013 figure of 769.</p><p>- The Dolphin House initiative which is a court related mediation initiative has achieved more that 1,200 agreements since its commencement and has been established on a permanent basis.The Board has also extended this service model to Naas and Cork and, more recently, Tipperary and Limerick in co-operation with the Courts Service.</p><p>- The piloting of mandatory information sessions about ADR/mediation as a pre-requisite to getting a legal aid certificate to go to court in family law disputes involving children commenced in Cork in July 2014, Athlone in October and Castlebar in January 2015.</p><p>- The approach to be adopted in the delivery of legal services in the Coroners Court was agreed by the Board and my Department in November 2014.  The Board will grant legal aid certificates and has responsibility for the operation of the Private Practitioner Scheme whilst my Department will provide administrative assistance.</p><p>- The Refugee Documentation Centre provides an independent and confidential query and research service for Country of Origin Information to all agencies in the asylum process.  It processed 1,394  queries in 2014.  It also manages the Board&rsquo;s library and information service.</p><p>- The Board continues in its efforts to reduce non-pay and non-legal costs in order to free up more resources for service delivery. </p><p>The table shows the numbers waiting for Civil Legal Aid for the last five years. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>2014</th><th>2013</th><th>2012</th><th>2011</th><th>2010</th></tr><tr><td>Number waiting</td><td>3,412</td><td>5,067</td><td>5,014</td><td>4,443</td><td>3,153</td></tr></table></p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the number of persons waiting for Civil Legal Aid at 1 October 2015 had dropped to 2,684 and I am assured that the Board keeps the delivery of its services under constant review with a view to getting legal services to those most in need of them as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

There are also 42 Garda Reserves and 23 Civilians attached to the Louth Garda Division. </p><p>I have also been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the allocations of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored to ensure optimal use of Garda human resources.  This process is periodically reviewed in light of particular incidents of concern or challenges and it is in this context that the Commissioner has directed the allocation of additional Garda&iacute; to the Louth Division.  I am advised that an additional 2 sergeants and 25 Garda&iacute; have been allocated to the Louth Garda Division as an interim measure. These Garda&iacute; have been transferred on a temporary basis from adjoining Garda Divisions and the Dublin Metropolitan Region to support the work of the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Louth Division.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to provide effective, visible policing throughout the country. A crucial element of the Government's strategy is ongoing seamless recruitment to renew An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>With this in mind Budget 2016 made provision for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year bringing to 1,150 the number of new Garda&iacute; that will be recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014. So far 295 of those new recruits are fully attested and are on the ground in communities nationwide. On attestation, new probationer Garda&iacute; are assigned to stations throughout the country by the Garda Commissioner, where they are assigned to mainstream uniform policing duties. I am assured by Garda management that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and that 10 of these newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to Co Louth Garda Division, 5 each to Dundalk and Drogheda Garda Stations.</p><p>I was very pleased to announce the commencement of the recruitment campaign for 2016 last Friday, 27 November. It is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Garda Commissioner. Applications must be made through .  The closing date for applications is Tuesday 5 January 2016.  Successful candidates can expect to enter the Garda College from June 2016 onwards. </p><p>In relation to the crime of burglary, Operation Thor is a multi-strand, national operation which builds on previous and current Garda operations to tackle crime, particularly burglaries, the number of which, as we know, increase with the advent of the long winter nights, in both urban and rural communities nationwide.  In excess of &euro;5 million is being committed to support Operation Thor. This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support abroad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.</p><p>This special, targeted operation has to be seen in the context of the major investment that this Government is making in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.</p></reply>

This includes the need for all such CCTV schemes to be authorised in writing by the Garda Commissioner. CCTV systems installed for the purposes of crime prevention, and as aids to policing in areas to which the general public routinely have access such as town centres, fall into two categories: Garda CCTV systems and community-based CCTV systems. </p>  <p>  Garda CCTV systems are planned and implemented on the basis of the identified operational needs and priorities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, decisions in relation to the introduction or extension of such systems are a matter for the Garda Commissioner. The Garda authorities inform me that they keep the current Garda CCTV arrangements under ongoing review in the context of changing operational requirements. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the value that communities, especially rural communities, place on CCTV as a means of deterring crime and assisting in the detection of offenders.  With this in mind, I have instigated a review of the effectiveness of the Community CCTV Scheme in conjunction with the Garda authorities.  The outcome of that review will inform future decisions on the continuation of the Scheme. The Deputy may also be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, has recently made an announcement in relation the provision of CCTV in rural areas, which is to be funded from the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to deliver highly-mobile and responsive Garda patrols in both rural and urban communities.  The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 Garda&iacute; recruited since this Government reopened the Garda College in September 2014.  It will also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing.  This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles. We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.

However, in recognition of the link between staff qualifications and the quality of early years services, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme, which is provided in nearly all of the early  years services in this country provides a higher rate of capitation to services that employ staff who hold a higher level of qualification.  There are in the region of 4,300 early years services participating in the ECCE programme and more than 1,400 of these services were in receipt of the higher capitation  in the 2014/2015 programme year. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that, in Budget 2016, the Government committed a further &euro;85 million to the early years sector in 2016. This additional funding, which will support the expansion of a number of childcare programmes implemented by my Department, has also enabled me to restore the capitation payments provided under the ECCE programme to pre-2012 levels from September 2016. This means that the higher rate of capitation provided to services will be increased from &euro;73 to &euro;75 per child per week with standard rate of capitation increasing from &euro;62.50 to &euro;64.50 per child per week.  </p>  <p>  The expansion of the childcare programmes in 2016 and the increased capitation levels will help providers to address some of the cost issues that impact on their services including remuneration costs. It will also provide support to services employing staff with Level 7 or higher qualifications and will provide a further incentive to other services to employ more qualified staff. </p>  <p>  New qualification requirements for staff working directly with children in early years services will be introduced in 2016 under the Early Years Quality Agenda.  All staff will be required to have a minimum Level 5 qualification on the National Qualifications Framework in early years care and education, or an equivalent . In addition, pre-school leaders delivering the ECCE Programme, who are currently required to hold a Level 5 qualification, will be required to have a minimum Level 6 qualification, or equivalent. To support staff to meet these new qualification requirements, my Department established the Learner Fund which has already allocated &euro;3.5 million to over 3,000 staff for the purpose of up-skilling.</p>  <p>  Further funding to improve  the qualifications of the early years sector was secured as part of Budget 2016. This includes:</p>  <p>  - &euro;1.5 million, which will be directed towards a Learner Fund in 2016. I will announce details of this Learner Fund shortly.</p>  <p>  - &euro;1.5 million, which will fund the delivery of a 'Higher Education Programme for Inclusion Co-ordinators in Early Years Settings' as part of the model of supports I recently announced to ensure children with a disability can access and meaningfully participate in the ECCE Programme. This funding will meet the costs for the first intake of participants (up to 900 early years practitioners) who are expected to commence in this Programme in April 2016. It is envisaged that, over the next four years, at least 80 per cent of ECCE services will avail of this training fund, which will cost &euro;1.5 million per annum.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to note new Government-funded posts for early years practitioners. These include posts for inspectors in the Early Years Inspectorate at the Department of Education and Skills and posts for Service Co-ordinators and Early Years Specialists in Better Start's Early Years Specialist Service.</p></reply>

That means directly subsidising places in early years services so that fees are lower or fully covered (as is already the case for programmes funded by my Department). The OECD, in this report, concluded that tax credits &ndash; or other &quot;consumer subsidies&quot; &ndash; are less effective and that &quot;direct public funding of services brings, in the majority of countries reviewed, more effective control, advantages of scale, better national quality, more effective training for educators and a higher degree of equity in access and participation than consumer subsidy models&quot;.</p><p>Start Strong, in their Submission to Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children in May 2015 also presented compelling evidence in relation to this issue referencing both the experience of the Netherlands and Australia. More specifically, this submission demonstrated how &quot;the Netherlands and Australia shifted from supply-side funding to childcare tax credits during the 2000s, and both subsequently saw rise in childcare costs outstripping inflation, and negating the benefit of the tax credits for parents&quot;.</p><p>The references for the evidence presented by Start Strong are as follows:</p><p>- Prof. D.

This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2011 and 30 June 2012 qualified for free pre-school from September 2015. Children who turn 3 from 1 July  2012 are below the age range for eligibility for ECCE in the 2015/2016 programme year but will qualify for the 2016/17 programme year. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2016 it was announced that, from September 2016, children will be eligible to start free pre-school when they turn age 3, and can continue in free pre-school until they start primary school (once the child is not older than 5&frac12; years at the end of the relevant pre-school year i.e. end June). </p>  <p>  This extension of free pre-school will increase the number of children benefiting from free pre-school from about 67,000 per annum, to 127,000 in a given programme year. Accommodating this increase requires a significant increase in capacity in the pre-school sector; pre-school services need time to consider and implement any needed infrastructural or service changes, and to put in place extra staff resources. The September 2016 implementation date was set to allow pre-school providers to put such measures in place.  </p>  <p>  It is appreciated that this does mean that a small cohort of children, including those mentioned by the Deputy, while continuing to avail of the 38 week entitlement to free pre-school currently provided under the ECCE programme, will not benefit from additional free pre-school provided under this new budgetary measure. However, should an earlier start date have been chosen, the likelihood is that there would not have been sufficient capacity in the sector to accommodate all children.</p>  <p>  However, you will appreciate that this extended provision, when introduced, will ensure that, from the age of three, all children in Ireland will be able to access free education, either in pre-school or in primary school. This is a significant step forward for children and families.</p></reply>

While my Department made a once off payment of &euro;10,000 to assist the Arc Adoption  in repaying clients that were due their refundable registration fees in July 2014, repayment of these fees and any other legacy debts are clearly a matter for the Board of Arc Adoption.

To summarise:</p><p>- The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme is provided through <b>both private and community/not-for-profit providers</b></p><p>- The Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes (i.e. Childcare Education and Training programme (CETS), Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme and After-school Childcare (ASCC) programme) are provided through both private and community/not-for-profit providers, and</p><p>- The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme is currently provided through <b>community/not-for-profit providers only</b>.</p><p>The original rationale for opening the CCS Programme to community/not-for-profit providers only was to ensure that children and families could access childcare in areas of market failure (i.e. in areas where private providers did not traditionally operate) and, due to economic constraints, Budget 2012 closed the CCS programme to new applications from providers wishing to enter the programme and to the expansion of services by existing providers.</p><p>However, as I also indicated in my previous reply to the Deputy, under Budget 2016, I lifted these restrictions and provided &euro;16 million in additional funding to further expand the CCS programme, to include its roll-out to private providers, in a targeted manner.  During 2016, work will also commence on developing a new simplified childcare subsidy programme. This programme, which will replace the existing CCS and TEC programmes, will be available through both private and community/not-for-profit providers in 2017.</p><p>- In 2012, capital funding of &euro;6m was provided to fund a maintenance programme for services (i.e. to address remedial, maintenance and renovation work and to purchase equipment). This funding, which provided grants up to a maximum of &euro;50,000, was available to <b>both private and community/not-for-profit providers.</b></p><p>- In 2013, capital funding of &euro;2.75m was provided to support the on-going improvement of services.  Both <b>private and community/not-for-profit services </b>participating in one of the childcare support programmes implemented by my Department were eligible to apply.</p><p>- In 2014, capital funding of &euro;2.5 million for the maintenance and upgrade of <b>community/not-for-profit services</b>to ensure that these previously-funded community/not-for-profit services remained fit-for-purpose thus protecting State investment. For this reason, private providers were not eligible to apply.</p><p>- In 2015, capital funding of &euro;7 million was provided. Under Strands 1-3 of the 2015 programme, &euro;5 million was made available to <b>community/not-for-profit services</b>to ensure that these previously-funded community/not-for-profit services remained fit-for-purpose thus protecting State investment. The remaining &euro;2 million, which was made available under Strand 4 of the 2015 programme, was made available for <b>both private and community/not-for-profit providers</b>.</p></reply>

Both Groups consulted widely with a range of stakeholders, including the early years sector, during the course of their work. </p>  <p>  Under this extended Programme, there will be three opportunities for eligible children to enrol during the pre-school year: children who reach the age of 3 between April and August will have the opportunity to enrol in September; children who reach the age of 3 between September and December will have the opportunity to enrol in January; and children who reach the age of 3 between January and March will have the opportunity to enrol in April. As a result of this extension, the number of children benefiting from the Programme is expected to rise from around 67,000 to 127,000 in a given programme year. For the 2016/17 programme year, it is estimated that 89,500 children will be eligible to enrol in the Programme from September 2016, 22,000 from January 2017 and 15,500 from April 2017.</p>  <p>  In order to provide the early years sector with the time to build capacity to meet this increased demand, a decision was taken to introduce this new measure from September 2016. As the increased demand for the Programme is not expected to peak until January and April 2017, this timeframe should allow pre-school providers to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional demand. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that there is already additional capacity in the early years sector to cope with some of the increased demand. Indeed, the Annual Survey of Early Years Services, which was conducted in December 2014, estimates that there are more than 24,000 vacancies in early years services across the country with almost 13,000 of these vacancies in sessional services. I am also aware that every year a significant number of new pre-school providers apply to participate in this Programme, and, this increased demand for, and additional investment in, free pre-school provision should encourage a greater numbers of applicants. </p>  <p>  The restoration of capitation rates to pre-2012 levels from September 2016 should also encourage a greater number of new applicants and encourage existing pre-school providers to expand.</p>  <p>  I am clear that more capacity will be required and that building this capacity may pose a challenge for some pre-school providers. Officials in my Department are committed to assisting with these challenges. They are already working closely with the City and County Childcare Committees and the Voluntary Childcare Organisations on a range of measures, which will assist pre-school providers meet increased demand for free pre-school provision, particularly from January and April 2017. Further information on these measures will be available shortly.</p>  <p>  With regard to payment for sick time for children availing of the ECCE Programme, the Programme contains provision for payment to continue in instances where the child is absent for periods of 4 consecutive weeks or less. It is only in instances where a child is absent for a period of more than 4 consecutive weeks  that the pre-school provider is obliged to cease claiming payment. If the child subsequently returns to the service, payment will be re-instated.</p>  <p>  With regard to payment for holiday time, pre-school providers voluntarily contract into the ECCE Programme on the basis of the capitation rates and number of payment weeks provided for under the Programme. It is a matter for pre-school providers themselves to decide whether the terms of the Programme are suitable for their service and whether they operate for the 38 weeks of the ECCE programme only.</p></reply>

The latter Group consulted widely during the course of their work and all stakeholders in the early years sector were invited to make a submission. There is no record of a submission being received from the HSE (now Tusla).</p>  <p>  With regard to the other questions raised by the Deputy, I can re-confirm that the Childcare Pre-School Regulations 2006 allow for children aged 0-6 years to be cared for in a pre-school and there is no requirement by Tusla that a child must be toilet trained before attending a private pre-school service or any pre-school service.  The age range of children to be catered for in a pre-school service is a matter for each individual service.</p>  <p>  Further, I, nor the HSE (now Tusla), are aware of any request by the HSE (now Tusla) having requested a review of the staffing levels allowed for in private pre-school providers to take into account the different levels of needs for three- to five-year-olds.</p></reply>

In January, taking into account current pressures on acute hospital services, I put in place maximum permissible waiting times for in-patient and day case treatment and outpatient appointments of 18 months by 30 June and 15 months by year end. The HSE was provided with additional funding of &euro;51m to ensure that these maximum waiting times would be achieved. The funding provided is intended to maximise capacity across public and voluntary hospitals as well as outsourcing activity where the capacity is not available to meet patient needs within the maximum allowable waiting time.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is addressing the areas of underachievement of maximum waiting times with Hospital Groups as part of the regular performance and accountability process, as well as seeking the support of the National Clinical Programmes to ensure that the appropriate referral and clinical pathways are used at all times.  The main priority is the patients affected by any delays in waiting lists and the HSE will ensure that these patients are prioritised for treatment. </p>  <p>  As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

The purpose of ABF is to change the model of funding from the existing block grant budget system to a new approach where hospitals are paid based on the quantity and quality of the services they deliver to patients. Hospitals will be incentivised to pursue the most cost-effective means of achieving their performance targets and will also be subject to overall budgetary ceilings.  </p><p>Implementation of ABF is a multi-year project and extensive preparatory work has been undertaken over the last 24 months.  This work has allowed 2016 to be identified as the &ldquo;conversion year&rdquo; for inpatient and day case activity. This means that hospital budgets will be separated into ABF and non-ABF budgets for the first time.  Hospital funding associated with inpatient and day case activity will effectively be withdrawn from hospitals and replaced with funding provided upon the delivery of activity in line with agreed targets.  In order to maintain financial stability in the system, where appropriate, hospitals will be given transition adjustment payments to reflect the difference between their current costs and the national average cost.  These transition payments will be phased out over time. All non-ABF activity will remain block funded during 2016.  The ABF model will continue to evolve in subsequent years to encompass other aspects of hospital services, such as outpatient activity, before extending into community services.</p><p>It is important to note that ABF does not seek to reduce budgets.  Instead, it will encourage hospitals to use the resources at their disposal more efficiently and will provide a more transparent funding mechanism that more fairly rewards hospitals for the activity they undertake.</p><p>The Government published details on this major element of its programme of health service reform in the &quot;<i>Money Follows the Patient Policy Paper on Hospital Financing</i>&quot;.  In addition, the HSE has in  recent months published the &ldquo;<i>Activity Based Funding Programme Implementation Plan 2015 &ndash; 2017</i>&rdquo; which outlines the timetable for implementation over the next two years.  Both documents are available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The title of <i>physiotherapist </i>will, as a consequence, be protected for the exclusive use of the board's registrants when the register's 2 year transitional period ends in 2018.</p><p>I am currently examining the issue of also protecting the title of <i>physical therapist </i>under the Act.  In the rest of the English speaking world the titles of <i>physical therapist</i>and <i>physiotherapist</i>are interchangeable and their users are qualified physiotherapists.  In Ireland, however, the title is used by a number of practitioners who are not physiotherapists but who are competing with physiotherapists in the private sector in the provision of musculoskeletal therapies.</p><p>Earlier this year, having consulted with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, I wrote to a number of relevant organisations including the Physiotherapists Registration Board and the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists, regarding my proposal to protect the title of <i>physical therapist </i>as a variant of the title of <i>physiotherapist </i>and invited them to submit their views.  Protecting the title of <i>physical therapist</i>in this way would mean that practitioners who are currently using this title and are not registered as physiotherapists would not be entitled to use the title of <i>physical therapist</i>when the regulations come into effect. </p><p>The submissions are now being examined and I expect that I will make a decision on the matter before the end of the year that ensures public protection and appropriately addresses the legitimate concerns of all parties.</p></reply>

The HSE was provided with additional funding of &euro;51m to ensure that these maximum waiting times would be achieved. The funding provided is intended to maximise capacity across public and voluntary hospitals as well as outsourcing activity where the capacity is not available to meet patient needs within the maximum allowable waiting time.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is addressing the areas of underachievement of maximum waiting times with Hospital Groups as part of the regular performance and accountability process,  as well as seeking the support of the National Clinical Programmes to ensure that the appropriate referral and clinical pathways are used at all times.  The main priority is the patients affected by any delays in waiting lists and the HSE will ensure that these patients are prioritised for treatment. </p>  <p>  As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

I am determined that these waiting times will be addressed as a priority, through additional resources and increased capacity. </p>  <p>  Scoliosis in children and young people is predominantly managed at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin.  Additional funding has been provided to Crumlin in 2015 for additional consultant posts including two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetist and support staff.  Capital funding has also been provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further. </p>  <p>  In the interim, patients from Crumlin are being transferred to other hospitals where capacity is available and where that is clinically appropriate.  These include Temple Street, Cappagh, Tallaght and the Blackrock Clinic.  External capacity has also been identified in the UK, at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore.  These measures in total have more than doubled capacity for this surgery for patients on the Crumlin waiting list in 2015. </p>  <p>  Additional consultant orthopaedic surgeons have also been appointed at Galway University Hospital to support the spinal service there.  In the short term, Galway is planning to assign 5 dedicated beds to support this service and when the new ward block at Galway is completed, this will increase to 8 dedicated beds.</p>  <p>  The HSE is continuing to work with the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group, Saolta Hospital Group and the individual hospitals to identify all options to increase capacity further to improve access times for surgery, including identification of external capacity where appropriate.</p></reply>

These services and supports which are co-ordinated by the HSE National Advocacy Unit are intended to provide that individuals receive tailored assistance to address their specific requirements, where appropriate.  It is acknowledged that treatment and individual medical needs may need to be reassessed over time to take account of changes in their condition or circumstances.</p>  <p>  As of 30 October 2015, the Health Products Regulatory Authority has received 77 reports with clinical information confirming a diagnosis of narcolepsy in individuals who were vaccinated with Pandemrix&reg; (76) and Celvapan&reg;   (1).  </p>  <p>  The ex-gratia health supports include clinical care pathways to ensure access to diagnosis and treatment, multi-disciplinary assessments led by clinical experts, counselling services for both the individuals and their families, discretionary medical cards for those who have been diagnosed have been provided to allow unlimited access to GP care and any prescribed medication, ex-gratia reimbursement of vouched expenses incurred in the process of diagnosis and treatment, including travel expenses for attending medical appointments; physiotherapy, occupational therapy assessments, dental  assessments and dietary services all on a needs basis.  Regional co-ordinators have been appointed by the HSE to assist individuals to provide advice, information and access to local services.</p>  <p>  On the education side, the National Educational Psychological Services engaged with all of the schools being attended by children with narcolepsy to provide guidance and assistance on the condition and the supports available.  These include special education home tuition, the provision of supplemental learning support/resource teaching support on a needs basis and the provision of Special Needs Assistants support if required.  Furthermore, reasonable accommodations, including special examination centres and rest breaks were provided for students who sat state exams in June.  Similar arrangements will be available on a needs basis to students sitting state exams in future years.  The Department of Education and Skills issued circulars providing information to schools on the nature, likely symptoms, possible effect of the condition of narcolepsy on students and the supports available for students.</p>  <p>  With regard to third level, students diagnosed with narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination can access the Disability Access Route to Education scheme, which is a college/university scheme which offers enhanced access routes to third level education.</p>  <p>  All health and educational services and supports will continue to be provided on an ex-gratia basis.  Those services and supports will be reassessed on an ongoing basis to take account of the individual's condition and circumstances.</p>  <p>  Financial assistance for people who are not working is a matter for the Department of Social Protection.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that I have a limited role in individual cases and do not have access to individual patient files or personal information.  I am informed that the HSE and the Coombe Hospital have been in contact with this family on an on-going basis over a number of years and has apologised to them for the death of their child 23 years ago. </p>  <p>  I understand that, in 2012, the Coombe Hospital initiated a systems review to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of this infant in 1992.  </p>  <p>  This review, which was undertaken in line with HSE Incident Management Policy and Guidelines, concluded that there were deficiencies in care, which contributed to the child&rsquo;s death.</p>  <p>  It is important that we learn from these adverse incidents,  as the single most important obligation for any health service is patient safety and improving the quality of care.  That is why this Government is committed to improving the quality and safety of Ireland&rsquo;s maternity services.</p>  <p>  A National Women&rsquo;s and Infant Health Programme will be established by the HSE to drive improvement and standardise care across all 19 maternity units.  The Maternity Strategy currently under development will provide the policy to direct and underpin the work of the programme.  Developing the strategy will help us identify how we can improve the quality and safety of care provided to pregnant women and their babies.  There was also an additional &euro;2 million provided to the HSE in 2015, to improve maternity services.  This funding provided for the appointment of additional staff including obstetricians, midwives and other staff.  </p>  <p>  We will build on these improvements through the provision of further additional resources for maternity services in 2016, the detail of which will be set out in the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan.</p>  <p>  I have previously written to the family of this child expressing my sincerest condolences.  However, as you can appreciate, it would not be appropriate for me to intervene on an individual case.</p></reply>

While certain flexibilities had been built in to the Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability  the <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter </i>Futures children and young people's policy framework contained a commitment to develop a plan to facilitate the full participation of such children in the ECCE Programme.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has lead responsibility for the implementation of this commitment and has concluded an intensive process of deliberation and consultation on the matter in conjunction with the Departments of Health and Education and Skills and has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.</p><p>As part of Budget 2016, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs announced the necessary funding to implement the new model of ECCE supports for children with a disability.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18th November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with my full support and the support of my Government colleague Jan O'Sullivan T.D., Minister  for Education and Skills. </p><p>Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8m is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand, inter alia, the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school settings as part of the rollout of the new inclusive preschools model. </p><p>It should be noted that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p><p>Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case he has raised.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them. </p></reply>

As Minister for Health, I am determined that these waiting times are to be addressed as a priority, with the focus on additional resources and capacity. </p>  <p>  Scoliosis in children and young people is predominantly managed at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin.  Additional funding was allocated in 2015 for additional consultant posts including two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin.  Capital funding has also been provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further. </p>  <p>  In the interim, patients from Crumlin are being transferred to other hospitals where capacity is available and where that is clinically appropriate.  These include Temple Street, Cappagh, Tallaght and the Blackrock Clinic.  External capacity has also been identified at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore in the UK. </p>  <p>  These measures in total have more than doubled capacity for this surgery for patients on the Crumlin waiting list in 2015. </p>  <p>  Additional consultant orthopaedic surgeons have also been appointed at Galway University Hospital to support the spinal service there.  In the short term, Galway is planning to assign five dedicated beds to support this service and when the new ward block at Galway is completed, this will increase to eight dedicated beds. </p>  <p>  The HSE is continuing to work with the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group, Saolta Hospital Group and the individual hospitals to identify all options to increase capacity further to improve access times for surgery.</p>  <p>  As the specific issues raised are a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

The current annual Rural Practice Allowance is &euro;16,216.07.</p>  <p>  As a result of satisfying the criteria for payment of this allowance, the GP is also entitled to claim practice support subsidies towards the employment of a Practice Nurse, Practice Secretary and/or Practice Manager at the maximum applicable rate which the doctor would otherwise only be entitled to claim if he or she had a panel size of 1,200 and over.  The GP would also be entitled to claim the maximum applicable contribution towards locum costs for periods of leave.  </p>  <p>  Where a GP currently holds the Rural Practice Allowance but the circumstances underpinning this have changed, the GP retains the allowance while they continue to practise in this location.  However, an application for the allowance is considered afresh by the HSE when a new GP commences in the area.</p>  <p>  The HSE has recently reviewed its guidelines for dealing with applications for a Rural Practice Allowance.  The purpose of the new guidance is to ensure consistency, transparency and fairness in decision-making in respect of the relevant discretionary provisions of the GMS contract pertaining to the granting or otherwise of the allowance to new applicants.  The new guidance does not affect existing holders of the allowance.</p>  <p>  The HSE, Department of Health and Irish Medical Organisation are currently engaged in a comprehensive review of the GMS and other publicly funded health sector contracts involving GPs.

Health related therapy supports and interventions for children, such as speech and language therapy, can be accessed through both the HSE&rsquo;s primary care services and its disability services, depending on the level of need.  Significant additional resources have been invested in recent years in the State&rsquo;s primary care and disability services with a view to enhancing therapy service provision. </p><p>Additional funding of &euro;20m was allocated in 2013 to strengthen primary care services and to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line posts, including over 260 additional posts for Primary Care Teams.  In addition, the HSE has introduced a number of initiatives specifically in relation to speech and language therapy services that are aimed at improving access to these services, such as therapists increasing clinic based work and providing family centred interventions in a group, as opposed to a one-to-one setting, whenever possible.  </p><p>The HSE is also currently engaged in a major reconfiguration of its existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multi-disciplinary geographically based teams, as part of its National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years)<i>.</i>The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.  An additional &euro;4 million was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the Progressing Disability Services Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  Further investment of &euro;4 million (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year) has been provided this year to support its ongoing implementation. </p><p>Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Within this context, funding of &euro;8 million is being provided in 2016 to expand the provision of speech and language therapy through primary care services and to support the reorganisation and expansion of speech and language and other therapies under the Progressing Disability Services Programme.  Full implementation of the Progressing Disability Services Programme is expected before the end of 2016.</p><p>I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in respect of the specific operational matters he has raised.

A broad range of complementary measures is required to successfully reduce consumption of and the harms associated with alcohol misuse especially amongst young people.  The <i>Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, 2012</i>contains recommendations which take a multi-pronged approach to tackling the misuse of alcohol, focusing on supply, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation and research. </p><p>  The Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse, based on the Report's recommendations, to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  The General Scheme of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill was approved by Government on the 3 February 2015.  The Scheme includes provisions for minimum unit pricing, health labelling on products that contain alcohol, restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol and the regulation of sponsorship.  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the preparation of the legislation.  It is expected that the Bill will be published shortly.</p><p>The Public (Health) Alcohol Bill will make it illegal to market or advertise alcohol in a manner that is appealing to children.  It provides for the making of regulations regarding the marketing and advertising of alcohol and includes provisions, inter alia, for restrictions on broadcast marketing and advertising, cinema advertising, outdoor advertising, print media and the regulation of sponsorship by alcohol companies.  The provisions in relation to marketing and advertising will be reviewed after three years to gauge their effectiveness. </p><p>The other measures set out in the <i>Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, 2012,</i>were endorsed by Government and are to be progressed by the relevant Departments and organisations.  The <i>Report </i>recommends that the Social Personal and Health Education Programme (SPHE) in schools and Youthreach centres is continued and developed.  The Department of Edcuation and Science is responsible for implementing this recommendation.  The Department of Education and Science conducted a thematic evaluation of teaching and learning in SPHE.  They reported that 98% of the schools visited had a substance misuse policy (<i>Looking at Social Personal and Health Education Teaching and Learning in Post Primary Schools, 2013</i>).  SPHE is mandatory in all primary schools and will also form part of the new mandatory 'Wellbeing' component of junior cycle in post primary schools. </p><p>The First Annual Report on the National Substance Misuse Strategy is due by the end of 2015.  The report, which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, will outline progress on the implementation of the recommendations in the Steering Group Report on the National Substance Misuse Strategy, the target for reduction in annual per capita consumption of pure alcohol, and the key performance indicators recommended in the Steering Group report.</p></reply>

However due to scheduling commitments and other diary events such as Cabinet and D&aacute;il business I am not always available to meet all who request a meeting.</p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>).  Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and over 100,000 girls have received this vaccine since its introduction.  The vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 and 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p><p>Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>is a fully tested vaccine which was licensed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2006.  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.  The introduction of new vaccines is based on the expert advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee.  Decisions on the supply of vaccines into the market are undertaken by specific expert agencies rather than being the responsibility of the Minister of the day.  </p><p>The EMA has recently completed a review of the HPV vaccine.  The review which the HPRA participated in specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  </p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  </p><p>As of the 27 November, the HPRA has received 936 reports of suspected adverse reactions or events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines.  Of the 936 reports received, 933 were associated with use of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and three were associated with Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>.  The vast majority have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and injection site reactions.  Parents of any child with a suspected adverse reaction following administration of a vaccine are advised to contact the HSE vaccination teams or their general practitioner for advice and are referred for further management if required.</p><p>The EMA has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information.</p></reply>

The HSE began its winter planning process early this year.  Funding has been made available to support the acute hospital system over the winter period by providing additional bed capacity and other initiatives to support access to care.  197 hospital beds have opened nationally since October with another 38 due to open in the next few weeks.  While it is still extremely challenging, the number of people waiting for nine hours or more on a trolley has fallen to, on average, 112 in Quarter 4.  This compares with 127 on average in June, and 173 in February. </p>  <p>   All hospitals have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care.  Last week I co-signed the ED Congestion Escalation Directive to ensure that progress made to date on overcrowding is sustained and improved upon.  The Directive requires hospitals to implement their Escalation Plan whenever the Emergency Department experiences overcrowding and it is expected that this will add to  the progress made on overcrowding so far.</p>  <p>  The National Clinical Programme for Emergency Medicine encourages, and hopes to ensure, that the diagnosis and treatment of patients in Emergency Departments (ED) is conducted in a way that potential underlying causes for a patient's symptoms including serious underlying injuries and illness are ruled out.  For this reason caution must always be taken in streaming of patients to separate areas before they have undergone a medical examination.  The ED is the safest environment for the assessment of these patients.  Emergency Medicine clinical expertise is required to differentiate between physical injury and the effects of alcohol or other substances and advanced diagnostic imaging is frequently required for such assessment.</p></reply>

In January, taking into account current pressures on acute hospital services, I put in place maximum permissible waiting times for in-patient and day case treatment and outpatient appointments of 18 months by 30 June and 15 months by year end. </p>  <p>  The HSE was provided with additional funding of &euro;51m to ensure that these maximum waiting times would be achieved.  The funding provided is intended to maximise capacity across public and voluntary hospitals as well as outsourcing activity where the capacity is not available to meet patient needs within the maximum allowable waiting time. </p>  <p>  In June, the HSE reported a performance against the 18 month maxima of 99.6% for in-patient/day cases (IP/DC) and 92% for out-patients (OPD).  The latest NTPF figures, published on Friday 6 November, continue to show improvements.  There are reductions in the total In-patient/Daycase waiting list, and in the numbers of patients waiting between 15&ndash;18 months and waiting over 18 months.  This is very positive, as it is the first time that we have seen reductions in all 3 key categories. </p>  <p>  Concerted efforts have been made to reduce outpatient waiting lists by facilitating additional clinics outside conventional working hours and outsourcing where capacity is limited.  Improvements are also evident with the end of October seeing a reduction of almost 5000 in the overall Outpatient waiting lists and of over 3000 in the number of people waiting between 15&ndash;18 months for appointments.  The total number of people waiting for outpatient appointments has fallen below 400,000 for the first time this year. </p>  <p>  The HSE is addressing the areas of underachievement of maximum waiting times with Hospital Groups as part of the regular performance and accountability process,  as well as seeking the support of the National Clinical Programmes to ensure that the appropriate referral and clinical pathways are used at all times.  The main priority is the patients affected by any delays in waiting lists and the HSE will ensure that these patients are prioritised for treatment.</p></reply>

All employees including medical staff are required to disclose and report incidents in line with the HSE's Safety Incident Management Policy.  Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from the things that go wrong is the bedrock of making systems safer.  Open Disclosure is defined as 'an open consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare.  This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event'.</p>  <p>  I recently announced that the Government has given its approval to the drafting of provisions to support open disclosure of patient safety incidents.  This will be included in the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s draft Bill on Periodic Payment Orders which is well advanced.  The legislation is part of a broader package of reforms aimed at improving the experience of those who are affected by adverse events. </p>  <p>  This legislation builds on the joint development by the HSE and State Claims Agency of the National Policy on Open Disclosure (2013).  The HSE is progressing the implementation of the Policy across all health and social care services.  We all know that when error or harm is experienced by a patient, the trust and confidence of that patient and their family are compromised.  That is why honest, open disclosure and communication, which demonstrate empathy and sensitivity, are so essential.  The intent of this legislation is to provide certain legal protections for healthcare staff for open disclosure, which is undertaken in good faith and in compliance with national standards.  This will give further support to those staff in their communications with patients and family members if an adverse event occurs.  The Ethical Code of Practice set out by the Medical Council also makes clear the responsibilities of doctors in relation to open disclosure.  </p>  <p>  Open disclosure is now HSE policy and therefore any unjustified breach of the policy (as with any HSE policy) will be managed in line with the HSE disciplinary procedures.  Where potential deviations have been identified the Healthcare records must be reviewed to ascertain any documentation in relation to communication with the patient about the adverse event and to establish if any rationale for non-disclosure has been documented.  Where there is no evidence that open disclosure has occurred the incident must be reviewed with the staff involved in the event.  The patient must be informed of the event and the impact of the event explained and acknowledged.  The patient should also be informed of the initial failure to disclose and an appropriate acknowledgement, explanation and apology provided.</p>  <p>  From a patient safety perspective the key focus of open disclosure is on learning so that systems and processes can be improved in order to reduce potential future harms to patients.  If a person is not satisfied that a health professional or administrator has fulfilled their obligations regarding open disclosure then that person has recourse to the HSE's complaints procedures.  It is also open to a person to raise a complaint with the appropriate professional regulatory body or with the Ombudsman.</p></reply>

The plan will be rolled out at a regional and local level and will involve full consultation. </p>  <p>  In terms of housing, the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government are working in collaboration to support the transition of people with a disability from institutions to social housing in the community under the Government's National Housing Strategy for People with Disability 2011 to 2016.</p>  <p>  As part of the implementation process, in 2013 and 2014 one million euro was transferred from the Department of Health's Vote to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government's Vote to provide for the ring-fenced social housing costs of up to 150 people leaving disability or mental health institutions.  At the end of December 2014, it is estimated that there were around 3,000 people with a disability living in congregated settings.  The HSE has prioritised the transition of 150 people from congregated settings in 2015. In 2015, one million euro has been allocated to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to continue this process.</p>  <p>  As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on "Time to Move on from Congregated Settings&ndash;A Strategy for Community Inclusion", I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.

This provides a legal basis for the various policies and practices which are applied by the Passport Service in the processing of passport applications.  Section 10 of the Act provides that a passport will issue in the name of a citizen as it appears on his/her birth certificate.  However, a name change for a passport from that which appears on a person&rsquo;s birth certificate is permitted under the Act in situations such as marriage for example.</p>  <p>  In cases where name change arises, other than by marriage, civil partnership, adoption or gender change, the Act specifically requires evidence of the use of this new name over a two year period.  While there is discretion under the Act in accepting evidence of usage for less than two years, this has been normally applied in the past to serious cases such as those involving domestic abuse.</p>  <p>  While the person in question may have changed her name by deed poll, this is not, of itself, evidence of a change of name.  To determine a person&rsquo;s name at any given moment in time depends upon evidence to support the constant and sustained use of this new identity.  A deed poll merely sets out an intention to change a person&rsquo;s name and does not, by itself, have the effect of changing that person's name.  A deed poll is, therefore, not conclusive evidence of a change of name.</p>  <p>  There is no record on the system of a passport application refusal to this person in her new name.  It should, therefore, be noted that her current passport is a travel identity document that is issued under the provisions of the Act and which is accepted at all international border points.  As indicated, it may be replaced with her new name if relevant evidence of the usage of that name is available to her.  If this is the case, she should make a passport application in the new identity well in advance of any future travel that she may have planned.  If not, she should plan her travel and insurance cover on the basis of the identity in her current passport.</p></reply>

Not all of the allowances listed are available to every teacher as entitlement is based on the qualifications held by the individual and/or the nature of the post for which they were employed.</p><p>Since the beginning of the financial crisis, there has been a need to enact a number of measures to reduce public expenditure.  The previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable of all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011 and required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale.</p><p>Subsequently, following the public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments, the Government decided to withdraw or modify allowances for new beneficiary public servants with effect from 1 February 2012.  Under this decision, certain allowances were withdrawn for new beneficiary teachers, including qualification allowances.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.</p><p>These measures were implemented at time of very difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.</p><p>Alleviation of the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date began under the Haddington Road Agreement.  Improved pay scales for post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 entrants to teaching were agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement.  In addition, allowances payable to post-1 January 2011 entrants and such allowances as remain payable to post-1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels.</p><p>The Lansdowne Road Agreement will, through salary increases and a reduction in the Pension-Related Deduction, begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years.  The issue of equalised pay scales was not one which could be resolved in the discussions which lead to the Agreement.  However, the flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement will be proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.</p><p>Teachers' Common Basic Scale<table><tr><th>Scale Point</th><th>1/1/10</th><th>Post-1/1/11 New Entrants to teaching - Applied 1/1/11 to 30/6/13 (Note a)</th><th>Post-1/1/11 New Entrants to teaching - 1/7/13 to 31/10/13 (Note b)</th><th>Post 1/1/11 New Entrants to teaching - 1/11/13 onwards (Note c)</th><th>Post 1/2/12 New Entrants to teaching - 1/2/12 to 30/6/13  (Note d)</th><th>Post 1/2/12 New Entrants to teaching - 1/7/13 onwards  (Note e)</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>&euro;

In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.</p>  <p>  Children with autism over the age of four may be eligible for home tuition if a school placement is not available for them.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p>  <p>  SENOs engage with schools annually in order to plan for, and to open, new special classes each year, in order to ensure there are sufficient special class placements available at primary and post primary school level to meet demand in a given area.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents are encouraged to liaise with the local SENO to discuss placement options for their child.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will continue to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new special classes, where necessary, subject to the willingness of schools to open classes.  Where a school opens a special class the NCSE will allocate supports to the class to meet the educational and care needs of the students enrolled.</p>  <p>  In addition to the mainstream educational provision provided for, there are over 1,000 special classes throughout the country at primary and post primary level.  Each special class for autism at post-primary level has a 6:1.5 pupil teacher ratio.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has advised that the school referred to by the Deputy opened an ASD class in September 2015.  There are a number of vacancies in this class which will be filled in September 2016.  The NCSE will continue to liaise with the parent of the child referred to by the Deputy in the context of their application for a placement in this school. </p></reply>

Traditionally all of the schools have been multi denominational and provide for children of all religions and none.  This applies equally to the second level schools where a legal agreement was entered into with a diocese or a diocese and religious order at the time the school was formed, often involving the amalgamation of a vocational school and a catholic voluntary secondary school.</p>  <p>  These agreements included a provision relating to religious worship and instruction. Notwithstanding that the agreements were entered into with catholic bishops or orders the provision in the agreements requires that the religious worship attended by any pupil and the religious instruction given by the ETB school must be in accordance with the rites, practice and teaching of the religious denomination to which the pupil belongs. The arrangements regarding religious worship and instruction reflect the definition of the schools as being multi-denominational. </p>  <p>  The term multi-denominational is also applied by Educate Together in relation to schools under its patronage but the usage can be distinguished from its application to ETB schools as Educate Together schools exclude any religious worship or instruction from the ordinary life of the school, and therefore could be described as non-denominational.</p>  <p>  The position of ETB schools and religious worship and instruction is evolving with an agreement reached between one ETB and Educate Together in respect of one school and a second such school in planning by another ETB. The agreements underpinning these two school excludes religious worship and instruction and can be defined as non-denominational.</p>  <p>  While I have no plans to seek to set aside the legal agreements referred to by the Deputy, as the demographics and composition of communities change in some communities a review of the configuration of second level provision could become timely.</p></reply>

This includes the allocation of a whole time equivalent of an additional 300 teachers to second level schools and brings the basis of allocation from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the school year 2016/17. This improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation is a restoration of 50% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota. The delivery of the 50% restoration through a change in the PTR allocation will allow each school to determine how best to allocate the additional resources to meet the guidance needs of the school. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to return to a situation where there would be a separate allocation for guidance in schools. The Department's Guidelines in relation to how Guidance should operate within schools will be updated for the next school year to reflect the change in the allocation process. The Guidelines will underpin the responsibility of every school to make sure that they use this additional staffing to meet their obligations to provide guidance counselling support to all students. When the allocation for guidance was brought within quota DEIS schools were protected from the change by providing for a 18.25:1 allocation compared to the general 19:1 allocation. The position of DEIS schools will be further enhanced by a change to an allocation on the basis of 17.95:1.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has recommended that a new model be developed for allocating resource teachers to schools. My Department has devised a pilot of the new model which is taking place in a number of schools during the 2015/16 school year. In taking the decision to conduct a pilot of the new model, I have been guided by the advice of the NCSE Working Group report, which recommended sufficient time be allowed for consultation before the new model is implemented. I therefore do not propose to amend the existing allocation process, pending the completion of the pilot project and the introduction of a new allocation model.</p></reply>

To date a total of &euro;82.92 million, including &euro;81.54m in contributions and &euro;1.38m in associated interest has been lodged to the special Investment Account managed by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) for the Fund in accordance with section 29 of the Residential Institution Statutory Act, 2012. Caranua accesses this funding directly as required. No Exchequer funds are provided to Caranua.</p>  <p>  I understand that in the period from January 2014, when it began accepting applications, to end October 2015 Caranua has expended some &euro;36m of the funds contributed on meeting the needs of survivors. </p>  <p>  Caranua publishes regular updates regarding applications and expenditure on its website (www.caranua.ie) while more detailed information is set out in its Annual Report and audited accounts which may be also accessed on this website.</p>  <p>  The authorised staffing complement for Caranua is 10 posts, 6 of which posts are currently filled. In addition, Caranua is utilising the services of an employment agency to provide temporary staff to assist in processing applications and to provide administrative support. A part-time accountant is provided by Caranua's external accountancy service provider.</p>  <p>  My Department is presently considering a request from Caranua to increase the number of authorised posts. If approved and implemented that proposal would lead to a reduction in the level of reliance placed on agency staff.</p></reply>

The previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable of all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011 and required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, following the public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments, the Government decided to withdraw or modify allowances for new beneficiary public servants with effect from 1 February 2012. Under this decision, certain allowances were withdrawn for new beneficiary teachers, including qualification allowances. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. </p>  <p>  Alleviation of the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date began under the Haddington Road Agreement. Improved pay scales for post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 entrants to teaching were agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement. In addition, allowances payable to post-1 January 2011 entrants and such allowances as remain payable to post-1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels.</p>  <p>  The Lansdowne Road Agreement will, through salary increases and a reduction in the Pension-Related Deduction, begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years. The issue of equalised pay scales was not one which could be resolved in the discussions which lead to the Agreement. However, the flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement will be proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.</p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  If the parents of the child referred to in the Deputy's question have concerns about their sons educational development I would suggest that they raise them with the principal of the school concerned with a view to his or her discussing the situation with the local NEPS service.</p></reply>

The fees to be applied to legacy providers seeking to re-engage with QQI, such as the organisations referred to by the Deputy, have yet to be determined.  The charging of fees to providers is integrally linked with how QQI is implementing its quality assurance and quality improvement role.  The principles and policy to inform QQI's application of fees were subject to extensive consultation.</p>  <p>  At a meeting hosted by my Department on 9th December 2014 involving representatives from QQI and the community and voluntary sector, it was confirmed that QQI would convene a working group of representatives from the sector to consider the implications of re-engagement for that sector in more detail.  It was agreed that 2015 would essentially be a lead-in time for the re-engagement process and that the issue of fees for community and voluntary providers would not therefore arise until 2016.</p>  <p>  QQI established a Joint QQI /Community and Voluntary Working Group in partnership with the community and voluntary sector to enable a process of collaboration and engagement with key stakeholders and providers.  The working group, which is facilitated by an independent facilitator with extensive experience in the community voluntary sector, had its first meeting on 3rd March 2015, and has subsequently met on 4 other occasions.  A further meeting is scheduled for December 2015.</p>  <p>  The working group also jointly hosted a consultative event on QQI's quality assurance guidelines and criteria relevant to this sector which took place on 30th June 2015.  Through these initiatives, QQI and the community and voluntary sector are engaging on a range of operational, developmental and strategic matters in the specific context of quality assurance and re-engagement.  There are no plans to conduct a regulatory impact analysis.</p>  <p>  The work of the group will assist QQI in clarifying its operational requirements for future re-engagement with community and voluntary sector organisations.</p></reply>

This study is examining international research developments in to non-ionising radiation (NIR) and electromagnetic fields (EMF) which have taken place since the publication in 2007 of a report by the then Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, entitled <i>Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields</i>.</p><p>Representatives from a number of Departments, together with national and international experts, are overseeing the study which is being undertaken by RIVM, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. It is expected that the report will be completed in the near future.  The 2007 Report noted that the majority scientific opinion was that no adverse short- or long-term effects have been demonstrated from exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). Extensive international research on the issue continues to be co-ordinated through bodies such as the World Health Organisation.</p><p>The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the licensing authority for the telecommunications industry, commissions audit reports to verify that its licensed operators are in compliance with their licence conditions relating to emission limits for non-ionising radiation. The detailed measurement results from over 1, 0 00 transmitter sites surveyed to date have so far shown total compliance. Recorded levels of radio-frequency signals are typically measured as being within the range of 0.002% to 2% of the safe exposure levels set by the ICNIRP guidelines. The location of licensed telecommunications antennae and the results of individual site survey reports can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website: .</p></reply>

The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, including the most appropriate method of valuation.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. </p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a local tax, and the rating system generally are deeply embedded in the local government system.  A large body of case law is well established and local authorities and ratepayers are, in the main, very familiar with, and generally accepting of, the operation and practice of the rating system.  Rates are also a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.</p>  <p>  Commercial rates are legally payable in two moieties; the first moiety and arrears are payable on the date of the making of the rate and the second moiety is payable on 1 July. In practice local authorities facilitate payments of commercial rates by instalments including by direct debit. As with all local charges, the invoicing and collection of due amounts is a matter for the local authority concerned to manage in light of prevailing circumstances and in accordance with normal accountancy procedures. </p>  <p> I am aware of the continued need to restrain costs on businesses. My Department has in recent years requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting, and where possible to reduce, ARVs and they have responded positively in this regard. The national average ARV decreased each year from 2010 to 2014; 2015 and 2016 are not directly comparable with previous years due to the local authority mergers and the necessity to harmonise rates across new local authority areas. </p>  <p>  I have no immediate plans to amend the legislation governing commercial rates.</p></reply>

The capped annual charge is &euro;160 for single adult households and &euro;260 for all other households until the end of 2018. All households now know what their capped bills will be until the end of 2018, which is particularly important for larger households or those with high usage due to medical needs.</p>  <p>  In addition, a water conservation grant of &euro;100 per year is available to qualifying households. The Department of Social Protection is administering the grant on behalf of my Department, which is available to households (principal private dwellings) that complete a valid response to Irish Water&rsquo;s customer registration process. </p>  <p>  The water conservation grant replaces the tax rebate and social protection measures previously announced and is a more straightforward means of addressing water issues for all households on equal terms and will reduce households&rsquo; outlay on water services both now and in the future. </p>  <p>   The charges structure was revised with a view to making it simpler and fairer, providing more clarity and certainty to households. The overall cost for those who register with Irish Water, net of the &euro;100 water conservation grant, is either &euro;1.15 a week for single adult households or &euro;3 a week for all others. Water supply will not be reduced under any circumstance.</p>  <p>  When it comes to payment, a range of easy pay options are in place, including direct debits, electronic funds transfer, payment by cash at any retail outlet with a paypoint or payzone sign or a post office where a bill can be paid in full or part payments of a minimum of &euro;5 can be made. Irish Water also intends participating in the Household Budget scheme.  This facility, operated by An Post on behalf of the Department of Social Protection, provides customers with a facility to have their household utility bills and social housing rents deducted directly from their weekly social welfare payment.</p></reply>

An additional &euro;15 million will be made available through LEADER for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine Artisan Foods Initiative. </p>  <p>  Ireland is conducting a two stage process for the selection of local development strategies to support the delivery of the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020. Stage one of the process is now complete and those successful at stage one have moved to stage two of the process, which is the preparation of local development strategies for their areas. Indeed, the preparation and submission of local development strategies is underway in each of the 28 designated sub-regional areas. A minimum period of six months to end-January 2016 has been allowed for the submission of strategies by all Local Action Groups, with the majority expected to submit strategies within that timeframe. To date, four local development strategies have been received and these are being considered at present. </p>  <p>  The focus is now on ensuring that all of the strategies are finalised so that Local Action Groups can begin accepting applications from both private promoters and community groups for projects. My priority is to begin distributing the existing &euro;250 million in funding to those rural communities. As regards additional funding, the Deputy will be aware that I recently announced a &euro;30m investment to support Town and Village regeneration. The new scheme will support the revitalisation of rural towns and villages with the aim of improving the living and working environment in rural communities and enhancing their potential to support increased economic activity into the future. </p>  <p>  The new scheme is proposed as part of a concerted effort to support the development of rural towns and villages not only as a component of a broader approach to rural development but also to improve the environment of rural dwellers in a way that will increase their quality of life and simultaneously support potential economic activity in their area.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government outlined an ambitious agenda for D&aacute;il Reform to be introduced in a phased process over the lifetime of the Government. On foot of this, since 2011 the operation of the D&aacute;il has been steadily reformed to enhance the legislative role of elected members and improve the working of the House. The measures introduced have included the following.</p><p>The number of D&aacute;il sitting days has been significantly increased by reducing the length of D&aacute;il breaks at Christmas, Easter, public holidays and the summer and introducing regular Friday sitting days. During the 45 months the FF, Green &amp;amp; PD Government was in office the D&aacute;il sat 349 days &ndash; an average of 93 days a year. The FG &amp;amp; Labour Government has been in office 56 months and the D&aacute;il has sat for 576 days &ndash; an average of almost 124 days a year, an increase of 31 more sitting days per year. </p><p>The first phase of the D&aacute;il Reform Programme was introduced in the summer of 2011 and included:</p><p>- An additional Leaders' Questions session on Thursdays, taken by the T&aacute;naiste</p><p>- Topical Issues Debates to replace the outmoded Adjournment Debates, so as to give Deputies an opportunity to raise issues direct with Ministers from the relevant Department</p><p>- Friday sittings to enable Deputies to play a fuller role in the legislative process by introducing their own Bills and having those Bills debated on the floor of the D&aacute;il</p><p>- A mechanism for appeal to the Ceann Comhairle if a Deputy is unhappy with the reply received to a Parliamentary Question</p><p>- A Pre-Legislative review system where by Ministers could provide the Heads of a Bill to the relevant Oireachtas Committee to review before the Bill was published</p><p>- Restructuring of the Oireachtas Committee system by reducing the number of Oireachtas Committees from 25 to 16</p><p>- Introducing a new Oireachtas Committee chaired by an Opposition Deputy to work with Ombudsmen's offices and review petitions. </p><p>In the summer of 2012, further reforms to the Oireachtas Committee system were introduced, which streamlined the structure and provided an additional focus on areas of priority such as Jobs and Agriculture.</p><p>In September 2013 the Government announced the second phase of D&aacute;il Reforms and the D&aacute;il debated and approved changes to Standing Orders in October 2013. These reforms are being phased in and include changes to enable more public involvement in the law-making process:</p><p>- A Pre-Legislative Stage at an Oireachtas Committee is now a general requirement for non-emergency legislation. A Minister who does not bring a Bill to Committee for Pre-Legislative Stage is required to explain that decision to the D&aacute;il.</p><p>- The new Pre-Legislative Stage allows for an unprecedented and extensive engagement by the public in law-making. The Committee can consult with experts and civic society groups; crucially, this takes place before the legislation is drafted.</p><p>- Where there has been a Pre-Legislative Stage, the Chair or Vice Chair of the Committee has an opportunity to outline the Committee's work to the members of the D&aacute;il during the Second Stage debate after the Minister and main opposition spokespeople have spoken on the Bill.</p><p>In addition, each year the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste will address the D&aacute;il setting out the Government&rsquo;s annual priorities, with Ministers setting out their Department&rsquo;s plans.</p><p>The role of Oireachtas Committees in the Budget process has also been expanded.</p><p>There has been a reduction in the number of Legislative Programmes to two per year.</p><p>The time available for legislative debate in the D&aacute;il has been increased, by increasing the total number of sitting days, extending the length of sitting days and starting at 9.30 am on Wednesdays and Thursdays. </p><p>The way legislation is debated in the Chamber has been improved:</p><p>- At First Stage, the proposer of a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill now has five minutes to outline the purpose of the Bill to the D&aacute;il and explain the reasons for proposing it.</p><p>- Where proposed legislation has been the subject of Pre-Legislative Scrutiny, at Second Stage the Chair or Vice Chair of the Committee which considered the Bill at Pre-Legislative Stage has a speaking slot, of the same length as that of the Minister and Opposition Spokespeople, to report to the D&aacute;il on the Committee's findings.</p><p>- At the end of the Second Stage debate, 45 minutes may be allowed for concluding remarks by Deputies, chosen by the Ceann Comhairle, who have previously spoken. </p><p>The number of Friday sittings has been expanded and the D&aacute;il now sits every second Friday to debate Private Members' Bills and Committee Reports selected using a lottery system. This has encouraged a rapid growth in the number of Bills introduced by Deputies, from 14 published in 2010 to 53 published in 2014. The new Friday sittings also allow Committees, for the first time, to seek directly to have their own reports debated in the D&aacute;il. </p><p>The system of Topical Issues now requires the Minister or a Minister of State from the relevant Department to reply; if this is not the case, the Deputy who raised the issue can have it deferred until a Minister or Minister of State from that Department is available.</p><p>The time allocated to Oral Parliamentary Questions to Ministers has been standardised to 75 minutes. An ordinary Oral Question will be answered only if the Deputy tabling the Question is in the Chamber when it is reached, and the Deputy is given a brief period, of 30 seconds, to outline the question. </p><p>The Government also passed the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges &amp;amp; Procedures) Act 2013 and the Standing Orders to establish an Oireachtas Inquiry system are now in place. The Banking Inquiry is the first Oireachtas Inquiry established under this new legislation.</p><p>The Convention on the Constitution's 7th Report, on the issue of D&aacute;il Reform, is currently being considered and a response is expected on this over the next few months. </p><p>D&aacute;il Reform is an ongoing process and the Government intend to bring forward a further package of reforms for consideration.</p></reply>

In the context of the Act, the term &ldquo;site&rdquo; includes residential land and any structures on such land. Under the provisions of the Act, with effect from 2019 - in respect of 2018 - a levy will be charged on the registered owners of vacant sites in designated areas in local development plans and local area plans as being in need of, and suitable for, housing. The levy &ndash; which will be applied at a rate of 3% of the market value of a vacant site with reduced rates applying in specific circumstances - will be charged each subsequent year until the site is no longer vacant. When operational, it is envisaged that the levy will be instrumental in bringing vacant, underutilised residential sites and structures into beneficial use for housing purposes and assist in increasing housing supply. </p></reply>

The Valuation Act 2001 comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p><p>The Valuation Act 2001, as amended, provides for global valuations of utility undertakings, to be carried out by the Valuation Office every five years and entered on the central valuation list. The most recent global valuations carried out by the Valuation Office are in respect of Gas Networks Ireland, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and telecommunications companies BT Ireland, Eircom, Vodafone, Three Ireland and Meteor. On 4 November 2015 the Valuation Office issued a copy of the Valuation Certificate and a schedule setting out the apportioned value to each rating authority. The previous valuation for these utilities had taken place in 2010. The Global Valuation Certificates show a reduction in the combined valuations for these utilities of &euro;112m. Moreover, the reduction in the global valuation of the ESB, following an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, will reduce the rates payable by the ESB from 2016.</p><p>The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. This process has recently been concluded in each local authority as part of the budgeting process for 2016. The implications of the Commissioner of Valuation&rsquo;s global revaluation of utility infrastructure for individual local authorities will ultimately be dependent on each authority&rsquo;s ARV, and its overall income and expenditure decided on in its budget.</p><p>My Department engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and there will be a once off adjustment in support from the Local Government Fund in 2016 to local authorities affected by the global valuations.</p><p>The estimate of the reduction in rates income arising from the new global valuations and the amount of the adjustment in the Local Government Fund in 2016 is set out in the table. The amount of the adjustment per local authority was calculated with reference to the reduction in valuation of each global utility (including the reduction in valuation of the ESB following an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal) in each local authority area, applying the latest available Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) to obtain the estimated reduction in rates income and by reducing the amount by just over 28% to accord with the available funding. <table><tr><th>County Council </th><th>Estimate of reduction in income arising from new valuations </th><th>Amount of Adjustment in Local Government Fund </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td><div>&euro;243,887 </div></td><td><div>&euro;175,549 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td><div>&euro;212,638 </div></td><td><div>&euro;153,056 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td><div>&euro;646,702 </div></td><td><div>&euro;465,493 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td><div>&euro;1,897,841 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,366,056 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td><div>&euro;717,503 </div></td><td><div>&euro;516,455 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown </td><td><div>&euro;1,045,936 </div></td><td><div>&euro;752,859 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Fingal* </td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td><div>&euro;796,831 </div></td><td><div>&euro;573,554 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td><div>&euro;835,463 </div></td><td><div>&euro;601,362 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td><div>&euro;879,403 </div></td><td><div>&euro;632,989 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td><div>&euro;361,120 </div></td><td><div>&euro;259,932 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td><div>&euro;252,149 </div></td><td><div>&euro;181,495 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td><div>&euro;122,730 </div></td><td><div>&euro;88,341 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td><div>&euro;222,631 </div></td><td><div>&euro;160,249 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td><div>&euro;399,540 </div></td><td><div>&euro;287,587 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td><div>&euro;691,776 </div></td><td><div>&euro;497,937 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td><div>&euro;793,217 </div></td><td><div>&euro;570,953 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td><div>&euro;195,614 </div></td><td><div>&euro;140,802 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td><div>&euro;315,895 </div></td><td><div>&euro;227,379 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td><div>&euro;322,133 </div></td><td><div>&euro;231,870 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td><div>&euro;267,373 </div></td><td><div>&euro;192,454 </div></td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin </td><td><div>&euro;1,337,243 </div></td><td><div>&euro;962,540 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary </td><td><div>&euro;568,963 </div></td><td><div>&euro;409,537 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td><div>&euro;312,487 </div></td><td><div>&euro;224,926 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td><div>&euro;533 </div></td><td><div>&euro;383 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td><div>&euro;749,197 </div></td><td><div>&euro;539,268 </div></td></tr><tr><td>City Council </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td><div>&euro;1,638,904 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,179,674 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin </td><td><div>&euro;4,429,335 </div></td><td><div>&euro;3,188,211 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td><div>&euro;369,492 </div></td><td><div>&euro;265,959 </div></td></tr><tr><td>City and County Council </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick </td><td><div>&euro;1,655,398 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,191,546 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford </td><td><div>&euro;849,664 </div></td><td><div>&euro;611,584 </div></td></tr></table><blockquote>*Fingal County Council had already adopted its Budget prior to 4 November 2015. </blockquote></p></reply>

This is one of the methods for the delivery of social housing by both local authorities and by approved housing bodies and significant housing delivery is also achieved through a range of other programmes supported by my Department.</p><p>The Exchequer funding drawn down by Mayo County Council in the delivery of new social housing units through both the local authority housing programme and the Capital Assistance Scheme between 2011 and 2014 is outlined in the following table: <table><tr><th><div>Year </div></th><th><div>Local Authority Housing </div></th><th><div>Capital Assistance Scheme </div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2011 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,101,258 </div></td><td><div>&euro;281,063 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012 </div></td><td><div>&euro;804,563 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,054,003 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013 </div></td><td><div>&euro;295,791 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,499,474 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2014 </div></td><td><div>&euro;709,620 </div></td><td><div>&euro;358,101 </div></td></tr></table></p><p>Allocations are not always issued to the authorities under these programmes as they are largely demand-led. In relation to future social housing in County Mayo, targets and provisional funding allocations for delivery under my Department&rsquo;s main capital and current programmes were issued to all local authorities, including Mayo County Council, in April this year. These targets were issued in the context of the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>, which provides a comprehensive response to the need for social housing and targets the provision of over 110,000 social housing units to 2020, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme. </p><p>The targets are for the period out to 2017 and the available funding is being invested in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes by the local authorities designed to accommodate 25% of those currently on the housing waiting lists. Mayo County ha s a target of 566 units, supported by &euro; 30.3 m of investment, broken down as follows: <table><tr><th>-</th><th>Local Authority Housing/ <br /><br />AHB delivery via CAS/ <br /><br />Return of vacant properties</th><th></th><th>Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme</th><th></th><th>Rental Accommodation Scheme </th></tr><tr><td>Period </td><td>2015-17 </td><td>2015 </td><td>2016/7 </td><td>2015 </td><td>2016/7 </td></tr><tr><td>Social Housing Units </td><td>146 </td><td>5 0 </td><td>137 </td><td>115 </td><td>118 </td></tr></table></p><p>The detailed implementation of the programmes and projects to deliver on targets is a matter for each individual local authority, but I am confident that good progress is being made in their achievement. When the targets were announced, it was indicated that the funding would support the refurbishment of vacant social housing units and support local authorities in both building and acquiring housing. Subsequently, I announced new social housing construction projects to the value of approximately half a billion euros, including 39 new units for Mayo at a cost estimate of &euro;7.2 million.

Section 23A of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 places certain obligations on the owner of a dwelling to register with Irish Water.  In the event that they do not register, Irish Water has the explicit legal authority to bill the owner of the dwelling in respect of any water charges relating to that dwelling.  Irish Water is providing landlords with the opportunity to prove that they are not the occupier by providing the tenant&rsquo;s name.  This will allow Irish Water to contact the tenant to complete the registration and to bill the tenant.</p>  <p>  Arrears can be avoided by entering into a payment plan with Irish Water.  Various easypay options are available through post offices or other payment providers.

A Review Group, established for that purpose in 2013 and comprising representatives from local authorities, the regional waste management offices, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Transfrontier Shipment Office, the National Waste Collection Permit Office and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, identified the existing strengths and weaknesses in this area and made recommendations for the future.  The review was also carried out in the context of the examination being undertaken by local government with respect to its existing service delivery models and cost base, and in identifying more efficient ways and means by which services could be delivered.</p><p>The Group recommended the establishment of three new regional lead authorities to drive improved performance and greater consistency in waste enforcement.  My Department engaged subsequently with Local Authority Chief Executives and Directors of Service, through the Programme Management Office of the Local Government Management Agency and the Public Service Reform and Oversight Group, to develop the work of the 2013 Review and to invite expressions of interest from local authorities who wished to bid for the role.</p><p>On 9 October, following an open and highly competitive bidding process, Cork County Council, Dublin City Council and Leitrim &amp;amp; Donegal County Councils (in a combined bid) were selected as the new Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities for the Southern, Eastern and Midlands, and Connacht /Ulster Regions respectively.</p><p>Each of these new Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) will have responsibility for co-ordinating waste enforcement actions within regions, setting priorities and common objectives for waste enforcement, ensuring consistent enforcement of waste legislation across the three existing waste management planning regions, while still leaving local authority personnel as first responders on the ground to specific breaches of waste legislation.  This is intended to facilitate a transformation from process-driven enforcement, structured around separate implementation of individual regulations, to one that focuses greatest effort on the waste problems and issues that matter most and to take swift, proportionate and effective action.</p><p>This structure will also complement the existing regional waste management planning group structure and the cooperative multi-agency approach of the Network for Ireland's Environmental Compliance and Enforcement (NIECE).  The establishment of lead regional enforcement authorities will also facilitate more streamlining of the tasks currently undertaken in the waste enforcement area.</p><p>The structures are to be put in place for an initial period of five years with a review as to their effectiveness carried out after Year Two.  A key point to note is that no enforcement powers are being taken away or transferred from local authorities to the WERLAs and the current waste enforcement network will be maintained. Consequently, local authorities will continue to receive the same level of enforcement grant subvention as heretofore, with the additional costs of establishing and staffing the three regional enforcement offices being also met by my Department.</p><p>The work of the WERLAs will be overseen by a National Steering Committee which will be chaired initially by my Department.  The National Committee will determine national waste enforcement priorities for WERLAs and drive consistency at a central level.  The Committee will include representatives from a wide range of regulatory authorities.  A National Steering Committee Contact Group will also be established to ensure that other stakeholders have a direct channel to the National Committee.</p></reply>

To facilitate this, I established the CEDRA Interdepartmental Group (IDG), comprising senior representatives of all relevant Government Departments.  The IDG is currently working in a coordinated way to ensure that each Department&rsquo;s policy development and implementation fully considers the needs of rural communities.  In this context, the focus is on maximising the financial resources already available for rural development and ensuring that these resources are directed in a way that best supports the sustainable economic development of rural areas.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain strong links with people in rural Ireland who are involved in or have a strong interest in the economic development of rural areas and communities, both Minister Kelly and I have also established an Expert Advisory Group to monitor progress and provide advice in respect of the implementation of the recommendations in the CEDRA report.</p>  <p>  In addition, work is at an advanced stage on the preparation of a Charter for Rural Ireland, which will establish frameworks and practices to support the rejuvenation of the rural economy.</p>  <p>  In line with the recommendations of the CEDRA report, I recently announced a Rural Economic Development Zone (REDZ) pilot scheme and I have made an amount of &euro;3.8 million available to support the implementation of this pilot, which consists of 51 projects.  This pilot scheme will complement the LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020, which will provide &euro;250 million in financial resources to support the development of sustainable rural communities over the coming period.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that in line with the objectives of the CEDRA report, I also recently announced an additional &euro;30 million investment package for rural Ireland, which will be rolled out over the coming months.  This funding will support the revitalisation of towns and villages with a view to improving the living and working environment in these communities and enhancing their potential to support increased economic activity into the future.</p></reply>

These measures have been identified in the Government's I<i>mplementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness</i>(May 2014).  Progress in implementing these measures is reported through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  The plan and progress reports are available on my Department's website at the following link:.</p><p>With regard to modular housing, the Government has approved the delivery of 500 units of modular housing for homeless families across Dublin.  It is intended to have the first 150 units delivered as quickly as possible in the Dublin City Council administrative area, with the City Council acting as the contracting authority.  The Council is aiming to secure the delivery of an initial fast-tracked 22 of these units before Christmas, with delivery of the remaining units commencing in late Q1 2016.  A further 350 units will then be provided across the four local authorities in the Dublin region through a national procurement framework overseen by the Office for Government Procurement.</p><p>This programme of modular housing provision is being implemented to mitigate the issues associated with an increasing volume of homeless families accommodated in inappropriate commercial hotel arrangements.  The units will provide emergency accommodation in the first instance, offering a greater level of stability while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support planning for access to all required services, including welfare, health and housing services.</p></reply>

In this regard, Ireland was assigned a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our overall energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  In addition, Member States must ensure that at least 10% of the energy used in the transport sector is from renewable sources by 2020.  The 10% transport target contributes to the overall 16% target, with the additional required contributions coming from renewable electricity (40%) and renewable heat (12%).  </p>  <p>  While the cost of any shortfall in Ireland's target of 16% has yet to be established, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has estimated that the cost to Ireland may be in the range of &euro;100 million to &euro;150 million for each percentage point Ireland falls short of the overall 16% renewable energy target.  In arriving at these figures, SEAI used the Irish onshore wind tariff support cost (lower bound) and the UK offshore wind tariff support cost (upper bound) as the cost per megawatt hour (MWh) of purchasing renewable energy credits to meet 2020 targets.  Further work commissioned by SEAI suggests the cost to Ireland may be in the range of &euro;70 million to &euro;140 million per percentage point shortfall (equivalent to &euro;50 to &euro;100 per MWh).  These estimates are based on the projected marginal cost of the renewable energy being brought to market by the selling Member State, with the cost per MWh based solely on the premium component of the tariff support and the type of technology used, ranging, as with SEAI estimates, from onshore wind (lower bound) to offshore wind (upper bound).   </p></reply>

Decisions by commercial operators to invest in particular technologies, including fixed line network technologies are taken purely on commercial grounds, having regard to the cost of service provision and the anticipated revenue returns from any such investment.  Neither my Department nor the Commission for Communications Regulation, the independent market regulator, have statutory authority to oblige any particular network provider to invest in the provision of upgraded broadband services.</p><p>The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in cases of clear market failure.  In this regard the National Broadband Plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service.  This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016.  This map is available at .  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention and includes the area of Raheen, Caherlistrine, Co. Galway.  All premises within the AMBER areas will be included in the State's intervention.</p><p>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by the end of 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. </p><p>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.</p><p>Consumers can also consult the websites of the various commercial operators to ascertain details of current and planned future deployment plans. </p><p>I can confirm that next generation broadband services have been rolled out to over 45,000 premises to date in County Galway with over 26,200 more expected to be served by commercial investment.  Approximately 62,500 remaining premises in County Galway will be covered by further commercial investment or be the target for the proposed State intervention under the NBP.  The breakdown of premises covered, per townland, is available on the High Speed Broadband Map.</p><p>Over 40 responses were received following the publication of the NBP proposed Intervention Strategy in July last.  Non-confidential versions of these submissions are being published and can be accessed at . </p><p>Meanwhile, my Department continues to review the technical and financial detail relating to potential new commercial investment proposals.

Ltd (the licensee) for a period of six years from  25 February 2010 until 24 February 2016. </p><p>PLs are reviewed by my Department every two years to ensure that the licensee has complied with all licence conditions (i.e. the licensee has carried out an acceptable work and expenditure programme and reported satisfactorily on same).  The licences in question were last reviewed in April 2014 and determined to be in good standing.  The next licence review is scheduled to be completed in early 2016.  All Prospecting Licences contain a conditional guarantee of renewal for licensees who satisfactorily observe the terms and conditions of their existing PLs.  The licensee may apply to renew their licences in February 2016 for a further six years (to 24 February 2022).  Should such an application be made, it will be evaluated by my officials.  PLs that are twelve years old may thereafter be renewed every two years subject to further evaluation by my officials.</p><p>To date, the licensee has not advised my Department of any changes in details of ownership or operation.</p><p>My Department makes all exploration work reports which are at least six years old available for public release.  Reports can be released earlier than six years, should licensees surrender their prospecting licences.  In relation to PL Areas 3435, 2899 and 2900, provisional results of the licensee's exploration are due to be made publicly available in late February 2018.  Historical work reports relating to the Allihies area are available from the Exploration Report search facility on my Department&rsquo;s website at .  </p><p>In addition historical information on the former mining operations at Allihes can be accessed on my Department's website at .</p><p>My Department is aware of the work of the Allihies Parish Co-Operative Society Limited in developing a tourist facility around the old Mountain Mine entrance and works in Allihies, County Cork.  A tourist mine project can be both beneficial to the local economy and in enhancing the perception of the mining industry in general, so long as it is undertaken with due regard to human health and safety and environmental protection. </p><p>However, as Minister of State with responsibility for natural resources, it is my primary statutory obligation to facilitate and regulate the discovery and development of new mineral deposits and as such there are currently no plans to exclude this area from prospecting. </p><p>It should be noted that all Prospecting Licences issued are restricted to exploration and do not grant any right to extraction or mining.  Any plans to carry out mining will require a separate mining lease from my Department as well as Planning Permission from the Local Authority and an Integrated Pollution Control licence from the EPA.</p></reply>

EirGrid, together with ESB Networks and Gas Networks Ireland, have respective emergency plans in place to deal with any unexpected short-term disruption to gas supplies.  The security of Ireland&rsquo;s gas supplies will be significantly strengthened by the coming onstream of the Corrib Gas field which will reduce our dependency on imported gas in the short to medium term.    </p>  <p>  Ireland has no domestic oil production and all oil consumed is imported, either in the form of crude oil that is refined at Whitegate or in the form of product.  The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) manages Ireland&rsquo;s strategic oil reserves.  NORA ensures that Ireland meets its EU and International Energy Agency (IEA) obligations to maintain 90 days' oil stocks for use in the event of an oil supply disruption. </p>  <p>  Ireland has one refinery in Whitegate, Cork that was privatised as a result of its sale by the State in 2001.  The owners of the refinery, Phillips 66, advised my Department in October that they were putting the Whitegate refinery up for sale.  A refinery sale would be a commercial matter between Phillips 66 and a potential purchaser.  As this process is under way Whitegate will continue to be operated on a business as usual basis.</p>  <p>  The Government views the continued operation of the Whitegate refinery on a commercial basis as highly desirable from an energy security and economic perspective.  Security of supply remains a fundamental tenet of our energy policy.  I am in contact with my ministerial colleagues to discuss the importance of continued operations at the facility.   </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is, therefore, a matter for the Council.</p>  <p>  Ireland has just under 100,000 kilometres of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.  Because of the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in Exchequer funding available for roads over the past number of years. Funding in 2008 was &euro;2.3 billion while funding this year is around &euro;760 million for the national, regional and local road network.  The reality is that funding will continue to be tight for the next number of years.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are aware that it is a matter for each Council to determine its priorities and to allocate funding accordingly.  Given funding constraints, my objective has to be to allocate funding to local authorities on as equitable basis as possible.  The main grant categories are, therefore, based on road lengths in each local authority's area of responsibility.  </p>  <p>  The RLR allocations for next year have yet to be decided but I expect to announce the details early next year. It is important to reiterate that State grants are intended to supplement local authorities' own resources.  In this context, I am emphasising to Councils that the commitment of local authorities to contribute significantly from their own resources, towards the cost of improving and maintaining the regional and local roads, network is essential. </p></reply>

In this regard, I wish to advise that my Department is responsible for the Wildlife Acts and the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 477/2011), both of which prohibit the spreading of invasive species.</p><p>In general, control of invasive species  such as Japanese knotweed is a matter for landowners, and my Department carries out considerable work on control of such species in National Parks and Nature Reserves. For example, work  undertaken over many years to deal with the rhododendron threat in Killarney National Park. My Department does not however  have the resources required to extend such work into urban areas or the wider countryside and is not in a position to provide dedicated funds for such work to other bodies.</p><p>The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department worked with the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) to fund and manage the <i>Invasive Species Ireland Project between </i>2006 and 2103. This initiative provides advice and guidance on the management of a range of invasive species, including the Japanese Knotweed.</p><p>Best Practice Management Guidelines for Japanese knotweed  have been published and can be accessed on the project website at . These guidelines provide practical advice to persons and organisations, including local authorities, on the removal and disposal of these species.</p><p>In addition, my Department is currently supporting the development of a Japanese Knotweed protocol for Ireland. A number of agencies, including the National Biodiversity Data Centre (NBDC), Inland Fisheries Ireland and the National Roads Authority are involved in drafting the protocol which it is to be completed next year. I am aware too that a number of  local authorities are already carrying out control programmes for problem species including Japanese knotweed.</p></reply>

In carrying out these functions, my main focus is to ensure that the victims of the Irish Famine are respectfully and appropriately remembered and also to raise awareness of current food security issues worldwide.  The Great Famine is marked each year at formal commemorations in Ireland and abroad. The 2015 National Famine Commemoration was held in Newry in September and was a great success, enjoying significant cross-community representation.  The 2015 International Famine Commemoration ceremony was held at St. John, New Brunswick, Canada in October and was also very successful.  </p>  <p>  My Department works with other Government departments and with a wide range of stakeholders to ensure that the Great Famine is marked each year by appropriate annual commemorations.  My officials are already commencing preparations for next year's national and international commemorative ceremonies, which will take place in Leinster and Philadelphia, USA, respectfully. While our primary focus must remain on the successful delivery of these commemorations, I can confirm that officials from my Department have been in contact with the Office of Public Works to examine the possibility of placing a memorial stone within the grounds of the Custom House in Dublin. This would recognise the staging of the inaugural National Famine Commemoration at that location, in 2008. As these discussions are at an early stage, no final decisions have been made in this matter as of yet.</p></reply>

The proposed programme of conservation measures for raised bogs is set out in the draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan. The final Plan is scheduled to be published early next year. </p><p>In October 2015, the European Commission approved funding under the EU LIFE programme for a &euro;5.4 million project for the restoration of active raised bog on 12 sites in Ireland&rsquo;s special area of conservation network. &euro;1.35 million will be contributed by my Department to this project. </p><p>The project will operate for a period of 5 years and will commence in January 2016. A project team is being recruited to implement this project and will be consulting with local communities in the relevant areas. </p><p>Details of the 12 project sites are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>EU Life Project Site</th><th>County </th></tr><tr><td>Killyconny Bog</td><td>Cavan and Meath</td></tr><tr><td>Clara Bog</td><td>Offaly</td></tr><tr><td>Ferbane Bog</td><td>Offaly</td></tr><tr><td>Mongan Bog</td><td>Offaly</td></tr><tr><td>Moyclare Bog</td><td>Offaly</td></tr><tr><td>Raheenmore Bog</td><td>Offaly</td></tr><tr><td>Sharavogue Bog</td><td>Offaly</td></tr><tr><td>Carrowbehy/Caher Bog</td><td>Roscommon</td></tr><tr><td>Derrinea Bog</td><td>Roscommon</td></tr><tr><td>Garriskil Bog</td><td>Westmeath</td></tr><tr><td>Carrownagappul Bog</td><td>Galway</td></tr><tr><td>Ardagullion Bog</td><td>Longford</td></tr></table></p><p>Restoration plans which will set out proposals for the restoration of all of Ireland&rsquo;s 53 raised bog special areas of conservation and associated habitats are currently being drafted. These plans will identify technically feasible restoration measures for the various zones of each bog including the high bog, cutover bog and surrounding margins. The implementation of these measures will be with a view to the targets for active raised bog at the particular special area of conservation being met. The draft restoration plans will be developed further in conjunction with local stakeholders and communities. </p><p>Typical peatland restoration measures include the blocking of drains in the high bog area, tree and vegetation clearance and installation of peat dams, where necessary. </p><p>Through consultation with stakeholders and local communities it will be possible to develop ideas for maximising socio-economic benefits for local communities through peatlands restoration. These could include improving existing or building new facilities (e.g. tracks, board walks, and bog bridges), encouraging the creation of small tourism enterprises, and enhancing the value of a site as an educational resource.</p></reply>
