    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-10a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061000052#WRA01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 92, 96, 98, 99 and 114 together. </p><p>The Government has provided over &euro;344 million for the rent supplement scheme in 2014, the purpose of which is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources. There are currently approximately 76,000 rent supplement recipients, of which over 50,000 have been in payment for more than 18 months.     A review of the maximum rent limits has commenced within the Department and will be considered as part of the budgetary process. The most recent review was completed in June 2013 with revised rent limits introduced on 17 June 2013. Despite pressures on the social protection budget, the last review saw rent limits increase in line with market rents in some areas, including Dublin and Galway, with Dublin limits increasing by a weighted average of 9%. </p><p>All prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, particularly in urban areas, are now finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties. Policy in relation to implementing rent controls on the amounts landlords can charge is a matter for my colleague in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  </p><p>I can assure Deputies that Department officials have considerable experience in dealing with customers of the scheme and will continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met. Staff in the Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service have discretionary powers to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant, for example, when dealing with applicants who are homeless or who are at risk of losing their tenancy.  Such cases are examined on a case by case basis having regard to the situation presented. Statistics are not maintained on the number of applications seeking payments over the maximum limits or their outcome.  </p><p>In view of the current supply difficulties, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive in conjunction with Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations have agreed with the Department a protocol so that families at risk of losing existing private rented accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf.<i></i>Cases will be assessed on an individual basis having regard to the individual circumstances and families requiring additional support will receive the necessary assistance from the Department, including financial support as necessary. The necessary operational arrangements are currently being put in place and it is expected that the initiative will be launched on 16 June 2014.  The number of families that will require assistance under this arrangement is not known at present but will be monitored following its rollout. </p><p>Officials in the Department are continuing to engage with those in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in progressing the transfer of customers with long term housing needs from this Department to the local authorities under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-10a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061000052#WRA01500"><p>Since the lowest point of the jobs crisis, the unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of over 15% to 11.8% at present.  The long-term unemployment rate has fallen from 9.5% to 7.3%.  The number of long-term unemployed has fallen from 204,000 in early 2012 to 156,000 at present. In terms of the Live Register, a target was set that 75,000 of those who were long-term on the Register at the beginning of 2012 would move into employment by the end of 2015; the number who have already done so is now over 46,000 and we are well on track to beating our target &ndash;a target that was considered by many to be overly ambitious.   The youth unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 33% to 25% at present, and the number of unemployed young people has fallen from 64,000 early 2012 to 47,500 now.</p><p>The Department operates four main schemes whose purpose is to provide a pathway to employment.</p><p><b>JobsPlus</b>is targeted specifically at encouraging employers to recruit people who are long-term unemployed.  Over 2,300 long-term unemployed people have been placed in employment as a result of JobsPlus and over 60% of these have been unemployed for 2 years or more.  </p><p><b>Community Employment and T&uacute;s</b>provide work experience opportunities for long term unemployed jobseekers mainly within the community and voluntary sector.  The numbers of participants on Community Employment and T&uacute;s as of April 2014 were 23,000 and 7,400 respectively up from 21,200 and 4,800 in April 2013. </p><p>The <b>JobBridge</b>scheme provides a stepping stone for unemployed people to employment in the wider economy.  As of the end of April there were over 6,700 participants on the Scheme, up 12% from 6,000 in April 2013.  To date nearly 30,000 people have participated in the scheme.  Evaluation results indicate that 61% of leavers from JobBridge find employment within 5 months of leaving their internship.</p><p>With specific reference to youth unemployment, the main strategy of the Government to reduce youth unemployment is the Youth Guarantee.  Approximately 5,000 places had been taken up on schemes covered by the Youth Guarantee in the first four months of this year. </p><p>The impact of the employment incentives outlined cannot be precisely separated from the impact of other factors affecting the decline in youth and long-term unemployment (such as the general improvement in the economy and the labour market resulting from the government&rsquo;s overall economic and employment policies).  However, I am satisfied that they have played an important part in recent progress in reducing unemployment levels.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-10a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061000052#WRA01700"><p>As the Deputy is aware, Gateway is a work placement initiative delivered by county, county and city, and city councils. While over 2,500 positions have been identified for Gateway by councils so far, progress on recruitment has been slower than anticipated.  By week ending 13th June, a total of 270 jobseekers will be actively working on Gateway across 16 councils.  For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, these include the Limerick Council, which has been one of the leaders in providing opportunities in this regard. An additional 469 jobseekers are currently awaiting the completion of contracts to commence work.  The councils have been tasked with starting this cohort within the next few weeks.  I expect placements to accelerate thereafter, with the aim of the councils employing 3,000 jobseekers by the end of the year.   Responsibility for the recruitment of jobseekers and identifying work opportunities rests with individual councils.  Similar to T&uacute;s, participants are selected by the Department from those persons in receipt of a jobseekers allowance payment for 24 months or more. Jobseekers are informed when they have been selected and, once they agree to participate, their contact details are passed to the relevant council for recruitment.  </p><p>  To further support the recruitment process, the Department has recently put arrangements in place for jobseekers meeting the criteria to apply to the Department or councils for participation on Gateway and for Departmental case officers to nominate suitable candidates for recruitment. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has also sanctioned 150 acting-up allowances for existing local authority staff to support the supervision of Gateway. Additionally, that Department has provided &euro;2 million to offset the costs of health and safety, training for specified tasks and personal protective equipment. </p><p>  I believe that there are considerable personal and wider social benefits to jobseekers from engaging in worthwhile work in their community. Gateway is modelled on successful schemes such as community employment, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme with the same level of pay and similar conditions of employment. </p><p>  The ambition of the Government is that Gateway will build on these positive initiatives using the quality working environment, resources and opportunities available to county and city councils enabling the long-term unemployed to make a positive contribution to their communities whilst up-skilling themselves for future prospective employment. </p></reply>

Staff members are regularly reminded of their obligations under data protection and information security policies and of the penalties applicable in respect of any breach of these policies. All staff members, every year, must sign undertakings to read and act in accordance with data protection policies and guidelines, which are kept under constant review and are updated as appropriate.  Data protection obligations are also covered on training programmes for new and existing staff members. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-10a.31.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061000052#WRA02500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 121 and 350 together.</p><p>  Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).  Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 8.5%).  </p><p>  Self-employed workers may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings. Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person&rsquo;s income from one year to the next are taken into consideration. It is recognised that the downturn in the economy had an impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels. This may be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance purposes. As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p><p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral. </p><p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. </p><p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries. To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes. The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  </p><p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  </p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I will reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.</p></reply>

When the outcomes of complaints to the Ombudsman are examined, over half or 55% of DSP complaints were not upheld, compared to 51% in 2012.  It is important to emphasise that staff in this Department are very conscious of their obligations to claimants and every effort is made to ensure people receive the entitlements due to them.</p></reply>

These entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice &amp;amp; Terms of Employment Acts, 1973-2001, and certain pension contributions.  Various other statutory awards made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, Rights Commissioners, etc., are also covered by the scheme.  </p><p>  Where a person&rsquo;s former employer was a limited company, the company must be in liquidation or receivership in order for the person to be eligible to claim under the insolvency payments scheme.    In such circumstances, the liquidator or receiver becomes the relevant officer for submitting claims as he or she has access to the company records and can certify that the amounts claimed are in order.   </p><p>  I am aware that there are cases where companies have ceased trading without engaging in a formal winding-up process and that in some such cases those employers owe monies to their employees.      Such employees are not eligible for payments under the insolvency payments scheme.

Participants are engaged for 19&frac12; hours per week to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities. The Department has engaged 35 local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to deliver the scheme.  The scheme currently provides work opportunities for 2,600 participants and 130 supervisory staff. The funds allocated for 2014 amount to &euro;45m. This level of funding will allow the scheme to continue along the same lines in 2014 as in previous years but does not allow for the recruitment above the numbers stated above. As of week ending 6th June, 2,562 participants and 130 supervisors were engaged on the RSS.    As with all schemes, the Department is required to ensure that the RSS remains effective, provides value for money and is in line with other Government policies.  A Focused Policy Assessment on the Scheme was carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and the results were published in recent months.  The Assessment highlights the difficulty in assessing the impact and benefits from the Scheme and that it is generally out of line with current Government policy, which is focused on having greater targeting of labour market activation and on the integration of income support schemes with activation. The Assessment also concluded that while there are social inclusion aspects to the RSS, these are not clearly defined and an improved activation component would be beneficial.  </p><p>  The Department is examining the conclusions made in the Assessment, together with the recommendations contained in the Review of Employment Support Schemes which published by the Department in early 2013. This is with a view to determining the measures that need to be implemented to improve the delivery and focus of the RSS, whilst ensuring the continued support for the provision of services across rural areas.</p></reply>

Table 2 contains details of JobBridge internships that commenced in 2013 with State agencies.  Internships other than JobBridge internships in State agencies fall outside the remit of the Minister for Social Protection.  As of 3 June, 2014, 13,433 host organisations had participated in JobBridge since it was launched on 1 July, 2011.  Of those, 1,378 host organisations were in the Public Sector.  While the independent evaluation of JobBridge undertaken by Indecon International Economic Consultants and launched by the Taoiseach and I on 1 May, 2013, found that there is a higher rate of progression into employment among participants who completed  their internships in private sector organisations, at 54.8%, compared to 41.2% among participants who  undertook their internship in a public sector organisation and 43% within the community and voluntary  sector, it was also found that, in every sector, JobBridge internships are providing effective and high quality real-workplace experience to break the cycle where the unemployed, even those with good vocational or academic qualifications have difficulty securing employment without demonstrable work experience. </p><p>The exceptional rates of progression into employment among interns in the public sector, where a recruitment moratorium limits possibility of progression into employment with the host organisation, make it clear that the benefits gained by interns in public and voluntary sector host organizations significantly improve their employability and facilitate them in gaining employment either with their host organisation or with another employer.</p><p>I am satisfied that there is minimal displacement created by JobBridge on foot of the independent evaluation.  Host organisations are required to give an undertaking that there is no displacement of existing employees when advertising an internship opportunity.  Where displacement is alleged it is dealt with vigorously by the Department.</p><p>In order to protect the intern and to ensure the integrity of JobBridge, a variety of control measures and criteria are in place to prevent displacement of an existing position and to ensure appropriate training and development and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the intern.  In addition to the initial vetting of advertisements and the requirement for the host organisation to participate in monthly compliance reporting, the Department has conducted over 6,400 onsite monitoring visits, either randomised visits/inspections with host organisations or for the investigation of complaints received from interns or concerned individuals.  The Department treats such complaints very seriously.</p><p><b>Table 1 - State Agencies that have participated in JobBridge</b><table><tr><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Adoption Authority of Ireland</th></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">An Bord Altranais</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">An Chomhairle Leabharlanna / The Library Council</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Athlone Town Council</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Ballina Town Council</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Ballyfermot Citizens Information Service</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Ballymun Whitehall Area Partnership</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Bord Bia</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Bord Gais Networks</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Bord na Mona Plc</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Bord Scannan na hEireann / Irish Film Board</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Border Regional Authority</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Border, Midland and Western Regional Assembly</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Bray Town Council</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Broadcasting Authority of Ireland</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Canal Communities Partnership</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Carlow County Council</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Carlow County Enterprise Board </td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Castlebar Town Council</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Cavan and Monaghan ETB</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Cavan Local Authorities </td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Central Bank of Ireland</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Central Statistics Office</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Chester Beatty Library</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Child and Family Agency Louth</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Citizens Information Board</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">City of Cork VEC</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">City of Dublin Education and Training Board</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">City of Limerick VEC</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">City of Waterford VEC</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Clare County Council</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Clare County Enterprise Board</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Co Cavan VEC</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Co Cork VEC</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Co Monaghan MABS</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Co.

I am satisfied that significant progress has been made in addressing the Appeals backlog. The average processing time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 the average processing time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks and the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  Further improvements were achieved in 2013, when the average appeal processing time reduced to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision, and to date in 2014.  As at 31 May 2014, the time take to process an appeal requiring an oral hearing reduced to 29.9 weeks and 22.5 weeks for a summary decision.

This arrangement is known as the Lough Payment Scheme or MABSlink. The purpose of the Household Budget facility is to facilitate deductions from social welfare payments for specified creditors.  The Lough Payment Scheme catered for a variety of creditors, some outside those specified for the Household Budget facility.  In order to regularise these arrangements, the local MABS companies which have clients currently availing of the Lough Payment Scheme are working with these clients to explore alternative arrangements for paying their bills.     The Citizens Information Board, which has statutory responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is liaising with the local MABS companies concerned.  Particular effort is being made to ensure that suitable alternative options are made available and that clients will be fully supported through the transition to the alternative arrangement.

In terms of mainstream provision, people with a disability can access all activation programmes &ndash; for example, SOLAS training courses, Community Employment schemes and JobBridge.  For those previously receiving a social welfare payment, they will either retain that payment or move to a training allowance or temporary employment payment, depending on their individual circumstances.</p><p>  In addition to access to its mainstream provision, Solas also funds customised training for people with disabilities provided by a range of Specialist Training Providers.  The Department of Social Protection also provides a wide range of income and work-related supports specifically for people with disabilities.  Work-related supports include:</p><p>- the EmployAbility service (formerly the Supported Employment Programme) which facilitates the integration of people with disabilities into paid employment in the open labour market; and </p><p>- a number of other supports specifically for employers (the Wage Subsidy Scheme - which pays an employer a subsidy for employing a person with a disability; the Work Equipment Adaptation Grant, the Employee Retention Grant, and the Disability Awareness Scheme). </p><p>  In addition, the Department launched the Disability Activation Project (DACT) at the end of 2012.  DACT is based in the Borders, Midland and Western (BMW) region and covers four specific strands associated with the employment of people with disabilities.  DACT will provide invaluable guidance as to how best to further develop effective activation measures generally for people with disabilities into the future.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Department also funds the WAM (Willing Able Mentoring) project, the objective of which is to bring graduates and employers together to promote access to the labour market for graduates with disabilities.  </p><p>  In short, the Department, in co-operation with the Department of Education and Skills, is committed to supporting people with disabilities to participate more fully in employment and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers they may encounter in finding and sustaining work employment.</p></reply>

As part of this process and to support the Department&rsquo;s activation commitments under the Pathways to Work Programme and the development of Intreo services nationally, it has been necessary to review the administration of all its services across its remit including the CWS. Overall, this has resulted in a rebalancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities including the relocation of some staff to main centres, primarily Intreo offices, which will provide a full range of services, including the CWS and these will, in general, be available in one location. Where the community welfare service has been re-structured, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service including increased frequency of clinics and improved phone services. If a person is unable to travel to a clinic, for example due to illness, alternative arrangements are in place including arranging a visit to the client&rsquo;s home if necessary.    People claiming supports under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme generally only interact with the Department on an occasional basis, for example, when seeking an exceptional needs payment or in claiming additional supports such as rent supplement, which are usually reviewed once to twice yearly.  Feedback from the community welfare service staff and interaction with customers in relation to the restructured service is positive and the service is providing benefits to customers including the removal of unnecessary travel to clinics through greater use of the phone system, meetings by appointment which has improved queuing times and increased availability of officers in particular locations to process and investigate applications. </p><p>  The Department continuously reviews all areas of its business, to ensure that the best use is made of available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department and that the services provided are reconstituted, where necessary, to meet the changing needs of Irish society.   </p></reply>

As at 31st May 2014, child benefit is in payment to around 614,122 families in respect of some 1.175 million children with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion in 2014.Safeguarding the child benefit budget is a priority and in this regard the Department has taken a proactive approach to ensuring that it is only paid to eligible families. A policy of issuing eligibility certificates to parents commenced in 2008 and is still in operation. The control policy for the scheme was reviewed in 2010 to ensure that controls in place to prevent fraud and abuse continue to be effective and relevant. As a result of this review, additional enhanced and updated control measures have been devised and implemented.  The Department carried out a Fraud and Error survey on child benefit in 2012 which confirmed the Department&rsquo;s view that the child benefit scheme is a low risk scheme in terms of fraud and error.  In addition, the percentage of savings arising from the eligibility reviews has been falling year on year proving the effectiveness of the control programme and indicating that the existing control policy is effective. Control savings in 2013 were some &euro;77 million. An overpayment recovery policy is also actively implemented by child benefit section to ensure that any money claimed fraudulently is recovered.  The child benefit control programme will continue to be kept under regular review to ensure that fraud across the customer base continues to be minimised. </p></reply>

There has been a steady growth both in the number of families supported by FIS over recent years and associated expenditure as set out in the table.    Expenditure on the FIS scheme is estimated to be &euro;281.7 million in 2014, up &euro;20 million on 2013.   <table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Number in payment  (approx.) </th><th>Expenditure  (&euro; Millions) </th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>28,875 </td><td>204.5</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>32,310</td><td>223.6</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>44,160</td><td>261.5 (provisional) </td></tr></table></p><p>The Department avails of every opportunity in its engagement with employers and jobseekers to build awareness of the availability of FIS and how this payment may benefit potential employees with children.  The increasing numbers of families in receipt of FIS is testament to the effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s information strategy for the scheme and the significant improvements in customer service and processing times for FIS customers. </p><p>The Departments web site www.welfare.ie has full information on the FIS scheme and provides typical family scenarios to aid understanding and provide comparisons.  This information is also available in all the Department local offices, CICs and information offices.  </p><p>In addition a series of road-shows have also been held around the country designed to inform employers about the wide range of employment support services provided by the Department, including FIS.  Case Officers in each locality will specifically use FIS as an incentive to move people from the long-term Live Register to employment.</p><p>Furthermore, the Department launched a Benefit of Work ready reckoner in December last year.  The ready reckoner gives an indication of the difference between a person&rsquo;s potential in-work payment, including FIS, and current out-of-work payments.  </p><p>The Department will shortly be launching a poster campaign in its Intreo centres and local offices to further promote FIS. </p><p>In conclusion, I am satisfied that the FIS scheme is being  promoted and evidence shows that it is fulfilling its role in assisting employees to take up employment opportunities and to remain at work. </p></reply>

This allowance is subject to a means test for those aged under 70.

To qualify for Farm Assist, a person must be a farmer, farming land in the State, aged between 18 and 66 and satisfy a means test.  There were just over 10,300 recipients of farm assist at end December last and nearly &euro;99.5 million was spent on the scheme in 2013.  The farm assist scheme is based on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and was introduced in 1999 to replace &lsquo;Smallholders Unemployment Assistance&rsquo; for low income farmers.  Farm assist recipients retain all the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.   Recent changes to the scheme have brought it into closer alignment with the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed persons.</p><p>  The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is designed to reflect the actual net income from farming.  Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.  </p><p>  The scheme, including the recent changes, is kept under ongoing review.  Last year I met with representatives from the Irish Farmers Association to discuss a number of issues including the farm assist scheme.  </p></reply>

By way of illustration, the projects being supported include:</p><p>- a project which is developing individualised occupational therapy programmes to enable people affected by arthritis to overcome the barriers they face in accessing, remaining in or returning to work;</p><p>- a project which is developing an interagency response to meet the needs of young people with learning disabilities;</p><p>- a project which aims to significantly broaden the number of employers who employ people with disabilities by increasing awareness of the capabilities, skills and competencies to be found among people with disabilities as well as highlighting the supports available to employers in this area.</p><p>  As well as the immediate positive outcomes which are being generated for those people participating, the outcomes of all of the projects will also provide valuable guidance as to how best to further develop effective activation measures generally for people with disabilities into the future.  I should mention also that the Department funds the WAM (Willing Able Mentoring) project, the objective of which is to bring graduates and employers together to promote access to the labour market for graduates with disabilities.  The Department is deeply committed to supporting people with disabilities to participate more fully in society and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers they may encounter in finding work and at work.	</p></reply>

Drafting is at an advanced stage and it is my intention to seek Cabinet approval for the publication of the Bill in the coming weeks.The legislation will provide for the development of a mechanism to record the deaths of Irish persons normally resident in the State who die while on short-term absences from the State. When a person dies abroad the death is registered by the authorities in that country, from which a certified copy of the death registration is obtainable.  In general, only deaths which occur within the State can be registered here although there are some exceptions, such as the death of a person on board an Irish aircraft, the death of a member of the security forces serving outside the State or where a death occurs in a country which does not have a system in place to register deaths.   I realise that it is very important for families to have the death of their loved one abroad recorded in Ireland.  In this regard, the Department has examined options for providing a mechanism that deals with these cases in a way that addresses the concerns of families while ensuring the validity of the current registration process.  An important part of this proposal is that there will be retrospective applicability.</p></reply>

The Department is currently in the process of evaluating tenders for the provision of the service.The allocation of additional resources to the activation of long term unemployed people was the focus of an updated &ldquo;Pathways to Work&rdquo; policy statement published in July 2013 (PTW 2013).  Having examined various resourcing and contracting options, and taking note of recommendations by the OECD among others, it was decided to procure additional capacity from providers with expertise and experience in the provision of employment supports or related services.  This additional capacity will augment the Department&rsquo;s own activation capacity as well as that already delivered under contract.  Currently the Department has some 50 contracts in place for the provision of Local Employment Services and Job Clubs in 75 locations around the country.    It is important to note that JobPath is not intended to be a substitute or replacement for any of the services currently offered by the Department either directly or via LES and JobsClubs; rather it will provide an additional element of support to enable people who are long-term unemployed and those most distant from the labour market to enter/re-enter employment or progress towards employment.</p><p>  In designing JobPath the Department has taken on board experiences in various jurisdictions with regard to such contracting, as well as its own experience from its current contracted provision. In order to mitigate the potential for &ldquo;creaming and parking&rdquo; JobPath has been designed so that the Department controls the referral process, higher payments are made for those who are more difficult to place into sustainable employment and poor performance by contractors can result in financial penalties.  In addition, unlike the position in UK, contractors must, subject to financial penalty, guarantee every JobPath participant a baseline level of service irrespective of the degree of difficulty in placing them into sustainable employment.  JobPath has therefore been designed with a focus on regular and on-going engagement with individual Jobseekers to ensure all clients while on JobPath receive an appropriate service. </p></reply>

Declaration 11 on Article 17 (6) and (7) further provides that the European Parliament and the European Council are jointly responsible for the smooth running of the process leading to the election of the President of the European Commission and that, prior to the decision of the European Council, representatives of the European Parliament and of the European Council will conduct the necessary consultations in the framework deemed the most appropriate. </p><p>  This process is now underway. On 27 May, I attended an Informal dinner of Heads of State or Government for an initial discussion on the results of the European Parliament elections. </p><p>  We took note of the letter from the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament inviting the Council to start consultations in conformity with Declaration 11 and gave a mandate to President Van Rompuy to conduct consultations on behalf of the European Council with the Presidents of the newly constituted political groups in the European Parliament. President Van Rompuy will also have bilateral talks with members of the European Council. I expect that President Van Rompuy will report back on these discussions to the European Council meeting on 26 June. Before and after the 27 May meeting, the topic has of course featured in my discussions with my European Council counterparts.</p><p>  Turning to the process of appointment for members of the European Commission, Article 17.7 of the Treaty on European Union provides that the Council, by common accord with the President-elect of the Commission, shall adopt the list of the other persons proposed for appointment as members of the Commission, on the basis of the suggestions made by Member States. I expect that the appointment process for the other 27 members of the European Commission will begin swiftly once a President-elect of the European Commission is in place.</p></reply>

While increased support for eurosceptic parties and, more worryingly, parties with extreme views on some issues, is a cause of considerable concern, support varies greatly across Member States and should not be overstated. A sizeable majority of voters registered their support for pro-EU parties, thus ensuring that they will continue to represent the largest political groups in the new European Parliament. </p><p>  On 27 May, I joined other EU Heads of State and Government in Brussels to discuss the outcome of the elections and the significance of the results for the way the EU functions and how it is perceived. It is clear that citizens have sent some strong messages which must be heeded. I stressed that our immediate focus must be on addressing the concerns raised by Europe&rsquo;s citizens and that this will best be achieved by prioritising measures to speed up economic recovery and spur job creation across the EU, including through the completion of Banking Union, deepening of the single market, and the agreement of free trade agreements with external partners. </p><p>  At the meeting, Heads of State and Government agreed on the need to set a positive and future-oriented agenda for growth, competitiveness and jobs while accelerating the recovery, as part of our collective response to the elections. Leaders also set some broad orientations on priorities and the strategic agenda for the years ahead, which will be the focus of further discussion at the June European Council.</p></reply>

No decision has yet been taken on the holding of a referendum.  Indeed, the question of holding a referendum may only become clear after the next UK general election.  My strong belief is that the UK is better off within the European Union, and that the Union benefits hugely from British membership.  The UK is Ireland&rsquo;s nearest neighbour and largest trading partner.  The recent State Visit by President Higgins to the UK highlighted again the extraordinary breadth and depth of the excellent relations between our two countries.  The contribution of our shared membership of the EU, where we have so frequently shared interests over the years, to the development of that relationship is not insignificant.  For very many reasons, it is clearly in Ireland&rsquo;s interest for the UK to remain in the European Union.</p><p>  The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p></reply>

The excessive use of administrative detention has been criticized by the EU on a number of occasions in recent years, and I have also spelt out my concerns about the practice, including here in the Oireachtas. There has been a significant reduction in the use of the practice by Israel during this period, but the problem remains a serious one. At the Universal Peer Review of Israel at the UN Human Rights Council in October 2013, conducted directly with the Israeli Government, Ireland focused in particular on issues relating to the detention of minors, and recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that Israel end night arrests of children, the admissibility in evidence in military courts of written confessions in Hebrew signed by Palestinian children, the use of solitary confinement against minors, and the denial of access to family members or to legal representation.</p><p>These serious concerns were also among those raised by Ireland in its statement under agenda item 7 on &lsquo;the human rights situation in Palestine&rsquo; at the 25<sup>th</sup>session of the Human Rights Council in March.</p><p>In addition Ireland raises its concerns bilaterally, both with the Israeli Embassy in Dublin and with the Israeli authorities in Israel, at every appropriate opportunity.  Finally, Ireland provides financial support to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs who are active in bringing these issues to light. We have seen some improvements in issues relating to detention, but much more remains to be done.</p><p>As I have stated before, it is right that Israel should be held to appropriate standards in dealing with civilians under its military occupation. However, it is only right also to note that Israel is not alone in giving rise to such concerns. Similar or worse treatment of persons in detention could be reported from many other countries in the region and elsewhere.</p></reply>

Only Greece and Cyprus did not receive CSRs this year.</p><p>  Having successfully exited the Programme of Financial Assistance, Ireland is now fully participating in the semester process for the first time. The engagement of Ireland in the annual process is part of the normalisation of our position as a post Programme country. The European Semester is a part of the new regime for economic surveillance, in operation since 2011 and codified by the 'six-pack' of legislative measures adopted in December 2011, to secure and maintain sound public finances across the EU, promote growth and employment and avoid macroeconomic spillovers between Member States.</p><p>  The publication of the Annual Growth Survey (AGS) at the end of November 2013 commenced the fourth European Semester cycle. The Country Specific Recommendations now proposed by the Commission are based on its assessment of Member States' Stability Programme Updates and National Reform Plans submitted in April this year. They are designed to ensure that Member States work together to put in place and maintain the necessary conditions for stability, growth and jobs.</p><p>  The Commission addressed a variety of CSRs to the 26 participating Member States in the fields of budgetary, fiscal and financial matters. The CSRs also cover areas where they propose deeper structural reforms. Ireland received a total of seven (7) CSRs.</p><p>  The proposed CSRs for all 26 Member States are being processed through the relevant EU Committee formations and Ministers in all relevant Council formations will work in a coordinated and consistent manner towards final endorsement of the 2014 CSRs by Heads of State and Government at the June European Council before being finally adopted by the ECOFIN on 8 July.</p></reply>

The European Commission has indicated that it will also review whether any issues raised relating to the regulatory framework require action.</p><p>Setanta is a Maltese incorporated company which was both authorised and prudentially supervised by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). Setanta was regulated at EU regulatory level in accordance with a directive known as Solvency I which currently places requirements on the amount of regulatory capital European insurance companies must hold against unforeseen events. I understand that Setanta met its EU regulatory obligations and under EU law was, therefore, entitled to trade across EU borders.</p><p>Under EU legislation the Central Bank of Ireland is not<b></b>responsible for the prudential supervision of Irish branches of credit institutions authorised in other EEA Member States and operating under a passporting arrangement in to Ireland.  The Central Bank does however have responsibility for the supervision of such entities in the following areas: in co-operation with the home state regulator, assessment of their compliance with liquidity requirements; secondly, consumer protection issues; and thirdly, compliance with Anti-Money Laundering regulations.</p><p>The current legal and regulatory framework for the provision of insurance in the EEA, and the supervision of that activity, is prescribed by European Union Law in the Life and Non-Life Insurance Directives. The provision of insurance throughout the EEA on a freedom of services basis and a freedom of establishment basis (i.e. a branch) within this framework is predicated upon the absence of internal market frontiers and the mutual recognition of the authorisation of insurance undertakings by Member States.</p><p>The Insurance Directives specify particular roles for both the home Member State supervisory authority (i.e. the supervisory authority that grants an authorisation) and the host Member State supervisory authority (i.e. the supervisory authority of a Member State where an insurance undertaking conducts business of a freedom of services or freedom of establishment basis) of an insurance undertaking. Insurance undertakings authorised under the Insurance Directives are subject to solvency and financial reserving requirements, the supervision of these requirements is the sole responsibility of the home Member State supervisory authority. The primary objective of these requirements is to ensure that claims made in respect of policies issued will be adequately provided for by an insurance undertaking.</p><p>Under EU law which governs non-life insurance, an insurer is required to inform the regulator in its home Member State (its home regulator) that it intends to pursue business in another Member State. The home regulator must then provide the host regulator with a certificate attesting that the insurer covers the EU Solvency Capital Requirement, as well as the nature of the business which the insurer intends to undertake. The insurer may start to pursue business from the date that the certificate is communicated to the host regulator, in this case the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p>Under Article 20 of the Third Non-Life Directive the Home Regulator is also required to notify the Host Regulator if the solvency margin of an undertaking falls below the statutory requirement. In such instances the Home Regulator should inform the Host Regulator of the measures it has taken to address the solvency deficit.</p><p>Following negotiations that were completed at European level in November, 2013, a new regime known as Solvency II will commence on 1 January 2016, which will further strengthen the EU regulatory framework. The Solvency II EU Directive sets out new, stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.  The new regime will also ensure greater cooperation between supervisors.</p><p>In relation to my comments on Parliamentary Question No 103 of 27 May, I made these comments in the context of a standard consumer transaction with a supplier.  The directives I mentioned set out the prudential protections already in existence and also those currently being introduced at EU level. These measures will offer both brokers and consumers additional protections. I am aware that as intermediaries it is not expected that brokers would investigate the solvency or other financial data on an insurer it was dealing with.</p><p>The point I was making was that as professional advisors, brokers can provide additional guidance and reassurance that consumers with very limited knowledge of the industry can avail of.  I think it is reasonable that brokers should explain the differences between the price and terms and conditions of each insurance policy they are proposing. I am sure most if not all are doing that.  It is not unreasonable therefore to expect that they would also give guidance on the relative financial strength of insurance companies based on public available information.  For example, the insurance companies may have received public rating agency confirmation of their financial strength and brokers may be able to advise clients of the differences between the ratings of different insurance providers being proposed and remind clients that price is not the only criterion in the purchase of insurance products.</p></reply>

However, I have also said that although it is my intention to alleviate the burden I can only do so when the public finances allow it. </p><p>  I would advise the deputy that it is unlikely that a reduction in labour taxation would pay for itself through additional spending in the economy, in the short run.  It cannot be assumed that any loss in Exchequer revenue from reductions in income tax or USC would be completely offset by additional indirect taxes that might arise, for example, from additional consumer expenditure, not least because taxpayers might apply their additional take-home pay to saving or to debt reduction. If the resulting shortfall was not made up for in tax increases elsewhere this could jeopardise our goal of reaching a 3% deficit by 2015. Therefore, I have no plans to introduce any income tax changes in advance of Budget 2015, which is scheduled for October next. Given the above concerns, a reduction in income tax at that stage, could only be considered in a scenario where the economy performs strongly enough that such a reduction would not threaten the achievement of the deficit goal outlined earlier and sustainable public finances in the longer term. Notwithstanding the above, I do acknowledge that reductions in labour taxation could have positive medium-term impacts in terms of increased employment.</p><p>  It should be acknowledged that Ireland has a progressive taxation system which ensures that the burden of taxation falls most heavily on those with a higher ability to pay. The low effective tax rates for low income workers ensures that work pays and is a growth friendly aspect of Ireland's tax system.   The latest data from the OECD's 2013 Taxing Wages report shows that Ireland has one of the most progressive income tax systems in the developed world. It is in this context that the Government has committed in the Programme for Government not to increase the marginal rate of income tax.</p><p>  The Programme for Government also contains a commitment not to change tax credits, which at current levels ensure that an estimated 856,000 workers are excluded from the charge to income tax entirely. Furthermore, delivering on a commitment in the Programme for Government, the USC was reviewed by the Department of Finance in the lead up to Budget 2012.  As a result of the review of the USC, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum. It is estimated that this removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge.</p></reply>

Only Greece and Cyprus did not receive CSRs this year. </p><p>  Having successfully exited the Programme of Financial Assistance, Ireland is now fully participating in the semester process for the first time. The engagement of Ireland in the annual process is part of the normalisation of our position as a post Programme country. The European Semester is a part of the new regime for economic surveillance, in operation since 2011 and codified by the 'six-pack' of legislative measures adopted in December 2011, to secure and maintain sound public finances across the EU, promote growth and employment and avoid macroeconomic spillovers between Member States.</p><p>  The publication of the Annual Growth Survey (AGS) at the end of November 2013 commenced the fourth European Semester cycle. The Country Specific Recommendations now proposed by the Commission are based on its assessment of Member States' Stability Programme Updates and National Reform Plans submitted in April this year. They are designed to ensure that Member States work together to put in place and maintain the necessary conditions for stability, growth and jobs.</p><p>  The Commission addressed a variety of CSRs to the 26 participating Member States in the fields of budgetary, fiscal and financial matters. The CSRs also cover areas where they propose deeper structural reforms. Ireland received a total of seven (7) CSRs.</p><p>  The proposed CSRs for all 26 Member States are being processed through the relevant EU Committee formations and Ministers in all relevant Council formations will work in a coordinated and consistent manner towards final endorsement of the 2014 CSRs by Heads of State and Government at the June European Council before being finally adopted by the ECOFIN on 8 July.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-10a.222.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061000056#WRE01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163, 164 and 188 together.</p><p>At the outset, I would like to say that both I, as Minister for Finance, and the Government are concerned over the situation that arose with regard to the Irish policyholders of Setanta Insurance Company Limited (Setanta).  My Department and the Central Bank will be reviewing the circumstances relating to Setanta and will be reporting to me on what lessons can be learnt and how the framework can be strengthened. The European Commission has indicated that it will also review whether any issues raised relating to the regulatory framework require action.  </p><p>Setanta is a Maltese incorporated company which was both authorised and prudentially supervised by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). The Central Bank is in contact with the MFSA in relation to Setanta Insurance Company Limited, the impact on policyholders and the provision for relevant and appropriate information.</p><p>Setanta was regulated at EU regulatory level in accordance with a directive known as Solvency I which currently places requirements on the amount of regulatory capital European insurance companies must hold against unforeseen events. I understand that Setanta met its EU regulatory obligations and under EU law is, therefore, entitled to trade across EU borders. Under EU legislation the Central Bank of Ireland is not<b></b>responsible for the prudential supervision of Irish branches of credit institutions authorised in other EEA Member States and operating under a passporting arrangement in Ireland.  The Central Bank does however have responsibility for the supervision of such entities in the following areas:</p><p>1.in co-operation with the home state regulator, assessment of their compliance with liquidity requirements;</p><p>2.consumer protection issues; and</p><p>3.compliance with Anti-Money Laundering regulations.</p><p>The current legal and regulatory framework for the provision of insurance in the EEA, and the supervision of that activity, is prescribed by European Union Law in the Life and Non-Life Insurance Directives. The provision of insurance throughout the EEA on a freedom of services basis and a freedom of establishment basis (i.e. a branch) within this framework is predicated upon the absence of internal market frontiers and the mutual recognition of the authorisation of insurance undertakings by Member States.  </p><p>The Insurance Directives specify particular roles for both the home Member State supervisory authority (i.e. the supervisory authority that grants an authorisation) and the host Member State supervisory authority (i.e. the supervisory authority of a Member State where an insurance undertaking conducts business of a freedom of services or freedom of establishment basis) of an insurance undertaking. Insurance undertakings authorised under the Insurance Directives are subject to solvency and financial reserving requirements, the supervision of these requirements is the sole responsibility of the home Member State supervisory authority. The primary objective of these requirements is to ensure that claims made in respect of policies issued will be adequately provided for by an insurance undertaking. </p><p>Under EU law which governs non-life insurance, an insurer is required to inform the regulator in its home Member State (its home regulator) that it intends to pursue business in another Member State. The home regulator must then provide the host regulator with a certificate attesting that the insurer covers the EU Solvency Capital Requirement, as well as the nature of the business which the insurer intends to undertake. The insurer may start to pursue business from the date that the certificate is communicated to the host regulator, in this case the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p>Under Article 20 of the Third Non-Life Directive the Home Regulator is also required to notify the Host Regulator if the solvency margin of an undertaking falls below the statutory requirement. In such instances the Home Regulator should inform the Host Regulator of the measures it has taken to address the solvency deficit.</p><p>Following negotiations that were completed at European level in November, 2013, a new regime known as Solvency II will commence on 1 January 2016, which will further strengthen the EU regulatory framework. The Solvency II EU Directive sets out new, stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.  The new regime will also ensure greater cooperation between supervisors.</p><p>The Central Bank had Regulator to Regulator contact with the MFSA in September 2013. In October 2013 the Central Bank undertook a consumer protection inspection of Setanta. The Central Bank became aware of prudential issues in the course of this investigation and subsequently shared these with the MFSA in November 2013. At this point the Central Bank entered into a phase of heightened contact with the MFSA in relation to these issues. Regular contact was maintained in the following months, and in January 2014 an announcement was made that the firm would cease writing new business and issuing further renewals. The Central Bank wrote on the 16<sup>th</sup>January 2014 to advise my Department of their concerns with Setanta's solvency margin and I was subsequently informed of this.  </p><p>With regard to the position of Setanta policyholders, my officials have been in discussions with the Central Bank of Ireland, with the Setanta Liquidator, the Accountant of the High Court and with the insurance industry representative bodies and I have asked them to convey my wish that every effort is made to facilitate Setanta policyholders in obtaining new motor insurance policies and in understanding their overall position.  We are endeavouring to obtain legal certainty on a number of matters relating to policyholders' claims for compensation and this will be made publicly available in due course.  At this time, I propose to set out the position as it currently stands.  </p><p>Setanta was formally placed into liquidation by the MFSA on the 30 April 2014 and a liquidator was appointed. Officials from my Department together with officials from the Central Bank met with the Liquidator and his representatives in Ireland on 7 May 2014 and the Central Bank is in ongoing contact with him regarding the position of Setanta policyholders. All Setanta policies have now been cancelled in line with the terms of the policies.  </p><p>In the circumstances, I continue to strongly advise policyholders to make alternative insurance arrangements without delay and that they should contact their insurance broker or an insurer directly to seek alternative cover.</p><p>The Liquidator made arrangements for policyholders to obtain their &quot;no claims bonuses&quot; certificates from Setanta. Insurance Ireland have informed me that these certificates are being honoured by other insurers and we are aware that many insurers are being flexible surrounding requirements for documents.  In addition, the Insurance Ireland 'Declined Cases Agreement' is available to policyholders of Setanta.  I am informed that under the agreement, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance, if he/she has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.  I understand that Insurance Ireland is also making information available to those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to this matter through their service at (01) 676 1914 or by email at .</p><p>With regard to Setanta premiums and claims, the position on each policy is for the liquidator to decide in due course.  My officials and the Central Bank will remain in close contact with the Liquidator and I have asked that public statements are provided to clarify matters for policyholders and claimants.</p><p>The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is a non-profit-making organisation registered in Ireland.  All insurance companies underwriting motor insurance in this county must, by law, be members of MIBI and contribute to the funding of claims in proportion to their market share.   </p><p>The principal role of MIBI is to compensate innocent victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles. This is regulated under the terms of an Agreement between the MIBI and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We are endeavouring to clarify the position on a number of matters relating to policyholders' claims for compensation, including the role of MIBI in this regard.  However, if, for legal reasons, MIBI is not in a position to accept a claim, these third party claims will be eligible to proceed for consideration by the High Court for compensation from the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF).</p><p>Under Section 6 of the Insurance Act 1964 the Minister for Finance may, on the recommendation of the Bank, advance from time to time to ICF such sum as he thinks proper to enable payments out of . During the administration of Quinn Insurance Limited, Primor plc (formerly PMPA) and Icarom plc (formerly Insurance Corporation of Ireland) the State was required to advance funds to the ICF in order to ensure that the administrators were adequately funded in order to meet their financial obligations as they arose.</p><p>Claims on personal insurance policies will be payable from the ICF.  All ICF payments are subject to the limit of 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser. Under Section 3.6 of the Insurance Amendment Act 1964 (as amended) first party claims by a body corporate or unincorporated body are not covered by the ICF. </p><p>The refund of premiums for either commercial or personal insurance policies is not covered by the ICF or MIBI. However, unpaid premium would fall to be claimed from the Setanta Liquidator in due course.</p></reply>

Where local authorities do not take up properties identified by NAMA, the properties are let or sold by their owners/receivers.  Once demand has been confirmed for houses and apartments and contracts entered into, NAMA immediately makes them available for social housing.  This often involves significant NAMA investment to complete construction works and resolve outstanding statutory compliance issues.  NAMA provides detail on this process on page 30 of its Annual Report and Financial Statements for 2013.  <table><tr><th>Local Authority Functional Area</th><th>Total Made Available by NAMA</th><th>Demand Confirmed by Local Authorities</th><th>In Negotiation</th><th>Complete/ Contracted</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow Co.

The total value of this lending was approximately &euro;2.8 billion. The Bank sought to enforce its security in April 2011 only to discover that steps had been taken to undermine the value of that security. It is the Bank's position that these steps were executed pursuant to a fraudulent conspiracy between members of the Quinn family. The Bank commenced proceedings in June 2011 in Ireland in respect of this conspiracy and obtained a number of injunctions against members of the Quinn family. The Bank's position is that both prior to and following the commencement of the conspiracy proceedings that members of the Quinn family have used every means at their disposal to hide assets from the Bank. Extensive efforts have been made by the Bank to retrieve assets in a range of jurisdictions with limited success. </p><p>  Prior to the appointment of the Joint Special Liquidators (JSLs) to IBRC in February 2013, the Bank was informed through a solicitor, that two former clients of his (the informants) had information pertaining to the assets held by the Quinn family. The Informants requested that an agreement be put in place between them and the Bank to recompense them for providing information. Before entering into an agreement, the Bank undertook due diligence on these two people to establish their credibility.</p><p>  Following this due diligence, the Board of IBRC decided that it was incumbent on the Bank to do what it could to establish the truth of the information promised by the informants in order to ensure that any assets properly belonging to the Bank be discovered. The Board initiated an agreement with the informants. This agreement was on the basis of a percentage of any funds retrieved directly through information provided by the informants.</p><p>  When the JSLs were appointed in February 2013, they were appraised of the proposed agreement which had not been fully concluded. The JSLs are under a legal duty to realise assets and pay creditors including the Irish taxpayer. Having reviewed all of the details pertaining  to this, the JSLs formed the view that the proposed arrangement was appropriated as it would only arise if funds were retrieved as a result of information provided by the informants. In March 2013, an agreement between the Bank and the informants was signed providing that they would receive 3% of any cash recoveries.</p><p>  The JSLs note that this information was detailed in an affidavit sworn by them and opened in the English High Court.  </p><p>  This arrangement is a matter for JSLs who have been appointed to maximise the overall return for creditors in the liquidation including the Irish taxpayer.</p></reply>

They are provisional and may be revised.</p><p>  I assume the deputy is enquiring as to the revenues that would be generated from consumption taxes across the economy as a result of any extra spending that might occur as a result of such a cut in income tax. It is not possible to estimate such a figure. However, it is unlikely that a reduction in labour taxation would pay for itself through additional spending in the economy, in the short run.  It cannot be assumed that any loss in Exchequer revenue from reductions in income tax or USC would be completely offset by additional indirect taxes that might arise, for example, from additional consumer expenditure, not least because taxpayers might apply their additional take-home pay to saving or to debt reduction. If the resulting shortfall was not made up for in tax increases elsewhere this could jeopardise our goal of reaching a 3% deficit by 2015.</p></reply>

The lender must also provide the borrower with the advantages of the offer and explain any disadvantages. </p><p>If the lender is not offering the borrower any alternative repayment arrangement, the reasons for this must be given in writing. The lender must also inform the borrower that a copy of the most recent Standard Financial Statement (SFS) is available on request, and provide the borrower with details, in writing of:</p><p>- other options available </p><p>- the borrowers right to make an appeal</p><p>- the website of the Insolvency Service of Ireland</p><p>The same information must be given to the borrower if he/she does not accept the alternative repayment arrangement offered to by the lender.</p><p>Furthermore, the CCMA provides that if a borrower is not satisfied with the alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender, or if the lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement, the borrower will have the right to appeal that decision to the lender's internal Appeals Board.  If the borrower is not happy with the outcome of an appeal/complaint made to the lender, s/he can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO). Further information on how to make a complaint to the FSO is available at <i>.</i></p><p>Regarding data on repossessions, Central Bank statistics indicate the following is the position since the start of 2011 in respect of primary dwelling properties:-<table><tr><th>-</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014 (Q1 only)</th></tr><tr><td>Court Order</td><td>196</td><td>194</td><td>251</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>Voluntary or abandoned</td><td>412</td><td>410</td><td>515</td><td>227</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>608</td><td>604</td><td>766</td><td>281</td></tr></table></p><p>Central Bank statistics are not in a position to indicate the housing status of households following repossession or the number of houses that were surrendered arising from the new statutory insolvency processes, though it is noted that these only became operational towards the end of 2013.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (in respect of the housing authorities) and the Department of Justice and Equality (in respect of the Insolvency Service) will be the appropriate Departments for the provision of available data on these aspects.</p></reply>

Joint Investigation Units are in place and comprehensive exchange of information takes place, including in relation to suspected 'working and signing'.  </p><p>  As to individuals making false claims for social protection payments in another jurisdiction, that is primarily a matter for that jurisdiction.  However, I am aware that Department of Social Protection officials works closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland and I'm sure that if the Deputy will pass to DSP any evidence he has of individuals making false claims for social protection payments in Northern Ireland, they will have the matter examined.  </p></reply>

The purpose of the strategy is to underpin the future competitiveness of the country, ensuring that we continue to be well-positioned to attract the inward investment that has been so important to our economic development.</p><p>  The strategy includes the Government's desire for a return to sustainable levels of mortgage lending as part of a healthy market. This involves the consideration of measures to stimulate the development of housing. In order for developers to be supported, they need confidence that customers will be capable of accessing finance to purchase new builds. This means mortgage products being available to potential purchasers with an ability to support repayments.</p><p>  In Ireland's recent abnormal housing market, lending volumes have declined dramatically. The banks are highlighting the lack of supply of houses in particular urban areas as a contributing factor for the lack of drawdown of approved mortgage facilities.  I would look upon the development of this initiative as being an aid to encouraging and facilitating the supply of new homes particularly for young families.  </p><p>  In other jurisdictions, such as the UK and Canada, "mortgage insurance" markets have been developed to support bank mortgage lending, particularly to 'First Time Buyers'. Mortgage insurance allows banks to share the risk of mortgage lending, either with the public sector or with private sector insurance companies with the aim of increasing bank lending in general or to target groups. </p><p>  My Department is committed, under this strategy, to examine the concept of a mortgage insurance scheme and how it might benefit new housing completions in the Irish market. The objective of any scheme would be to ensure adequate availability of mortgage finance on affordable terms for new completions, particularly for 'First Time Buyers', as the economy recovers. </p><p> As the Construction Strategy mentions, my Department is undertaking an economic impact analysis which will assess the impact such a scheme would have on the Irish housing market, taking into consideration time limits, targeting 'First Time Buyers' or owner occupiers and focussing on new housing. The analysis will draw lessons from mortgage insurance initiatives undertaken in other countries and will include questions as to the appropriateness of a price cap as well as regional or geographic restrictions. Some schemes, currently in place in other jurisdictions, operate on a commercial basis. Once this analysis has been completed and presented to me I will consider next steps.     </p></reply>

International investors will only put their money to work alongside the ISIF if they have confidence in the commerciality of the investment process.</p><p>  In recent months, the NTMA, in consultation with the Department of Finance and a number of other Government Departments and Agencies, has been developing an Economic Impact Framework to identify target areas for investment which have higher potential economic and employment impact, and which will also facilitate the identification of categories of investment that would be expected to assist and accelerate normalisation of capital markets in Ireland following  the financial crisis.</p><p>  Given that the ISIF is not yet operational, it is not possible to say now what will be the nature and shape of the ISIF's ultimate investment portfolio. I expect that the ISIF will seek investment opportunities across the country; however, the draft legislation does not mandate fixed allocations of capital for specific regions because the ISIF is primarily a provider of finance and so will be only one player in the development of proposals with economic and employment impact. It would not make sense to have ISIF capital segregated waiting for investment proposals in a particular region when it could be put to good use elsewhere. In any case, the ISIF will be a revolving fund, in the sense that it will seek to realise its investments as appropriate in order to have capital available to make new investments. </p><p>  The ISIF is open for business and is actively seeking investment opportunities across the country. In March this year the NTMA held a market engagement event in Dublin castle seeking investment opportunities and co-investors. The ISIF can be contacted directly with proposals for commercial investment.</p></reply>

Firstly, nominal economic growth has not materialised as expected and the forecast nominal GDP for 2015 (which is used as the denominator for deficit purposes) has reduced from &euro;181.6bn to &euro;174.5bn</p><p>  Secondly, given the latitude provided by the restructuring of the promissory note last year, estimated voted expenditure ceilings have increased by c. &euro;0.5bn.  This was agreed in the context of Budget 2014. Finally, related to the lower than expected economic growth, tax revenue in 2015 is forecast at some &euro;1.2bn lower than this time last year.  There were also some minor positive offsetting factors.</p></reply>

The CCMA is issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and lenders covered by the Code are required to comply with it as a matter of law.  The Central Bank has the power to administer sanctions for a contravention of this Code.    In relation to buy to let mortgages, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, which falls within the remit of the Minister for Housing and Planning, provides the main regulatory framework for the private rental sector and prescribes the statutory rights and obligations of landlords and tenants.</p><p>The Central Bank published the revised CCMA in June 2013.  As part of the financial institutions' delivery of full implementation of the revised CCMA, the boards of directors of all mortgage lenders were required by the Central Bank to sign off that all of the provisions of the revised CCMA had been fully implemented and tested and that staff training had been completed.   Compliance with the CCMA will continue to be central to the Central Bank's work programme throughout 2014 and an inspection of mortgage lenders to test compliance with the revised CCMA will be conducted later this year. </p><p>The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers in difficulty. If a borrower is not happy with the way that their lender is dealing with them or if they think the lender is not complying with the CCMA, the borrower can make a complaint to their lender. Under the CCMA, borrowers have the right to appeal to the lender's Appeals Board if they are not happy with the alternative repayment arrangement offered or where a lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement or if they believe they have been wrongly classified as not co-operating.   If the borrower is not happy with the outcome of the appeal/complaint made to the lender they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p><p>The monthly mortgage restructures and arrears data published by my Department also provides an impetus for those MART banks to increase the pace of provision of mortgage restructures.  The latest publication, in respect of the end of March, shows that some progress has been made in putting permanent mortgage restructures in place.  For example, the total number of permanent restructures of principal dwelling houses mortgages has risen from around 51,000 in December to around 62,000 in March 2014.  In addition, the latest Central Bank quarterly mortgage arrears and restructures publication ()  shows that lenders now have over 92,000 PDH mortgage accounts categorised as restructured at the end of March.  The data published by my Department, as well as the Central Bank data, would appear to demonstrate some success by the lenders in addressing the accounts in arrears as well as measures to prevent borrowers from going into arrears.  However, increased engagement in this area by the financial institutions will be necessary to address the situation of those remaining householders facing difficulties in meeting their mortgage commitments.</p></reply>

Member States must apply a standard VAT rate of 15% or greater and have the option of applying one or two reduced VAT rates of 5% or more to the goods and services listed in Annex III of the EU VAT Directive. Ireland operates a standard VAT rate of 23% and two reduced VAT rates of 9% and 13.5%.</p><p>  Annex III allows Member States to apply a reduced VAT rate of 5% or more to the construction, repair and renovation of housing, but not to non-residential construction. While most Member States apply the higher standard VAT rate to construction services, Ireland applies the 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to all construction services, including non-residential construction, under a derogation in Article 118 of the EU VAT Directive.  This provides that Ireland can maintain our reduced VAT rate on non-residential construction services because we applied a reduced rate to non-residential construction services on and from 1 January 1991.  However, this derogation is only permissible where the VAT rate applying is 12% or greater.  In this case, while Annex III would allow Ireland to operate a 9% reduced VAT rate on the construction of residential housing, there is no provision in the VAT Directive that would allow Ireland to apply a 9% VAT rate to non-residential construction services.</p></reply>

Schools will decide what mix of subjects, short courses and other learning experiences will enable their students to meet the requirements of the 24 Statements of Learning, including those related to science education.</p><p>  This approach provides an opportunity to enhance provision for Science Education at Junior Cycle. The specification for Science will give schools the freedom to provide more time for Science if they deem it appropriate, or to provide short courses or learning experiences such as involvement in the Young Scientist and Technology competition or SciFest.

The continued allocation of the concessionary post is dependent on the teachers concerned remaining on the staff of the school and the appropriate enrolment figures being maintained. </p><p>  The school referred to by the Deputies, Bunscoil McAuley Rice, was allocated a concessionary mainstream teaching post upon amalgamation in 2007. This was allocated on the basis of the school operating on a split site and the school was informed that the post would remain in place until the school moved to a new building, on one site. This arrangement remains in place, however as the school is moving to its new building in September 2014 the concessionary post will be removed for the coming 2014/15 school year. </p><p>  The staffing arrangements for the 2014/15 school year (Circular 0007/2014) were published on 24 January, 2014. The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final. </p><p>  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing arrangements also include the provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolment for September 2014. The school referred to has been provisionally approved for a developing school post for the 14/15 school year pending confirmation of its enrolment at 30 September 2014.</p></reply>

In total, I have approved the spending of more than &euro;70 million on the Summer Works Scheme to allow over 770 schools undertake improvement works during the summer months. </p><p>  Commensurate with the level of funding set aside for the Scheme, applications were assessed on a top down basis in accordance with the prioritisation criteria outlined in the Circular accompanying the Scheme. Unfortunately, due to the scale of demand for funding under the Scheme, it was not possible to grant aid all applications including those received for windows.  However, in accordance with the Scheme's Circular, the school's application will be retained and will be prioritised for consideration under further rounds of the Summer Works Scheme in the future, subject to availability of funding. I regret that there is no other funding stream available for window replacement.</p><p>  However, it is open to the school authority to submit an application for Emergency Works funding should they deem the works required to be of a particularly urgent nature. In regard to the consideration of an Emergency Works application, the school authorities must be advised that the main purpose of the Emergency Works Scheme is to ensure the availability of funding for urgent works to those schools that are most in need of resources as a result of an emergency situation. </p><p>  An emergency is a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment, which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action and in the case of a school, if not corrected, would prevent the school or part thereof from opening. Details of the Scheme, together with an application form for grant assistance, can be accessed on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</p></reply>

It is schools that employ teachers and not my Department. However my Department has issued a number of Circulars addressing this issue in recent years. Under these Circulars School Principals must maintain a list of unemployed registered teachers who are available for substitute work at short notice and report to the Board of Management on any exceptional occasion where they have to engage a registered teacher who is retired. Circular 31/2011 details a cascade of measures for the recruitment of teachers, prioritising registered teachers over retired registered teachers and unregistered people.</p><p>  A retired teacher who returns to teaching on or after 1 February 2012 will commence at the first point of the incremental salary scale (i.e. the lowest point or starting salary for teachers). Incremental credit for service prior to 1 February 2012, qualification allowances and certain job role allowances are also not payable. This measure represents a significant financial disincentive for teachers who retired at the top of their salary scale, often with a post of responsibility allowance, to return to teaching.</p></reply>

In 2012 the Commission announced that it had commenced dismantling the records of the vaccine trial division by returning the records supplied to their original sources and by seeking the return of copy documents from third parties for confidential disposal.

Following on this contact, it was ascertained that there are currently two schools, with the same Patron, as the school referred to by the Deputies which have lost or are due to lose mainstream teaching posts.  These schools have spare accommodation capacity within their buildings and expressed a willingness to accept an additional stream of Junior Infants each, which my Department approved, to alleviate any pressure on places in the area.  This undertaking was given by these schools on 19th March last after contact with my Department.  Prior to that date, children may have been refused a school place in the two schools in question but this should no longer be the case.  In further recent contact with the schools involved, my Department has been advised that the schools concerned are continuing to offer places.    </p><p>  The Deputies will appreciate that in view of constraints on my Department's capital budget imposed by the need to meet demographic demand, it is important that school size is monitored and that a balance is preserved among all schools in catchment areas to ensure that one school is not expanding at the expense or the viability of another school.

However, the reports also concluded that the intended purpose of the scheme was not always generally well understood by parents or schools and that the scope and purpose of the scheme should be clarified for schools. </p><p>  It is important to note that the new Circular, for the most part, reflects existing allocation practices which have been in place in recent years, as opposed to introducing new criteria.</p><p>  The Government approved an extra 390 SNA posts last December for the period to end-December 2014, which means that there are now almost 11,000 SNAs available to work with children who have an assessed care need in primary, post-primary and special schools</p><p>  These extra posts will ensure the Government's policy of ensuring every child assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to support.</p><p>  Implementation of the circular should ensure that children's care needs are better understood so that SNAs can work more effectively to assist children. </p></reply>

The first phase of that programme focussed on putting in place the policies and procedures which would allow QQI to engage with providers with no existing relationship with any of its predecessor bodies, FETAC, HETAC and the NQAI. QQI is now putting in place the policies required for it to re-engage with legacy providers. </p><p>  Re-engagement in this context refers to the agreement by QQI of a provider's overall procedures for quality assurance and enhancement, as required by Part 3 of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act, 2012.  Currently, legacy providers are engaging with QQI on a transitional basis, and will be required to establish a new formal quality assurance arrangement with QQI and move into what is referred to as a &quot;Lifecycle of Engagements&quot;.</p><p>  Re-engagement will involve the comprehensive evaluation by QQI of providers' quality assurance procedures against QQI's new quality assurance guidelines, which will be based on those used by HETAC and FETAC, but with additional elements required by the 2012 Act.  Agreement of those procedures by QQI will allow providers to access QQI's range of services, including the validation of programmes and the making of awards.</p><p>  QQI published a number of draft policy papers regarding its re-engagement with legacy providers in March 2014 to facilitate consultation with relevant stakeholders.  The Board of QQI is to consider the draft Policy on Re-Engagement with Legacy Providers at its next meeting and, if approved, the Policy will then be published with a view to its implementation from the Autumn. </p><p>  Under Section 80 of the Act, QQI is required to determine the fees which apply to the providers with which it engages, and to seek the consent of both the Minister of Education and Skills and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  QQI has not yet determined the relevant fee.</p></reply>

The Act requires that a school Code of Behaviour shall, inter alia, specify the standards of behaviour that shall be observed by each student attending the school and the measures that may be taken when a student fails or refuses to observe those standards.</p><p>  In relation to a school's closing date, the arrangements in relation to the standardised school year do not require that the start or end of the school year should be standardised. However, schools must provide of a minimum of 167 teaching days at post-primary level and 183 teaching days at primary level.</p><p>  Under the provisions of the Education Act, 1998, the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school. Decisions in relation to matters relating to the school's closing date and the implementation of the school code of behaviour are dealt with at local school level and any concerns relating to same should be addressed to the relevant school authorities. The complaint procedures adopted by most schools are those that have been agreed between the teacher unions and school management bodies. </p><p>  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the action of the school has had a negative effect on a child. </p></reply>

In particular my Department does not support a strategy which leaves a student in an unsupervised situation (e.g. a locked room or a corridor) while the child is in the care of the school. Many schools withdraw pupils occasionally from the main classroom for short periods of time in order to provide support to them, or to manage pupil behaviour, particularly if a child is exhibiting behaviours which may be a danger to themselves or others. In some circumstances, a child who is exhibiting extreme behaviours may be brought to another room to ensure the safety of other pupils and until they are calm again. Such rooms or spaces may not be officially designated as withdrawal rooms, e.g. schools may use existing classrooms or other spaces within the school. This is a normal facet of the management of pupil behaviour. Where used, it will normally form part of a school's response to behaviour and part of student support structures, procedures and practices. </p><p>  Some special schools for pupils with severe emotional behavioural disorders, or Autism, where there are a greater number of pupils likely to exhibit distressed behaviour, may use a room which is designated as a safe space for withdrawal purposes, in order to ensure pupil safety and to prevent self-harm or harm to other pupils. These rooms are variously described as 'withdrawal rooms', 'time-out rooms', or 'safe spaces'. In all cases where such a room is used the child should be under continuous supervision. In circumstances where special schools use designated time out procedures, they should do so with the consent of parents and the school Board of Management.</p><p>  The Board of Management of each school is responsible for the care and safety of all of the pupils in their school. Schools should supervise and support children who are distressed or out of control until they have recovered and are able to re-engage in the classroom. Schools may seek advice from their local National Educational Psychological Services psychologist, from their NCSE Special Educational Needs Organiser, or from the National Behavioural Support Services, as to how children with behavioural needs can best be supported in school.</p><p>  Training is available for schools in relation to the provision of support for children with special educational needs from the Special Education Support Services (SESS), who can, as part of their designated training modules, provide guidance for schools in relation to containment or management measures for difficult behaviour.</p><p>  There are a number of published guidelines available to schools:</p><p>-  The Department recently published new Guidelines for Schools on Supporting Students with Behavioural, Emotional, and Social difficulties, which are available on the Department's website www.education.ie</p><p>-  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) has also developed guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour. In developing a Code of Behaviour schools must specify the standards of behaviour that shall be observed by each student attending the school. All parents must be made aware of behaviour management strategies employed by a school. This guidance document on Developing a Code of Behaviour advises that specialised behaviour management strategies, such as the use of restraint, should not be used without expert advice, training and monitoring. In particular the guidelines point to certain sanctions which are regarded as inappropriate, including leaving a student in an unsupervised situation (e.g. a corridor) while in the care of the school.</p><p>-  The National Educational Psychological Services document Behavioural Emotional and Social Difficulties- a Continuum of Support: Guidelines for Teachers also provides advice for teachers, including some advice on the use of "Time Out" procedures in the classroom.</p><p>  The Department has asked the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to prepare Policy Advice on Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders. In developing this policy advice, the NCSE will consult widely with parents, professionals and other stakeholders and interested parties while also conducting research in relation to this area. As part of the process to develop this policy advice, the NCSE will consider the issue of the use of withdrawal in schools and advise the Department in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-10a.491.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061000061#WRK04600"><p>Under EU law, public contracts above certain values must be advertised EU-wide and awarded to the most competitive tender in an open and objective process. The aim is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. </p><p>  However, I understand that the European Commission issued guidance in 2010 that identified a range of social considerations that could be relevant for procurement including promoting employment opportunities for young unemployed or long-term unemployed and promoting compliance with core labour standards. This guidance stressed that when incorporating social considerations into the procurement process one of the key challenges is ensuring compliance with the EU Treaty Principles and the Procurement Directives. The EU procurement directives primarily envisage that social considerations may be included as contract performance conditions, provided they are not discriminatory and are included in the contract notice or in the contract documents and relate to the performance of the contract. For example, the EU Directives state that contract performance conditions may be intended to favour on-site vocational training, the employment of people experiencing particular difficulty in achieving integration, the fight against unemployment or the protection of the environment. </p><p>  The issue of maximising the potential of public contracts to deliver social benefits is something that I have been examining. Therefore the use of social clauses in public procurement is limited to instances where they are targeted at factoring into the procurement process consideration of social issues such as employment opportunities, equal opportunities and social inclusion.  In order to be compatible with EU law, they must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States.</p><p>  Challenges arise from the need to ensure that: value for money is not adversely affected; additional costs are not placed on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers; and the targeted benefit is capable of being measured and monitored during execution of the contract. </p><p>  The inclusion of social clauses in the procurement process would appear to be most suited to situations where the social benefit could be considered a core requirement and can be directly linked to the contracting authority s policy or strategic plan. Experience in other Member States, would also indicate that social clauses will tend to be used for services and works contracts rather than supply contracts.  A further consideration is the ability of contracting authorities to effectively monitor compliance with the social clause; this may be more difficult where some of the work is to be performed in another Member State. </p><p>  The use of a social clause requiring a contractor to recruit a certain percentage of those employed on a public works construction site from the ranks of the long term unemployed is being piloted on a limited number of schools projects under the Devolved Schools Programme Design and Build Framework, which is being administered by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  The Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC) last year approved the pilot initiative to be included in the NDFA Devolved Schools Programme.  </p><p>  A framework of contractors has been set up for the Devolved Schools Programme, which consist of a mix of new builds, extensions and some remedial works to existing schools both at a primary and post primary level.  Three contracts were awarded in February off the Devolved Schools Programme.  The projects will be constructed using the public works contract for Building Works designed by the Contractor.  A clause has been included in the contract which requires that 10% of the person weeks worked on the contract be undertaken by individuals recruited from the ranks of the long-term unemployed.  There is also a requirement for 2.5% of the person weeks on the contract to be undertaken by apprentices.  </p><p>  It is important to note that such a provision must be managed carefully both to ensure that the requirements set can be met and monitored but also consideration must be given to their impact on a sector that has experienced decline in output since 2008 as it may result in significant displacement of those already in employment.  </p><p>  The contractor s compliance with this clause under the Devolved Schools Programme will be carefully monitored in accordance with the terms set out in the contract.  Once initial evaluations on the performance of the clause have been undertaken any necessary amendments will be tabled at GCCC before they are incorporated into the PPP element of the Stimulus Programme.</p><p>  In addition in order to maximise the effective use of such clauses in procurement a project group lead by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is to be established which will put forward projects where social clauses would be inserted into the contract to address employment and training.</p><p>  The group will have the following functions:</p><p>- The Departments with responsibility for employment and training will identify the important social considerations and actively assist the procuring bodies and successful tenderers through the provision of training, accreditation.</p><p>- The OGP will assist departments/agencies in the design of the social clause most suited to the specific contract.</p><p>- The procuring body will monitor the impact of the social clause(s).</p><p>- The OGP will collate this information and report on its implementation.</p><p>  This is a complex area and I want to ensure that we learn from practical experience here and the experience in other jurisdictions to develop robust social procurement framework that is effective. It is important to ensure that where possible the State uses its purchasing power to develop employment and re-training opportunities that arise under certain public contracts. I have asked the OGP to review this approach after 12 months.</p></reply>

The Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 extended the Ombudsman's remit to some 200 additional public bodies.  I understand that the Irish Tax Institute is primarily a representative and educational body for tax professionals; under the current legislation it could not be subject to review by the Ombudsman and there are currently no plans to extend the Ombudsman's remit to encompass representative organisations.</p><p>  The question of whether an independent regulatory body should be appointed to deal with complaints made against the Irish Tax Institute is a matter - in the first instance - for my colleague the Minister for Finance.  The Department of Finance has advised that, the Irish Tax Institute has established and maintains appropriate professional standards of conduct for its members. A complaints mechanism has been put in place under its Code of Conduct for members and students which allows persons to make a complaint if they believe standards of work and conduct have been breached. Complaints are investigated by an Investigation Committee comprising three Council members and an independent Senior Counsel who is not a member of the Council and the Institute exercises professional discipline as appropriate over those who do not comply with the standards. Details of the standards and the complaints mechanism are available on its website. In these circumstances, it is not considered necessary to appoint an independent regulatory body to deal with complaints made against the Institute.</p></reply>

This unique pilot initiative is managed by IDA Ireland and delivered on their behalf, under contract, by Connect Ireland, a subsidiary of the Taxback Group.  Connect Ireland markets, promotes and implements the &lsquo;Succeed in Ireland&rsquo; initiative in the international marketplace.  Under the terms of the contract, Connect Ireland and IDA Ireland work to convert potential leads identified by &lsquo;Connectors&rsquo; into investments and job creation in Ireland.</p><p>Up to Friday last, 6 June 2014, there have been a total of 20 projects approved by IDA Ireland under the initiative, with the potential to create 498 jobs.

Of the 20 projects approved to date, 13 have been publicly announced and are listed on the tabular statement B.  On the basis of information received from Connect Ireland, IDA Ireland has informed me that, at present, there are in the region of 150 jobs now on the ground arising from the initiative.  Under the agreed terms of its contract Connect Ireland have covered all start-up costs associated with the establishment of the initiative.  Payments will be made to Connect Ireland on a phased basis by IDA Ireland in respect of each sustainable job that has been in place for a period of over two years.  To date, no exchequer funding has been expended as payments by IDA Ireland to Connect Ireland, under the initiative have not yet fallen due.  An independent evaluation of the initiative is currently underway and, following completion of that evaluation, I will bring a memorandum to Government on the matter.</p><p><b>TABLE A</b></p><p><b>Table showing the number of Connect Ireland projects approved by IDA Ireland in each of the years 2012, 2013 &amp;amp; to date in 2014</b><table><tr><th><div>Year </div></th><th><div>Number of Projects approved </div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013</div></td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2014 ( to date)</div></td><td><div>7</div></td></tr></table><b>TABLE B</b></p><p><b>Table showing the number of Connect Ireland Projects that have been publicly announced</b><table><tr><th><div>Company Name </div></th><th><div>Origin </div></th><th><div>Location</div></th><th><div>Jobs </div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Intergeo Services </div></td><td><div>US</div></td><td><div>Carlow </div></td><td><div>30</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Flagship Management</div></td><td><div>US</div></td><td><div>Kinvara Co Calway </div></td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Mafic (Black Basalt) Ireland</div></td><td><div>Luxembourg</div></td><td><div>Kells Co Meath </div></td><td><div>70</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Ark Energy Consulting Ltd </div></td><td><div>Italy</div></td><td><div>Longford </div></td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>The Magni Group </div></td><td><div>US</div></td><td><div>Mallow Co Cork </div></td><td><div>50</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Improv Asylum </div></td><td><div>US</div></td><td><div>Dublin </div></td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>SMI </div></td><td><div>US</div></td><td><div>Dublin </div></td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Sound &amp;amp;Sea </div></td><td><div>US</div></td><td><div>Cork </div></td><td><div>55</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Bayne Law </div></td><td><div>US</div></td><td><div>Cork </div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Wired Ireland </div></td><td><div>France </div></td><td><div>Dublin </div></td><td><div>8</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Lobo Leasing </div></td><td><div>US</div></td><td><div>Dublin </div></td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Sure Power Consulting </div></td><td><div>US</div></td><td><div>Dublin </div></td><td><div>25</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Pepper Home Loans </div></td><td><div>Australia </div></td><td><div>Shannon Co Clare </div></td><td><div>49</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

In 2013 Irish goods exports to Germany were valued at over &euro;6.5 billion and Services exports in 2012 (the most recent data available) were valued at over &euro;8 billion.  Germany is also the third-largest source of tourists to Ireland, with almost half a million German tourists visiting Ireland in 2013.  As part of the Governments 2014 Ministerial-led St Patrick's Day "Promote Ireland" programme, Minister Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd visited Germany.  In 2013 both Minister of State Sean Sherlock and I led Enterprise Ireland Trade Missions to Germany.  My  programme focused on building on the strong relationships that exist already with the aim of growing exports and creating the jobs we need. My programme included:</p><p>- 9 bilateral meetings with IDA and Enterprise Ireland target companies;</p><p>- A trade/investment event with over 100 companies;</p><p>- 5 Irish tourism/cultural events;</p><p>- 2 Bord Bia events to promote Irish food exports;</p><p>- Interviews with German media as part of the continuing drive to rebuild Ireland's reputation.</p><p>  I am confident that this jobs focused trade and investment-related programme has helped Enterprise Ireland clients cement relationships with their German partners and win access to key decision-makers in target sectors which should facilitate employment growth.  It has also helped German investors to continue to see Ireland as an attractive location for foreign direct investment and further expand operations and employment in Ireland.  While further missions to Germany are not planned for 2014, Enterprise Ireland has an office in Dusseldorf from where it will continue to provide services to Irish owned companies looking to develop their businesses in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.</p></reply>

In this region IDA prioritises the marketing of the linked Gateway of Athlone/Tullamore/Mullingar.</p><p>  I have been informed by IDA Ireland that the agency successfully secured 16 agency sponsored site visits by potential investors to the Midlands Region with 1 visiting Mullingar in 2013.  To date this year, the Region has received 7 site visits.  These site visits were from new companies visiting the location for the first time and from senior executives of existing companies.  There are many complex factors influencing investor location decision-making such as the increasing preference of investors globally for cities of scale with 1 million plus population, significant challenges from lower cost locations in the UK and Eastern Europe and attractive regional aid.  In the region as a whole, there are currently 43 IDA Ireland client companies employing 4,812 people.  IDA Ireland has formed strong relationships with these companies and, having regard to the fact that 70% approximately of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland is from the existing client base, the agency continues to work closely with them in order to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.  IDA Ireland works closely with third level educational institutions in the region so that the skill-sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the Region are being developed.</p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, we are bringing a particular focus to regional job creation and are delivering a range of measures to support this goal.  One such measure is that IDA Ireland will commence building new advanced manufacturing facilities in Waterford and Athlone and office space in Letterkenny.  The Athlone building will provide an enhanced platform to attract FDI to the Midlands Region.  The other IDA Parks in the Midlands, including Mullingar Business Park are essential infrastructure to provide for FDI clients and also for indigenous companies interested in developing their business in the Midlands Region.  With the improved infrastructure that is now in place, a significant number of people commute within the Midlands Region.  Indeed, a project win in one Midlands location has a positive impact on the other surrounding areas due to the close proximity of all main locations.  The Agency has also explained that they have invested in specific marketing materials for the Midlands Region to support their marketing effort and launched the digital Connect and Invest site earlier this year.  This is proactively used by IDA Ireland regional and overseas teams to market and promote the Midlands to overseas clients wishing to invest in the Region and covers all aspects such as the clusters of companies, infrastructure, talent, lifestyle and the overall business environment offered by the region.  We must also remember that it is the investor in all cases who decides where to invest and an investment win for Ireland regardless of the location has to be seen as a plus for the country as a whole.</p></reply>

My Department engages with the key State players on the Forum to monitor developments on the detailed actions set out in the Plan, and I myself have held a number of meetings with the Forum.  In addition, I have asked the Forum to look at the measures recommended in the recent Oireachtas Committee Report on the region, as part of its ongoing work.</p><p>  Significant progress on job creation has been made, including the establishment of the new Call Centre operation, Eistech, supported by Enterprise Ireland, which now employs more staff than previously worked for Talk Talk in the city.  There have been several other job creation initiatives for the region as a result of the work of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland including projects by Glanbia, Nypro, Feedhenry, Dawn Meats and Danone.</p><p>  Other enterprise support initiatives have been developed to support new start-ups, graduate placements and research projects.  It is heartening that data from the Central Statistics Office has confirmed that, in 2013, an additional 15,000 jobs have been created in the region, resulting in the unemployment rate having dropped from 18.8% to 15.5%, which, while of course is unacceptably high, represents solid progress.  In Waterford itself, the number of people on the Live Register has decreased steadily over the past two years and is down 3,000 from its peak in 2010.</p><p>  Specifically in the case of IDA Ireland, the agency informs me that site visits by potential investors are one of the key means to sell a regional location and gives both IDA Ireland and local stakeholders an opportunity to showcase the region.  In this respect, I am glad to say that in the two year period since the establishment of the South East Action Plan the number of site visits to Waterford has almost doubled to 40 for the period 2012 / 2013, as opposed to 22 for the period 2010/ 2011.  The availability of suitable property solutions is also very important for potential clients and the construction of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s new 2,438 sq. m. advanced technology building at IDA Ireland&rsquo;s Technology Park, Waterford will be a strong attractor for the region.  As over 65% of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s business comes from its existing client portfolio, the agency works constantly with its existing portfolio of client companies in the area encouraging them to embed and grow their businesses.  Examples of the success of this strategy have been the Investment announcements by Nypro and Sanofi   during 2013.</p><p>  I understand from IDA Ireland that its clients decisions on where to locate are down to how well a particular location meets the company needs and are usually based on a strong cluster of industries in their sector, eg medical technologies in Galway and Pharmaceuticals in Cork, a strong skill base and the availability of suitable property solutions.  To enhance the attraction of Waterford as an investment location, IDA Ireland has rolled out a dedicated digital marketing initiative for inward investment focusing on the South East Region and Waterford (Connect and Invest Waterford).  IDA believes that this initiative will enhance the marketability of Waterford for investment at a very early stage in a prospective client&rsquo;s decision making process.</p><p>  In an effort to attract and support investment and enterprise development in regional locations, the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.  My intention is that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, focusing on the Midlands region, and involving the agencies under the remit of my own Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices.  The objective is to enhance synergies between the agencies and their client companies and build on the competitive strengths of the region to maximise the potential for job creation.  The role which other public bodies in the region can play in working towards this objective will also be examined as the project develops.  The aim is that this framework will serve as a model for other regions of the country.</p></reply>

The records my Department received from F&Aacute;S in respect of the person concerned show that they were employed as a temporary part time cleaner in Tralee working 12.5 hours per week.  They were employed in a non-pensionable capacity and as such would have no entitlements to a pension and lump sum.  As the nature of their employment was non-pensionable and temporary, they were allowed to continue working beyond the normal maximum retirement age of 65, which they reached on 13 September 2001.  The Human Resources Division of my Department have been in touch with F&Aacute;S to ascertain if there would have been any provision within their schemes to pay the person concerned a special gratuity if they were to resign.

It is expected that demographic change will see this grow, e.g., approximately 17,000 additional pensioners are in receipt of State pension each year, and in 2013 the Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;190 million for the increasing number of pensioners.  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.</p><p>Whilst an objective of the pension system in Ireland is to provide an adequate and sustainable basic standard of living through direct State supports, it is also to encourage people (through tax reliefs) to make supplementary pension provision so that they may have an adequate replacement income when they retire from work.  The State pension has been successful in ensuring older people have an adequate income.  However, many people retiring from work will have a significant income gap if they do not have supplementary pension provision.  Recent figures indicate that only half of workers aged between 20 and 69 years have a supplementary pension and this relatively low coverage is of concern.  Accordingly, it is a priority for the Government to increase supplementary pension coverage and the Programme for Government includes a commitment to reforming the pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers.</p></reply>

No account is taken in the calculation of any income taxes payable on earnings i.e. the assessment is based on gross earnings before tax. Given that the universal social charge is a tax, the impact of this charge is, therefore, not taken into account when means testing welfare entitlements. </p><p>  The one exception to this arrangement relates to entitlement to Family Income Supplement. This has been, for many years, assessed net of all statutory charges including income tax. This approach has been continued and the universal social charge is taken account of for the purposes of entitlement to this scheme.    </p><p>  The programme for government contained a commitment to review the universal social charge.  This review was completed by the Department of Finance, and Budget 2012 contained a number of changes to the USC that will help low paid, part-time and seasonal workers.  From 1 January 2012, the exemption level has been raised from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 (&euro;193 per week).  It was estimated at that time that the measure would benefit nearly 330,000 people including part-time workers in receipt of primary weekly welfare payments.  </p></reply>

This will support the gradual implementation of the new Youth Guarantee which will seek to offer young people employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed. As part of the Intreo process young people will be prioritised for case officer support and personal progression planning.The Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan provides for 28,500 programme opportunities for unemployed young people in 2014. This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.  These PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for the young, although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, also contribute to the programme.    In relation to the 28,500 places for unemployed young people, approximately 5,000 of these were taken up in the first four months of 2014. This is broadly in line with expectations, as some programmes such as the student intake on programmes such as the Vocational Training Opportunity Scheme (VTOS) and Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) are concentrated in September/October in line with the academic calendar.  The table supplied displays the total number of under 25s who have started across the various programmes outlined in the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan in the first four months of 2014. A new intake of young people to the second iteration of the Momentum programme for long-term unemployed jobseekers is also scheduled for later in the year. </p><p>A further &euro;2 million of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects funding will be used for future employment of young people at risk of becoming involved in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour.</p><p>In addition, it is important to note that some of the initiatives planned under the guarantee require primary legislation to allow positive discrimination on age grounds in the provision of employment services and supports.  This legislation will be enacted as part of the Spring Social Welfare Bill due before the Oireachtas in June.  Two employment schemes in particular, the Youth Guarantee developmental internship programme and the JobsPlus variant for young people, are dependent on this legislation being passed.

As I have previously highlighted, a detailed consultation process was undertaken to inform the deliberative process regarding the wind-up priority provision in section 48 of the Pensions Act.  This included a Department-sponsored review by Mercer Consultants on the technical aspects of the distribution of assets.   This review involved specific consideration of a service-related priority &ndash; the principle of which is that those who have contributed the longest should get the most from the scheme on wind-up.  The Mercer review was published by the Department () on the 9th December 2013.   </p><p>It was acknowledged at that time that, generally speaking, defined benefit schemes by their nature take an employee&rsquo;s length of service (and by association their contributions) accrued in a pension scheme into account when calculating pension entitlement.   It is arguable therefore that this longevity principle is naturally satisfied by the structure of DB schemes.  </p><p>The principle underlying an additional service tapered approach would be that those who have contributed for longest should get proportionately more out of the scheme in the event of the wind-up of the scheme.  However, &lsquo;overlaying&rsquo; such a service-related scale could be regarded as overweighting the priority in favour of service or &lsquo;double counting&rsquo;.</p><p>To demonstrate how the service principle works, consider two members of a scheme, one with 30 years&rsquo; service completed and one with 15 years&rsquo; service completed. Assume the pension formula is 1/60th of pensionable salary per year of service, with both having the same pensionable salary of &euro;30,000 and both being aged 55. The accrued pension of the first member is 30/60ths of &euro;30,000, which is &euro;15,000. The accrued pension of the second member is half this amount, which is &euro;7,500.  This example demonstrates that the most appropriate approach has been adopted in the legislation.  </p></reply>

Payment of partial capacity benefit lasts as long as the person has an entitlement to illness benefit or invalidity pension.</p><p>  On the other hand, the wage subsidy scheme (WSS) is an employer support payable to the employer where a person with a disability is hired and works a minimum of 21 hours per week. </p><p>  However, as PCB and WSS are stand- alone supports, one aimed at employees the other at employers, both are not available simultaneously to support a single employment vacancy.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 76,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. </p><p>  It a condition of rent supplement that a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation, or accommodation for homeless persons or an institution (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement. A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out and the person is deemed by a housing authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support. </p><p>  In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by the housing authority. Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement. The scheme also provides for an existing rent supplement recipient to make an application for an assessment of a housing need on being required by the officer administering the scheme. </p><p>  The assessment of housing need is a matter for the housing authority and any concerns the Deputy may have regarding the timeless of these assessments should be referred to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  </p><p>  There is no evaluation underway of discretionary rent supplement decisions made in respect of disabled persons as referred to by the Deputy.  Department officials operating the rent supplement scheme have discretionary powers to award a supplement at a higher level in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant. Each case is examined individually and is decided on the basis of the situation presented. </p><p>  Once approved, rent supplement is payable in arrears. However, under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, a payment for rent in advance can be made as a once off exceptional needs payment. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment and each application is determined by the officer administering the SWA scheme based on the particular circumstances of the case taking account of the nature and extent of the need.  Such payments are confined to occurrences which are considered to be unexpected, unforeseen or exceptional. The detail of the specific case referred to by the Deputy should be forwarded to the Department for review.  </p></reply>

A range of measures are employed by the Department to ensure that social welfare fraud and abuse is minimised and that its control activity is appropriately focused.  Overall, this is resulting in less opportunity to commit fraud and less chance of claims being in payment at an incorrect rate through fraud or error.</p><p>Control savings arise as a result of control activity on claims in payment and from inspections of employers.  They are not actual moneys recovered by the Department &ndash; rather they represent an estimate of the value of prevented future social welfare expenditure on claims that would have been incurred if investigative and control work had not been carried out.  Actual monies are recovered when the Department assesses an overpayment in individual cases and subsequently recovers such debt.</p><p>Control savings do not include any cases of departmental or clerical error.  In addition, they do not include any cases where the customer voluntarily told the Department of a change in their means or circumstances, which resulted in a change to their rate of payment.  All of these control savings arise from proactive reviews on claims in payment.   </p><p>Control savings are calculated by applying validated multipliers to the difference in the rate of payment before and after the control activity. Multipliers used in assessing control savings estimate the total future savings to the Department of a revocation or reduction resulting from a control action.  The multiplier used is based on the average amount of time the person who ceases to claim will remain off the Department&rsquo;s books. This time varies from scheme to scheme. </p><p>In general, long-term schemes have a multiplier of 136 weeks (termination cases) and short-term schemes have multipliers ranging from 32 to 52 weeks.</p><p>Validation exercises are undertaken to ensure control savings are recorded correctly. These involve an examination of the various control savings reported to ensure that savings are being compiled and calculated in the correct manner.</p><p>The overall savings target for 2013 was &euro;710 million and the actual savings achieved was &euro;632m.<table><tr><th>-</th><th>2013 Target &euro;m</th><th>2013 Achieved &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>Jobseekers</td><td>119</td><td>123</td></tr><tr><td>Illness (inc DCA)</td><td>122</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>Pensions (inc HHB)</td><td>157</td><td>140</td></tr><tr><td>OFP (inc WOPS)</td><td>165</td><td>146</td></tr><tr><td>Carers</td><td>15</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td>80</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>FIS</td><td>17</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>SWA</td><td>30</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>PAYE/PRSI</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>710</td><td>632</td></tr></table>This outcome demonstrates that the Department&rsquo;s more intense control focus in recent years is having a positive impact on the level of fraud and error in the social welfare system.  </p><p>In addition the new Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018 which I launched recently builds on the approach and progress made under the Fraud Initiative (2011 &ndash; 2013) and provides a strategic direction to tackling fraud and compliance risks in the years ahead.</p></reply>

In the case of payments to bank accounts, the Department sends payment instructions to Bank of Ireland on the Monday before the first Tuesday of a month.  Bank of Ireland processes these payment instructions and makes payments to accounts held with Bank of Ireland.  It also forwards payment instructions to the Euro area clearing and settlement service for payments to third party bank accounts.</p><p>  In the case of bank holiday weekends, the Department brings forward the issue of a payment file to Bank of Ireland to the previous Friday in order to ensure payments are available on the following Tuesday.  Bank of Ireland, as part of its internal processing, may make funds available to their customers&rsquo; accounts on the following day (Saturday) but the amount is not fully credited to their account until the due date of the first Tuesday of the month.  Payments to accounts in third party banks are processed as normal through the clearing system with a payment date of the first Tuesday of the month.

Up to 2009 the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum, whereas in 2012 the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013.  This has placed considerable pressure on the office.  Significant effort and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeals process to manage this increased workload, reduce backlogs and improve appeals processing times for appellants, while, at the same time, recognising the need to ensure that quality and fairness are not compromised.  An additional 15 Appeals Officers have been assigned to the office over the past three years, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number to 41.  A new operating model has been introduced in the appeals office and a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is also underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>  These measures have achieved significant improvements. The number of appeals cases processed in 2013 increased by 18%, to over 38,400.  The average processing time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 the average processing time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks and the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  Further improvements were achieved in 2013, when the average appeal processing time reduced to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision, and to date in 2014.  As at 31 May 2014, the time take to process an appeal requiring an oral hearing reduced to 29.9 weeks and 22.5 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>  In addition to the improvements in processing times mentioned above, these measures have also led to a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised in the appeals office from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress also continues to be made in reducing the number of appeals on hands from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 12,846 at 3 June 2014.</p><p>  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.  However, where an appellant&rsquo;s means are insufficient to meet their needs pending the determination of their appeal, it is open to them to apply for a means-tested Supplementary Allowance payment.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-10a.705.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061000066#WRP02100"><p>In the first instance, the Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to reduce unemployment (including youth unemployment) is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  This strategy is working. Employment rose by 42,700 in the year to Q1 2014.  Unemployment decreased by 33,900 (-11.6%) in the year to Q1 2014 bringing the total number of persons unemployed to 258,100. This is the seventh quarter in succession where unemployment has declined on an annual basis.  The unemployment rate for 15-24 year olds (youth unemployment rate) decreased from 26.7% to 25.3% over the year to Q1 2014.  Nevertheless, despite the progress that has been made, the Government recognises that youth unemployment remains unacceptably high. Hence, the Government also recognises the need for additional activation measures in the interim while the economy recovers. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee, both of which are being led by the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>The Youth Guarantee initiative is specifically aimed at those under 25 who are unemployed with specific targeting of those who are either long-term unemployed or are most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.  The implementation of the Guarantee is a medium-term policy of the Irish Government.  The guarantee of an offer of training, education or work experience for those aged 18-24 years after a four month period should be implemented on a phased basis.  By the end of 2014, processes and programmes will be rolled out to ensure that all of those young unemployed people who need most support (i.e. are assessed as having a low probability of securing employment in the absence of support from the Public Employment Services) will receive a Youth Guarantee offer within four months.</p><p>In keeping with the Government&rsquo;s broader focus on tackling long-term unemployment, we will first target interventions at those young people most at risk of long-term unemployment.  In this way, the Department ensures that resources are prioritised to help those who are most in need. In 2012 some 56,000 young people joined the Live Register as wholly unemployed, and some 35,000 (63%) of these remained unemployed for four months or more.  The target of the guarantee approach will, over time, be to reduce this level of persistent unemployment among young people.  As part of the implementation of the Youth Guarantee it is proposed, subject to labour market and economic developments, to review the targeted nature of the Youth Guarantee offer, before the end of 2015.</p><p><b>Progress to Date on National Rollout</b></p><p>The Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan was published in January.  It provides for over 28,000 programme opportunities for unemployed young people in 2014, as set out in the table attached as an appendix to this statement.  This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.  These PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for the young, although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee.</p><p>In relation to the 28,500 places for unemployed young people, approximately 5,000 of these were taken up in the first four months of 2014.  This is broadly in line with expectations, as some programmes such as the student intake on programmes such as the Vocational Training Opportunity Scheme (VTOS) and Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) are concentrated in September/October in line with the academic calendar.  A new intake of young people to the second iteration of the Momentum programme for long-term unemployed jobseekers is also scheduled for later in the year.</p><p>In addition, it is important to note that some of the initiatives planned under the guarantee require primary legislation to allow positive discrimination on age grounds in the provision of employment services and supports.  This legislation will be enacted as part of the Spring Social Welfare Bill due before the Oireachtas in June.  Two employment schemes in particular, the Youth Guarantee developmental internship programme and the JobsPlus variant for young people, are dependent on this legislation being passed.  The JobsPlus variant will be available as soon as possible after the relevant legislation has been cleared. The developmental internship which will include a pre-internship training period, will be in place no later than autumn. Passage of the legislation will also permit the introduction of earlier and more intensive engagement by INTREO with the young unemployed.</p><p>In relation to the 28,500 places for unemployed young people, approximately 5,000 of these were taken up in the first four months of the year.

The long-term unemployment rate has fallen from 9.5% to 7.3%.  The number of long-term unemployed has fallen from 204,000 in early 2012 to 156,000 at present.  In terms of the Live Register, a target was set that 75,000 of those who were long-term on the Register at the beginning of 2012 would move into employment by the end of 2015; the number who have already done so is now over 46,000 and we are well on track to beating our target &ndash;a target that was considered by many to be overly ambitious.</p><p>The Department operates four main schemes whose purpose is to provide a pathway to employment:</p><p><b>- JobsPlus</b>is targeted specifically at encouraging employers to recruit people who are long-term unemployed.  Over 2,300 long-term unemployed people have been placed in employment as a result of JobsPlus and over 60% of these have been unemployed for 2 years or more.</p><p><b>- Community Employment and T&uacute;s</b>provide work experience opportunities for long term unemployed jobseekers mainly within the community and voluntary sector.  The numbers of participants on Community Employment and T&uacute;s as of May 2014 were 23,150 and 7, 379 respectively up from 21,250 and 5131 in May 2013.</p><p>- The <b>JobBridge</b>scheme provides a stepping stone for unemployed people to employment in the wider economy.  The Scheme is specifically intended to give jobseekers an opportunity to increase their employability through real-workplace experience.  In May 2014 there were just under 6,900 participants on the Scheme.  To date nearly 30,000 people have participated in the scheme.  Evaluation results indicate that 61% of leavers from JobBridge find employment within 5 months of leaving their internship.  The independent research indicates that JobBridge, based on 2011 and 2012 performance generated positive value to the exchequer.</p></reply>

The incentive is payable, on a monthly basis, over a two year period if the employee is retained in full-time employment for two years.  JobsPlus is biased in favour of those who are longer term unemployed.  The value of the aggregate monthly payments is &euro;7,500 for employing a jobseeker 12 to 24 months on the LR and &euro;10,000 if the jobseeker was on the LR for over 24 months.  Since its launch in July 2013, JobsPlus is supporting some 2,385 jobseekers in full-time employment with   1,811 employers nationally.  Some 60% of jobseekers being supported had been on the LR for over 24 months at the time of recruitment.</p><p>At the end of May 2014, payments under the JobsPlus scheme thus far amounted to approx. &euro;4.5 million.

The proposed new bye-laws are intended to support the investment already made by Waterways Ireland in new infrastructure and facilities along these waterways.  That investment has made the waterways more attractive for boat owners and is helping to develop them as a vibrant recreational and tourist amenity.  Against that background, it is now considered timely to update the bye-laws to ensure that the rules governing use of the waterways are fit for purpose and best meet the needs of all waterway users.  As the Deputy will be further aware, Waterways Ireland undertook a public consultation process in relation to the proposed bye-laws earlier this year.  I am informed by Waterways Ireland that key stakeholders, including the Inland Waterway Association of Ireland, the Heritage Boat Association, the Royal Canal Amenity Group and the Irish Boat Rental Association, were contacted individually and invited to meet with the Chief Executive and the senior management team of Waterways Ireland prior to submitting their views.  I am also advised that all current permit holders on the three waterways, including traditional canal users and canal dwellers,   received individual written notice and were given the opportunity to make their views and requirements known.</p><p>I understand that over 2,000 submissions were made in the course of the public consultation process.  Waterways Ireland has now concluded its analysis of the public consultation.  A summary of the process and of the submissions received is available on the Waterways Ireland website at and work is continuing on finalising the proposed bye-laws.  To that end, Waterways Ireland will prepare a report setting out its proposed approach, including any revisions to its original proposals, which will be submitted to my Department and referred to me, with recommendations for consideration and final decision.</p><p>I am satisfied with the extensive consultation that Waterways Ireland undertook and  that the proposed bye-laws, when finalised, should enhance the ability of Waterways Ireland to manage these waterways for the benefit of all their users.  The intention is that the proposed bye-laws will introduce a new framework to regulate the use of moorings that will provide all visitors, including tourists and recreational users to the canals, the opportunity to use public moorings at key locations close to amenities, visitor attractions and places of interest.</p><p>As I indicated during a debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on Wednesday 26 February 2014, I will afford interested Deputies and Senators an opportunity to discuss the matters with me, prior to making a final decision on the proposed new bye-laws.</p></reply>

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect architectural heritage, including thatched buildings, by including them on the Record of Protected Structures. Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.

This independent committee comprises scientists from the Marine Institute, Inland Fisheries Ireland, ESB, the Loughs Agency and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Bio-Sciences Institute (AFBI) Northern Ireland.</p><p>  I can advise that the overall requirement and objective is to provide, with high probability, a long-term 40% escapement to the sea of the biomass of silver eel, relative to pristine conditions (i.e. if the stock had been completely free of man-made influences including commercial fishing).</p><p>  In 2011, the status of the European Eel in Ireland was defined by the United Nations as critically endangered. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) advice is that the eel stock continues to decline and urgent action is needed. ICES advice is that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pollution) should be reduced to as close to zero as possible until there is clear evidence that both recruitment and the adult stock are increasing. In 2011, glass eel recruitment fell to 5% of their 1960-1979 level in the Atlantic region and less than 1% in the North Sea area, and showed no sign of recovery.</p><p>  In 2012, as required by the EU, a review of the management of Eel in Ireland, including a scientific review by the independent Scientific Committee, was undertaken. This process included a robust public consultation during which many issues were raised and considered. Full details of the outputs of the public consultation are available on the IFI website.</p><p>  While I recognise fully the difficulty facing eel fishermen, the review of scientific and management advice and inputs from the public consultation informed a decision to continue with the cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market for the period from 2012 to 2015. Ireland&rsquo;s EMP will again be fully reviewed in 2015 from both scientific and management perspectives.</p><p>  With regard to the Waterford region, I am advised that a survey of eel stocks was carried out in the Waterford estuary in 2009 and 2011 as part of surveys of transitional or estuarine waters under Ireland&rsquo;s EMP. I am also advised by IFI that telemetry eel tagging studies undertaken in 2012, 2013 and continuing this year will assist in giving a clearer indication of the movement habits of eels in estuaries and improve population density estimates.</p><p>  The very significant decline in the stock dictated that closure of the fishery be applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts and there is no property right attaching to public eel licences and consequently the issue of compensation is not relevant or appropriate.  Given that context, the Deputies will appreciate that in the current national economic circumstances it is unlikely that funding will be available to the Government to provide for compensation payments.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-10a.739.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061000067#WRQ01500"><p>The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and</p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. </p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas.</p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.</p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that require a State intervention. I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. The list is available on my Department's website . Currently, a total of 84 areas in County Galway have been identified as requiring an intervention. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. I expect that this mapping exercise will be concluded in the autumn.</p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end implementation strategy for the State led intervention. It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed implementation strategy. EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised. This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible.</p><p>I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas. It is my intention to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component. In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21<sup>st</sup>century and is determined to ensure that all citizens and businesses have access to quality and reliable broadband.</p></reply>

The Act, in defining the membership of IFI provides that the persons to be appointed shall have experience or capacity in one or more areas defined in the Act; and that they shall be appointed with a view to representing the public interest. The current Board membership was appointed in accordance with the provisions of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources appoints members as follows: 3, including the Chairperson, on his own nomination; 1 nominated by the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government; 1 nominated by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs; and 3 nominated of the Joint Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture.  The Joint Committee, through the Public Appointments Service, sought expressions of interest for the three positions from individuals who had recognised expertise or a track record in one or more of the areas set out in the Act.</p><p>  The Act also provides that one Board member is appointed following election by the staff of IFI and that the Chief Executive Officer shall be an ex-officio member of the Board.</p><p>  While the board is appointed to act in the public interest, the Deputy will be aware that the National Inland Fisheries Forum has been established in accordance with Section 7 (4) of the Act, which makes specific provision for stakeholder input to policy formulation. The Forum includes a broad spectrum of stakeholders with knowledge or expertise in a number of key sectors including commercial fisheries. The 60 members of the Forum were appointed following an open selection process conducted by the Public Appointments Service.</p><p>  The Forum is designed to provide an opportunity for stakeholders to contribute to management and development policies and is a valuable channel of communication between the stakeholders and management in this regard.</p></reply>

In pursuit of these objects RT&Eacute; and TG4 are charged, inter-alia, with ensuring that programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of Ireland and &ldquo;have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular the Irish language&rdquo;. RT&Eacute; and TG4 publish detailed commitments on an annual basis setting out how they intend to meet their public service obligations and objects as set out in the Act. The extent to which the commitments entered into by the two public service broadcasters have been met is reviewed annually by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI).</p><p>Radio and television services, additional to those provided by the national public service broadcasters are matters for the BAI, which is an independent statutory body. Matters in relation to broadcast content on commercial radio are the subject of contractual negotiations between the BAI and commercial radio operators. In submitting their initial licensing applications to the BAI, such broadcasters put forward commitments in regard to how they will deal with a range of broadcast issues including public service commitments and, where appropriate, more specific commitments, for instance, in regard to the playing of Irish music. If they are successful in their licence applications, these commitments form part of the terms and conditions of the relevant broadcaster's actual licence. This policy approach is seen as appropriate in that it deals with the differing requirements of commercial and public service broadcasting. In relation to commercial broadcasters, it is seen as an effective means of leveraging public service type commitments that takes full account of the specific broadcaster&rsquo;s business proposal. As for public service broadcasters, it provides an iterative approach that is sufficiently flexible to ensure that the changing needs of Irish society continue to be addressed.</p><p>  While I fully support the promotion of Irish music in our broadcasting services, the policy approach taken to this issue must be consistent with EU and Irish regulatory structures. It is also important that it takes account of the right of broadcasters to determine the type of programming and content they wish to broadcast, subject, of course, to meeting relevant licensing and legislative obligations.</p><p>  As I have previously suggested in meetings I have had with Irish music representatives, it is my view that the best approach to be followed on this issue is one of direct engagement with the radio sector with a view to establishing a mutually acceptable treatment of Irish music. To my mind, this is likely to produce a far more successful and sustainable position in regard to the broadcasting of Irish music, rather than seeking the imposition of any arbitrary quota.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.</p><p>  The Government has decided, following consideration of proposals in relation to the funding model for Irish Water, to provide a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply. The Government has also decided to provide for an additional free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as child benefit, such that water charges will in effect only apply to adults in such households.  The Government has also decided that bills will be capped at the relevant assessed charge level for those customers with particular medical conditions which necessitate high water usage. Qualifying medical conditions will be set out, following consultation with the Minister for Health and the Health Services Executive.</p><p>  In addition to the above, the Government has agreed to put in place further a affordability measures to assist pensioners, persons with disabilities, and carers who receive the Household Benefits Package.  The conditions and administrative approach to this additional measure will be developed by the Department of Social Protection.</p></reply>

Transfers under the scheme can be to RAS accommodation in the private rented sector or to other social housing options. Since the scheme commenced in late 2005 and to the end of Quarter 1 2014 some 48,894 households have been transferred from Rent Supplement to RAS and other social housing options. Of these 28,940 were housed directly under RAS and a further 19,954 were accommodated under other social housing options.   </p><p>The figure of 2,500 referred to in Parliamentary Question No. 126 of 4 February 2014 represents the number of transfers to RAS accommodation in the private rented sector, which is counted as new social housing supply, and which was the subject of the question. Transfers that take place to other social housing options are not counted in the output figures for new supply under RAS as they are accounted for under the output figures for other supply mechanisms e.g. accommodation built or purchased by housing authorities or approved housing bodies. This is to avoid double counting the units which would lead to an overestimate of the new units supplied for social housing purposes in any given year.</p><p>  When referring to overall targets in RAS this is not in reference to output or supply but rather to numbers transferred from Rent Supplement to RAS and other social housing options. This is how the operation of the scheme is measured, given that RAS is concerned with transferring households with an assessed long term housing need out of Rent Supplement and into social housing support. </p><p>  Accommodation provided under the Rental Accommodation Scheme is governed by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended. A landlord can terminate the agreement entered into where particular circumstances prevail, if for example they wish to sell their rented property or where anti-social behaviour is an issue, subject to compliance with the provisions of the Act and the terms of the RAS agreement. While landlords can exit the scheme for the above reasons, there are landlords that still remain attracted to the scheme due to incentives such as a guaranteed rent for a minimum of 4 years, no rent collection, no vacancies and savings on advertising costs. </p></reply>

While I have received an initial draft of the review from the Agency a number of issues have been identified that need further detailed financial analysis. For example, full information on the status of each local authority&rsquo;s loan book is required in order to accurately determine the implications of any possible solutions to shared ownership issues for local authority debt management generally.  This substantial data collection project involving my Department, the Local Government Management Agency and the local authorities themselves is under way. It will be a number of months before sufficient data has been collected in order to complete the requisite analysis to enable the completion of the review. </p><p>  Pending full conclusion of this review, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities setting out some of the options and interim actions that might be explored to alleviate the difficulties of those in shared ownership distress such as allowing use of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and room rental for Shared Ownership mortgage holders. It is accepted that these proposals are not a complete solution to the issues that arise for such mortgage holders but are intended as an interim measure pending outcome of the review.   </p><p>  I fully recognise that shared ownership home owners, amongst others, have been affected by issues such as unemployment, possible negative equity, and changes in rental contributions. In such cases, borrowers should actively engage with their lenders, whether a commercial financial institution or a local authority, to seek to avail of one of the options available to provide sustainable solutions to distressed mortgages. </p><p>  The mortgage arrears resolution process, already in place in respect of commercial mortgages, is now being implemented across all local authorities. In cases of acute mortgage distress, homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now also in place to deal with personal insolvency.</p><p>  On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears, the Government launched a Mortgage to Rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012. This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. To date, some 40 households have availed of the Mortgage to Rent scheme facilitating low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable. In addition, my Department has issued full funding approval under the scheme for a further 51 housing units. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body and the family becomes a tenant of the approved housing body. Eligibility requirements are in line with other forms of social housing support.  </p><p>  The scheme for local authority borrowers in arrears, which was piloted in two local authority areas, Westmeath County Council and Dublin City Council, has now been rolled out nationally. </p></reply>

The regional approach is considered more appropriate as it helps to bring a more strategic perspective to bear on action to address homelessness, including avoidance of over-concentration of homelessness services in certain centres and promoting appropriate regional availability of services, consistent with need. </p><p>The Section 10 funding provided by my Department to housing authorities on a regional basis for the years 2009 to 2013 and the recently notified provisional allocations for 2014 are set out in the table.</p><p><b>Funding Provided under Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988</b><table><tr><th>Region </th><th><div>2009 </div></th><th><div>2010 </div></th><th><div>2011 </div></th><th><div>2012 </div></th><th><div>2013 </div></th><th><div>2014 Allocation </div></th></tr><tr><td>Dublin </td><td><div>&euro;38,967,542 </div></td><td><div>&euro;40,521,375 </div></td><td><div>&euro;35,732,525 </div></td><td><div>&euro;32,398,290 </div></td><td><div>&euro;31,322,223 </div></td><td><div>&euro;31,322,223 </div></td></tr><tr><td>South East </td><td><div>&euro;1,945,792 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,742,886 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,110,476 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,848,877 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,787,469 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,787,469 </div></td></tr><tr><td>North East </td><td><div>&euro;1,197,451 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,037,617 </div></td><td><div>&euro;912,250 </div></td><td><div>&euro;910,194 </div></td><td><div>&euro;879,963 </div></td><td><div>&euro;879,963 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Midlands </td><td><div>&euro;872,375 </div></td><td><div>&euro;666,344 </div></td><td><div>&euro;624,897 </div></td><td><div>&euro;672,027 </div></td><td><div>&euro;649,707 </div></td><td><div>&euro;649,707 </div></td></tr><tr><td>South West </td><td><div>&euro;5,458,211 </div></td><td><div>&euro;4,270,143 </div></td><td><div>&euro;3,505,749 </div></td><td><div>&euro;4,418,967 </div></td><td><div>&euro;4,272,197 </div></td><td><div>&euro;4,272,197 </div></td></tr><tr><td>d-West </td><td><div>&euro;4,110,166 </div></td><td><div>&euro;3,435,607 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,905,457 </div></td><td><div>&euro;3,516,119 </div></td><td><div>&euro;3,399,336 </div></td><td><div>&euro;3,399,336 </div></td></tr><tr><td>West </td><td><div>&euro;2,175,312 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,699,288 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,227,696 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,581,478 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,528,951 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,528,951 </div></td></tr><tr><td>d East </td><td><div>&euro;885,801 </div></td><td><div>&euro;906,842 </div></td><td><div>&euro;697,665 </div></td><td><div>&euro;839,146 </div></td><td><div>&euro;811,275 </div></td><td><div>&euro;811,275 </div></td></tr><tr><td>North West </td><td><div>&euro;444,206 </div></td><td><div>&euro;423,355 </div></td><td><div>&euro;406,335 </div></td><td><div>&euro;360,865 </div></td><td><div>&euro;348,879 </div></td><td><div>&euro;348,879 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td><div>&euro;56,056,856 </div></td><td><div>&euro;54,703,457 </div></td><td><div>&euro;48,123,050 </div></td><td><div>&euro;46,545,963 </div></td><td><div>&euro;45,000,000 </div></td><td><div>&euro;45,000,000 </div></td></tr></table>On 20 May 2014, I published the <i>Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness</i>in which the Government's approach to delivery on its objective of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined.

As such, on that date, the town councils were dissolved and their functions, staff etc. integrated into the county council and the mergers of local authorities in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford took effect. </p><p>  In terms of the costs of replacing town councils by the national system of municipal districts, the main costs arising are in respect of gratuities payable to councillors who cease to be members of local authorities, subject to certain conditions as prescribed by Section 142 of the Local Government Act 2001 and the Local Authority Members (Gratuity) Regulations 2002 to 2006. It will take some time, based on the recent results of the local elections, to determine the cost of such gratuities. However, estimates prepared in advance of the election suggest that the net additional cost of gratuities payable to Town Councillors who did not run for election or failed to get elected to County and City and County Councils would amount to &euro;4.6 million.  The reduced number of councillors will ensure that this once-off additional expenditure will be offset by future savings on gratuities.    </p></reply>

However, the owner is entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes i.e. if the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment. The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in this context are matters for each individual local authority. </p><p>  The Local Government Act 1946 provided that the owner was entitled to a 100% refund in most local authority areas. Separate legislation governs refunds in the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork, where the same criteria for refunds apply but only 50% of the rates paid was refundable. </p><p>  The Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides for a change to rating law in relation to the refund of rates on vacant properties and gives discretion to the elected members of individual local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority&rsquo;s administrative area. This discretion allows elected members to respond to the differing characteristics of the local commercial property markets. The amendment does not make any change to the eligibility or otherwise for refunds as currently provided for in relevant legislation. </p><p>  The provision commenced with effect from 1 June 2014. The Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provide that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be taken at the annual budget meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates. The absence of a decision to vary the refund means that the existing legislative provisions regarding the rate of refunds apply (either 100% or 50% as set out above).   </p></reply>

The Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952 provides that the rate of duty for a quarterly tax disc must not exceed 30% of the annual duty applicable and sets no upper limit for a half-yearly disc. The rates of duty currently applicable to the quarterly and half-yearly discs are 28.25% and 55.5% of the annual rate, respectively. These relativities have remained generally constant since the 1960s and I have no plans currently to change them. </p><p>  Non-annual transactions make up over two-thirds of all motor transactions processed. Tax rates for these discs take account of the extra staffing, administrative and printing costs for motor tax offices and the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) arising from the higher number of motor tax applications and in issuing reminders for each renewal. </p><p>  The estimated annual income from the increased charges for these discs is in the region of &euro;50m. A loss in income of this magnitude would have a negative impact on the Local Government Fund and consequently on grant allocations to local authorities from the Fund, and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system, or through the taxation system generally. </p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the water charges plan to be prepared by Irish Water is subject to the approval of the CER.  The CER has recently completed a public consultation on the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs for both metered and unmetered properties.  Further consultations are planned for June in relation to other aspects of the water charges plan to be submitted to the CER by Irish Water.  Full details of the CER&rsquo;s public consultation plans are available on its website ().  The CER will be announcing the approved water charges in August 2014.</p><p>I have indicated that I intend to use my powers under the Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 to issue a policy direction to the CER in relation to a number of matters relating to domestic water charges, including the calculation of assessed charges; a draft of the proposed direction has been published and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at Households that are connected to the public water supply, but do not have a water meter installed, will be charged on an assessed basis, primarily based on occupancy.  There will also be provision for a rebate, when a customer moves from an assessed charge to a metered charge and usage is deemed above a reasonable threshold by comparison to the subsequent metered usage.</p><p>Irish Water has recently commissioned a study on possible approaches to metering properties that are not part of the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections.  This report was recently submitted to my Department and the recommendations of the report are being considered.  In particular, my Department is exploring with Irish Water the potential to include a new phase of metering of some 48,000 apartments, which the report suggests can be easily metered as part of a separate procurement.</p></reply>

Construction 2020 acknowledged that while across Ireland effective planning has been at the heart of rejuvenation of cities and towns and the creation of investment and job opportunities, there is also a legacy from some poor past decision making, reflecting an absence of good planning and strategic thinking which has served Ireland and its citizens badly.</p><p>Construction 2020 contains 75 Actions in total and my Department, together with the Housing Agency, will be involved in the delivery of over 30 of these Actions.  These include the publication of a Policy Statement on Planning, and the progression of new planning legislation to implement the recommendations of the Mahon Tribunal and to establish an Independent Planning Regulator, as well as providing the necessary legal framework for planning related actions in Construction 2020.  The Review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which deals with affordable housing, will be completed shortly and any legislative changes required as a consequence of this Review will be incorporated into the new Planning Bill.</p><p>As regards the issue of housing densities, Construction 2020 provides that, where appropriate and in line with sustainable development into the future, flexibility around overall densities will be considered as part of a &ldquo;kick start&rdquo; initiative for prime development areas where extensive infrastructure development has taken place.  Under Action 8 of Construction 2020, a Social Housing Strategy is to be published by Q3 2014.  To assist in the development of the Social Housing Strategy, the Housing Agency has invited submissions by 31 July 2014; Further information is available at the following weblink:.</p></reply>

My Department, the Housing Agency and NAMA continue to work together with housing authorities and approved housing bodies in identifying suitable NAMA housing units and bringing them into social housing use.  By the end of Q1 2014, 4,653 units have been identified by NAMA as being potentially suitable for social housing and of these some 1,849 units are available and have been confirmed by local authorities as being suitable for social housing.  Completed housing unit transfers stand at 518 , with a further 166 units contracted and with completion work on-going.  This brings the overall total delivery of social housing from NAMA- sourced units to 684 units (completed or contracted) since the process began.

The Housing Land Availability Survey (HLAS) is an annual survey undertaken by my Department seeking information from local authorities to inform the publication of the amount of zoned residential land in their areas that is currently serviced. In 2013, my Department reviewed the HLAS approach taking account of the advent of and the need to reduce and rationalise the data gathering requirements placed on local authorities.  A new internet based approach called the Residential Land Availability Survey (RLAS) is currently being finalised in conjunction with local authorities which will produce robust datasets mapped to individual land parcels across all local authorities.  I expect that the final RLAS will be available by Autumn 2014 and the RLAS survey will be undertaken annually thereafter.</p><p>However, it is provisionally estimated that there is currently in excess of 25,000 hectares of undeveloped residentially zoned land nationally which equates to a capacity for over 500,000 new homes (based on a national average of 20 units per hectare).  This capacity is considered to be sufficient to meet the housing requirements nationally for in excess of the next ten years.  In line with the commitments under the Government&rsquo;s <i>Construction 2020 Strategy</i>, a Housing Supply Co-ordination Task Force for Dublin has been established with an immediate focus on addressing supply-related issues.</p></reply>

As of 1 January 2015 that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form. </p><p>  In developing the shape of the new system of Direct Payments in Ireland, I have been very conscious of the needs of sheep farmers, in particular those who farm on hill and commonage land. In general, sheep farmers hold low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme. </p><p>  When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer&rsquo;s entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307/2013 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme.  This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.  </p><p>  I have decided to apply this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the value of the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme for those farmers concerned.  The Grassland Sheep Scheme is the only Article 68 scheme that is being incorporated into the calculation of entitlements under the new Basic Payment Scheme.  If such incorporation does not take place the value of such payments would simply remain in the national fund and would be redistributed generally among all farmers who establish entitlements. </p><p>  The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019.  Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision the group of farmers who receive the Grassland Sheep Scheme will have an immediate financial benefit in 2015 as part of their payment under the Basic Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-10a.898.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061000070#WRT01900"><p>As the Deputy is aware, the free movement of goods and services within the Single Market means that no specific agreement on live cattle exports is required with other member states.  My Department attaches considerable importance to the live export trade and, over the years, has been very active in facilitating shipments abroad.  Live exports serve a dual purpose as a means of satisfying legitimate market demands for live animals and providing alternative market outlets for farmers.  Total live exports to date this year are 140,000 head of which  24,000 went to the UK , an increase of some 3,370 head or 16% up on the comparable period in 2013.  Of this 24,000, some 17,000 went to Northern Ireland which is an increase of 10% on the same period in 2013.</p><p>  However, the potential to grow the live trade to the UK even further is constrained by the buying specifications operated by the British retail chains in relation to cattle born in this country and exported live for finishing and processing in that market.  The retailers&rsquo; longstanding policy is to market British and Irish beef separately.  This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country; i.e. born, reared and slaughtered in the same country.  In addition, logistical difficulties arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant.  Under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcases have to be deboned in a separate batch, packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor. </p><p>  While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised this issue with British retailers over the years, they are unlikely to reverse their marketing policy in the short term.  Nevertheless Bord Bia, in its ongoing interactions with British customers, will continue to pursue all opportunities to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner.  In addition Bord Bia actively supports the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity.  I will continue to engage with my Northern counterpart, Ms Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, on issues relevant to producers including cross-border trade.</p><p>  Arising from the two roundtable discussions with key stakeholders which I hosted on 17 April and 3 June, I announced a number of measures to address the challenges currently facing the overall beef sector, including the allocation by Bord Bia of &euro;0.5m to intensify its marketing of Irish beef in the UK, Netherlands and Germany and I understand the bulk of this money will be spent between now and the peak autumn cattle supply period.  An additional &euro;85,000 will go towards the UK market, bringing Bord Bia&rsquo;s total spend for marketing Irish beef in the UK to &euro;0.4 million.  The additional expenditure will contribute towards an online promotion on well-known food websites, as well as profiling Irish beef through recipes and competitions.  A manufacturing category study is also being carried out to reaffirm the position of Irish beef alongside British beef as an ingredient in value-added ready meals.  </p><p>  The main focus of the roundtable was a report I requested from Michael Dowling regarding the implementation of the Beef Activation Group and consideration of any additional actions required.  The report was compiled following intensive consultation with the various stakeholders in the last few weeks and has been published on the Department&rsquo;s website to allow interested parties to reflect on the recommendations.</p></reply>

Related matters were also investigated by a Commission of Investigation carried out by Patrick McEntee SC.  While acknowledging co-operation received from the British authorities, both the Barron and McEntee inquiries concluded that they had been limited somewhat by not having access to certain British Government documents which may be relevant to their terms of reference.</p><p>  This House and Seanad &Eacute;ireann have unanimously called on the British Government to make this documentation available.

The implementation of the Strategy continues to be the focus of Government policy.  Key elements include the Disability Act 2005, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, the Citizens Information Act 2007 and the Sectoral Plans of six Departments which set out how they will deliver services to people with disabilities.</p><p>  In line with the Programme for Government commitment a National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan (NDSIP) was published in July 2013, the first such implementation plan to be put in place since the launch of the Strategy in 2004.  The Implementation Plan was developed with the identification by Departments of actions, timelines and key performance indicators.  Significant discussion was undertaken between the disability stakeholders and Government Departments to reach agreement on the suite of actions contained in the Plan.  The Plan sets out the practical measures across all Government Departments that will be taken to advance the Strategy and ensure that available resources are used to best effect and that the needs of those we consider a priority continue to be addressed.</p><p>  Progress on the Implementation Plan is reviewed by the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group (NDSIG) through thematic meetings which deal with specific issues.  Such meetings are attended by all relevant bodies to ensure cross-sectoral input and review.  All actions in the Plan relevant to the chosen issue are discussed and the progress made is mapped against commitments in the Plan.  Two such thematic meetings were held in quarter 4 of 2013 and focused on the themes of Irish Sign Language and Housing.</p></reply>

The determinations of the Adjudicators will be guided by Legal Costs Principles.  A publicly accessible Register of Determinations, which will include the outcomes and reasons for determinations about disputed legal costs, will be established and maintained.  I am considering further amendments in relation to the management and efficiency of the operation of the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator under the Bill that I hope to bring forward for Report Stage.

Where the application is for the purpose of family reunification, applications based on same-sex or heterosexual relationship are treated in exactly the same way. This is made clear throughout the Policy Document on Third Country Family Reunification which has been in force since the start of this year. I acknowledge that, in such cases, the nature of the relationship would be clear to the visa officer where they are aware of the gender of both the applicant and a sponsoring partner in Ireland.</p><p>  However, I can assure the Deputy that information supplied in a visa application is subject to all Irish data protection legislation and cannot be, without the permission of the applicant, supplied to a third party. It is not the practice to refer information supplied in a visa application to domestic authorities in the applicant's home country. If an applicant feels that they are constrained in submitting supporting documentation to a Visa Office or Irish consular mission in their own country, it is open to them to submit that documentation by post or courier to the headquarters of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in Dublin where it can be associated with the on-line visa application and the decision made there. Arrangements can also be made to return this documentation directly to the applicant.</p><p>  I am advised by INIS that it is not aware of any discrepancy in this area as stated by the Deputy nor is it aware of any case where there has been a refusal, inadvertent or otherwise, of a visa application on grounds of a person's sexual orientation or lack of full disclosure thereof.

The Deputy might wish to note that at EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of persons present in the State without first examining the merits of their individual cases.  In Ireland's case there are also considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account<i>. </i>Any significant departure from well established policies in this respect would have a major impact on the operation of the Common Travel Area both here and in the United Kingdom<i>.</i>It must also be emphasised that broad regularisation programmes are problematic, in particular as they could give rise to unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services. Clearly there would also be significant issues for the labour marker in the context of the very large number of people unemployed in the State. Similar issues would arise in respect of access to the housing market and its related supports.</p><p>Measures have recently been taken with a view to delivering improvements in the processing of protection applications. The Deputy will be aware that the European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 426 of 2013) were signed into law by my predecessor last November. Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection was transferred from my Department to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) with appeals to be dealt with by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT).  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals, respectively. Additional resources have been allocated to the establishment and operation of the new arrangements for the processing of these cases which include the engagement of a panel of legally qualified persons to process cases, personal interviews for each applicant at the first instance and the opportunity for an applicant to appeal a negative recommendation of the ORAC to the RAT. The ORAC, in consultation with the UNHCR, have recently published on its website details of how it will prioritise the process of scheduling persons for interview taking into account, inter-alia, dealing with applicants who are longest in the system first.  The intention is to process as many of these cases to finality as soon as possible to include consideration of any leave to remain aspects arising.</p><p>Legislative reform aimed at establishing a single application procedure in the area of international protection remains a key priority. I will be reviewing the work done to date in respect of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill in consultation with my officials, following which I will decide on how best to progress the implementation of the Government's priorities, particularly those relating to the establishment of a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State.</p></reply>

I expect to receive and consider a report in relation to these matters in the near future.  When I have considered that report I will consider what further action is necessary in relation to the firearms licensing system, including the proposal from interest groups for an examination of relevant administrative issues by the Garda Inspectorate.</p><p>  Officials of my Department met key interest groups in late 2013 and early 2014 who set out their concerns in relation to a range of issues regarding firearms licensing at that time. These interest groups have also communicated their views directly to me, as well as to all Oireachtas members. Further consultation with relevant stakeholders will take place when I have considered the report and before any decisions are finalised in relation to proposals for change to the firearms licensing system. I will decide on the nature of the consultation and what meetings are appropriate at the time I am considering the report.</p><p>  In so far as a risk assessment is concerned, I am advised that the draft report has regard to recent relevant EU Commission reports and developments in other jurisdictions in relation to public safety. However, I should say that is difficult to see how any risk assessment could foresee the tragic events in Dunblane, Scotland in 2006, Utoya, Norway in 2011, Sandy Hook, Connecticut in 2012 or Santa Barbara, California in May 2014.  Mass shootings are happening with increasing frequency and a common theme is that the firearms used are legally owned. I think it is only right that we consider options now, rather than endure a similar tragedy here, when people will rightly ask why we as legislators did nothing to prevent it.</p></reply>

It is intended that the first intake of new Garda trainees who have successfully completed all stages of the recruitment process will enter the Garda College in July of this year.

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Training and Development Review Group Report was published in May 2009.  The objective of the review group was to make recommendations to improve and reinvigorate Garda training in line with best practice in order to meet the new challenges of a changing society.</p><p>The review group carried out an extensive analysis of the training needs of the Force and consulted widely with staff across all ranks and grades. They engaged with different organisations including the following:</p><p>- Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC)</p><p>- Garda Inspectorate</p><p>- HETEC</p><p>- External training providers including</p><p>- University College Dublin</p><p>- Dublin Institute of Technology</p><p>- Institute of Public Administration.</p><p>As a result of this review the student/probationer training programme has been radically restructured into three phases.  Phase I is for 32 weeks at the Garda College, at the end of which successful students will be attested (i.e. become members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with full police powers).  Phase II is for 65 weeks based in Garda stations, and Phase III consists of seven weeks of exam preparation, exams and assessments (total 104 weeks).  The new programme will now result in an award of a Bachelor of Arts (Level 7) in Police Studies, and the programme will be delivered using a problem based learning approach.</p><p>The main differences between the new and the current programme is that the new programme carries a greater emphasis on operational policing and focuses on real life scenarios which in turn prepare students better for the policing challenges they will face. The new programme will also instil a lifelong learning philosophy for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with a suite of mandatory and elective courses made available.  In terms of the Garda College itself, the Office of Public Works is undertaking work to the accommodation with four blocks having been completed to date.  Competitions for the filling of staff requirements at Garda, Sergeant and Inspector rank to act as Instructors at the Garda College are currently under way.</p></reply>

I understand the manufacturer of Fampyra supplied the drug free of charge to some patients prescribed the drug by their clinician. However, the manufacturer has recently decided to stop supplying the drug free of charge and, as a consequence, these patients are now faced with financing the drug themselves if they wish to continue with this drug treatment.</p><p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.</p><p>The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes. The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines. In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish health care setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website (). </p><p>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. Due to the very difficult and challenging economic environment in which the Government targeted additional savings in health expenditure of &euro;619 million in 2014, which must be achieved while protecting front line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible, the HSE decided it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes.</p><p>It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost effectiveness of Fampridine. The HSE will then re-consider the application to add this product to the List of Reimbursable Items, in line with the agreed procedures and timescales for the assessment of new medicines.</p></reply>

The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is responsible for delivering the new hospital on schedule, to optimal design and value for money. The Board&rsquo;s membership reflects the skills and expertise required to achieve that, including construction, planning, engineering, procurement and architecture as well as clinical and stakeholder involvement. The Board is now in the final phase of the selection process for the appointment of a design team. The full design team is expected to be appointed shortly, following which design development will begin, with the aim of submitting an application for planning permission in February 2015.  Construction is scheduled to commence in August 2015, and the transition of services to the new hospital is on schedule to commence at the end of 2018.</p><p>  In October 2013, the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform announced that up to &euro;200m would be made available for the new children&rsquo;s hospital from the sale of the National Lottery, adding to the existing &euro;450m Exchequer funding and underlining the Government's commitment to the project. Philanthropic / non-Exchequer funding will be sought as appropriate.  The business case for the hospital is currently being revised and updated, and this will set out outline capital costs for the hospital on the St James's campus and potential future revenue savings arising from operational efficiencies. Estimates set out in the revised business case will be reviewed and refined at each stage of the project.</p></reply>

Supporting infrastructure, procured through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multi-disciplinary primary health care.  Considerable progress has been achieved to date.  37 primary care centres have been opened since March 2011 and infrastructure development is underway or planned at a further forty three locations.</p><p>In addition to the rank of the locations as a result of the 2012 prioritisation exercise, the mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care infrastructure is dependent on a number of factors including GP participation.     Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care centres are also subject to suitable locations being offered/provided/available and to successful planning processes.  In addition, the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to sufficient financing.</p><p>As regards the PPP project, the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) published a Prior Indicative Notice (PIN) / Pre-Qualification Questionnaire in the OJEU on 19 December 2013.  Four submissions were received by the closing date which was 10 March 2014.   Information can be located at the following web address - .  It is expected that 10-14 sites (indicative number 12 based on affordability) will be delivered as part of a single PPP contract with the remaining centres to be delivered by the HSE using other procurement means.</p><p>As with all capital projects this programme must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.   There will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer.    There is limited funding available for new projects over the period 2014-2018 given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.   Nevertheless, where possible, the HSE's capital programme will include provision to progress primary care centres with the highest ranking following the 2012 national prioritisation exercise by direct/own-build in the event that other delivery mechanisms are not feasible.</p><p>It is expected that the PPP primary care locations will be delivered by late 2016 / early 2017 and that the locations underway by HSE direct/own-build and the lease initiative will be delivered over the period 2014 to 2016.</p><p>As regards budget, the construction costs in relation to the lease initiative PCCs are borne by the developer.  For reasons of commercial sensitivity, it would not be appropriate at this stage to provide estimated construction costs for the PPP project or those to be delivered by HSE direct/own-build.</p><p>Health care services to be delivered at the PPP locations will include General Practitioner (GP) services and in addition a number of centres will include a wider range of community based services, for example, dental services, community mental health services, child and adolescent mental health services, early intervention teams, and doctor on call services.</p><p>Please see the attached spreadsheet which provides the information on primary care infrastructure available at end April 2014.</p><p>- Primary care infrastructure opened since March

Shared premises encourage and facilitate interaction across all health care professionals and that is why my Department and the HSE are committed to developing Primary Care Centres nationally.  The Programme for Government highlights the expansion of Primary Care Centres as a priority within the health capital budget.  The National Service Plan 2014 provides for the procurement of an additional 21 Primary Care Centres this year.  This will create an environment for improved access which will facilitate structured approaches to chronic disease management, enhanced multidisciplinary team working, improved diagnostic capabilities in Primary Care and the integration of services between primary and secondary care.</p><p>  The HSE's Primary Care Division is also working with the Clinical Strategy and Programmes Directorate to expand chronic disease prevention and management in primary care and this includes the development and roll out of improved access to diagnostic tests for GPs particularly ultrasound.  This will greatly assist in early diagnosis, hospital avoidance, greater integrated care and a better, safer, patient experience.  This initiative is currently at development stage and it is planned to roll out this service initially in two pilot sites in 2014. </p></reply>

Section 39 of the Health Act 2004, empowers the Health Service Executive (HSE) to &quot;give assistance to any person or body that provides or proposes to provide a service similar or ancillary to a service that the Executive may provide&quot;.  Employees of Section 39 organisations are not public servants, are not subject to the standard salary scales for the health sector, are not counted in public service employment numbers and are not members of a public sector pension scheme.  This provides Section 39 agencies with the freedom to exercise greater flexibility in respect of staff recruitment, deployment, pay and conditions.  </p><p>The Service Level Arrangement or Grant Aid Agreement between the HSE and service providers governs the funding relationship between the relevant bodies.   This agreement framework provides governance which links funding to a quantum of service and provides for these services to be linked to quality standards, with continuous monitoring to ensure equity, efficiency and effective use of available resources.  </p><p>As part of this process, all Section 39 agencies are monitored via regular review meetings with HSE Management at Area and Regional level.  These review meetings address financial reports, human resources, activity data, planning, review of agreed performance indicators and compliance with quality and standards etc.  It must also be noted that Section 39 organisations may be involved in a range of other activities, which are not funded by the HSE.</p><p>The Government's plans for the reform of the health services, including the disability services, are set out in <b><i>Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 - 2015.</i></b><b></b>This document recognises that in order to improve services for the population and achieve the overarching objectives of the reform programme, we need real changes in the structures of the health system.  Future Health describes the Government's plans for structural reform and outlines the phased approach which is being taken.</p><p>The Minister's key concerns in terms of structural reform are to promote good governance, avoid duplication and ensure a strong regional focus in managing performance and delivering value for money.  The first phase of the transition process is aimed at: introducing revised governance and management structures, including the appointment of new national directors, in the HSE; the establishment of hospital groups on an administrative basis; revising the structures for delivering primary, social and mental health care to improve integration of services at the local level following a review of the Integrated Service Areas; and establishment of the new Child and Family Agency.  I am happy to report that good progress has been made on these issues. </p><p>The second phase will involve the development of a formal purchaser / provider split and the establishment of the new structures to replace the HSE.  As indicated, the plans for structural reform are not confined to hospital services and primary care, but will also apply to the social care sector.</p><p><b><i>Future Health </i></b>commits to the development of a social and continuing care system that maximises independence and achieves value for the resources invested.  This includes the reform of disability services in line with the findings of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services.  Among the measures to be introduced as part of the reform process are the introduction of a standardised framework to commission services from both public and non-public providers; individualised budgeting to bring about a closer alignment between funding and the outcomes for individuals; and a robust regulatory regime to ensure quality and safety.</p></reply>

The best and most appropriate treatment option depends on the individual case, the likely cause of depression and the severity of . </p><p>Treatment for depression usually involves a combination of medication, talking therapies - usually provided by a mental health professional, such as a counsellor, psychiatrist or psychologist - and self-help.  In some cases, a combination of all three might be the most appropriate treatment plan for that individual.  Regular exercise, reduction in caffeine intake and avoiding alcohol can also prove helpful when treating depression.</p><p>Depression is quite common and about one in ten people will experience depression at some point. However, the exact number of people with depression is hard to estimate because many people do not get help or are not formally diagnosed with the condition.</p><p>In Budgets 2012 and 2013 this Government provided a total of &euro;7.5 million to facilitate the roll out of the Counselling in Primary Care (CIPC) initiative.  This is a new national service which will improve access for people to counselling in a primary care setting.  Medical card holders aged 18 and over who are referred by their GP or other member of the primary care team can have up to 8 counselling sessions to address mild to moderate psychological difficulties.  No consideration has been given to the provision of gym membership to those presenting with depression and it is not possible to estimate the likely cost or savings accruing from such an initiative.</p></reply>

There is a link between consumption and harm and evidence that affordability is one of the drivers of increased consumption.  The Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse, to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  These measures are based on the recommendations contained in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy.  </p><p>  The Government has decided that minimum unit pricing is the most effective policy measure to deal with the sale of alcohol at cheap prices.  Minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels per gram of alcohol that must be legally observed by retailers in both the on and off trade sector.  This is a targeted measure, designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  It is mainly aimed at those who are higher risk, such as adolescents and people who have a harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption pattern.  It should therefore only have a marginal effect on moderate drinkers.  It is not expected that minimum unit pricing will affect the price of alcohol in the on-trade sector or the majority of alcohol products sold in the off-trade sector.</p><p>  A health impact assessment, in conjunction with Northern Ireland,  has been commissioned as part of the process of developing a legislative basis for minimum unit pricing.  The assessment will study the impact of different minimum prices on a range of areas such as health, crime and likely economic impact.  The study should be finalised shortly.  Work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing.  It is hoped to publish a General Scheme of a Bill shortly.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE), unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p></reply>

I will take this opportunity to remind the Deputy that, there is no, nor has there ever been, an entitlement to a medical card for a person with a particular illness or medical condition under the legislation. </p><p>  Under the Act, the HSE is obliged, in deciding on an individual&rsquo;s eligibility, to have regard to the person&rsquo;s overall financial situation, including the means of the spouse, if any, in view of the reasonable expenditure in relation to him or herself and his or her dependants.  </p><p>  If an applicant&rsquo;s means are above the financial thresholds, as outlined in the National Assessment Guidelines, the HSE routinely considers whether the refusal of eligibility will result in undue financial hardship for the applicant or any dependants. Eligibility may be granted, if the applicant is above the guidelines, but cannot arrange general practitioner, medical and surgical services, for themselves and their dependants, without being caused undue financial hardship. Where discretion is exercised with regard to an applicant with an illness or disease, it is the effect of reasonable expenditure related to that condition on a person's financial situation that is relevant to the assessment for a medical card.  </p><p>  All medical card and GP visit card holders are subject to a periodic review of eligibility to determine continuing eligibility. Under the review process, applicants are not asked if they  - or a family member  - still has a lifelong condition or illness. As I have outlined, the card is not awarded based on a medical condition and, in this regard, such like questions would be neither pertinent nor appropriate. </p><p>  However, the HSE is obliged under the review   process to ensure that  full account is taken of any costs that a family may have that arise from a change in their circumstances, perhaps an exacerbation of an illness or a secondary illness. Any questions on change in circumstances  refer to the resultant financial impact and do no not refer to a person still having  the particular life-long condition or particular illness.  The information sought is to support the determination of undue financial hardship due to the costs associated with having a medical condition or illness.</p></reply>

The Government recognises that neurological illness or injury has significant implications for the individual and their family, which impacts on their social, educational, vocational and recreational participation.  Waiting times, access, treatment and quality of care, are a priority for reform for this Government, despite budgetary constraints. In relation to specialist disability support services, the Health Service Executive (HSE) will spend &euro;1.4 billion and employ a staff level of approximately 15,000 whole time equivalents in 2014 to deliver its Disability Services Programme.</p><p>  The HSE is embarking on a large scale reform programme, which will transform our model of service to a community-based model of person-centred care. This Government is also committed to a significant strengthening of primary care services.  The HSE has provided additional funding and filled 200 additional primary care team posts including public health nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists. </p><p>  Where medical cards are concerned, the Government has decided to develop a new policy framework for eligibility for the award of medical cards to take account of on-going medical conditions.  The HSE has established an Expert Panel to examine the range of conditions that should be considered as a basis of eligibility and has been asked to make an early report to Government.  In this context, the HSE has decided to suspend reviews of medical cards where discretion had been exercised to take account of medical circumstances, pending the outcome of this process.  This includes people who are currently in the appeals process.  The HSE has extended eligibility of the individuals concerned, who are in the process of being advised in the normal way.</p><p>  The Government is examining how best to address the situation of persons with serious medical conditions who had been issued with a medical card on a discretionary basis, but who have already completed the review process (and appeal process, as relevant) and who are not eligible to retain that card.  The Government is examining the most effective and timely way of progressing such change.</p></reply>

The HSE has established an Expert Panel to examine the range of conditions that should be considered as a basis of eligibility and has been asked to make an early report to Government.</p><p>  In this context, the HSE has decided to suspend reviews of medical cards where discretion had been exercised to take account of medical circumstances, pending the outcome of this process. This includes people who are currently in the appeals process. The HSE has extended eligibility of the individuals concerned, who are in the process of being advised in the normal way. </p><p>  The Government is examining how best to address the situation of persons with serious medical conditions who had been issued with a medical card on a discretionary basis, but who have already completed the review process (and appeal process, as relevant) and who are not eligible to retain that card. The Government is examining the most effective and timely way of progressing such change. </p></reply>

The core objective of NPP is to facilitate a competitive and effective market for maritime transport services.  NPP categorises the State commercial ports sector into:<blockquote>- Ports of National Significance Tier 1 (Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes);  <br /><br />- Ports of National Significance Tier 2 (Rosslare and Waterford); and <br /><br />- Ports of Regional Significance (Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Galway, New Ross and Wicklow). </blockquote>This tiered categorisation of the sector is in line with revised European transport policy, the new Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) Regulation.  Under this Ireland's Ports of National Significance (Tier 1) fall into the European 'core' network while our Ports of National Significance (Tier 2) are in the European 'comprehensive' network. </p><p>NPP provides for the designated Ports of Regional Significance being transferred to more appropriate local authority led governance structures.  This is in line with wider government reforms to transfer functions to local authorities where appropriate.  The five Ports of Regional Significance retain important roles as facilitators of their regional economies and as centres of marine related amenity and tourism activities.  Government recently approved the draft Scheme of the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2014 which will provide the primary legislative framework to enable these 5 ports to be transferred by Ministerial Order to local authority led governance structures.  The Ports of National Significance are our key international maritime gateways handling over 90% of all tonnage through our ports and of significance in terms of national competitiveness.  All three Tier 1 ports have master plans in place covering the next 30 years. Ireland currently has enough port capacity to meet existing demand and, in keeping with NPP, Ports of National Significance will lead the response to future national port capacity.  As such Dublin Port Company, with the required scale and experience, will lead any major future development at Bremore or any other location on the east coast should it ever be required. </p><p>Dublin Port Company published a masterplan in 2012 to guide the development of Dublin Port in the period to 2040.  Dublin Port is committed in its master plan to utilise the existing footprint of the port to the greatest extent possible.  The company currently has an application with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the redevelopment of Alexander Basin that includes a proposal to infill an existing basin within the Port at Berth 52 and 53.  However the previous proposals to infill significant parts of Dublin Bay under the Dublin Gateway plan, that were previously rejected by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, do not form part of Dublin Port's plans.</p><p>Dublin Port's master plan is endorsed within NPP and is available on their website Dublinport.ie.</p></reply>

I understand from the RSA that most issues have been agreed with Ontario.  However the issue of licences based on exchange for a third country licence has delayed matters.  My Department is aware of this, and has been in communication with the embassy in Ottawa in order to explore ways of overcoming this.   </p><p>  Reaching such an agreement is not only a matter of facilitating the exchange of licences by Irish residents in Canada or by Canadian residents in Ireland.  Rather it also involves both sides ensuring that the people licensed to drive in the other jurisdiction are properly qualified.  As a result, when Ireland makes agreements of this kind with other jurisdictions, we require, as a standard component of the agreement, that we will not accept for exchange licences issued by the other jurisdiction if those licences were in turn derived from an exchange with a third country with which we do not have an exchange relationship.   </p><p>  I am keen to see exchange agreements reached with the Canadian provinces as soon as possible.</p></reply>

My role relates to the overall policy for the sector. </p><p>  There have been many changes to the policy framework for the sector in recent years through the implementation of the recommendations of the Taxi Regulation Review Report, 2011.  In particular the introduction and commencement of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013, together with the new SPSV regulations introduced by the NTA, gives the necessary legal underpinning to many of the actions recommended in the Review Report.  The aim is to allow consumers to have confidence in the SPSV sector while also ensuring that legitimate and professional taxi operators and drivers can be rewarded fairly by operating under a regulatory regime that is adequately enforced. </p><p>  I have referred your specific queries regarding the costs associated with setting-up in the SPSV industry to the NTA for direct reply.

Amongst the decisions to be made by Government in finalising arrangements as part of its overall deliberations on the format and conduct of the review will be the assignment of lead responsibility for implementation.</p><p>  Such scoping work is essential if fully informed decisions are to be made and matters are to be dealt with effectively.  This is the experience in effectively initiating successful review processes in recent years.  The work will proceed speedily and promptly.  It will consider all of the issues which have arisen and the particular factors which the review will need to take into account including, for example, the passage of time.  Government will be kept up to date and expects to have the product of this consideration before the end of the month.  </p><p>  I will provide a further update to the Deputy in the coming days.</p></reply>

The Agency has advised that this contract has now been extended, with revised conditions to the end of 2014.</p><p>The Child and Family Agency is currently undertaking a review of Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence service provision and will be developing a strategic plan later in 2014, to support the delivery of effective and accessible services over the coming years.  The Programme Manager for Domestic, Sexual and Gender based Violence Services in the Agency will work with the Agency Head of Procurement to establish a tender process, due to begin in September, for longer-term provision of support to front-line agencies from 2015.

A substantial element of the uncommenced sections relates to provisions for special care.  Given the legislative framework utilised to manage the interaction between the Child Care Act 1991 and the Health Act 2007, in relation to special care provisions, Regulations under the Health Act 2007 are required in advance of the commencement of these sections.  Work is at an advanced stage in my Department in drafting the required Regulations for Special Care Units.  I would hope to have the Regulations finalised in the near future, and shortly thereafter to draft a commencement order for the relevant sections of the 2011 Act.  Other sections of the Act that are not yet in force are being kept under review as to their commencement in association with relevant policy and service developments.</p></reply>

The Adoption (Information and Tracing ) Bill will address this matter but the legislature will be constrained in the nature of any access which can be granted to adoption records by these legal issues.  My Department is continuing to consult with the Office of the Attorney General on this and on a number of related issues.  One reason for the discussions with the Attorney General is to continue to examine precisely how this can be done in the context of strong legal advice about the constitutional protection of the rights of the natural mother to privacy.  I will continue to explore how far the Government can go in the legislation to provide for access to information without breaching the Constitution. </p><p>  I intend to submit the Heads of Bill for Government approval as soon as these issues have been addressed.  Once approved by Government, the Heads of Bill will be sent to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for its detailed consideration.  The process of sending the Heads of Bill to that Committee will ensure that the provisions of the proposed legislation will be subject to public scrutiny and it is open to that Committee to invite submissions from all interested parties.</p></reply>
