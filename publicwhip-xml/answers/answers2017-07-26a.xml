The estimates are prepared under Regulation (EC) No 138/2004 of 5 December 2003, which sets the scope and main methodological approaches. They provide detailed estimates of major accounting items, such as output, input costs, gross and net value added and operating surplus. The results are transmitted to Eurostat for publication on the European database, and are also published by the CSO in the <i>Output, Input &amp;amp; Income in Agriculture </i>release three times a year (i.e. an advance estimate in December, preliminary estimate the following March and final estimate in June).</p><p>The estimates are based on data from a combination of sources including administrative data, industry sources and several statistical surveys, conducted by the CSO, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) and Teagasc.  The detailed Methodological Note and Quality Report are available on the CSO&rsquo;s website. In addition, EAA Inventories for all EU member states will be published by Eurostat in the near future.</p><p>The following tables contain the details of Ireland's Economic Accounts for Agriculture for each year from 2003 to 2016.</p><p><b>Table 1  Output, Input and Income in Agriculture, 2003 -

I re-iterated the Irish Government's support for an Irish Language Act, as provided for in the St Andrew's Agreement, and the need for balance and respect between the parties. </p>  <p>  Prior to that, I met with Prime Minister May in London on 19 June.  During our discussions I raised the Dublin/Monaghan Bombings and other legacy cases, stressing the importance of making progress on legacy issues and the overall arrangements for dealing with the past. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government in relation to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, and pursue all possible avenues that could achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by the D&aacute;il, and in the hope that this could bring some measure of closure to the families.</p></reply>

However, visits to farms by HSA inspectors include routine unannounced inspections to monitor compliance with health and safety legislation and also to investigate farm accidents.  Typically in any one year there can also be between 60 &ndash; 90 investigations of serious and fatal accidents on farms.  The number of overall farm inspections and investigations carried out since 2013 and the number of NACE Category A (Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing) inspections and investigations by county are set out in Appendices 1 and 2 below.</p><p>The HSA&rsquo;s database cannot break the number of farm inspections down by county.  However it can break down the number of inspections and investigations carried out since 2013 by county for NACE (European industrial activity classification) Sector A which covers Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing.  The county figures are given in the table and are higher than those for just farms.  Typically the total NACE A county figures are over 90% farm inspections with forestry and fishing figures being higher in the counties where these activities are concentrated.  As an inspector may cover more than one county he/she may concentrate on different counties in different years.</p><p>The HSA plans to carry out 2,000 farm, 50 forestry and 50 fishing inspections in 2017.</p><p>Since 2014 the HSA has redirected some of its inspection resources to engaging directly with farmers on other accident prevention initiatives.  In 2017 HSA inspectors have participated in over 80 Teagasc organised Knowledge Transfer Group meetings, farm safety walks and presentations to farmers, many of which are organised by the farming representative bodies.  This has enabled the HSA to direct its message to over 4,000 farmers this year.</p><p><b>Appendix 1</b></p><p><b>Farm inspections and investigations 2013 &ndash; 2017</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of farm Inspections and Investigations covering health and safety issues</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>2,784</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>2,644</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>3,056</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>2,250</td></tr><tr><td>2017 (at 20 July</td><td>1,207</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Appendix 2</b></p><p><b>Number of NACE Category A Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing Inspections and Investigations by County 2013 to 20</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b>July 2017</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017 </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>284</td><td>241</td><td>84</td><td>18</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>235</td><td>250</td><td>107</td><td>44</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>35</td><td>74</td><td>81</td><td>90</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>557</td><td>606</td><td>425</td><td>422</td><td>236</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>60</td><td>44</td><td>119</td><td>136</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>25</td><td>28</td><td>92</td><td>19</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>74</td><td>119</td><td>127</td><td>94</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>183</td><td>49</td><td>45</td><td>13</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>13</td><td>23</td><td>36</td><td>21</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>178</td><td>161</td><td>167</td><td>116</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>62</td><td>29</td><td>66</td><td>69</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>54</td><td>95</td><td>34</td><td>36</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>190</td><td>185</td><td>172</td><td>1</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>52</td><td>11</td><td>24</td><td>29</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>55</td><td>15</td><td>163</td><td>125</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>38</td><td>59</td><td>66</td><td>83</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>205</td><td>302</td><td>257</td><td>220</td><td>168</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>126</td><td>21</td><td>33</td><td>23</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>37</td><td>29</td><td>23</td><td>73</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>2</td><td>54</td><td>79</td><td>36</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>127</td><td>113</td><td>150</td><td>49</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>108</td><td>99</td><td>44</td><td>70</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>72</td><td>73</td><td>149</td><td>72</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>60</td><td>52</td><td>201</td><td>130</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>9</td><td>18</td><td>61</td><td>146</td><td>149</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>127</td><td>109</td><td>254</td><td>183</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>2968</td><td>2859</td><td>3059</td><td>2318</td><td>1245</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Apart from significant losses to the Exchequer that can arise from cases of so-called bogus self-employment, the practice has serious implications from an employment rights perspective.  In this respect, it is important that individuals are correctly designated regarding their employment status so that those who ought to be designated as employees are not deprived of their employment rights.  This is particularly the case for vulnerable workers who may not feel in a position to object to certain arrangements. </p>  <p>  Ireland has a well-resourced labour inspectorate, which forms part of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and there are existing mechanisms in place to determine the employment status of individuals or groups. </p>  <p>  WRC Inspections are undertaken on the basis of risk analysis which identifies certain sectors, as a result of complaints received and on a routine basis.  Where the WRC inspection service discover or issues are raised in relation to bogus self-employment or bogus sub-contracting, they are forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners and/or the Department of Social Protection (Scope Section) for investigation either solely by the recipient, or jointly with the Workplace Relations Commission. </p>  <p>  In most cases it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed.  Where there is doubt in relation to the employment status of an individual the relevant Departments and Agencies will have regard to the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals.  This Code was drawn up and agreed in 2007 by the relevant Government Departments with ICTU and IBEC.</p>  <p>  Where an individual believes they are being deprived of employment rights applicable to employees they may refer a complaint to the WRC where the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication leading to a decision that is enforceable through the District Court.  Complaints can be made on a single complaint form available at the WRC&rsquo;s website www.workplacerelations.ie. </p>  <p>  The WRC&rsquo;s Customer Service Section, which  provides information to both employers and employees in relation to employment and industrial relations rights and obligations, can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or 059-9178990.</p>  <p>  An interdepartmental working group, comprising officials from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, has been examining the emergence of new forms of employment arrangements, which are sometimes called &lsquo;disguised employment&rsquo;.  These includes arrangements i) where an individual, who would otherwise be an employee, establishes a company to provide their services employment and ii) where an individual, who is dependent on and under the control of a single employer in the same manner as an employee, is classified as self-employed. </p>  <p>  The working group sought the views of interested parties and stakeholders through a public consultation.  The consultation received 23 submissions from interested parties, including employers, trade unions, professional bodies and individuals. The working group is preparing a report which will present the views of these organisations and individuals, together with an analysis of the issues arising. I understand that the working group is currently finalising the report.</p></reply>

These inspections focussed on the health and safety management of the workers during the construction phase.  As the construction work is nearing completion, the HSA&rsquo;s primary role relates to the occupational health and safety management of the commissioning and operational aspects of the facility.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of an incident at the facility on the 7th June 2017 where the release of lime used for flue gas treatment resulted in 10 workers being taken to hospital.  The HSA inspected the facility on 8th June and subsequently imposed a Prohibition Notice which prohibited all work activities involved in the combustion process until a comprehensive examination of the entire process had been carried out and appropriate remedial plans developed and implemented.  Subsequent visits were made by the Authority to the facility and following agreement with the company on the necessary improvements, the Prohibition  Notice was lifted on 10th July 2017. </p>  <p>  The workers injured in this incident in June were working at the construction site in the commissioning process and their work did not involve any loading bays. </p>  <p>  The HSA has confirmed that no concerns have been raised with them from an occupational safety and health perspective in relation to the loading bays at the facility. </p></reply>

However, it advocates for greater competition across all sectors to reduce costs (including through its membership of the National Competitiveness Council) and also makes recommendations with respect to various sectors of the economy for consideration by the relevant Government bodies responsible for a specific policy area to achieve such reduced costs.</p>  <p>  Ensuring that businesses operate in a competitive environment and that business costs are sustainable is a key focus for the National Competitiveness Council which has recently reported to me in its Cost of Doing Business Report 2017 and which I have taken to Cabinet to raise the business related cost issues across the relevant Government Departments.</p>  <p>  The NCC research shows that notwithstanding the sharp cost adjustments that Ireland underwent in terms of its cost base across a range of metrics during the crisis, Irish price levels remain elevated compared with many of our competitors.  Prices on average, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, registered no growth in 2016 compared to 2015 and were 0.2% higher in April 2017 compared with April 2016.  As highlighted by the CSO, the most notable changes in the year were decreases in Transport (-0.52%) and Miscellaneous Goods &amp;amp; Services (-0.04%).  The aspects which caused the largest upward contribution in the month were Restaurants &amp;amp; Hotels (+0.12%) and Alcoholic Beverages &amp;amp; Tobacco (+0.08%).  Ireland, however, remains a relatively expensive location in which to live and do business with a price profile which can be described as &ldquo;high cost, rising slowly&rdquo;. Irish consumer prices remain over 25% above the European Union average. </p>  <p>  The NCC has identified a number of recurring cost drivers impacting on a range of business inputs including Housing, Commercial property, Credit costs and interest rate differentials between Irish firms and their European counterparts, Energy and utility costs, Business services costs (e.g. professional services and transport) and Consumer costs (e.g. insurance, health and education).  There is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage the controllable portion of their respective cost bases, drive efficiency and continue to take action to address unnecessarily high costs. </p>  <p>  The NCC will be reporting to me in December with recommendations in its annual Competitiveness Challenge Report 2017 to address competitive issues in the economy and I will take these to Government for response by the respective Departments and agencies. </p></reply>

So, while we are now less dependent on the UK market a key part of EI&rsquo;s strategy is to further reduce the share of exports going to the UK.</p><p>The objective however is not to reduce our exports to the UK market, which will always be a key market.  The aim is to grow our exports to other markets.  A particular focus will be the Eurozone market. EI recently launched a Strategy to increase client exports to the Eurozone by 50%, from &euro;4bn currently to &euro;6bn, by 2020.</p><p>On the critical issue of finance, following significant analysis and stakeholder consultation, my Department is currently working to develop appropriate, tailored and targeted responses to meet the needs of companies across the economy around working capital and business development schemes.  While these measures are being considered in the context of existing State aid rules, this work, along with market developments as a result of Brexit, and ongoing engagement with the business community, will inform further discussions with the Commission and the development of any further initiatives to business.</p><p>Since the UK referendum result, my Department and its agencies - Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and Inter Trade Ireland - have been actively engaged in supporting companies to assess and address their exposure to Brexit.</p><p>In terms of information and advice, EI initially produced an updated guide to exporting to the UK as well as a series of papers and webinars on key issues including currency.  EI&rsquo;s current &ldquo;#Prepare for Brexit&rdquo; campaign includes a Brexit Scorecard, available to all companies, to self-assess their preparedness across all aspects of operations and strategy and which generates a report suggesting appropriate responses.  These supports are available to all companies, on EI&rsquo;s website: www.enterprise-ireland.com.</p><p>Each of the 31 Local Enterprise Offices can offer advice, training and mentoring to address Brexit challenges.  Each LEO can now offer financial assistance to clients to examine export options, to improve product innovation and improve the competitiveness of their business in the face of Brexit.</p><p>InterTrade Ireland has established a new Brexit Advisory Service to assist SMEs, particularly dependent on cross border trade.</p><p>In terms of export assistance, my Department secured additional resources in Budget 2017 to enable EI and the LEOs to support exporting companies.  An extra 39 staff are being recruited by EI to support companies with market research and new market penetration.  EI will organise some 145 trade promotion events in 2017.</p><p>The strategic response to Brexit is to strengthen the innovation and market diversification of Irish companies.  On an ongoing basis, Enterprise Ireland is engaged directly with clients that are most dependant on the UK to offer a package of supports in terms of marketing, innovation, key skills and competitiveness in order to secure existing business and to source new opportunities.</p></reply>

Building on this strong base, the Agency is targeting a 30% to 40% increase in investment in the region by 2019.  A dedicated Regional Business Development Manager has been appointed to assist the Agency in achieving this ambitious target.  IDA Ireland is actively seeking overseas investment for Kildare and continues to draw the attention of potential investors to the particular strengths of the County.</p>  <p>  In 2016, Enterprise Ireland supported companies in County Kildare employed 8,632 people, a net gain of 229 on the previous year.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for the period 2017 to 2020 is focused on addressing the need for greater scale across Irish enterprise, in every county throughout the country, including the Agency&rsquo;s 180 clients in Kildare. </p>  <p>  In the period 2014 to 2016, Enterprise Ireland paid approximately &euro;11 million to client companies located in Kildare.  Enterprise Ireland funding has supported the establishment of two Community Enterprise Centres in Kildare situated in Clane and Athy.  These provide space in a supportive environment for budding entrepreneurs and serve to help the development of entrepreneurship locally. </p>  <p>  In June 2017, Enterprise Ireland launched the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund.  The Fund will support significant collaborative regional initiatives to build on specific industry sectoral strengths and improve enterprise capability, thereby driving job creation.  This competitive fund is open to projects from Kildare that meet the fund&rsquo;s eligibility criteria.  An information event on this initiative was held in Maynooth at the end of June.  Enterprise Ireland will continue to work with other enterprise development actors to support the implementation of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs and Rural Action Plan in Kildare and surrounding area. </p></reply>

This allocation is distributed across 39 different subheads which is reflective of the diversity of my Department&rsquo;s functions.</p><p>Capital funding is primarily in the form of enterprise and innovation grants awards provided through  Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, the 31 Local Enterprise Offices,  InterTrade Ireland, Tyndall National Institute, the Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions and the Interreg programme.  It also covers some funding to support the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Credit Guarantee Scheme and payment of Ireland&rsquo;s membership and participation in various International Research Organisations such as the European Space Agency.</p><p>Current funding covers the Pay, Non-Pay and Pensions costs associated with the Department, its Offices and Agencies.  It also covers Ireland&rsquo;s annual membership subscriptions to certain international organisations such as the Wold Trade Organisation, the International Labour Organisation and the World Intellectual Property Organisation.</p><p>Gross expenditure to the end of June 2017 across my Department&rsquo;s Vote amounted to &euro;333.960 million.  This compares to an estimated profiled expenditure amount undertaken through an extensive exercise at the beginning of 2017 of &euro;360.44 million.  The gross expenditure to the end of June therefore represents a 7% variance behind expenditure profile.  The following table outlines the respective variances between the different elements of Current expenditure and also Capital expenditure versus the initial profile. <table><tr><th>-</th><th>Total Allocation as per 2017 REV </th><th>Expenditure to the end of June 2017 </th><th>Original profiled spend estimate for end June 2017</th><th>Variance</th><th>% Variance</th></tr><tr><td>Pay </td><td>&euro;153.53m</td><td>&euro;69.61m</td><td>&euro;72.08m</td><td>-&euro;2.46m</td><td>-3%</td></tr><tr><td>Pensions </td><td>&euro;  49.37m</td><td>&euro;24.43m</td><td>&euro;24.55m</td><td>-&euro;0.12m</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Non-Pay</td><td>&euro;100.50m</td><td>&euro;41.88m</td><td>&euro;45.29m</td><td>-&euro;3.40m</td><td>-8%</td></tr><tr><td>Capital </td><td>&euro;555.00m</td><td>&euro;198.03m</td><td>&euro;218.51m</td><td>-&euro;20.48m</td><td>-9%</td></tr></table>My Department keeps expenditure trends under constant review and provides expenditure details on a monthly basis to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Such information feeds into the Expenditure Reports that are published with the monthly Exchequer Statement.</p><p>It is difficult to assess the full year expenditure on my Department&rsquo;s Vote at this early stage.  As the year progresses my Department will continue to manage expenditure within the allocations agreed by the D&aacute;il in the 2017 Estimates in order to deliver on my Department&rsquo;s agreed objectives. </p></reply>

I also informed Michael Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, of these discussions when I met him in Brussels on 10th July 2017.  These discussions continue at the highest levels to address all relevant issues relating to any proposals emerging from our work with industry. </p>  <p>  The Government is conscious of the need to consider the types of supports that Irish businesses may require to address challenges arising as a result of the Brexit Referendum, which is likely to represent a structural shift in the UK trading relations.  Short, medium and long term responses from market diversification through to price repositioning will be needed. </p>  <p>  On foot of extensive engagement with industry, my Department is working with the Department of Finance, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Enterprise Ireland and the SBCI to develop appropriate, tailored and targeted responses.

Complaints regarding the abuse of the sub-contracting or the Relevant Contracts Tax (RCT) system are solely a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  Thus, the WRC does not keep statistics in relation to complaints of bogus self-employment. </p>  <p>  In most cases it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed.  Where there is doubt in relation to the employment status of an individual the relevant Departments and Agencies will have regard to the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals.  This Code was drawn up and agreed in 2007 by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Department of Social and Family Affairs, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Federation.</p>  <p>  The WRC has statutory authority to share information with both the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.  Such information sharing takes place regularly between WRC inspectors and their counterparts in these bodies.  In cases of mutual interest, joint operations and/or inspections may be carried out.  This exchange and sharing of information, together with the joint operations, is a valuable element of the inspection process and contributes to uncovering non-compliance in the areas covered by the relevant bodies.  </p>  <p>  The WRC provides information on employment, equality &amp;amp; industrial relations legislation, through the Workplace Relations Customer Service and Information Unit.

Finally, I understand that the Department of Social Protection has convened an interdepartmental working party to examine how employees&rsquo; access to the Social Insurance Fund could be improved in circumstances where their employer has not entered formal insolvency.  The work of this group is progressing.</p></reply>

The number of personal callers has fallen by 64% since 2008.  Taxpayers are choosing different channels to the traditional 'walk-in' services and are getting the information and assistance they require in a way that better meets their needs.</p>  <p>  Revenue is responding to the changing taxpayer requirements and has introduced an appointments service in a number of public offices in recent years, including the Dundalk office with effect from 17th July 2017.   A dedicated telephone line is available for making appointments and appointments are facilitated on a basis agreed with the taxpayer in each instance.  The provision of an appointments service at the Dundalk office provides an improvement in Revenue's service to taxpayers by enabling them to arrange attendance at a time when they can be certain of a speedy service and removes any potential for queuing or delays.</p>  <p>  Revenue offers a range of service channels to support taxpayers to comply voluntarily with their tax and duty obligations.  Revenue continues to enhance its service offering and the channels through which taxpayers can obtain information and/or engage with them.  The Deputy may wish to note that, on 7th June 2017, Revenue launched a substantially revamped website designed to provide the best possible information source for taxpayers and more effectively meet their needs with clear and easy to understand information.  Many taxpayers prefer, and indeed expect, to do business online.  To meet that need, Revenue has in place modern, high-quality, accessible and user-friendly online services, so that taxpayers can manage their tax affairs at a time that best meets their needs.  Revenue continues to enhance those services, as evidenced by recent on-line developments that include the facility for PAYE customers to file their tax returns online; the 'myaccount' service, eTax Clearance and the 'MyEnquiries' secure online enquiry facility.  The introduction of a Business Taxes service and consistent opening hours across the telephone services has also provided greater certainty for taxpayers. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the circumstances of elderly customers and those with limited, or no, access to internet facilities is fully accommodated in the arrangements now in place and there is no difficulty arranging an appointment in such instances.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am informed by Revenue that a significant process of engagement with staff was undertaken in advance of the implementation of the new service.</p></reply>

In essence the ICF is a consumer protection mechanism which is also found in Member States across the EU and elsewhere.  The ICF is currently maintained and administered under the control of the President of the High Court acting through the Accountant of the Courts of Justice.</p>  <p>  The ICF is funded by a levy on non-life insurance policies, not just on motor insurance policies.  There are some exclusions to this such as health and marine insurance policies.  The current ICF levy has been in place since it was re-introduced on 1 January 2012 and was put in place because of the insolvent nature of Quinn Insurance and the need to protect the policyholders of the company.  Prior to its re-introduction, the levy was applied once before, between 1984 and 1993, to meet the liabilities of an insolvent insurer following the collapse of PMPA.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland (the Bank) is required to carry out an assessment of the ICF on an annual basis pursuant to section 6(8) of the Insurance Act 1964, as amended.  On the 4th November 2011 the Bank published a levy notice requiring non-life insurance companies to pay a 2% levy on insurance premiums in respect of new business and renewals with an inception date on or after 1 January 2012.  This notice remains in force until amended by a further notice.  The last assessment was carried out by the Bank in October 2016. </p>  <p>  The 2% levy is calculated as a percentage determined by the Bank based on the aggregate of the gross premiums paid to insurers in respect of policies issued in relation to risks in the State.   The current ICF levy generates in the region of &euro;70 million per year.</p>  <p>  To date, the Exchequer has advanced in excess of &euro;1 billion to the ICF on which a commercial rate of interest is applied.  As of 31st December 2016, the balance owed to the exchequer was &euro;833 million.  Until all advances outstanding from the Exchequer to the ICF are fully repaid, continued financial support for the ICF in the form of a levy will be required.  Based on the current amount raised by the levy, it is likely to take between 10 to 12 years  for the Exchequer to be repaid.  However, this estimate assumes that no further advances to the ICF will be required.</p></reply>

Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff countrywide engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance.

Enforcement strength at particular locations is regularly augmented with additional personnel on a risk assessment basis or when particular operations are taking place against illegal activity.  I am assured by Revenue that they attach a high priority to combatting the smuggling of controlled drugs and are very active, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, in targeting this criminal activity and those responsible for it.

It will replace the Insurance Mediation Directive which was adopted in 2002 to regulate point of sale insurance products and will create a single market for the sale of insurance products.  The Insurance Distribution Directive aims to further enhance consumer protection and ensure a level playing field by extending the scope of the directive to include all sales of insurance products.  It will also seek to identify and mitigate conflicts of interest in particular in the area of commissions, and strengthen administrative sanctions. </p><p>Work has commenced on the transposition of IDD including the holding of a public consultation on the national discretions in the Directive which ran during April - see link: <i></i></p><p>My Department is currently preparing a submission for me on the transposition process with particular focus on how the discretions should be handled.  For the purpose of this exercise the views of the various stakeholders who participated in the public consultation as well as the Central Bank will be included and will therefore form part of my considerations on these matters.</p><p>In the hierarchy of discretions, it is acknowledged that the discretion in Article 29(3) of IDD which allows Member States amongst other things to prohibit the offer or acceptance of fee, commissions etc., from third parties in relation to the provision of insurance advice, is of particular importance.  This is in turn directly relevant to the issue of independence and the issue of a level playing field for investment products sold under MIFID and those sold under IDD.</p><p>Finally, I hope to have completed my consideration on the IDD discretions in September.  Soon after that the matter will be referred to the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office with a view to having this Directive transposed in advance of the deadline of February 2018.</p></reply>

Prior to 2000, income tax allowed for full joint assessment of married couples, meaning that the earner in a single-income couple could use the combined tax credits and standard rate band available to the couple &ndash; i.e. double the personal tax credit and rate band available to a single earner.  As a result, where the primary earner of a couple had sufficient income to use the available reliefs in full, the second earner faced the marginal rate of tax from the first pound of income earned, and this could act as a disincentive to workforce participation for second earners.</p>  <p>  A process of moving towards an individualised system of income taxation began in the 2000-01 tax year with the stated economic objectives of increasing labour force participation and reducing the numbers of workers paying the higher rates of income tax.  A fully individualised system would have resulted in a two-parent, single-earner family having the same net income as a single individual from a gross wage &ndash; i.e. it would no longer be possible for the tax bands and allowances of the non-earning spouse to be used by the earning spouse.  However, in recognition of the choices made by families in relation to caring responsibilities, the Home Carer Credit (HCC) (or Home Carer&rsquo;s Allowance as it was then) was introduced in tandem with the move towards individualisation in order to benefit families where one spouse works primarily in the home to care for children or other dependants.  The HCC was increased in both Budgets 2016 and 2017 and now stands at &euro;1,100 per annum.  It may be claimed in full where the home carer&rsquo;s income is below &euro;7,200 per year, and on a reduced tapered basis where the home carer earns up to &euro;9,200 per year. </p>  <p>  The Dependent Relative Tax Credit pre-dates the HCC and may be claimed by an individual who maintains a dependant relative at his or her own expense.  The dependant relative can be an individual unable to maintain themselves due to old age or infirmity; a widowed parent; or a child on whom the claimant depends due to old age or infirmity, and the credit cannot be claimed where the dependant relative&rsquo;s income exceeds &euro;14,504.</p>  <p>  The credit has remained unchanged for many years and the current rate of this tax credit is &euro;70 per annum.  The credit has remained unchanged in recent years as there are inherent limitations in the potential for the tax system to be an effective policy tool, particularly when looking at individuals who may be working on a part-time basis while caring for a dependant relative.  In general, a single employee will only enter the income tax net when income exceeds &euro;16,500, so an increase in a tax credit would have no potential to benefit individuals earning less than that amount.  For this reason, direct expenditure measures can be a more effective policy tool than tax reliefs in providing support to individuals on lower income levels.</p>  <p>  With regard to any future increases to the Home Carer Credit, any such announcements would normally be made as part of the Budget and I am not inclined to diverge from this practice.</p></reply>

All 17 of these action points have been completed by their deadline.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for June) indicates that motor insurance premiums have reduced by 10.2% year-on-year.  I accept that while CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures only represent a broad average and that there are many people who are still seeing increases.  I take the view that while the greater stability in pricing is a good thing, premiums are still at a very high level.  </p>  <p>  However, I do believe that the implementation of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance will make a difference to the pricing of insurance premiums over the next 18 months.  I also believe that the Setanta judgment, by finding that MIBI is not liable to meet third party claims, removes a major uncertainty from the industry, which I would expect to be reflected in pricing in the short to medium term.</p></reply>

Mortgage interest relief (MIR) has been abolished for homes purchased on or after 1 January 2013.  MIR is currently due to expire for the remaining recipients on 31 December 2017, however in Budget 2017 the Government confirmed its intention to extend MIR beyond the current end-date of December 2017 on a tapered basis to 2020, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The remaining recipients receive relief at a rate of between 15% and 30% of qualifying interest paid &ndash; the highest rate of 30% applies to first-time buyers who purchased between 2004 and 2008 when house prices were at their peak.  A ceiling on qualifying interest applies of &euro;10,000 per individual (&euro;20,000 per couple) in the first seven years of the mortgage, and &euro;3,000 per individual (&euro;6,000 per couple) in subsequent years.</p>  <p>  With regard to mortgage interest paid by landlords, the expenses that may be allowed as deductions against gross rent are specified in section 97 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Interest on loans used to purchase, improve or repair a property may be deducted, subject to the limitations set out below. </p>  <p>  For residential properties, deductibility of mortgage interest is conditional on the registration of all tenancies with the Residential Tenancy Board (RTB). For the period 7 April 2009 to 31 December 2016, 75% of interest was deductible against rental income.  Full 100% interest deductibility is being restored incrementally by 5 percentage points per year from 2017, with 80% deductible in 2017, and full deductibility scheduled to apply from 2021.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that in the Finance Act 2015, a new relief was introduced with effect from 1 January 2016 which increases to 100% the mortgage interest deduction where a landlord undertakes, for a period of at least three years, to provide accommodation to tenants in receipt of social housing supports and registers such undertakings with the Residential Tenancies Board within certain time limits.  The additional relief (i.e. the difference between the standard deductibility rate set out above and 100%) in respect of the three-year period is available by way of a claim to Revenue after the end of the period.  Further information on this relief is available in section 97 of the Revenue Commissioners &ndash; Notes for Guidance &ndash; Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 &ndash; Finance Act 2015 Edition &ndash; Part 4 Principal Provisions Relating to the Schedule D Charge, which is available at www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/law/notes-for-guidance/tca/part04.pdf.</p></reply>

Payments can only be made out of the ICF, with the approval of the High Court and only if it appears to the High Court that it is unlikely that the claim can be met otherwise than from the ICF.  If satisfied, the High Court can order payments out of the ICF up to 65% (or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser) due to relevant third party claimants.</p>  <p>  The Liquidator has informed the Department that, as of 20 July 2017, the number of outstanding claims is 1,552.  The Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice and the State Claims Agency are currently working with the Liquidator to progress the making of payments to these claimants.</p>  <p>  In this regard, an Order was granted in the High Court on Monday, 24 July 2017 in relation to 324 claims (25 first-party claims and 299 third-party claims).  The Courts Service is now in a position to process the payments for these 324 claims. </p>  <p>  Over and above the 65% ICF payment, it is expected that a proportion of the balance of money due to third party claimants will be met from the proceeds of the distribution of Setanta&rsquo;s assets on completion of the liquidation process. However, it is not possible to say definitively at this stage what proportion of the claims this will amount to. In this regard, a preliminary assessment was carried out by Towers Watson in 2014 who indicated that the Liquidator would not be in a position to meet more than 30% of claims out of the assets of the liquidation.  The Liquidator has subsequently informed my Department that as the Supreme Court has now made its judgment, a new actuarial report is being commissioned.  This is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2017.</p></reply>

The CCMA sets out the four-step MARP process that must be followed when dealing with a mortgage arrears case:</p><p>Step 1: Communicate with borrower;</p><p>Step 2: Gather financial information;</p><p>Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and</p><p>Step 4: Propose a resolution.</p><p>Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm.  The CCMA includes requirements that arrangements be sustainable and based on a full assessment of the individual circumstances of the borrower.  While the CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered in a particular case, it does provide that a regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where it has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower (or his/her nominated representative), and the specific timeframes set out in the CCMA have been adhered to or the borrower has been classified as &quot;not co-operating&quot; under the provisions of the CCMA.  </p><p>Outside of the CCMA process, the statutory insolvency framework and its various options will also be available to people with unsustainable levels of personal debt.  Details on the protections and options available to insolvent debtors under the personal insolvency legislation can be found at isi.gov.ie.</p><p>Mortgage and other loans can be sold by Central Bank regulated entities to entities which are not regulated by the Central Bank.  However, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing) Act 2015 (&ldquo;the 2015 Act&rdquo;) was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans are sold to an unregulated firm.  The Act provides any loans which are purchased by an unregulated firm must be serviced by a &quot;credit servicing firm&quot; which is authorised by the Central Bank to conduct credit servicing activities.  Such credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  Therefore, this ensures that consumers, whose loans have been sold to an unregulated firm, nevertheless maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct (such as the CCMA) issued by the Central Bank.</p><p>From the enactment of the 2015 Act, regulated entities are required to comply with the requirements of financial services legislation including the Central Bank&rsquo;s Statutory Codes of Conduct (including the CCMA, where relevant) in respect of any credit servicing activities (as defined in the Act) it performs.  This means that the regulated &quot;credit services firm&quot; must engage with consumers in accordance with these rules including when managing or administering the credit agreement, including:</p><p>(a) notifying the relevant borrower of changes in interest rates or in payments due under the credit agreement or other matters of which the credit agreement requires the relevant borrower to be notified,</p><p>(b) taking any necessary steps for the purposes of collecting or recovering payments due under the credit agreement from the relevant borrower,</p><p>(c) managing or administering any of the following:</p><blockquote>(i) repayments under the credit agreement;<br /><br />(ii) any charges imposed on the relevant borrower under the credit agreement;<br /><br />(iii) any errors made in relation to the credit agreement;<br /><br />(iv) any complaints made by the relevant borrower;<br /><br />(v) information or records relating to the relevant borrower in respect of the credit agreement;<br /><br />(vi) the process by which a relevant borrower&rsquo;s financial difficulties are addressed;<br /><br />(vii) any alternative arrangements for repayment or other restructuring;<br /><br />(viii) assessment of the relevant borrower&rsquo;s financial circumstances and ability to repay under the credit agreement,</blockquote><p>or</p><p>(d) communicating with the relevant borrower in respect of any of the matters referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c).</p></reply>

As at end of June 2017 the Housing Agency has expressed an interest in over 500 of these properties with 281 of these sale agreed.  AIB continues to work directly with the Housing Agency to ensure all suitable properties are made available for consideration.</p><p><b>PTSB</b></p><p>Permanent TSB has informed me that in April 2015 the bank reviewed its entire property stock and offered 45 properties to the Housing Agency (HA) based on the HA requirements at that time.  One property was selected by the HA and progressed to sale.  The bank further advised that the number of properties in possession as at December 2016 were 480.  However during  2016 Permanent TSB paused the sale of homes in its possession and paused legal proceedings which might have led to houses being taken into the bank&rsquo;s possession in order to review processes around such cases in light of lessons from the Mortgage Redress Programme (late 2015).  The bank has now lifted that pause and will review options including the offer of properties to the Housing Agency going forward. </p></reply>

The relief serves to ensure the taxation of the portion of the couple&rsquo;s combined income that is attributable to the tax resident individual is not greater than it would have been if both spouses were resident for tax purposes.  The issue of a direct comparison of the tax outcome of a tax resident couple does not arise as the income of the non-resident individual will, in general, be taxable in the jurisdiction of residence.</p>  <p>  This relief was introduced in recognition of the decisions of the Supreme Court in the cases of Murphy v. Attorney General (1982) and Muckley v. Ireland (1985) confirming the constitutional prohibition on any discrimination against the family in the tax code. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy is aware of particular instances of unfairness or inconsistency arising from the application of the relief, or any instance of abuse of the relief, he should bring the matter to the attention of Revenue who will investigate fully.</p></reply>

National Debt is effectively a domestic measure as it is the net debt incurred by the Exchequer after taking account of cash balances and other financial assets.</p>  <p>  Gross National Debt is the principal component of GGD.  There is no Departmental break-down of debt as each Department is funded via the Exchequer and/or appropriations in aid.  However it should be noted that, as well as National Debt, GGD also includes the debt of central and local government bodies.

We are a small and very open economy in a world that has more risks than usual.  Compliance with the fiscal rules underpins the Government&rsquo;s objective of maintaining sound public finances.  Furthermore, any additional expenditure outside of the limits set by the expenditure benchmark could result in a deviation under the fiscal rules which, if the State does not take effective action within a relevant deadline, could result in the European Commission applying an interest bearing deposit.  Additionally, aside from financial penalties there could be a potential for adverse debt market outcomes and reduced confidence in the Irish economy.</p><p>It has always been the Government's intention to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our debt and help reduce our debt servicing costs.  Given the uncertainty around the specific timing of or the amount that will be realised, such an estimate has not been included our debt forecasts.  </p><p>Debt reduction, underpinned by the Government's lower gross general government debt target of 55% of GDP, will increase the resilience of the public finances to deal with any potential shocks which may emerge.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-26a.398.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017072600010#WRH05300"><p>The Deputy will be aware that NAMA outlined in its 2016 Annual Report that the Agency expects to return a surplus to the State in the region of &euro;3bn, subject to prevailing market conditions, when it completes its work.  It is important to recognise that this is a projected surplus - it will only materialise after NAMA&rsquo;s debt is fully repaid and NAMA&rsquo;s ongoing work is completed.  NAMA held cash reserves of circa &euro;1.6 billion at the end of 2016 and requires these reserves to fund its ongoing operating costs and to progress its ongoing deleveraging, Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes in the interim period to 2020.  It is only through the successful completion of these objectives that NAMA anticipates that the estimated surplus will be available for return to the State by 2020.  </p>  <p>  NAMA currently has &euro;500m (2%) of its original &euro;30.2bn senior debt and &euro;1.6bn of subordinated debt remaining outstanding.  NAMA is structured in such a way that the debt it issued to purchase the acquired loans was not treated as part of Ireland&rsquo;s General Government Debt under European accounting rules.  NAMA Group entities are therefore 51% privately owned and operate to return dividends to its shareholders.  The return to the private investors is an annual dividend linked to the Irish Government Bond yield at the time of dividend declaration, with the potential of an additional 10% (capped) of the contributed capital sum.  As per section 60(2) of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA may, following consultation with the Minister for Finance, use surplus funds to redeem and cancel its debt and &ldquo;transfer any surplus funds remaining after that redemption to the Central Fund&rdquo;.  In practice, this means that surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once all NAMA's obligations have been repaid in full and in order of seniority: </p>  <p>  1.  Government guaranteed senior bonds</p>  <p>  2.  Subordinated debt</p>  <p>  3.  Private investors</p>  <p>  NAMA currently expects to redeem the remaining government guaranteed senior debt by the end of 2017, its subordinated debt of &euro;1.6bn at its call date of March 2020 and repay its private investors thereafter.  NAMA have also advised that the Residential and Docklands SDZ funding programmes are unlikely to be completed before 2020.  Thus, I do not currently envisage a situation where NAMA will complete its work early as the Deputy suggests.</p>  <p>  As has been discussed with Eurostat, from an accounting perspective, once the senior debt, subordinated debt, and private investors have been repaid then NAMA (the Agency), which is in Government, would be the sole shareholder and, as such, NAMA (the SPV) would then become classified into the Government sector, having no effect on the General Government Balance.  This is expected to occur in 2020, no later than the time at which the private shareholders have been fully compensated.  At this point in time NAMA will have no debt.</p>  <p>  It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised or distributed within the fiscal rules once it is available.  It has always been the current Government's intention to utilise receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our debt and help reduce the cost of the banking stabilisation measures and reduce our debt servicing costs.  The fiscal rules are designed to promote budgetary discipline and underpin sustainable economic growth.  While Ireland's economy is growing and debt is on a downward trajectory, the debt level is still comparably high and caution must be exercised due to the potential of rollover risk should interest rates increase.  We are a small and very open economy in a world that has more risks than usual.  Compliance with the fiscal rules underpins the Government&rsquo;s objective of maintaining sound public finances.</p></reply>

The guiding principle of the protocol to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated any differently to any other driver subject to their ability to demonstrate, and the insurance company to verify, their continued driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.  This is of particular relevance to the issue of the recognition of claims-free driving experience in another jurisdiction.</p><p>In addition, insurance companies have agreed to provide relevant and helpful information on their websites to make it easier for consumers to understand the implications of their move abroad from a motor insurance perspective.As part of this exercise they will outline what people need to do under a number of different circumstances, depending on the length of time they intend being away from Ireland.  </p><p>The one outstanding future action related to Recommendation 6 is the submission of a report by Insurance Ireland to my Department before the end of Q4 2017 which will provide an update as to how the recommendation has been rolled-out amongst Insurance Ireland members in practice.  This will greatly assist my Department in monitoring the implementation of the relevant actions.</p><p>Finally, if a consumer is unable to secure a quotation on the open market, he or she may be in a position to avail of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA) process.  Under the terms of the DCA, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance if the person has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.  In this regard, there are further details available on the Insurance Ireland website while Insurance Ireland also operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  The relevant contact details are: <i>feedback@insuranceireland.eu</i>or <i>declined@insuranceireland.eu</i>or 01-6761914.</p></reply>

The initial focus of the Working Group was the problem of rising motor insurance premiums and a broad range of issues affecting the cost of motor insurance were examined. </p>  <p>  The Working Group&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are clearly set out in an Action Plan.  Some 45 of these action points are due to be implemented by the end of this year with the remainder scheduled for completion before the conclusion of 2018. </p>  <p>  There is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress and the first such update was published in early May.  The second quarterly update was published on the Department's website on 21 July 2017 and shows the progress to date on the overall implementation of the recommendations, with a particular focus on the 17 action points which were due for completion in the second quarter of 2017.  All 17 of these action points have been completed by their deadline. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for June) indicates that motor insurance premiums have reduced by 10.2% year-on-year.  I do, however, accept that while CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures only represent a broad average and that there are many people who are still seeing increases.  I take the view that while the greater stability in pricing is a good thing, premiums are still at a very high level.   </p>  <p>  However, I believe that the implementation of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance will make a difference to the pricing of insurance premiums over the next 18 months.  I also believe that the Setanta judgment, by finding that MIBI is not liable to meet third party claims, removes a major uncertainty from industry, which I would expect to be reflected in pricing in the short to medium term. </p>  <p>  Additionally, in January, the Cost of Insurance Working Group embarked on its second phase to examine issues around the cost of insurance for businesses, specifically Employer Liability (EL) Insurance and Public Liability (PL) Insurance.  It is envisaged that the final results of this second phase will take the form of an addendum to the existing Report.  As with the first phase, the aim is for all relevant bodies and stakeholders to work together in order to deliver fairer premiums for businesses without unnecessary delay.  It is hoped that a final report will be published in the autumn.</p>  <p>  The Working Group is building upon the previous work done in the motor phase in order to determine how it can be applied in the employer liability and public liability insurance claims areas particularly in relation to:</p>  <p>  - Personal Injury data and information</p>  <p>  - Effects of legal costs and litigation processes on insurance costs</p>  <p>  - Current claims compensation arrangements and cost of claims</p>  <p>  - Impact of unlawful activity on insurance sector</p>  <p>  The Working Group is also considering the impact of the cost of insurance on the competitiveness of particular business sectors, the impact of health and safety issues on the cost of insurance and other market issues.  </p>  <p>  The Working Group has met nine times this year and has held extensive consultations with a range of stakeholders including the Hotels Federation of Ireland, IBEC, ISME, the Vintners&rsquo; Federation of Ireland (VFI), the Licensed Vintners&rsquo; Association (LVA), the Retail Grocery Dairy &amp;amp; Allied Trades Association (RGDATA), Chambers Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority.  Further consultations are also planned and I would invite further submissions from interested parties to insurance@finance.gov.ie.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>- be without one or both legs;</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p><p>The Scheme and qualifying criteria were designed specifically for those with severe physical disabilities and are, therefore, necessarily precise.  </p><p>The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.

From time to time representations are received on behalf of individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.

All cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the lender, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his/her mortgage obligations.  The CCMA sets out the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) as the framework lenders must follow when dealing with borrowers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears.</p><p>As part of the MARP process, lenders will need to gather relevant financial information from a mortgage borrower.  To that end, Appendix 1 of the CCMA</p><p>() now sets out a Standard Financial Statement (SFS) which is to be used by all lenders and other relevant creditors across the industry in line with the recommendation which was made by the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Expert Group.  The SFS is essential to the effectiveness of the MARP Process and the standard format ensures that assessments of borrowers&rsquo; cases will be based on a common analysis of their financial circumstances. </p><p>It could also be noted that, in a more general way, the Consumer Protection Code (provision 3.1) also requires regulated entities to provide such reasonable assistance and/or assistance that may be necessary to a vulnerable customer to facilitate his/her dealings with the regulated entity.</p></reply>

Therefore, assuming abolition in 2018, the full-year cost of abolishing the Universal Social Charge would be in the order of &euro;4.0 billion.  As the Deputy will appreciate, these figures will be reviewed and are subject to change as part of the Budget 2018 process in October this year, which will incorporate the most up to-date macroeconomic data.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the first and full year cost of abolishing the USC for persons earning less than &euro;90,000 is &euro;1,884 million and &euro;2,185 million respectively. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the first and full year cost of abolishing the USC for persons earning less than &euro;80,000 is &euro;1,730 million and &euro;2,004 million respectively.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that increasing the entry threshold to USC in this manner would create a significant step effect whereby a USC liability of over &euro;3,589 or &euro;4,389 would arise once income exceeds &euro;80,000 or &euro;90,000 respectively.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the first and full year yield of introducing additional income tax bands such that earnings between &euro;100,000-&euro;140,000 are subject to income tax at 50%; earnings between &euro;140,000 and &euro;180,000 are taxed at 55%; earnings between &euro;180,000 and &euro;250,000 are taxed at 60%; and earnings above &euro;250,000 are taxed at 65%; is &euro;1,636 million and &euro;2,226 million respectively.</p>  <p>  On the basis of the information provided above in respect of the cost of abolishing the USC for those earning under &euro;90,000 and the projected 2018 USC yields, it is estimated that the amount that would be collected in 2018 if USC were to be applied only to those earning over &euro;90,000, using the current system of rates and bands for the charge, would be in the region of &euro;1,815 million.</p>  <p>  These estimates have been generated by reference to 2018 incomes as calculated on the basis of actual data for the year 2015, the latest year for which returns are available, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.  The estimates are provisional and may be revised.</p></reply>

I am advised by NAMA that this is considered frictional vacancy, whereby one tenant has just moved out of a property and a new tenant is preparing to occupy it.</p>  <p>  As regards development land over which NAMA holds security, NAMA&rsquo;s objective is to facilitate the delivery of 20,000 residential units by end-2020, subject to commercial viability.</p>  <p>  From the beginning of 2014 to the end of April 2017, I am advised that over 5,300 residential units were completed with funding from NAMA.  In addition, I am advised that another 9,200 units are either under construction or have obtained planning permission.  Sites with a delivery capacity of another 9,500 units are either in the planning system or will be within a year. Pre-planning and feasibility work is underway on sites which have a delivery capacity for another 17,000 units.</p>  <p>  NAMA has also played an important role in facilitating, on a commercial basis, the supply of social housing from within its existing portfolio.  It has engaged extensively with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Housing Agency, local authorities and approved housing bodies in order to facilitate the delivery of social housing to the greatest extent possible given the composition of assets securing its loans. </p>  <p>  I am advised that, to date, NAMA has identified 6,945 vacant residential properties as being potentially suitable for social housing.  Through the Housing Agency, local authorities confirmed demand for 2,768 of these properties and to date, 2,398 of these properties have been delivered to both local authorities and approved housing bodies for social housing.  It is important to note that confirmation of demand and suitability is a matter, not for NAMA, but for the local authorities through the Housing Agency.</p></reply>

This survey provided for the first time comprehensive data on household wealth in Ireland.  The survey provides information on the ownership and values of different types of assets and liabilities along with more general information on income, employment and household composition. </p><p>During 2016, my Department, jointly with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), conducted a research project into the distribution of wealth in Ireland and the potential implications of a wealth tax using the HFCS.  The research formed part of an ongoing joint research programme with the ESRI on the Macro-Economy and Taxation.  The research paper, &ldquo;Scenarios and Distributional Implications of a Household Wealth Tax in Ireland&rdquo; is available on the ESRI website ().  The paper presented results on the composition of net wealth (i.e. assets less liabilities) across both the wealth and income distributions in Ireland. </p><p>Table 2 of the Research paper details the distribution of household net wealth in 2013 across ten wealth deciles.  Deciles are constructed by ranking households based on their net assets and then dividing them into ten equally sized groups. </p><p>It should be borne in mind when aggregating the percentage of net wealth held by different deciles that the bottom wealth decile in Table 2 has negative net wealth as total debts exceeded assets for these households.  As a result, the richest 90% of households held 103.5% of net wealth in 2013.  On this basis, in 2013 the richest ten percent of households held 53.8% of net wealth, the richest twenty percent held 72.7% of net wealth and the richest fifty percent held 98.6% of net wealth.  The research paper did not examine the wealth holdings of the richest five percent or richest one percent of households.</p></reply>

This estimate was both conservative and prudent.  To estimate the yield from these amendments into the future requires predicting changes in property prices as well as behavioural changes.

I am advised by Revenue that the following table sets out the total value claimed annually, and the number of eligible claimants, in respect of tuition fees for 2012, 2013 and 2014, the latest year for which data are available. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Claimants</th><th>Total Tuition Claimed <br /><br />&euro;*</th></tr><tr><td>2012**</td><td>-</td><td>34,000</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>18</td><td>169,000</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>35</td><td>571,000</td></tr></table></p><p>*It should be noted that these figures are the total amount of tuition fees in respect of which claims were made and not the amount of tuition fees that qualified for SARP.  The amount of tuition fees which qualified for SARP relief is not readily available.</p><p>**Where there are only small numbers of cases in a category, figures are not provided to protect confidential taxpayer information.</p><p>Due to the nature of the SARP employer returns for the years 2012, 2013 and 2014, there are no statistics available to estimate a net cost to the Exchequer for claims involving tuition fees.  I am further advised by Revenue that as it not possible to estimate a net cost to the exchequer for claims involving tuition fees it is also not possible to estimate a saving associated with only allowing the relief at the 20% marginal rate, as described by the Deputy.</p><p>The Charitable Donation Scheme allows tax relief on qualifying donations made to eligible charities and approved bodies which include (but are not limited to) primary and secondary schools.  I am informed by Revenue that it is not possible to separately identify the donations and refunds attributable to such schools.  Accordingly, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the potential savings arising from the measure mentioned by the Deputy. </p></reply>

This is to ensure that the tax is applied to sugar content of the product regardless of the retail price.</p>  <p>  The 2016 Tax Strategy papers estimated potential yields from a tax on sugar sweetened drinks based on total soft drink sales in Ireland of 685.4 million litres per annum.  The TSG papers estimated that the tax would apply to 60% of these sales.  Once introduced, it is expected that the tax will apply to much less than 60% of these sales as the soft drinks industry continue to reformulate their products, reducing sugar content.  Therefore, it is difficult to estimate exactly the tax yield.  However, it can be estimated that a tax on sugar sweetened beverages, levied at 10c on a 330ml can, would yield in the region of &euro;40m in a full year.</p>  <p>  I have not yet finalised the structure, scope or rate of the tax, so estimates are preliminary and subject to change.  It is expected that the underpinning legislation will be introduced in this year's Finance Act. </p></reply>

It is not therefore possible to provide the annual cost in each of the years 2008 to 2016, and to date in 2017, of tax reliefs and exemptions available to residential landlords as sought by the Deputy.  However, tax returns for the 2016 year of assessment onwards have separate data fields for residential property rental income and non-residential property rental income. The relevant information will become available in due course.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the 2013 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General contains, in Chapter 16, a detailed review of the taxation of rental income and expenses deductible therefrom.  This report is available on the website of the Comptroller and Auditor General and can be accessed via the following link: </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, a working group was established in early 2017 to examine and report on the tax treatment of landlords (or rental accommodation providers) and to put forward options, where appropriate, for amendments to such treatment.  The establishment of this group was one of the commitments contained in the &lsquo;Strategy for the Rental Sector&rsquo; which was published by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in December 2016.  The working group is chaired by the Department of Finance and its membership consists of officials from the Department of Finance; the Revenue Commissioners; the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government; and the Residential Tenancies Board. </p><p>As part of the group&rsquo;s work, a public consultation lasting for four weeks was conducted from March to April 2017 which received almost 70 written submissions from a wide range of interested parties, including individual landlords, representative bodies and charitable organisations.  A summary paper on the issues considered has been prepared for discussion by the Tax Strategy Group this month and the final report of the working group is due to be completed shortly thereafter, to allow for consideration of any options put forward as part of my deliberations for Budget 2018.</p></reply>

The companies supported by ISIF's investment activity employed 21,930 people, directly or indirectly, which is a 22 percent increase on end-2015 and of these jobs, 49% are located outside of Dublin. </p><p>Table 1 provides a breakdown of the employment supported by ISIF's investment activities split between Dublin and the remaining four provinces.</p><p>As shown by the report, and outlined in the table, the regional impact of ISIF&rsquo;s investments is in line with the national spread of economic activity as measured by Gross Value Added (GVA).  GVA is a standard measure of economic activity with GDP comprising the aggregate of GVA at enterprise level across the economy.</p><p>The legislation which provided for the establishment of ISIF, the NTMA (Amendment) Act 2014, requires ISIF to include an assessment of its impact on economic activity and employment and the distribution of its investments on a regional basis in its reporting.  Information on the economic impact of ISIF's investment, including employment, is, with the exception of Dublin, reported on a province basis in order to avoid inadvertently identifying commercially sensitive information of underlying investees. </p><p><b>Table 1. ISIF employment levels as at end-2016</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Jobs</th><th>ISIF Capital Deployed</th><th>GVA</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>51%</td><td>57%</td><td>49%</td></tr><tr><td>Leinster ex Dublin</td><td>15%</td><td>13%</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Munster </td><td>27%</td><td>18%</td><td>23%</td></tr><tr><td>Connacht</td><td>5%</td><td>8%</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Ulster</td><td>2%</td><td>4%</td><td>3%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

As part of the Tax Strategy Group process, papers on various options for tax policy changes are prepared annually, these papers discuss options and issues to be considered in the Budgetary process.  In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to Budgetary reform, including greater engagement with the Oireachtas, the Tax Strategy Group papers are now published well in advance of the Budget to facilitate informed discussion.  It is intended that the papers for 2017 will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website by the end of July.  Those for 2016, and indeed previous years, are already available there.</p>  <p>  Some points that may be of particular interest to the Deputy include:</p>  <p>  - My Department uses the ESRI&rsquo;s tax-benefit model, SWITCH, in order to analyse the changes in the direct taxation burden for different household categories that arise from Budget policies (an example of this analysis is available in the annex to TSG 2016/05 paper and will be available again shortly in the 2017 equivalent), www.finance.gov.ie/sites/default/files/160714-TSG%2016-05%20-Income%20Tax%20and%20USC%20paper.pdf</p>  <p>  - In the context of direct taxation, Annex B from Budget Book 2017 provides a discussion of progressivity and the income tax system.  It includes a chart (B.28) which examines the average tax rate at different gross income levels and in different years from 1997 to 2016.  It demonstrates that, in any given year, the tax burden increases as incomes increase www.budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2017/Documents/Budget%202017%20-%20Full%20document.pdf</p>  <p>  - My officials regularly review and consider publications on the tax burden on labour e.g. the OECD Taxing Wages publication.  They also regularly review the tax burden for other taxes using publications from, amongst others, the OECD and the European Commission. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may also wish to note that Revenue&rsquo;s distribution tables www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/information-about-revenue/statistics/income-distributions/it-ct-distributions.aspx were used recently by my Department in an ESRI joint research paper on tax volatility, www.esri.ie/pubs/RS59.pdf.  These tables show how much income tax or USC is paid annually in a given income band for different taxpayer categories.</p></reply>

The rights for the State to appoint Public Interest Directors to the boards of the Covered Institutions were derived from the terms of the guarantee schemes introduced in 2008 and extend over the period of the guarantee.  The last of the guaranteed liabilities are due to mature between now and Spring 2018 and as such I do not expect to make any new appointments of Public Interest Directors to the boards of the banks. </p>  <p>  Going forward however, the State does have the ability to appoint directors to the banks in which it has large equity ownership positions.  So in line with the commitment in the PPG, officials in my Department are currently reviewing options in relation to the appointment procedures for bank directors having due regard to distinct differences which exist from appointments to other State boards, not least the requirements of the Central Bank/SSM Fitness and Probity Regime and the requirement to have a broad set of expertise relevant to large regulated entities in an ever more complex regulatory environment.</p>  <p>  In terms of reporting, the legal position is that any company director regardless of whether or not they are a State nominated director is subject to the requirements of company law to act in what he or she believes to be the interests of the company to which they are appointed.  These are the director&rsquo;s fiduciary duties which are owed to the company rather than to the appointing shareholder.  Accordingly, State nominated directors to the banks do not have a formal reporting relationship to the Minister or to the Department of Finance.  However, in carrying out its role in monitoring the performance of the banks in which we have a shareholding, officials in my Department meet the senior executives of each of the banks on a monthly basis and have access to monthly board papers.</p></reply>

It emphasises the Government's commitment, through the Capital Plan, of supporting strong and sustainable economic growth and raising welfare and living standards for all.  Promoting environmental sustainability is, of course, integral to achieving and maintaining sustainable economic growth.</p>  <p>  The incorporation of environmental sustainability as a key encompassing policy goal in the Capital Plan is demonstrated  throughout the plan document and through progress made in the implementation of key elements of the Plan itself, as well as through other important policy and legislative developments focused on environmental sustainability.</p>  <p>  It is important to stress that there is a detailed governance framework already embedded in the allocation of capital resources through which significant investment decisions must be aligned with all government policies, including environmental policy.</p>  <p>  For example, when the Plan sets out the Budget Management Framework, it is explicitly stated that all Departments are responsible for ensuring projects meet with the appropriate regulatory requirements including environmental impact assessments.</p>  <p>  In addition, when outlining the drivers of long-term public investment requirements the Plan highlights environmental concerns such as the developments in climate change and the need to meet EU emissions targets requiring intervention in the areas of energy efficiency and renewable energy, as well as the need for investments in flood prevention.</p>  <p>  Moreover, the area of Environment and Climate is allocated 7% of the available Exchequer capital envelope in the Plan.  This amounts to &euro;874 million over the course of the Plan specifically targetted to this sector.</p>  <p>  The funding of energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes will play a key role in seeking to meet climate change and energy targets as well as reducing expenditure on imported fossil fuels, underpinning domestic energy sector employment and reducing emissions from our annual energy usage.</p>  <p>  As well as Exchequer investment, the commercial State sector as part of the Capital Plan also undertakes investment in renewables, including biomass and forestry, in order to support the delivery of Government's objectives in these areas.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, each Department is responsible for ensuring their spending programmes are consistent with whole-of-Government priorities such as environmental sustainability.  Consequently, my Department has requested that all submissions to the current review of the Capital Plan, from both Government Departments and the Public, examine all potential impacts - both positive and negative &ndash; of capital proposals in the context of meeting Ireland's existing and forthcoming Climate and Energy goals.  My Department also made clear that proposals for additional capital spending should be aligned with the National Mitigation Plan and upcoming National Adaption Framework.</p>  <p>  The review of the Capital Plan will, therefore, ensure that resources continue to be allocated and aligned to support sustainable growth, as required under the Government's current policy framework.</p></reply>

PRD applies to the pay, including any non-pensionable pay elements, of pensionable public servants.</p>  <p>  Specifically, section 2(1)(b) of the 2009 Act provides that any public servant who is a member of a public service pension scheme or who is entitled to benefit under such a scheme or receives a payment in lieu of membership of such a scheme is subject to PRD.</p>  <p>  Across the public service certain cohorts of employees in a few specific occupations are not members of a public service pension scheme, but may instead qualify for a one-off non-recurring gratuity payment at retirement provided that they meet certain conditions.</p>  <p>  It is understood that the possibility of qualifying for such a gratuity would exist in particular for certain retained firefighters and for certain home help workers.  The overall number of such affected public service employees is believed to be quite small.</p>  <p>  The payment of such a one-off non-recurring gratuity at retirement to qualifying public service workers constitutes a payment in lieu of pension scheme membership.  On that basis the pay received by those workers before retirement and gratuity award, is liable to PRD. </p>  <p>  It should however be noted that in practice many of those employees may already be free of PRD, or may be paying much less PRD than previously, on account of the significant amelioration of PRD provided for under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015.  This amelioration means that, from 1 January 2016, all persons with annual public service earnings of up to &euro;26,083 were exempt from PRD, and from 1 January 2017, this exemption threshold increased to &euro;28,750. </p>  <p>  The recently proposed Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides that PRD will be replaced with a permanent Additional Superannuation Contribution (ASC).  If ratified, this means that most public servants currently subject to PRD will benefit from increased ASC exemption thresholds under the PSSA 2018-2020.  Specifically, the new contribution will apply to pensionable remuneration above a threshold of &euro;32,000 from 2019 and &euro;34,500 from 2020, for those with standard accrual pension terms.</p></reply>

These includes sites that are in full State ownership and others that are privately-owned, where Guardianship arrangements exist and where the OPW provides maintenance services.</p>  <p>  As a general policy, OPW facilitates visitor access to as many National Monument sites as possible with a view to both fostering interest in and awareness of our heritage and as part of Ireland&rsquo;s supporting infrastructure for tourism.  Access is not always feasible because of a range of issues such as ongoing conservation works, physical location, risks associated with dangerous structures and restrictions imposed in some cases by landowners who may wish to limit access, either temporarily or more longer term, because of insurance fears, livestock etc.  OPW estimates that approx 10 - 15% of the accessible National Monument sites in its care are not available at any given time for these such reasons.</p>  <p>  While many sites are obviously open to visitors with Guides services and visitor facilities; the majority of properties within the heritage portfolio are largely unattended.  A significant number of locations are generally open on a fulltime basis and visitors are free to wander at will.  At other sites measures are in place to protect them while still facilitating the public who wish to enter and Athlumney Castle is one such location.  OPW maintains a total network of 110 Caretakers and Keyholders at various places around the country and their role is to be available to provide visitors with a key to access the site.  At Athlumney, this controlled access mechanism is made available through a locally appointed Keyholder as it was considered, following previous incidents of antisocial behavior at the site, that access should to be regulated.  I understand that the sign on the site entrance advertising this service was damaged recently and had to be removed.  This may have created erroneous impression that the site is no longer open to the public.   </p>  <p>  I can confirm therefore that visitors are still fully able to access Athlumney Castle and there should be no fears that there has been any change in the position in this regard.

The OPW regards these contacts as beneficial and intends to remain in contact with the Network in relation to relevant issues in the future, including the organising of local Volunteer tours to the St. Columcille&rsquo;s House Monument from the local Church of Ireland site and in the making of plans to restore public access to the Round Tower nearby.</p>  <p>  Currently, access to the St. Columcille&rsquo;s House site in Kells is controlled through a local keyholder.  This reflects the need to maintain control of the site and to avoid a recurrence of the damage and antisocial incidents that have happened in the past.  Though the OPW considers that the keyholding system works well and allows bona fide visitors to access the site easily, it is obviously open to suggestions for its improvement and is assessing the position with a view to making the key available in the local F&aacute;ilte Ireland tourism office.  It does not however propose to make a key available to the Network directly at this time in the interest of maintaining security at the site.</p></reply>

Introduced in 2011 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010, PSPR reduces the value of those public service pensions which have pre-PSPR values above specified thresholds.  It does so in a progressively structured way which has a proportionately greater effect on higher value pensions. </p>  <p>  A very significant part-unwinding of PSPR in three stages is taking place under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015, with PSPR-affected pensioners getting pension increases via substantial restoration of the PSPR cuts on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.</p>  <p>  On 1 January 2016 all pensions of up to at least &euro;18,700 became exempt from PSPR; from 1 January 2017, all pensions of up to at least &euro;26,000 are now exempt from PSPR, and from 1 January 2018 all pensions of up to at least &euro;34,132 per year will be exempt from PSPR.  Those pensioners not fully removed from the reach of PSPR by dint of these changes will, in the majority of cases, benefit by &euro;1,680 per year from 2018.  The cost of these changes is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018.</p>  <p>  Section 6.2 of the proposed Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, which if ratified, will be an extension of the Lansdowne Road Agreement, indicates that over the duration of that agreement, policy on public service pensions in payment will be guided by the following three elements:</p>  <p>  First, the need to adopt an equitable approach to the various public service pensioner cohorts differentiated by date of retirement (in particular pre and post end-February 2012) is affirmed.</p>  <p>  Second, for those who retired or will retire post end-February 2012, to the extent that they retired on reduced salaries for pension award purposes, they will receive pension increases in line with pay increases received by their peers currently in employment in accordance with the terms of the collective agreement.</p>  <p>  Third, when alignment is achieved between pre and post end-February 2012 pensioners, as will happen progressively for salary ranges up to &euro;70,000 in 2020 under the proposed collective agreement, pay increases will continue to benefit pensions in payment for the duration of the agreement.</p>  <p>  This means that over the period of the agreement, if ratified, public service pensions in payment will increase in line with pay increases where necessary to ensure that those pensions are equal to the pensions being awarded to same-grade retiring staff.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-26a.650.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017072600015#WRN03100"><p>On Budget day last October, the Government set out its priorities in relation to expenditure measures for 2017 in Expenditure Report 2017, with the Budget Estimates published in that report reflecting these measures.  The Revised Estimates Volume for Public Services 2017 (REV) provided additional details in relation to these Estimates and also reflected additional allocations of just over &euro;40 million to take account of changes since Budget day, with the most significant being that in relation to the Garda pay following the recommendations by the Labour Court.</p>  <p>  Departments are required to manage expenditure within the allocations set out in the REV and agreed by the D&aacute;il.  Where new priorities emerge in the course of the year which must be met within the approved allocation for each Department, any reallocation of funding from one area, where there may be an emerging underspend, to meet such new priorities would be made in accordance with Public Financial Procedures.</p>  <p>  Following the Labour Court Recommendations with respect to Garda pay the Government had to act to ensure that the Lansdowne Road Agreement would remain intact.  The agreement reached, to bring forward by five months, from September to April, pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road, has a cost in 2017 of &euro;0.12 billion.  As outlined in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report, at this stage three months of this additional cost is reflected in expenditure to the end of June with the cost arising this year to be met from available public resources taking into account the scope for reallocation of expenditure arising from the emerging expenditure position later in the year. This position will be monitored closely in order to assess how to meet any additional funding requirements where the need arises. </p>  <p>  Turning to the Christmas Bonus, the position for 2017 is essentially unchanged from the position that prevailed for the last three years.  The Christmas Bonus to long-term Social Welfare recipients had been abolished in 2009. On Budget day in October 2014, it was announced that a 25% Christmas Bonus would be paid in December of that year.  On Budget day in October 2015, a Christmas Bonus of 75% was announced. Demonstrating the Government's commitment to our most vulnerable citizens, an increased 85% bonus was paid in 2016 as set out in my Estimates Statement on Budget day last year.  In each of these years, the REV did not include a specific allocation in respect of a Social Welfare Christmas bonus, in line with the practice that such payments are funded based on the fiscal position at Budget time.  The payment of a Christmas Bonus has required a Supplementary Estimate in each of the last three years. In 2016 the Department of Social Protection required a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;109 million to provide for the Christmas Bonus, with a broadly similar amount being paid from the funds available in the Social Insurance Fund.  The extent to which a Supplementary Estimate would be required to fund a decision in relation to a Christmas Bonus would depend on the projected outturn at Budget time in relation to spending in the Department of Social Protection, which in net terms at the end of June was &euro;41 million below profile, and also the surplus on the Social Insurance Fund, which as outlined in the June Analytical Exchequer Statement was &euro;132 million ahead of profile, driven by strong growth in PRSI receipts.  The approach to be adopted in relation to meeting the funding requirements of a decision in relation to a Christmas Bonus in 2017 will therefore follow the approach adopted in the last three years. </p>  <p>  Turning to the specific issue of refunds of water charges, which will be in effect a one-off charge in the year of payment, it is anticipated that the cost arising this year in relation to the refund of water charges will be met within available Exchequer resources taking into account the revenue, expenditure and overall fiscal policy position later in the year. </p></reply>

The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles and this information is published monthly, as part of the Department of Finance's Fiscal Monitor.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report, and as set out in the June Fiscal Monitor, overall voted expenditure of &euro;27.4 billion is &euro;0.3 billion, or 1.2 per cent, below profile at the end of June.  Underspends against expenditure profiles can arise for a number of reasons.  These reasons can be timing related, can arise from re-estimations of demand for particular programmes or from cost savings in the delivery of programmes.</p>  <p>  Given the many moving parts within the overall gross voted expenditure amount of &euro;58 billion, the amount of the projected year-end underspends can only be assessed with certainty at a later stage in the year.  This is illustrated by the expenditure outturn for 2016. As outlined in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report 2017, gross voted current expenditure in 2016 ended the year &euro;0.1 billion below the current expenditure allocation based on the Revised Estimates for 2016 agreed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  This outturn of &euro;51.8 billion was &euro;0.2 billion below the current expenditure amount for 2016 set out in Expenditure Report 2017 published last October, due to underspends across a range of Departments that emerged towards the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Turning to the specific issue of refunds of water charges, which will be in effect a one-off charge in the year of payment, it is anticipated that the cost arising this year in relation to the refund of water charges will be met within available Exchequer resources taking into account the revenue, expenditure and overall fiscal policy position later in the year. </p></reply>

The HEA allocates this funding as a block grant to the institutions.  As autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of this funding, along with any funding it receives from private sources, is a matter for the individual institution.</p>  <p>  Student services and associated activities are an integral part of the whole student experience at third level.  Student services support each individual student achieve his/her intellectual, cultural and social potential while supporting and complementing the formal academic programme.  Student services can fall under a number of headings, particularly &lsquo;Welfare and Guidance&rsquo; which includes counselling services, health promotion, careers service, multi-faith, racial and ethnic cultural support.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides a range of services for students in HEA funded higher education institutions, including supports provided by Access Offices.  In particular these offices co-ordinate pastoral and academic supports for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Among the supports administered by the access offices, in conjunction with student services, is the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities.</p>  <p>  The Student Assistance Fund </p>  <p>  The Student Assistance Fund is managed by the HEA on behalf of my Department.  This Fund is allocated annually to the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to support students from socio economically disadvantaged backgrounds, whose participation in higher education would otherwise be at risk as a direct result of financial difficulties.  The fund assists students with ongoing needs for financial support and students with other circumstances giving rise to short or longer-term financial difficulties, including family responsibilities, bereavement, family difficulties, accidents or health problems.  In all cases, institutions are responsible for targeting the available resources at those students most in need.</p>  <p>  Fund for Students with Disabilities </p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) aims to ensure that students can participate fully in their academic programmes and are not disadvantaged by reason of a disability.  The total allocated under the FSD in 2015-16 was &euro;10.4m with a total of 10,486 students in further and higher education supported through the fund.  956 students with a mental health condition in higher education were supported by the FSD in 2015/2016. </p>  <p>  Mental Health Matters - AHEAD</p>  <p>  AHEAD, the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability, is supported through an annual grant from the HEA towards the cost of the activities of the organisation.  AHEAD is an independent non-profit organisation working to promote full access to and participation in further and higher education for students with disabilities and to enhance their employment prospects on graduation. </p>  <p>  In 2016, AHEAD in partnership with the National Learning Network (NLN), published a report called &lsquo;Mental Health Matters&rsquo;, a study into the experiences of students with mental health difficulties.  The study found that the majority of HEIs have services supporting students with mental health difficulties and some institutions have dedicated services for students.  The report made some key recommendations such as the promotion of mental health awareness to students on their induction, the provision of mental health awareness at institutional level for staff and institutions adopting a whole of campus strategic response to meet the needs of students experiencing mental health difficulties.  Implementation of the recommendations is being progressed by AHEAD and partners and a follow-on conference/seminar is planned for later this year.</p>  <p>  Increased funding for Higher Education</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, I secured increased Exchequer investment in higher education of &euro;36.5m, with &euro;160 million being invested over the next three years.  This is the first significant reinvestment in higher education since the beginning of the financial crisis. </p></reply>

As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS has ceased making payments to Institutes of Technology (IoTs) and apprentices pay the full <i>pro rata</i>Annual Student Contribution.  These arrangements mean that apprentices are treated the same, on a <i>pro rata</i>basis for the proportion of a full academic year they spend in IoTs, as full-time students in terms of the ASC.  Typically an apprenticeship block is one third of an academic year, meaning that most apprentices pay &euro;1,000 (one third of the full ASC of &euro;3,000) as their ASC for that period.</p><p>However, unlike full-time students, apprentices are paid a training allowance by SOLAS for phases of their training spent in IoTs.  This allowance ranges from &euro;293 to &euro;647 per week depending on the trade and phase of the apprenticeship programme.  This is the equivalent to their net take-home pay on the job, and is not subject to tax or PRSI.  Such allowances are not available to students in the IoTs. </p></reply>

The Central Applications Office (CAO) manages the graduate entry to medicine on behalf of the participating institutions, and the Graduate Medical Schools Admission Tests (GAMSAT) is used in this regard.</p>  <p>  The CAO handbook states that applicants must hold (or expect to hold by July on year of entry) an Honours Bachelor's degree with a minimum a 2.1, in any discipline.  For candidates who meet this requirement, the GAMSAT is then used to select students.  A minimum score of 55 was required in 2016 to receive an offer of a place.  The level of points required depends on the demand for places.  Details of the GAMSAT application process and the issuing of candidate results are available on the CAO website.</p>  <p>  The Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) offers reduced points places to school leavers with a disability, under the age of 23 as of 1 January 2017, who have been educationally impacted as a result of that disability.  Each participating institution has a reserved number of places to offer eligible DARE applicants at lower or reduced Leaving Certificate points.  Applicants must meet the minimum entry requirements and any specific programme requirements before being considered for a DARE reduced points offer.</p>  <p>  The reduction in points for DARE places can vary each year.  The number of points a particular course is reduced by is dependent on a number of factors, such as the overall number of places on the course, the number of reserved DARE places and the number of DARE eligible applicants competing for these reserved places.  Information on the number of reduced points places available per course and the method used by colleges for selecting eligible DARE students for those places is available on participating HEI websites.</p>  <p>  Undergraduate Medicine is provided in UCD, UCC, NUIG, TCD and the RCSI.  All of these providers are part of the DARE scheme and some have additional places reserved for mature students.  It is understood that the number of places reserved for DARE students for 2017 entry will be the same as for 2016 entry.</p>  <p>  The third level institutions, as part of the Transitions Reform group have been working in partnership with my Department to improve the transition from second level to third level.  The Transitions Reform Group comprises stakeholders from my Department, the Irish Universities Association (IUA), Higher Education Authority (HEA), Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), State Examinations Commission (SEC) and the Technological Higher Education Association (THEA).  A large part of work of the Transitions Reform Group has been the reform of the Leaving Certificate Grading and the Common Points scale for admission to higher education.  Following extensive research and consultation, it was agreed to broaden the Leaving Certificate grading bands.  The number of grade bands was reduced from 14 to 8 to ease the pressure on students to achieve marginal gains in examinations and to encourage better engagement with each subject.  The broader grade bands also bring Ireland more in line with international best practice in other countries.  The Common Points Scale, which is used by the CAO for entry to higher education has also been revised.  The new Common Points Scale will apply to all applicants in 2017, so it will be a level playing field for everyone applying through the CAO system for a higher education place.</p>  <p>  The points for Medicine may be different but not necessarily lower, it depends on the number of applicants, and all candidates will be competing using the revised Leaving Certificate points system.</p></reply>

The quality of our teaching profession is a critical factor in sustaining and enhancing the quality of education outcomes.  Specific targets for 2017 are outlined in the Action Plan for Education.</p>  <p>  The professional development needs of serving teachers are being addressed through the provision of an induction programme for newly qualified teachers, support for new and revised curriculum areas including junior cycle, the new primary language curriculum and ongoing support for the curriculum generally with a particular focus on priority areas - literacy and numeracy, well-being, support for school leaders and for teachers to meet the needs of children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  The responsibilities of the Centre for School Leadership, cover the range of leadership development from pre-appointment training and induction of newly appointed principals, to CPD throughout leaders' careers.</p>  <p>  My Department also adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting the work of schools in promoting positive mental health.  The process spans the curriculum in schools, whole school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional support for teachers.  It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.</p>  <p>  To support schools, my Department has produced and distributed the Well-Being in Primary and Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013 and 2015).  These guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners, and by current research.  They assist schools and the school community in (a) supporting and responding to the mental health and well-being needs of our children and (b) in providing a safe and supportive environment for building life skills and resilience and a strong sense of connectedness to school.  My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is actively assisting schools and school communities in this regard.</p>  <p>  A key theme of my Department&rsquo;s 2017 Action Plan for Education is the support of wellbeing initiatives to ensure that mental resilience and personal wellbeing are integral parts of the education and training system.  Specifically, the Plan commits to the commencement of the roll-out of the Friends for Life programme and the Incredible Years Classroom Management programme to teachers in all DEIS schools.  NEPS will deliver both programmes commencing in the autumn and are currently in the process of recruiting an additional 11 psychologist staff to undertake this work.</p>  <p>  It is planned that during the coming academic year, some 40 Friends programmes will be organised involving some 1,000 primary and post-primary teachers and 50 Incredible Years programmes will be offered to some 1,000 primary school teachers at the commencement of a three year roll-out of the training.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department will be in touch with the individual to further discuss the supports which have been outlined.</p>  <p>  It is open to the interested part to make a submission to my Department which will be considered and responded to.</p></reply>

A total of 13,990 SNA posts will now be available at a gross annual cost of &euro;458 million.  This is more SNAs than we have ever had previously and will ensure that all children who qualify for SNA support can continue to receive access to such support.  In total, the number of SNAs available has increased by over 32% since 2011, when 10,575 posts were available.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which is an independent statutory agency, is responsible, through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from schools for SNA support.  Responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports and resources to be allocated to schools to support individual pupils rests with the NCSE.  In making allocations to schools, the NCSE takes into account the assessed individual needs of all children with identified needs in the school.</p><p>The NCSE has advised all schools of their allocations for SNA support for the coming 2017/18 school year, including the school in question.  Details of SNA allocations which have been made to schools, have been published by the NCSE on their website at .</p><p>It should be noted that SNA allocations are not made to individual children, but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs in the school.</p><p>The level of SNA support allocated to all schools can change from year to year, as students with care needs leave the school, as new students with care needs enrol, or as students develop more independent living skills as they get older and their care needs diminish over time.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>In circumstances where a school, or parent, is unhappy with the allocation of SNA support which has been made, or if it is considered that the level of support allocated is not sufficient to meet the care needs of the pupils concerned, the school or parent, may appeal the decision via the NCSE appeals process.  Details of the NCSE appeals process are available at www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The level of facilities, including playspace,  that can be provided in schools will therefore vary depending on the extent of classroom accommodation needed for the school.</p>  <p>  A suite of technical guidance documents is available on the Department's website (www.education.ie) to assist design teams in best practice design and development of projects and to encourage them to take a complete design team approach from project conception.  These documents cover all aspects of the development of a building project for both internal and external works, including site assessments for new schools.</p>  <p>  The Physical Education curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary.  Many primary schools have a general purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the P.E. programme.  A similar situation with sports halls and outdoor facilities applies at second level.  In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.  In the context of the Department's co-operation with local authorities in identifying suitable sites for new schools, the location of sporting facilities in the vicinity is one of a number of factors taken into account in the overall site appraisal process.</p>  <p>  The Department's design guidelines for schools include guidance in the provision of P.E. Halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts.  The provision of playing pitches is not part of the specification for primary schools.  However, in certain circumstances and where the site conditions allow, the project scope may include the levelling and grassing of an area which schools may decide to use for playing fields.</p>  <p>  At post primary level, an area may be developed as a practice playing field where site conditions and resources permit and specifications are referenced in the site assessment guidelines.  The inclusion of playing pitches may be subject to space availability and school requirements.</p>  <p>  In higher density urban developments the optimum site area may not be available and green space guidelines are subject to space availability.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the student grant scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students on full-time courses who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, approved course, previous academic attainment and means.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit are eligible payments for the special rate of maintenance grant.  In addition Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant (where paid to recipients of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Domiciliary Care Allowance) and the Domiciliary Care Allowance are classified as an &ldquo;income disregards&rdquo; and these payments are not included in calculating reckonable income.</p>  <p>  The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level.  Students can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials.  The SAF is open to full-time registered students on courses of not less than one year's duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification.</p></reply>

This requires information on the options and supports, as well as ensuring all actors including schools, families, other Government Departments and Agencies work together to ensure the needs of pupils can be reasonably met.</p>  <p>  The interdepartmental Cross-Sectoral Team, which is comprises of representatives of my Department, National Educational Psychological Service, Department of Health, Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the National Council for Special Education and the Health Service Executive works to support and plan for the co-ordinated delivery of services to families of children with special educational needs across the disability sector.  The issue of transitions has been discussed by the Cross Sectoral Working group and is an item on the agenda for its next meeting which is scheduled for September.</p>  <p>  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring that people with disabilities, who are able to, and want to work are supported and enabled to do so.</p>  <p>  My Department, together with the NCSE, SOLAS, Education and Training Boards (ETBs), HSE, Department of Social Protection among others have key roles to play in delivering on various actions to enable achievement of key strategic priorities, including transition from school to further or higher education and adult disability services.</p>  <p>  Good progress has been made across a number of areas.  My Department provides for a continuum of special education provision to be made available for children with special needs, so that regardless of the level of need of the child, educational provision can be made for them.</p>  <p>  In 2017, &euro;1.68 billion - approximately 19% of the Department of Education and Skills budget is being allocated to supporting children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  In general, the funding allocated by the Department provides for mainstream classroom supports, resource and learning support teachers, SNAs, additional special class support, assistive technology and individual supports depending on the various needs of students at different levels of the education cycle.  It also provides funding for school buildings to ensure accommodations for students and teachers at the school and classroom level as well as enhanced capitation levels for students in special schools and classes, specialist transport arrangements, Special Arrangements for State Examinations; ESF Aided Fund for Students with Disabilities at 3rd level; Vocational Training for people with disabilities and in Adult Education &ndash; once off projects for disability in education.</p>  <p>  Preparation and planning are key to a successful transition from school.  In January 2016 the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published transition guidelines for children with special needs.  These wide-ranging and comprehensive guidelines provide advice and tips for parents, students and schools covering the transitions between all stages of education, including the transition to further education or work - Guidelines on Planning for Life after School.</p>  <p>  The NCSE in association with the National Disability Authority (NDA) has also published an information booklet about the full range of post-school education and training options for adults and school leavers with disabilities.  The NCSE booklet contains summary information on all of the main programmes and supports available to students with disabilities.  It also provides convenient links and signposts to where more information and guidance on these programmes can be found.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and Children/Health Service Executive assumes direct responsibility for young adults with special educational needs who are over 18 years.  My Department may allocate funding towards an education component of such provision.</p>  <p>   A key feature of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education (2015-2019) is the inclusion of targets to increase participation in higher education by people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities also plays a key role in helping to build the skill and education levels of people with disabilities.  The Fund, which is managed by the Higher Education Authority on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills, provides supports for full time students with disabilities to help them access and complete courses in our further and higher education institutions.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has a number of strategies and initiatives in place to build links between education providers and employers so as to ensure that education and training for all learners, including people with disabilities, is aligned to the skill requirements of the workplace.  This includes the new National Skills Strategy 2025, which was launched in January 2016.  The strategy provides a framework for skills development that will help drive Ireland's growth both economically and societally over the next decade.</p></reply>

The care needs must also be those beyond which could normally be provided for by alternative supportive approaches or modifications of the classroom environment, teaching approaches and/or assistive technology or specialist equipment.</p>  <p>  A key aspiration for pupils with special educational needs is that they will, on completion of their school-based education, be able to graduate as young independent adults in so far as this is possible.  There is therefore a need to balance the support provided in schools with each pupil&rsquo;s right to acquire personal independence skills.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which is an independent statutory agency, is responsible, through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including SNA support.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports and resources to be allocated to schools to support individual pupils rests with the NCSE.  The NCSE allocates SNA support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie, in order that students who have care needs can access SNA support as and when it is needed.  My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support.  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools, as a school based resource.</p>  <p>  The type of significant care needs that pupils may have can be varied, depending on the nature or level of the disability or sensory impairment that a child may have.  Circular 0030/2014 sets out the primary and secondary care needs for which SNA support is provided.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is currently undertaking a Comprehensive Assessment of the SNA Scheme, in consultation with other Departments and State Agencies, including the National Disability Authority, to identify the most appropriate form of support options to provide better outcomes for students with Special Educational Needs, having regard to the significant amount of State investment in this area.</p>  <p>  In response to a progress report from the NCSE on this Review, I have requested the NCSE to establish a working group, comprising relevant stakeholders, to assist in proposing a better model for providing care supports so as to provide better outcomes for students with special educational needs who have additional care needs.</p>  <p>  This Working Group will commence its work upon its appointment and the work will run in tandem with the completion of the Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme.  It is intended that the reports of the Working group and of the Review will be completed in Spring 2018.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-26a.799.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017072600017#WRP06000"><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that DES Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools and 0014/2017 for post primary schools were published on 7th March 2017.</p>  <p>  These Circulars set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.</p>  <p>  The revised allocation process replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.</p>  <p>  The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p>  <p>  Allocations based on the school profiles were issued to all schools on 7th March.  Details of the special education teaching allocations have also been published on the NCSE website.</p>  <p>  The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children.</p>  <p>  No school, including the school to which the Deputy has referred, will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011.</p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government.  The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular school referred to by the Deputy, under the old allocation model, this school had a Learning Support allocation of 10 hours for the 2016/17 school year, which combined with 8.50 resource teaching hours allocated to the school by the National Council for Special Education, gave a total allocation to the school of 18.50 additional teaching hours for the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  The profiled allocation for the school, including the additional baseline provision, for 2017/18 amounts to 15 hours in total.  However, the school has maintained its existing level of allocation of 18.50 hours which includes a retained amount of 3.50 and a baseline amount of 1.83 hours.  Accordingly, the school has been allocated some 5.33 hours more than its profile indicates.</p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools are provided with a total allocation to meet the needs of all children in the school who have special educational needs.</p>  <p>  Under the new model resources are based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.</p>  <p>  The new allocations to schools will include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including pupils who may receive a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school.</p>  <p>  All allocations to schools include a supplementary provision, which has been referred to as the &lsquo;baseline allocation&rsquo; which is allocated over and above the profiled allocation.</p>  <p>  For students who start school from September 2017, with a specific diagnosis, either in junior infants or transferring from another school, the resources they need will already be in the school under the new model.</p>  <p>  The NCSE published details of an appeals process on the NCSE website: www.ncse.ie whereby schools could appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017/18 allocation.</p>  <p>  Schools who wished to appeal were asked to submit appeals March 31st 2017.</p>  <p>  DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outlined the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.</p>  <p>  In advance of the submission of an appeal, schools were asked to read carefully the DES circulars and in particular the relevant section, which relate to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will advise schools of the outcome of the appeals as soon as possible.  The NCSE has confirmed that the school referred to in this question has not submitted an appeal.</p>  <p>  The model will allow for some additional provision for Developing schools or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior, beyond what would be expected through normal demographic growth, prior to the next review of the model.  The DES is currently developing the criteria in this regard and schools will be notified of the qualifying criteria for this in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The model will also allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or emergency circumstances arising over the course of the model.  The NCSE, through its regional support services, will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may consideration be given to an additional allocation of hours be made to the school.</p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs have also now been published and are available on my Departments website.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants.</p></reply>

It is not intended to cover the full costs of attending college.  The student grant scheme does, however, provide for different levels of maintenance support, depending on means.

The higher non-adjacent rates are intended to provide additional support to those students who may be living away from home.</p>  <p>  Budget 2011 provided for a number of student grant measures which came into effect for the 2011/12 academic year, including the change in the assessment of the qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of grant from 24 kilometres to 45 kilometres. </p>  <p>  The 24km distance criterion was originally set in 1968 and had not been updated in more than 40 years.  Since then, significant improvements have taken place in the road and rail network and it is considered that the revised distance criteria is more consistent with the type of distances that students may legitimately be expected to commute to college.</p>  <p>  The current qualifying distance of 45km for the higher non-adjacent rate of student grant takes into account a reasonable radius within which students may commute on a daily basis. </p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.

Following receipt of that submission, my Department authorised the Board of Management to instruct its Design Team to commence the pre-qualification process for the assessment of suitably qualified contractors to which the project can be tendered.  This authorisation was granted by my Department in order to expedite the tender process for this project by running the pre-qualification in tandem with the finalisation of Stage 2(b). The Design Team has commenced this process and the closing date for the e-tenders advertisement was the 19th June 2017.  The Design Team has informed my Department that it expects to complete its assessment of the pre-qualification submissions in the coming weeks and will then submit its report on the shortlist of contractors to my Department. </p>  <p>  Following examination of the Stage 2(b) Report, it became apparent that the submission was incomplete and some additional items which should have been included in the original submission, were requested by my Department.  A revised submission has been received which is currently under review.  Upon completion of the review of the revised 2(b) submission my Department will then revert to the school with a timeframe to proceed to tender and construction stage.</p></reply>

Annual registrations in the craft trades are predicted to grow to 5,587 over the period to 2020.</p>  <p>  SOLAS, through its Skills and Labour Market and Research Unit (SLMRU) and its Apprenticeship Services Unit, regularly conducts forecasts of apprenticeship requirements.  The SLMRU has developed a comprehensive methodology to generate five-year forecasts of apprentice intake for construction trades.  The forecasts are revised annually and are due to be updated later this year.  The methodology takes account of output forecasts, in money terms, for various segments of the construction industry, the CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) and the relationship between apprentice intake and employment trends in the sectors.</p>  <p>  Further Education and Training providers also deliver a range of specific skills programmes for the construction sector outside of the apprenticeship system.  SOLAS are engaging with the Education and Training Boards to continue to expand provision in identified areas of skills needs.</p></reply>

The process spans the curriculum in schools, whole school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional support for teachers.  It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.</p>  <p>  To support schools, my Department has produced and distributed the Well-Being in Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2015). These guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners, and by current research. They assist schools and the school community in (a) supporting and responding to the mental health and well-being needs of our children and (b) in providing a safe and supportive environment for building life skills and resilience and a strong sense of connectedness to school.  My Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is actively assisting schools and school communities in this regard. </p>  <p>  All primary and post-primary initial teacher education programmes include the study of psychology of education and sociology of education.  All primary initial teacher education programmes include the implementation of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum which is taught at all class levels. The SPHE curriculum provides particular opportunities to foster the personal development, wellbeing, and social and emotional health of the individual child.</p>  <p>  Professional development services are provided by my Department to support teachers in addressing and dealing with mental health issues. At primary level, continuing professional development (CPD) is provided through:</p>  <p>  - NEPS, which provides guidance for schools in managing and responding to critical incidents; and training in the delivery by teachers of programmes, including the Incredible Years programme, which aims to prevent and treat young children's behaviour problems and promote their social, emotional, and academic competence</p>  <p>  - The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) provides professional development support to teachers and schools to develop and promote student health and wellbeing, including mental health, in the context of a positive health promoting school environment.</p>  <p>  - The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Support Service, will support teachers in addressing the needs of pupils with special educational needs, including needs which relate to their mental health. </p>  <p>  - Supports are also provided through the Association of Teachers' Education Centres in Ireland (ATECI) summer courses, the Irish Primary Principals Network (IPPN), the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals (NAPD) and the Centre for School Leadership. </p>  <p>  At post- primary level, the new Framework for Junior Cycle (2015) places a clear emphasis on overall student health and well-being:  The Framework has eight key skills, which are to be embedded in every new Junior Cycle subject and short course, including the key skills of "Managing Myself" and "Staying Well".  </p>  <p>  The Framework includes an area of learning called Wellbeing, encompassing Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE), Physical Education (PE) and Civic Social and Political Education (CSPE) and to support its introduction in post-primary schools in September coming, a comprehensive programme of CPD has been drawn up by my Department's support services. The supports to be delivered during the 2017/18 school year will include whole school CPD on Wellbeing in Junior Cycle, seminars for teachers of SPHE on Mental Health, Gender and Sexual Orientation and Substance Use and seminars for designated liaison persons in schools on Child Protection, Anti Bullying and a Whole School approach to Mental Health. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that CPD for teachers is not compulsory. However, at post-primary level it is intended that all teachers in schools participating in whole school CPD will receive CPD in Wellbeing in 2017/18. It is anticipated that the significant majority of post-primary schools will avail of such CPD.</p>  <p>  A key theme of my Department's 2017 Action Plan for Education is the support of wellbeing initiatives to ensure that mental resilience and personal wellbeing are integral parts of the education and training system. Specifically, the Plan commits to the commencement of the roll-out of the Friends for Life programme and the Incredible Years Classroom Management programme to teachers in all DEIS schools. NEPS will deliver both programmes commencing in the autumn and are currently in the process of recruiting an additional 11 psychologist staff to undertake this work.</p>  <p>  It is planned that during the coming academic year, some 40 Friends programmes will be organised involving some 1,000 primary and post-primary teachers and 50 Incredible Years programmes will be offered to some 1,000 primary school teachers at the commencement of a three year roll-out of the training.</p></reply>

This approach considers the entire school community, as well as focussing on groups and individual young people with identified need.  This approach spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support, pastoral care, guidance counselling and the provision of professional development for teachers.  It also involves accessing other supports such as educational psychology services and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.  Additionally, schools engage in a wide range of sport and cultural activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth. The whole staff shares responsibility for general student wellbeing.</p>  <p>  The Well-being in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013) and Well-being in Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion (2015) provide a framework for schools to present in an integrated way their existing good practice. The Guidelines promote social and emotional learning, and mental health and direct then to new practices, as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The European wide HSE supported Health Promoting School Process (HSP) is also outlined, and the Well-being Guidelines show how the HSP can be introduced to schools to complement existing good practice. The Guidelines outline how schools support young people through early intervention and prevention, modelled on the NEPS Continuum of Support tiered approach.  </p>  <p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the systematic implementation of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the Professional Development Service for Teachers' SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services. </p>  <p>  More recently, my Department's Action Plan for Education 2017 promotes wellbeing as one of its key goals. Other actions, in addition to those outlined above, relating to wellbeing and mental health in the primary school sector include: </p>  <p>  - Developing an integrated programme of support for all schools to implement the Wellbeing Guidelines and an implementation plan for roll-out of this programme to all primary and post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  - Increasing the capacity of NEPS: an enhanced educational psychological service to schools, through the appointment of an additional 10 educational psychologists.  The focus of this additional support will be on extending the delivery of training to teachers in DEIS schools in two specific evidence-informed programmes &ndash; the Incredible Years Teacher Programme and the Friends programmes  &ndash; the Friends programme, when delivered by trained teachers, reduces anxiety and promotes coping, resilience and school-connectedness in children and young people in the primary and post-primary schools, while the Incredible Years Teacher programme strengthens the social and emotional competence of primary school children whose teacher has completed the programme. </p>  <p>  There will be a suite of Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) supports provided to post-primary schools to enable them to implement the new National Council for Curriculum and Assessment's Wellbeing Guidelines for Junior Cycle which are being introduced from this September for first years.  These supports will range from a full day whole staff professional activity event, workshops varying in length from 2 hours to 1 day. The workshops will address the needs of both mainstream and special schools. There will be a dedicated wellbeing section on the JCT website full of resources to assist the implementation of wellbeing within the junior cycle. JCT will liaise closely with National Educational Psychological Service and the Health Service Executive as they develop their involvement in this very sensitive area</p>  <p>  Measures announced by my Department as part of Budget 2016 and 2017 mean that 400 guidance posts, or two thirds of the guidance allocation that was withdrawn in Budget 2012, will be restored to post-primary schools from September 2017.  All of these 400 posts are allocated separately and transparently on the staffing schedule of posts for schools.  The pupil teacher ratio (PTR) will revert to 19:1 with effect from September 2017 with the guidance allocation shown separately on the staffing schedules and will represent 0.4 of the PTR for each school.  There is now an obligation on schools to ensure that the hours are used for guidance activities. Principals may decide to allocate more hours to guidance activities than the amount allocated on the schedule; they cannot decide to allocate fewer. </p>  <p>  While most of the 400 posts restored over the past two years are likely to be allocated to guidance counsellors, schools may decide, in the context of their guidance plans, to allocate some resources to others who may also play a role in delivering guidance in the schools.  However, my Department has made it clear that schools' guidance plans should include specified time allocation for guidance counsellors to be available for one-to-one guidance counselling and time allocation for the role in supporting the organisation and work of the Student Support Team.</p></reply>

The review found that only approx. 60% of supply teachers' time was used to cover sick leave absences. This reflects the unpredictable nature of sick leave absences. </p>  <p>  While there are benefits for schools in having these teachers it is considered more cost effective to use the normal substitution arrangements that apply to all other schools to cover sick leave absences instead of having a cohort of full-time teachers "on call" all the time in these schools to cover sick leave absences that may or may not arise.</p></reply>

The capital expenditure for fee-charging schools in 2016 was &euro;53,551.28.</p>  <p>  Clearly if the parents of 25,282 children in the fee charging sector chose to send their children to the non-fee-paying sector, the state would have to fund those school places.  In this respect, the figures quoted relate to the gross cost of fee charging schools and not the net cost.  Since it is impossible to predict the pattern of behaviour it is not possible to calculate the net saving.  Suffice to say it would be significantly less than the gross figures quoted.</p></reply>

Private providers seeking to engage with QQI are firstly required to establish quality assurance procedures based on guidelines issued by QQI.  The operation of these procedures is monitored by QQI through periodic review.</p>  <p>  Following the establishment of approved quality assurance procedures, providers may then apply to QQI for validation of programmes.  Validation is generally for a period of 5 years.  Validation may be reviewed at any time by QQI and may be withdrawn if the conditions of validation are not being complied with.</p>  <p>  Additionally, all Springboard+ programmes provided by private higher education institutions are subject to validation procedures set and implemented by QQI and are recognised on the NFQ.

These Circulars set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.</p><p>The revised allocation model replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.</p><p>The new model provides one single allocation to schools based on the profile. Schools will be frontloaded with resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils who need such support. </p><p>The NCSE notified all schools of their special education teaching allocations for September 2017 on 7 March 2017.</p><p>The NCSE also published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: www.ncse.ie.  Schools who wished to submit an appeal were asked to do so by 31 March 2017. </p><p>In relation to the particular school referred to by the Deputy, under the old allocation model, this school had a Learning Support allocation of 40 hours for the 2016/17 school year, which combined with 13.60 resource teaching hours allocated to the school by the National Council for Special Education, gave a total allocation to the school of 53.60 additional teaching hours for the 2016/17 school year.</p><p>The profiled allocation for the school, including the additional baseline provision, for 2017/18 amounts to 47.50 hours in total.  However, the school has maintained its existing level of allocation of 53.60 hours which includes a retained amount of 6.10 and a baseline amount of 16.73 hours.  Accordingly, the school has been allocated some 22.83 hours more than its profile indicates. </p><p>Schools could appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017/18 allocation.</p><p>DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.</p><p>In advance of any submission of an appeal, schools were asked to read carefully the DES Circulars and in particular the relevant sections, which relate to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.</p><p>The NCSE is now concluding the appeal process and it is hoped that decisions will issue to schools in the coming days.</p><p>The model will also allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.</p><p>It is acknowledged that there are circumstances which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process put in place by the NCSE in March 2017(NCSE 03/2017) to support the new special education teaching model.  This includes circumstances where the school profile significantly changes following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increase year on year.</p><p>Schools have recently been advised of the qualifying criteria for such allocations.  Schools who qualify for additional allocations on the grounds that they will receive additional developing posts in accordance with the primary and post primary staffing schedules for 2017, will also provisionally receive additional special education teaching allocations, less any retained element contained within their profiled allocation.</p><p>Schools which have qualified for additional allocations on the grounds of developing status will be notified of these allocations.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. </p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs have also now been published and are available on my Departments website.</p><p>The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants.</p></reply>

However, in the Back to School Allowance is the responsibility of my colleague in the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  My Department will arrange for that Department to contact the Deputy directly in relation to this matter.  <table><tr><th>Details</th><th>Estimated Full Year Cost</th></tr><tr><td>Indicative estimate of providing free primary and secondary school books to all pupils across all fully publicly funded schools based on a survey by Barnardos</td><td>&euro;40m</td></tr><tr><td>*Abolishing all fees for third level students both capitation and tuition </td><td>&euro;207m</td></tr><tr><td>Restoring the capitation grant to Primary and Post-Primary schools to pre-2010 levels</td><td>&euro;35m</td></tr><tr><td>**Abolishing student fees for all EU post graduate students</td><td>&euro;71m</td></tr><tr><td>Restoring student grants to pre-2008 levels</td><td>In excess of &euro;100m</td></tr><tr><td>Restoring support for guidance teachers to pre-2008 levels</td><td>&euro;13m</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Providing free primary and secondary school books to all pupils across all fully publicly funded schools</b></p><p>School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents.  Circa. 95% of primary schools and 65% of post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme.  </p><p>My Department supports the operation of book rental schemes through the funding provided under its school books grant scheme.  Under this scheme, my Department provides funding of &euro;16 million annually to primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme.  </p><p>A survey from Barnardos indicates that it would require an additional investment of around &euro;40 million per annum to provide all school children with free school books.  This should not be taken to mean that this organisation does not see the value of school book rental schemes.  It should be noted that the organisation's &euro;40 million estimate is in addition to the Department's existing annual investment under the school books grant scheme.  </p><p>*  <b>Abolishing all fees for third level students both capitation and tuition</b></p><p>Based on the number of students that qualified for free fees funding in the academic year 2014/15 (and were therefore liable to pay the Student Contribution), and taking into account overall expected increases in student numbers, it is estimated that the net cost to my Department of abolishing the Student Contribution for the 2017/18 academic year would be &euro;207m.  This figure takes into account the resulting reduction to my Department's Student Grant Scheme budget.  </p><p>With regard to funding towards tuition fees at undergraduate level, my Department provided funding of &euro;280m in the academic year 2015/16 under the free fees schemes.  </p><p><b>Restoring the capitation grant to pre-2008 levels</b></p><p>The figure provided in the table above is based on the cost associated with restoring capitation rates for Primary and Post-Primary schools in the Free Education Scheme to 2010 levels which are higher than those that were in place in 2008.  </p><p>The process is underway for restoring grant funding that is used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff.  The ancillary grant was increased by &euro;6 in 2016 and &euro;5 in 2017 in order to enable primary schools implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation.  A similar type approach in relation to improvements in grant funding was applied, as appropriate, at post-primary level.  </p><p><b>Restoring student grants to pre-2008 levels.</b></p><p>It is not possible to definitively calculate the cost of the various adjustments that have been made to the student support system since 2008, particularly in light of the demographic changes that have taken place.  </p><p>To put it in context, in 2008/09 there were 57,261 students who benefitted from grant support at a cost of &euro;264m, whereas in 2015/16 there were 80,622 students in receipt of grant support at a cost of &euro;388m.  </p><p>It is estimated, however that it would cost in excess of &euro;100m to reverse all of the adjustments that have been made to the student grant scheme since 2008.  </p><p>**  <b>Abolishing student fees for all EU post graduate students.</b></p><p>The cost to the State associated with the abolition of postgraduate fees is dependent on varying factors associated with type study i.e. full-time or part-time, varying fees associated with different course types and higher fees for international students.  However, based on the fact that the academic year 2015/16, there were 11,975 EU students registered on postgraduate courses, and using the average cost of an EU postgraduate course, the estimated cost to the State of abolishing fees for EU postgraduate students would be &euro;83m.  It should also be noted that under my Department's Student Grant Scheme, funding of &euro;12m was provided for postgraduate tuition fees in 2015/16; taking this into account, the net additional cost to my Department would therefore be in the region of &euro;71m.  </p></reply>

Funding for segregated Traveller provision has been incorporated into overall school and other funding streams in order to provide supports for Traveller pupils in mainstream schools.  </p>  <p>  However, a number of Traveller-specific supports have been retained to assist with the transfer to mainstream provision including additional pupil capitation and additional resource teacher posts to support some 11,000 Traveller pupils in primary and post-primary education.  The current cost of this additional provision is &euro;10 million.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the restoration of previous funding arrangements would necessitate the re-introduction of segregated provision for Travellers.  </p>  <p>   As the Deputy may be aware, DEIS Plan 2017 which I launched earlier this year includes a number of specific actions to improve educational outcomes for Traveller children and young people in the education system.

The Department of Education and Skills invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling:</p><p>-  61% of students to attend mainstream schools</p><p>-  26% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and</p><p>-  13% to attend special schools.</p><p>Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there.  This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.  Enrolment in an ASD special class can be considered for these students where it has been demonstrated that he/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports.  </p><p>Others students with ASD may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.  </p><p>The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.  </p><p>Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that: </p><p>-  S/he has ASD, and that</p><p>-  S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>Special classes for students with ASD are staffed with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level and 6:1.5 at post primary level.  Special Classes or students with Autism also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children.  </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes.  </p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned.

The Department of Education and Skills invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling:</p>  <p>  -  61% of students to attend mainstream schools</p>  <p>  -  26% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and</p>  <p>  -  13% to attend special schools.</p>  <p>  Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there.  This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.  Enrolment in an ASD special class can be considered for these students where it has been demonstrated that he/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports. </p>  <p>  Others students with ASD may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p>  <p>  Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that: </p>  <p>  -  S/he has ASD, and that</p>  <p>  -  S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p>  <p>  Special classes for students with ASD are staffed with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level and 6:1.5 at post primary level.  Special Classes or students with Autism also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned.  The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p>  <p>  Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 100% from 548 in 2011 to 1,152 across the country now, of which 887 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE will establish an additional 145 ASD Special Classes for the 2017/18 school year increasing the number of ASD Special Classes to 1,032.  </p>  <p>  With regard to Kildare in particular there are 942 students with ASD attending schools in the County.  Of these, 520 students attend mainstream schools and are accessing in-school supports including Resource teaching and SNA support. 322 students are attending 59 ASD special classes, including 6 early intervention classes, 41 primary ASD classes and 12 post primary ASD classes. A further 100 students with ASD are placed in 4 special schools.  The number of ASD classes has increased in the area by 24% since the 2013/14 school year.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE intends to open an additional 4 special classes in Kildare for the 2017/18 school year, consisting of 1 Primary ASD special class, 2 Post Primary ASD special classes and 1 Post Primary Moderate GLD special class.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there will be sufficient special class placements available to meet demand in Kildare for the forthcoming school year.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.  </p>  <p>  During the passage of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill in the Select Committee recently, I indicated that I intend, at Report Stage, to include in this Bill a provision that will provide, based on reports and advice from the NCSE, the Minister will have the power to require a school to open a special class or increase the number of special classes in schools identified by the NCSE.

This Budget represents the start of a major reinvestment in education, and the first phase of implementation of the Action Plan for Education, aimed at becoming the best education system in Europe within a decade.  The budget provides for over 2,400 additional teaching posts for our primary and post-primary schools in the coming school year.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2016 provided for an improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools by 1 point, from 1 teacher for every 28 pupils to 1 teacher for every 27 pupils for the 2016/17 school year and it should be noted that the current staffing schedule of 27:1 for primary schools has restored it to the position it was at prior to the fiscal crisis.  The staffing schedule for post primary will be 19:1 for the 2017/18 school year.  The allocation for guidance provision which is equivalent to 0.4:1 in the staffing schedule is being provided separately.  </p>  <p>  The 2017/18 school year will see a significant increase of over 4,800 in teacher numbers in our schools compared to the 2015/16 school year.  </p>  <p>  Each 1 point adjustment to the staffing schedule is estimated to cost in the region of &euro;15m - &euro;18m per annum.  </p>  <p>  It is my intention to make further improvements to class sizes over the life of the Government.  However, I recognise that there are needs across the system which have to be balanced in the decisions made in each Budget.  </p></reply>

The HEA allocates this funding as a block grant to the institutions.  As autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of this funding, along with any funding it receives from private sources, is a matter for the individual institution.  </p>  <p>  Student services and associated activities are an integral part of the whole student experience at third level.  Student services support each individual student achieve his/her intellectual, cultural and social potential while supporting and complementing the formal academic programme.  Student services can fall under a number of headings, particularly &lsquo;Welfare and Guidance&rsquo; which includes counselling services, health promotion, careers service, multi-faith, racial and ethnic cultural support.  </p>  <p>  My Department also provides a range of services for students in HEA funded higher education institutions, including supports provided by Access Offices.  In particular these offices co-ordinate pastoral and academic supports for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Among the supports administered by the access offices, in conjunction with student services is the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities.  </p>  <p>  The Student Assistance Fund </p>  <p>  The Student Assistance Fund is managed by the HEA on behalf of my Department.  This Fund is allocated annually to the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to support students from socio economically disadvantaged backgrounds, whose participation in higher education would otherwise be at risk as a direct result of financial difficulties.  The fund assists students with on-going needs for financial support and students with other circumstances giving rise to short or longer-term financial difficulties, including family responsibilities, bereavement, family difficulties, accidents or health problems.  In all cases, institutions are responsible for targeting the available resources at those students most in need.  </p>  <p>  Fund for Students with Disabilities </p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) aims to ensure that students can participate fully in their academic programmes and are not disadvantaged by reason of a disability.  The total allocated under the FSD in 2015-16 was &euro;10.4m with a total of 10,486 students in further and higher education supported through the fund. 956 students with a mental health condition in higher education were supported by the FSD in 2015/2016.  </p>  <p>  Mental Health Matters - AHEAD</p>  <p>  AHEAD, the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability, is supported through an annual grant from the HEA towards the cost of the activities of the organisation.  AHEAD is an independent non-profit organisation working to promote full access to and participation in further and higher education for students with disabilities and to enhance their employment prospects on graduation.  </p>  <p>  In 2016, AHEAD in partnership with the National Learning Network (NLN), published a report called &lsquo;Mental Health Matters&rsquo;, a study into the experiences of students with mental health difficulties.  The study found that the majority of HEIs have services supporting students with mental health difficulties and some institutions have dedicated services for students.  The report made some key recommendations such as the promotion of mental health awareness to students on their induction, the provision of mental health awareness at institutional level for staff and institutions adopting a whole of campus strategic response to meet the needs of students experiencing mental health difficulties.  Implementation of the recommendations is being progressed by AHEAD and partners and a follow-on conference/seminar is planned for later this year.  </p>  <p>  Increased funding for Higher Education</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, I secured increased Exchequer investment in higher education of &euro;36.5m, with &euro;160 million being invested over the next three years.  This is the first significant reinvestment in higher education since the beginning of the financial crisis.  </p></reply>

This approach considers the entire school community, as well as focussing on groups and individual young people with identified need.  This approach spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support, pastoral care, guidance counselling and the provision of professional development for teachers.  It also involves accessing other supports such as educational psychology services and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.  Additionally, schools engage in a wide range of sport and cultural activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth.  The whole staff shares responsibility for general student wellbeing.  </p>  <p>  The Well-being in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013) provides a framework for schools to present in an integrated way their existing good practice.  The Guidelines promote social and emotional learning, and mental health and direct then to new practices, as appropriate.  </p>  <p>  The European wide HSE supported Health Promoting School Process (HSP) is also outlined, and the Well-being Guidelines show how the HSP can be introduced to schools to complement existing good practice.  The Guidelines outline how schools support young people through early intervention and prevention, modelled on the NEPS Continuum of Support tiered approach.  </p>  <p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the systematic implementation of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process.  Information is also provided on how to access support from the Professional Development Service for Teachers&rsquo; SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services.  </p>  <p>  More recently, my Department&rsquo;s Action Plan for Education 2017 promotes wellbeing as one of its key goals.  Other actions, in addition to those outlined above, relating to wellbeing and mental health in the primary school sector include: </p>  <p>  -  Developing an integrated programme of support for all schools to implement the Wellbeing Guidelines and an implementation plan for roll-out of this programme to all post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  -  Increasing the capacity of NEPS: an enhanced educational psychological service to schools, through the appointment of an additional 10 educational psychologists.  The focus of this additional support will be on extending the delivery of training to teachers in DEIS schools.  </p>  <p>  There will be a suite of Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) supports provided to post-primary schools to enable them to implement the new National Council for Curriculum and Assessment&rsquo;s Wellbeing Guidelines for Junior Cycle which are being introduced from this September for first years.  These supports will range from a full day whole staff professional activity event, workshops varying in length from 2 hours to 1 day.  The workshops will address the needs of both mainstream and special schools.  There will be a dedicated wellbeing section on the JCT website full of resources to assist the implementation of wellbeing within the junior cycle.  JCT will liaise closely with National Educational Psychological Service and the Health Service Executive as they develop their involvement in this very sensitive area.  </p>  <p>  Measures announced by my Department as part of Budget 2016 and 2017 mean that 400 guidance posts, or two thirds of the guidance allocation that was withdrawn in Budget 2012, will be restored to schools from September 2017.  All of these 400 posts are allocated separately and transparently on the staffing schedule of posts for schools.  The pupil teacher ratio (PTR) will revert to 19:1 with effect from September 2017 with the guidance allocation shown separately on the staffing schedules and will represent 0.4 of the PTR for each school.  There is now an obligation on schools to ensure that the hours are used for guidance activities.  Principals may decide to allocate more hours to guidance activities than the amount allocated on the schedule; they cannot decide to allocate fewer. </p>  <p>  While most of the 400 posts restored over the past two years are likely to be allocated to guidance counsellors, schools may decide, in the context of their guidance plans, to allocate some resources to others who may also play a role in delivering guidance in the schools.  However, my Department has made it clear that schools&rsquo; guidance plans should include specified time allocation for guidance counsellors to be available for one-to-one guidance counselling and time allocation for the role in supporting the organisation and work of the Student Support Team.  </p></reply>

Schools will be frontloaded with resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils who need such support.  </p><p>The NCSE notified all schools of their special education teaching allocations for September 2017 on 7th March 2017.  </p><p>The NCSE also published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.  </p><p>Schools who wished to submit an appeal were asked to do so by March 31st 2017.  </p><p>Schools could appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017/18 allocation.  </p><p>DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.  </p><p>In advance of any submission of an appeal, schools were asked to read carefully the DES Circulars and in particular the relevant sections, which relate to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.  </p><p>The NCSE is now concluding the appeal process and it is hoped that decisions will issue to schools in the coming days.  </p><p>The model will also allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.  </p><p>It is acknowledged that there are circumstances which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process put in place by the NCSE in March 2017(NCSE 03/2017) to support the new special education teaching model.  This includes circumstances where the school profile significantly changes following the allocation process e.g., a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increase year on year.  </p><p>Schools have recently been advised of the qualifying criteria for such allocations. Schools who qualify for additional allocations on the grounds that they will receive additional developing posts in accordance with the primary and post primary staffing schedules for 2017, will also provisionally receive additional special education teaching allocations, less any retained element contained within their profiled allocation.  </p><p>Schools which have qualified for additional allocations on the grounds of developing status will  be notified of these allocations.  </p><p>The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school.  </p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs have also now been published and are available on my Department's website.  </p><p>The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.</p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.</p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreements have, to date, restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the proposed pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the starting salary of a new teacher from 1 January 2018 will be &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.</p>  <p>  Further to the this newly recruited teachers benefit from the terms of the Ward circular which reduced the qualifying period for a CID and the removal of the career break and secondment categories of objective grounds which had previously prevented some teachers from gaining CIDs.  In addition to earlier permanency, other measures of benefit to newly recruited teachers include a revised sequence for the filling of posts to enable fixed-term and part-time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more quickly and easier than before.</p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or do not work at all.  It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.</p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the recently concluded draft Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision in relation to new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the Agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.</p></reply>

Therefore the periods which are covered for tuition and payment purposes reflect the school terms and do not include school holidays, bank holidays and weekends.</p>  <p>  For children and students who qualify under the Home Tuition Grant Schemes, sanction is given to approve a grant towards the engagement of a tutor who will provide home tuition for the child/student in question.  Home tutors are engaged by the parents/guardian of the child who is to receive tuition and the tutor has no contractual relationship with the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  In order to facilitate parents, my Department acts solely as payroll agents on behalf of the parents/guardian.  On foot of instructions from the Revenue Commissioners payments under the Home Tuition Grant Scheme are subject to statutory deductions at source.</p>  <p>  Any queries in relation to PAYE and USC should be directed to the Revenue Commissioners.  Queries relating to social welfare supports should be directed to the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  A Payroll Information Note is available on my Department's website which provides information for Home Tutors on the payments process and procedures for the Home Tuition Grant Schemes operated by my Department.</p></reply>

The relationship between teachers and private providers of education is based on a private contract. Issues relating to working conditions are a matter between the two parties and do not come under the remit of my Department.</p>  <p>  There is an extensive range of legislation in Ireland which protects the employment rights of workers, including English language teachers, in relation to employment contracts, payment of wages and related matters.  It is the responsibility of the employer in the first instance to ensure that their employees receive their employment rights.  Where an employee considers that their rights have been breached they may bring a claim under the appropriate legislation to the Workplace Relations Commission.  The Workplace Relations Commission is also responsible for monitoring a range of employment rights through its Inspection Service.</p>  <p>  A core component of the Government's future policy for the English language sector will be the introduction of the International Education Mark (IEM).  It is the intention that the regulations governing the IEM will include a requirement that all obligations concerning national employment legislation are complied with by education and training providers seeking to access the Mark.</p>  <p>  The necessary legislation to facilitate the introduction of the IEM is being progressed by my Department.  This legislation will also provide Quality and Qualifications Ireland, who will manage the IEM, with additional powers to examine the bona fides of providers, including English language providers.</p></reply>

Section 9 of the 2012 Act gives the Board of Caranua the power to determine the criteria by reference to which decisions may be made in respect of applications - this includes the power to apply limits to the moneys that may be made available for an arrangement for the provision of support to a former resident or to pay a grant to a former resident.

The last review meeting was held in Belfast on 14 December 2016.  Unfortunately, as a new Executive has not yet been formed following the Assembly election in March, it has not been possible to convene a Review Meeting since.  The Government is continuing to work with the British Government to support and facilitate the parties in their efforts to reach agreement on formation of a new Executive.  The Government wishes to see this achieved as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the Fresh Start Agreement is continuing to the fullest extent possible in this context, and as an integral part of this, the Government is meeting its commitments as regards infrastructure projects under the Agreement.  In relation to the Narrow Water Bridge, there have been North South discussions at senior official level regarding co-operation on this and other infrastructure projects and exploring financing options for future border infrastructure projects.</p>  <p>  Under the Fresh Start Agreement, it was agreed that a review of the proposed Narrow Water Bridge project would be undertaken with a view to identifying options for its future development for consideration by the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC).</p>  <p>  ​Following on from consultation, involving the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure, with stakeholders concerning options for the Narrow Water Bridge proposal, I understand that an options paper is being prepared for consideration by the North South Ministerial Council at its next Plenary meeting.</p>  <p>  In the absence of a Northern Ireland Executive, and specifically a First and deputy First Minister, the NSMC cannot meet.  However, with the Government continuing to work with the British Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland, I am hopeful that meetings of the NSMC will recommence as soon as possible to enable further important engagement on progressing all-island cooperation in general, and including the options concerning the Narrow Water Bridge.</p></reply>

While no government can be expected to tolerate indefinitely the situation arising as a result of Hamas' withholding of payment for the power supplied, it is the ordinary people of Gaza who are caught in the middle of this dispute, and are suffering the consequences.</p>  <p>  Fortunately the resumption of operation by the Gaza power plant has largely compensated for the reduction in supply from Israel, but this resumption may not be sustained, and in any case only maintains the overall supply at the already wholly inadequate level provided in the first half of this year.</p>  <p>  I raised the problems of Gaza with almost every official interlocutor I met on my recent visit, Israeli and Palestinian leaders and UN agencies, and others.  This included both the electricity issue and the broader restrictions and deteriorating conditions which made Gaza a clear crisis point even before this latest problem.  I urged all sides to see that a radical rethink of their positions was urgently needed, to avert a disaster in both humanitarian and political terms.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of election observers for such missions.  Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).</p><p>The election roster was established in May 2013 for a period of five years, following a review of the previous roster and a public call for applicants.  An independent appraisal and ranking of all 263 eligible applicants was undertaken by two assessors external to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, against the four criteria specifically related to election observation.  These criteria were: experience of election observation; knowledge of human rights and /or governance issues; language skills; and experience of challenging environments.</p><p>Following the independent appraisal process, an election observation panel of 200 members was established in May 2013 for a five-year period, with a reserve panel of 10.  The roster currently stands at 194 members, the reserve panel having been fully utilised.  I am confident that the current roster is well equipped to deal with the requirements of the EU and the OSCE missions.</p><p>During the call for applications for membership of the roster, three late applications were permitted and these applications were subject to the same rigorous appraisal as all others.  On foot of the appraisal process, these applicants were ranked high enough to be included in the roster of 200 members.</p><p>All members of the roster are invited to apply to participate in any mission to which Ireland proposes to deploy observers following a request by the EU or OSCE.  To date, 133 members of the current roster have taken part in missions.  61 members have not yet done so.  A significant factor in this is that the number of applicants for election missions is nearly always higher that the number of available places.  I understand that some 29 members of the current roster have yet to apply to participate in a mission, which represents under 15% of the membership.</p><p>Officials will shortly begin working on the criteria and methodology for the call for applications for the next election observation, and they will consult nationally and internationally.  Officials of the Department are also in regular contact with the OSCE and the EU Focal Points and Ireland actively participates in the European Commission and European External Action Service - led European Observation network, which brings together election observation focal points from all EU Member States, together with Norway, Switzerland and Canada.  Learning from other Focal Points will feature as part of the preparations for the new roster.</p><p>It is anticipated that this preparatory work will be finalised before the end of the year and a public call for new applicants will issue shortly thereafter.  Details will be published on the Irish Aid website (<i>www.irishaid.ie</i>) and existing roster members and those who have expressed an interest in receiving details about the next roster will also be advised.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of election observers for such missions.  Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).</p>  <p>  The Department also maintains a Rapid Response Roster of highly skilled and experienced professionals available to deploy at short notice to humanitarian emergencies anywhere in the world.  The key difference between the conditions for members of the two rosters is that members of the Rapid Response Roster are remunerated.  Members of the Election Roster who are nominated as long or short term observers by the Department do not receive remuneration.  They are paid a daily allowance, as determined by the EU and the OSCE, to cover the cost of food, accommodation and other out-of-pocket expenses, along with a pre-departure grant of &euro;600.  Members of the Rapid Response Roster require a Tax Clearance Certificate, as they are remunerated.  Officials of the Department are in contact with the Revenue Commissioners in relation to any possible need for Tax Clearance Certificates for election observers.</p>  <p>  The pre-departure grant of &euro;600 to cover expenses including vaccinations and transport costs ahead of travel to the country in question, is only paid to members of the roster.  If an election is cancelled or an observer is unable to travel, the Department generally seeks reimbursement of the grant, but does take into account each particular circumstance.  In one case, the grant was paid to an Irish observer who had commenced preparations and incurred mission-related expenditure.  At a late stage, the European Union appointed this observer to the EU Core Managing Team for the election mission.  Given the lateness of the appointment and the fact that pre-departure expenditure had been incurred, the Department did not seek the repayment of the grant.</p></reply>

Protecting the gains of the peace process is a central priority for the Government in dealing with Brexit.  This includes: ensuring that all provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are fully respected and upheld; avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and; maintaining the Common Travel Area.</p>  <p>  A key feature of my role involves representing Ireland at the General Affairs Council (Art. 50), which provides political oversight of the Article 50 negotiations as they proceed, and prepares the work of the European Council (Art. 50), where Ireland is represented by the Taoiseach.  The most recent General Affairs Council (Article 50) was held on Tuesday 20 June, where I and the other EU27 Ministers received a short update from Michel Barnier on the launch of the negotiations with the UK which had taken place the day before.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s key priorities and concerns   are understood by our partners, the Government has undertaken an intensive campaign of engagement with our EU partners and the EU Institutions.  This approach has delivered for Ireland, with our unique issues recognised in key negotiation texts, and I am continuing these efforts.  I have already held bilateral meetings with a number of my EU colleagues since assuming my new role, including with the EU&rsquo;s lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, as well with my Estonian, Luxembourg, French, Slovak, Belgian and Spanish counterparts.  I also welcomed the Finnish Foreign Minister to Ireland earlier this month and my officials are currently finalising the details for further engagements in the autumn.</p>  <p>  In these meetings, I have laid particular emphasis on Ireland&rsquo;s objective of protecting the gains of the peace process and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  I have strongly emphasised the need for an imaginative and flexible political solution.</p>  <p>  I have also stressed the importance of ensuring that the positive momentum from the early rounds of EU-UK negotiations is maintained so that progress can be made as quickly as possible on the many complex issues facing the negotiators.  It is important to make sufficient progress on the exit issues, including citizens&rsquo; rights, the financial settlement and the Irish specific issues, in phase one of the negotiations so that parallel discussions can begin in phase two on the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK, including on trade, as well as on effective transitional arrangements.</p>  <p>  Engagement with the UK, in particular on Irish-specific issues, is also important.  In this regard, I met the UK&rsquo;s Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, David Davis, in London on 6 July and more recently, I met the UK&rsquo;s Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson in the margins of the Foreign Affairs Council on 17 July.  Given the unique situation of Northern Ireland in the Brexit context, Brexit issues have of course featured in discussions with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire and with as well as the main political parties in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

Ireland expressed particular concerns about the Kafala system of sponsorship, and encouraged Qatar to undertake a thorough review of the regulatory regime for migrant workers, with the aim of bringing it into line with international human rights and labour standards.  In addition, Ireland recommended on this occasion that Qatar abolish the &lsquo;exit visa&rsquo; system for migrant workers.  More recently, Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador to Qatar raised these issues directly with the Foreign Ministry of Qatar.</p>  <p>  I urge the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia to cooperate with the UN and the International Labour Organisation, and to implement the relevant recommendations in order to improve the situation of migrant workers and their families in their respective countries.</p>  <p>  I am not aware that difficulties faced by migrant workers under the Kafala system are linked to the ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar.  However, the developing situation between Qatar and its neighbours remains a matter of concern, and Ireland will continue to monitor the situation, including its potential to impact on citizens, commerce and regional stability.  I strongly encourage mediation to resolve the crisis in Qatar, and hope for a swift resolution.</p></reply>

The past months have seen almost daily mass protests and violence in Venezuela, resulting in dozens of deaths in clashes between security forces and opposition demonstrators.  The reported human rights violations, excessive use of force, and mass detentions are unacceptable.  I condemn unreservedly any act of intimidation or violence perpetrated against those seeking to defend or exercise their rights, whether in Venezuela or elsewhere.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s view is that the establishment of a clear electoral calendar, the reopening of dialogue, and the full restoration of the country&rsquo;s democratic institutions will be critical to achieving a settlement to the crisis.  This was made clear when the situation in Venezuela was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in May 2017.  Ireland and other EU member states used this opportunity to condemn the use of force in Venezuela and urge the Government and opposition to seek peaceful and democratic solutions through dialogue.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Constituent Assembly, I share the view expressed by Federica Mogherini, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, in her press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council last week.  The convening of a Constituent Assembly risks further polarising Venezuela and increasing confrontation in the country.  The focus of all political actors should instead be on finding ways to create the conditions to resume efforts towards a peaceful negotiated solution.</p>  <p>  While Ireland does not have diplomatic representation in Venezuela, officials at my Department and at our Embassy in Mexico, which has responsibility for Venezuela, will continue to monitor the situation closely.  Ireland will continue to work with EU partners in trying to urge a peaceful, negotiated settlement to the crisis.</p></reply>

While recorded ceasefire violations have decreased in recent weeks, shelling continues with both sides ignoring calls to pull back their heavy weapons from the contact line.</p>  <p>  As a result of the ongoing fighting, very little progress has been made in 2017 on implementing the Minsk peace deal.</p>  <p>  International efforts to end the conflict are continuing.  The OSCE Trilateral Contact Group, which comprises representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the separatists, met most recently on 19 July in Minsk to discuss confidence building measures, including exchange of prisoners and disengagement from the contact line.</p>  <p>  The Normandy Format countries (France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine) are also continuing talks to overcome the current impasse.  On Monday, Presidents Macron, Merkel, Putin and Poroshenko held a conference call and pledged to re-double efforts to improve the security situation on the ground and move forward on implementing key elements of the Minsk peace deal.</p>  <p>  I condemn the recent statement by the leader of the so-called Donetsk People&rsquo;s Republic regarding the supposed creation of a new entity named &ldquo;Malorossiya&rdquo;.  I regard the statement as provocative rhetoric which risks undermining the ongoing efforts by the OSCE and the Normandy format to reach a peaceful resolution of the conflict.</p>  <p>  The declaration is the latest in a series of negative developments including Russia&rsquo;s recognition of travel documents illegally issued by the separatists, the adoption of the Russian rouble in separatist-held areas, and expropriation of Ukrainian-owned companies in the Donbas region, all of which run counter to the Minsk agreements.</p></reply>

However, those efforts were not able to restore momentum to the peace process, which remains stalled.</p>  <p>  There is no clear view at present in the European Union on the best way to try and encourage a resumption of talks.  I look forward to taking part in those discussions, but Ireland in the meantime will continue to urge the EU to take action in response to Israeli actions on the ground which are making those negotiations ever more difficult.  There is some expectation that the US administration will initiate new efforts in early autumn to negotiate an agreement.  If this goes ahead, the EU will have to be ready to respond appropriately and support efforts to deliver a sustainable two-state solution.</p>  <p>  During my recent visit to the region I discussed the prospects for restarting talks with Israeli, Palestinian and US and other international representatives.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Gaza electricity supply, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question 388 today.</p></reply>

The EU Negotiation Guidelines and negotiating directives provide for the recognition of existing agreements and arrangements between Ireland and the UK, such as the Common Travel Area, which are in conformity with EU law. </p>  <p>  The UK Government notification letter which formally triggered Article 50 placed a strong emphasis on the &ldquo;unique relationship&rdquo; between these two islands.  The letter confirmed that the UK Government wishes to avoid a return to a hard border, to maintain the Common Travel Area, and to uphold the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  As agreed, the Irish-specific issues were discussed as part of the second round of negotiations between the EU and the UK which took place last week.  This included an exchange on the Common Travel Area.  The discussion centred on assessing the extent of common understanding on the issues, with agreement to do further work ahead of the next round of talks.  I am satisfied with the direction of the discussions.  My officials continue to be in good and close contact with the EU Task Force.</p>  <p>As part of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to ensure that the issues unique to Ireland are prioritised in the Brexit negotiations, I have held bilateral meetings with a number of my EU colleagues since assuming my new role, including with the EU&rsquo;s lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, as well with my Estonian, Luxembourg, French, Slovak, Belgian and Spanish counterparts.  I also welcomed the Finnish Foreign Minister to Ireland earlier this month and my officials are currently finalising the details for further engagements in the autumn.  I have met with the UK&rsquo;s Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, David Davis, in London on 6 July.  I have also held a bilateral with the UK&rsquo;s Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson in the margins of the Foreign Affairs Council on 17 July.  </p>  <p>  With my colleagues across Government, I will continue to work to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in these negotiations &ndash; minimising the impact on our trade and economy, protecting the peace process, maintaining the CTA and its associated rights, and securing the future of the EU &ndash; are delivered.</p></reply>

At this meeting, Michel Barnier, the EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator, informed Ministers of the outcome of the first round of the negotiations with the UK on its withdrawal from the EU.</p><p>I also met with Mr Barnier for a bilateral exchange on Brexit and on the EU&rsquo;s position on the issues specific Ireland as set out in the European Council Guidelines of 29 April and the negotiating Directives of 22 May.  I thanked Mr Barnier for his recent visit to Ireland, which included travelling to the border region, and for his continuing support and understanding.</p><p>We had a very positive and constructive discussion which clearly confirmed that addressing issues unique to Ireland will be a key EU priority in the negotiations.  I reiterated the Government&rsquo;s position in relation to protecting the gains of the peace process and ensuring that all provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are fully respected and upheld.  In particular, I emphasised the importance of the European Council&rsquo;s recognition that &ldquo;in view of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, flexible and imaginative solutions will be required, including with the aim of avoiding a hard border, while respecting the integrity of the Union legal order.&rdquo; </p><p>During our discussion, I expressed my support for the handling of Irish issues as set out in the Terms of Reference agreed between the EU and the UK on 19 June whereby the issues unique to Ireland will be the subject of a dialogue at the level of the two most senior members of the respective negotiating teams.  This again underlines the urgency and importance with which Irish issues are being addressed.  I also underlined my willingness and that of my officials to continue constructive and regular engagement with Mr. Barnier and his team at the European Commission as these complex negotiations progress.</p><p>As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is determined to ensure that all aspects of the Agreement are fully respected through the process of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union, and thereafter.  Our priority is to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement and the overall integrity of the settlement is not in any way disturbed by the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union.</p><p>As a result of the intensive political and diplomatic engagement by the Government over the last year and more, all of our EU partners and the EU institutions are fully aware and supportive of the importance of respecting the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and of supporting and protecting the achievements, benefits and commitments of the peace process.  This is expressly reflected in the European Council&rsquo;s Guidelines and the Negotiating Directives to the Commission for the EU-UK negotiations. </p><p>Protecting the gains of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts was reaffirmed as a key priority for both sides in the negotiations, by Michel Barnier, on behalf of the European Commission, and by David Davis, on behalf of the British Government, on the conclusion of the second round of the EU-UK negotiations on 20 July.  Constructive engagement and a strong political willingness on all sides, will remain essential to achieving this shared objective through the withdrawal agreement.</p><p>The Government will continue to work very closely with Michel Barnier and his team at the European Commission, to ensure that sufficient progress is made on the Peace Process and the other Irish specific issues in phase one of the negotiations. </p><p>Together with my colleagues across Government, I will continue to work to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in these negotiations &ndash; including in relation to the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement &ndash; are delivered  <font color="#FF0000">.</font></p></reply>

A failure to reach such an agreement, resulting in a disorderly withdrawal, would, as I believe is now almost universally accepted, be hugely damaging for the UK and for the EU, most particularly Ireland. </p>  <p>  It is therefore incumbent on all sides to act responsibly and to approach these negotiations in a constructive, positive and ambitious frame of mind, with a willingness to compromise. </p>  <p>  My focus is on working with our EU partners and the EU institutions to ensure that the negotiations proceed in a positive manner, with a view to making sufficient progress on the withdrawal issues so that we can move on to discussing in parallel the future EU-UK relationship, including as regards trade.  The need for effective transitional arrangements is also now very broadly understood. </p>  <p>  That said, the negotiations will be complex and difficult.

While some good progress was made last week, including clarification from both sides on the areas of agreement and divergence in regard to citizens&rsquo; rights, it is clear that many difficult and complex issues remain, above all in regard to the financial settlement.  These issues must be addressed in a constructive spirit as the negotiations progress if the European Council is to be able in October to judge that sufficient progress has been made to allow for the opening of parallel discussions on the framework for future relations.</p>  <p>  Michel Barnier, the Chief Negotiator for the EU27, and his team are well prepared for these negotiations, based on the negotiating guidelines and directives agreed in the spring and the extensive and ongoing consultations they are holding with all member States.  My officials and I have been working very closely with Mr Barnier and his team to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s positions were fully reflected in this round and we will continue to engage in the coming weeks ahead.</p>  <p>  On the Irish specific issues, I am satisfied with the direction of the discussions, which were held between the coordinators of the EU Task Force and UK Officials on 18 July, as agreed.  The specific topics covered were those previously agreed for the agenda going into this round - maintaining the Common Travel Area and protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  The discussion centred on assessing the extent of common understanding on the two sets of issues, with both sides agreeing to do further work ahead of the next round of talks. </p>  <p>  While the border and related issues were not the subject of detailed discussions in this round&rsquo;s exchange, the focus in this round on protecting the gains of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts is of course directly relevant to the crucial objective of avoiding a hard border.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade administers a roster of election observers so that Ireland can be represented at an appropriate level in international election observation missions organised, in the main, by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  The current roster was established in May 2013 for a period of five years following a review of the previous roster and a public call for applicants.</p><p>The number of observers deployed on missions varies from year to year, depending on the number of elections, the interest in participating, and the number of Irish nominees selected for EU missions.  All Irish nominations for OSCE missions are normally selected.  In 2015, for instance, 46 observers were deployed on 15 missions.  In 2016, 68 were deployed on 16 missions.  To date in 2017, 18 have been deployed on 6 missions.  Given the pattern of elections for the rest of the year, it is unlikely that the total number deployed in 2017 will be as high as in 2016.</p><p>The roster is administered by the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Irish Focal Points are an Assistant Principal and an Executive Officer who are in regular contact with the OSCE and EU election Focal Points and also participate in the European Observation network, which brings together election observation Focal Points from all EU Member States, Norway, Switzerland and Canada.  The network facilities the exchange of information on all aspects of election rosters and missions. </p><p>Officials will shortly begin working on the details relating to the criteria and methodology in respect of the call for applications for the new election observation roster.  They will consult nationally and internationally, including with other election Focal Points.  It is anticipated that this work will be finalised before the end of the year and a public call for new applicants will issue shortly thereafter.  Details will be published on the Irish Aid website (<i>www.irishaid.ie</i>) and existing roster members and a wide range of people who have expressed an interest in receiving details about the next roster will also be advised.  </p></reply>

However, from the information provided by the Deputy, it is likely that this case concerns the protection of minors arriving at our borders and in particular, unaccompanied minors.  An Immigration Officer may seek to establish that there are no child protection issues arising where a child under 18 years presents for entry to the State at the border.  For this purpose, an immigration officer may raise a number of queries with the minor in question to establish his or her circumstances.  This may include requesting any documentation that might assist in the matter. </p>  <p>  These routine enquiries are in place to protect potentially vulnerable children and those who may potentially be trafficked into the State.  Any enquiries should be undertaken in a manner that is friendly and fully respects the dignity of the person concerned.

No. 12 of 2016) commenced the bulk of the Act with effect from 18 January 2016.  That Commencement Order brought provisions of Parts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 13 of the Act into operation.</p>  <p>  Part 10 of the Act, which amended the Passports Act 2008, was commenced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 1 July 2015.</p>  <p>  Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provide for parentage through donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR).  The issue of the recognition of parentage for same-sex couples and their children is dealt with under Part 2 of the Act.  The Minister for Health has responsibility for Parts 2 and 3 of the Act.  It was indicated during the passage of the Children and Family Relationships Bill 2015 through the D&aacute;il and the Seanad that an appropriate transition period for these Parts would be required in order to carry out significant preparatory work to facilitate a seamless transition to the new regulatory framework laid out in the Act. Detailed work on Parts 2 and 3 is underway and it is intended that these will be commenced later this year. </p>  <p>  Other provisions of the Act which relate to DAHR have not yet been commenced as they are linked to Parts 2 and 3.  The commencement of the provisions of the Act which are related to Parts 2 and 3 will be co-ordinated with the commencement of those Parts.</p>  <p>  Part 9 of the Act provides for a number of amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004.  No provision of Part 9 has yet been commenced.  Some sections cannot be commenced until Parts 2 and 3 are brought into operation.  Other sections are dependent on provisions of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 being commenced and my Department is liaising with the Department of Social Protection in relation to scheduling the commencement of these sections. </p>  <p>  Part 11 of the Act in relation to adoption has not been commenced. Other provisions of the Act that are linked to Part 11 have also not been commenced.  Adoption policy is the responsibility of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, which was recently signed into law, provides for the repeal of Part 11 of the 2015 Act.  The provisions in Part 11 allowing for cohabiting couples and civil partners to adopt have been included in the 2017 Act.</p></reply>

An intensive process of checking and verification, in conjunction with the courts, is ongoing in this regard.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as of 19 July 2017, 9,830 letters have been issued by registered post to affected members of the public.  In some cases it has been necessary to print these letters for a second time for hand delivery in order to ensure receipt and this has occurred in 3,888 cases so far, while in some cases the proceedings in question predate the Criminal Justice Interoperability Project with the checking process therefore being undertaken manually.

It has been the subject of correspondence with successive Ministers for Justice going back over a considerable period of time, including legal correspondence.  It has also been the subject of many Questions over that period.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the incident in question was the subject of a thorough investigation at the time.  The Deputy will appreciate, of course, that any decisions in respect of prosecutions are a matter solely for the Director of Public Prosecutions, who acts independently in accordance with the law.  Complaints were made in the past by the person to whom the Deputy refers to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board which investigated the matters raised and found no evidence of an offence or breach of discipline on the part of the Garda members concerned.</p>  <p>  This case was among those reviewed more recently as part of the Independent Review Mechanism established by the Government in May 2014 to consider certain complaints of Garda misconduct referred to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality.  An independent panel consisting of two senior counsel and five junior counsel was established for that purpose.  To ensure that the independence of the review process was preserved retired High Court Judge, Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy, oversaw the preparation of summaries and recommendations in the notification letters of the outcome of the process.  His role was to independently vouch for the fact that the summaries of conclusions and the reasoning behind them were a fair reflection of the advice which has been made available to my Department by the Panel. </p>  <p>  It was open to the independent counsel of the Independent Review Mechanism to make any recommendation that they saw fit.  Having examined this particular case the recommendation was that there was no further action to be taken by me.  I understand that some matters which the Deputy raises were a part of that examination.  The independent counsel's recommendation was accepted and the reasons for this conclusion were communicated to the person referred to by the Deputy in November 2015.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate also that in respect of the data protection issue that he has raised, this would be a matter for the Data Protection Commissioner who is independent in the performance of her functions in accordance with Data Protection Acts. </p></reply>

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 2,400 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next three years in addition to the 2,000 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.</p><p>The workforce plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that a further four hundred are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  In addition to this, a further 800 Garda trainees are expected to attest in 2018.</p><p>I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to ensuring funding is available to allow sufficient recruitment into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2018 and the coming years so that the planned overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is achieved. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation. </p><p>For the Deputy's information, I have set out in the following table the number of Garda intakes and attestations since the College reopened, as provided by the Commissioner:</p><p><b>Intake of Garda Trainees and Attested Garda Trainees - 2014 - 2017</b><table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>Month</b></th><th><b>Intake</b></th><th><b>Attestation</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>2014</b></td><td>September</td><td>100</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>December</td><td>100</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><b>2015</b></td><td>February</td><td>101</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>April</td><td>-</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>July</td><td>-</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>August</td><td>100</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>September</td><td>-</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>October</td><td>75</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>November</td><td>75</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><b>2016</b></td><td>March</td><td>-</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>April</td><td>150</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>June</td><td>151</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>July</td><td>-</td><td>146</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>September</td><td>152</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>November</td><td>203</td><td>148</td></tr><tr><td><b>2017</b></td><td>February</td><td>197</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>April</td><td>-</td><td>142</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>May</td><td>210</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>July</td><td>-</td><td>198</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><b> </b></td><td><b>1614</b></td><td><b>1179</b></td></tr></table></p></reply>

It is Ireland's statutory regulator for charitable organisations and is an independent regulatory agency under the aegis of my Department.  Its mission is to regulate the charity sector in the public interest to ensure compliance with the law and to support best practice in the governance, management and administration of charities.</p>  <p>  Part 6 of the Charities Act 2009 provided for the dissolution of the former Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland and the transfer of the functions of the Commissioners to the Regulator.  This included the Commissioners' role regarding the Common Investment Fund which had been established by the Commissioners in 1985 for the management of assets which had been entrusted to them for charitable purposes pursuant to Section 31 of the Charities Act 1961.  It should be pointed out that in many cases the assets concerned would have been donated or bequeathed in trust by individuals for charitable purposes and were invested in the Fund on that basis.  However, it might be noted that in a majority of cases assets contained in the Fund would not have been invested by individual charitable organisations.  Rather the assets would have been entrusted to the Commissioners to be managed for the benefit of charitable organisations.  I should point out that the functions relating to the Common Investment Fund are a matter for the Charities Regulator and under Section 14(3) of the Charities Act 2009, the Regulator is independent in the performance of its functions.  Accordingly, I as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in relation to the matter.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Charities Regulator that it does not have information available as to whether or not any charitable organisations which are funded by the Health Service Executive under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004 hold, or benefit from, investments in the Common Investment Fund.  The Regulator has also advised me that no new investor has been admitted to the Common Investment Fund since June 2012.  I understand that the Authority has instigated a strategic review of the Common Investment Fund which includes a long term sustainability policy, with a responsible investment focus indicative of best practice for responsible investment globally.  In the interim, the Authority took a decision on 20 June 2017 to divest the Common Investment Fund of tobacco-related stocks.  As of 22 June 2017, no tobacco-related stocks were held in the Fund.</p></reply>

These funds are not public funds and are held on behalf of persons who are under the protection of the courts and they are invested under the direction of the court.  The main primary and subordinate legislation governing the receipt, management and investment of court-controlled funds is as follows:</p>  <p>  - Court Officers Act 1926</p>  <p>  - The Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act 1958 and the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Orders made thereunder</p>  <p>  - The Rules of the Superior Courts</p>  <p>  - The Rules of the Circuit Court</p>  <p>  - The Rules of the District Court</p>  <p>  An Investment Committee was set up in 2002 to oversee the implementation of investment strategies.  It comprises members of the Judiciary, a County Registrar, Court Officers, Court Service Officials and independent external members.  The Committee is chaired by the President of the High Court.  Its role is advisory and its main function is to devise investment policy for the investment of Court funds based on advice from our independent investment advisors, to oversee the implementation of investment strategies, and to ensure compliance with best practice in the management of Court funds.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has informed me that the total value of Court Funds as of 30 September 2016 was &euro;1,675 million and there is a very small exposure to tobacco related equities.  The Courts Service has in place a passive investment strategy, which for equities tracks the FTSE All World Developed Index.  This index, based on latest available data, has about 1.89% exposure to tobacco stocks.  Based on current valuations this represents &euro;8.7 million, or approx 0.5% of the total value of court funds. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that it consulted with their fund managers and that it may not be possible to exclude tobacco stocks from the current fund or index, as there are other investors involved whose agreement would be required to change the investment strategy.  The Investment Committee considered this matter earlier this year and was advised it would be expected that any solution would likely result in higher fund management fees for beneficiaries and possibly require a full EU open procurement process to be undertaken.  The latter could take between 12 and 18 months to complete.</p>  <p>  This matter has been brought to the attention of the Courts Service which continues to review the position as part of the remit of the Investment Committee and I will also ensure that the Minister for Health is aware of the issues.  The Deputy will appreciate that the funds are operated independently of my Department in the best interests of the beneficiaries, and my Department has no role in managing or directing investments. </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  Furthermore when allocations are taking place comprehensive consultation is carried out with local management during which all factors are taken into consideration.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p><p>I have been informed that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Tipperary Division on the 30 June 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 368 with 18 Garda Reserves and 38 Civilians.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, 36 of whom have been assigned to the Tipperary Division.  I am also informed that a further 400 Garda recruits are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Tipperary Division in the coming years.</p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the following table, as provided by the Commissioner, the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Tipperary Division by station as of 30 June 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available:<table><tr><th><b> DISTRICT</b></th><th><b> DIVISION</b></th><th><b>TOTAL </b></th></tr><tr><td>CAHIR</td><td>ARDFINNAN           </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYPOREEN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CAHIR</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASHEL</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLOGHEEN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>  TOTAL</b></td><td><b>68</b></td></tr><tr><td>CLONMEL</td><td>CARRICK-ON-SUIR</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLONMEL</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>FETHARD</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILSHEELAN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MULLINAHONE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b> TOTAL</b></td><td><b>72</b></td></tr><tr><td>NENAGH</td><td>BORRISOKANE</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLOUGHJORDAN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LORRHA</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MONEYGALL           </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NENAGH</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NEWPORT</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PORTROE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROSCREA</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>  TOTAL</b></td><td><b>83</b></td></tr><tr><td>THURLES</td><td>BALLINGARRY SOUTH</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BORRISOLEIGH</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>HOLYCROSS           </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILLENAULE</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TEMPLEMORE</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TEMPLETUOHY</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>THURLES</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b> TOTAL</b></td><td><b>106</b></td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY TOWN</td><td>BANSHA</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CAPPAWHITE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GOLDEN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TIPPERARY TOWN</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b> TOTAL</b></td><td><b>39</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>TIPPERARY TOTAL</b></td><td><b> </b></td><td><b>368</b></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Once these processes are completed the application is submitted to me for a decision, which is made in my absolute discretion under the Act by assessing the entirety of the information available to me.  Applicants are then informed of my decision in writing.  Successful applicants are advised by letter of my intention to grant citizenship and they are requested to submit the prescribed fee and any other relevant documents.  On receipt of the fee and requested documentation the case is advanced and in due course the person is invited to attend a citizenship ceremony at which they are required to make a declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State and receive their certificate of naturalisation.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the Citizenship Division is conducting an ongoing review of outstanding cases with a view to substantially reducing the number of applications which await decision, particularly in cases where the applicant has not been engaging with the office, and that they also continue to monitor their customer services based on feedback they have received from applicants and are happy to introduce improvements where this is possible.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  All applications are examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, such as good character and lawful residence and enquiries are made, as appropriate, to establish if the applicant meets the requirements for the granting of naturalisation.  While most straightforward cases are generally processed within six months, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases may take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks may take a considerable period of time.</p>  <p>  Cases where delays in processing can arise are generally due to further documentation being required from the applicant and/or payment of the required certificate fee is awaited, or the applicant has not been engaging with the office.  In some instances delays can arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example where additional information comes to light which requires further investigation.  In other instances the applicant may request that a hold be put on their application, for example where they may have returned to their country of origin for a prolonged period, to facilitate them in making arrangements to return to reside in the State, or where they have difficulty in obtaining satisfactory evidence of their identity or nationality.</p></reply>

It is evident, from the jurisprudence developing on the application of s.115A, that a number of people are now in PIA arrangements which would formally have been subject to final rejection by the creditors.</p><p>The jurisprudence in this area also has a wider importance, as it clarifies the range of statutory solutions available to borrowers in mortgage arrears on their home, significantly developing the legal framework within which both informal solutions, and statutory solutions, are worked out and negotiated in the future.</p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p><p>The Commissioner has advised that all Garda&iacute;, not simply designated Community Garda&iacute;, have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises and, in that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that the Garda R and J Districts form part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Division and as of the 30 June 2017, there were 656 Garda&iacute; attached to the DMR North Division.  There are also 49 Garda Reserves and 38 civilians attached to the DMR North Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 1,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 90 of whom have been assigned to the DMR North Division.  I am also informed that another 400 trainee Garda&iacute; are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; including Community Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division in the coming years.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p><p>For ease of reference, I have provided below the detailed information requested in relation to the number of Community Garda&iacute; assigned to the Garda R and J Districts in 2015 to 2016, as supplied by the Commissioner.  I have requested the information sought by the Deputy from the Garda Commissioner in relation to 2017 and I will write to the Deputy on receipt of same.<table><tr><th colspan="5">Community Garda 31/12/2015</th></tr><tr><td>District</td><td>Station</td><td>Sergeant</td><td>Garda</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>R District</td><td>Coolock</td><td>2</td><td>14</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Malahide</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Swords</td><td>0</td><td>9</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>2</td><td>28</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>J District</td><td>Raheny</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Clontarf</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Howth</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>1</td><td>14</td><td>15</td></tr></table><table><tr><th colspan="5">Community Garda 31/12/2016</th></tr><tr><td>District</td><td>Station</td><td>Sergeant</td><td>Garda</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>R District</td><td>Coolock</td><td>2</td><td>12</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Malahide</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Swords</td><td>1</td><td>9</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>3</td><td>25</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>J District</td><td>Raheny</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Clontarf</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Howth</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>1</td><td>12</td><td>13</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These programmes can offer purposeful activity to those in custody while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead law abiding lives on release.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all people in custody are eligible to use the services.</p><p>The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2016 - 2018.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning through Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes.</p><p>As well as seeking to draw on best practice in adult and further education in the community, there has been a lot of curriculum development over the years that is specific to prison circumstances, such as courses on addiction, health issues and offending behaviour.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole time teacher equivalents to the Prison Service through the Education and Training Boards (ETB).  Education in prisons is delivered in partnership between the ETBs and the Irish Prison Service with a focus on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and which facilitates lifelong learning.  The partnership endeavours to meet the needs of students through helping them cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release.  A broad and flexible curriculum is provided which ranges from basic literacy classes and peer led tutoring to Open University.  There is an increasing focus on QQI accreditation as the modular structure best meets the needs of students in prison.  On some occasions, people in custody may have to wait for a place to become available on an educational programme.</p><p>Specifically in relation to Wheatfield Place of Detention, I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that Wheatfield School was closed on the following days in May and June due to officer shortages: Friday 12th May, Friday 26th May, Thursday 29th June and Friday 30th June.

The Incentivised Regimes Programme provides for differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour.  The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment.</p>  <p>  There are three levels of privilege - basic, standard and enhanced, with different criteria and privileges associated with each level of regime.  The list of privileges additional to core privileges varies between prisons, and within different areas of a prison, depending on the operational and infrastructure requirements of each prison.  Experience in other jurisdictions has shown that a tiered incentivised regime structure is a hugely valuable addition to prisons in the context of maintaining good order, and in motivating prisoners to partake in constructive activities.  Since the introduction of the Incentivised Regimes Programme, the Irish Prison Service has witnessed a considerable reduction in assaults in prisons.  Incentivised Regimes is part of a multi-faceted approach to improving outcomes for prisoners by promoting the benefits of active participation in their own rehabilitation and behavioural reform.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service is committed to working to ensure the continuing integrity of the Incentivised Regimes Policy and is currently finalising arrangements for the conducting of a review.</p></reply>

At a meeting of the Firearms Consultative Panel (chaired by my Department) held on April 5th 2016, shooting groups stated that illegal shooting at night is a serious safety issue which needed to be addressed.  As a result a working group on night time shooting chaired by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) with membership from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other shooting interest groups held a number of meetings resulting in a draft report prepared by the NPWS.  The proposals in the draft report do not contain a legal ban on night time shooting but rather are intended to act as a voluntary code of best practice guidance for shooters.  I understand, during discussions by the working group, that many issues arose for consideration in what is a complex and challenging area.</p>  <p>  That draft report was submitted to the Firearms Consultative Panel for consideration on April 20th 2017.  While the draft report received considerable support, certain concerns were raised.  As a result members of the Firearms Consultative Panel were invited to make submissions by June 1st which will be considered by the NPWS chair of the working group on night time shooting, in conjunction with members of the Working Group.  A full meeting of the Firearms Consultative Panel, chaired by my Department, will subsequently consider the matter.</p></reply>

At its meeting on 13 June 2017, the Government noted the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s interim Report which analysed population and crime trends and, taking account of the availability of stations for reuse, makes a number of recommendations including that Stepaside Station in Co. Dublin be reopened on a pilot basis.</p>  <p>  The Report also indicates that the Commissioner is likely, subject to further analysis, to recommend the reopening of Leighlinbridge, Co. Carlow and Donard, Co. Wicklow in her final report.  If a second station is to be reopened in Dublin, the Commissioner has indicated that, subject to further analysis, the former station at Rush, Co. Dublin will be recommended for reopening.</p>  <p>  The Government has, accordingly, agreed in principle to the reopening of Stepaside Garda Station on a pilot basis as soon as any necessary preparatory works have been completed.  Following any decision to reopen the former stations, the Garda authorities will work closely with the Office of Public Works in relation to any necessary preparatory works required to progress the reopenings.</p>  <p>  The final report of the Commissioner in relation to Rush, Leighlinbridge and Donard stations is expected to be received in the near future and it will be brought to Government thereafter.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-26a.1355.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017072600027#WRZ02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 471 to 487, inclusive, together.</p><p>The Disclosures Tribunal was appointed following the passing of Resolutions by this House and Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 16 February 2017.  Those resolutions require the Tribunal to report to the Clerk of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with its findings and recommendations.  Therefore, I do not propose to say or do anything which could be interpreted as impinging on its independence.</p><p>As the Deputy will also be aware it is the Garda Commissioner who has statutory responsibility  to carry on and manage and control generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, the putting in place of internal structures to service the Tribunal is a matter for the Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. The question of Government approval does not arise.  Similarly, the selection of personnel to support those structures is a matter for the Commissioner.  I do not believe that it would be proper for me as Minister to prescribe the approach which is taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the Tribunal.  Indeed, I would be open to criticism if I were to seek to influence how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fulfil their duties to the Tribunal.  </p><p>As previously advised in reply to Parliamentary Questions No. 62 of 1 June 2017 and Nos. 762 to 778 of 20 June 2017, the Government has been anxious to ensure that the Disclosures Tribunal receives the greatest degree of assistance possible from all parties, not least An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to that end, has been supportive of the Commissioner in ensuring that she has the resources at her disposal to service the Tribunal in a timely and effective manner.  In light of the importance of the Tribunal and the urgency of its work, it was agreed that arrangements should be put in place without delay to facilitate that work.  The Commissioner identified a requirement that could best be met by the re-engagement of a small number of retired persons and my Department approved this in February 2017, subject to formal sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which was conveyed in May 2017.  The formal sanction provided for the engagement of three persons (<font color="#001A26">i.e. two retired members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and one civilian)</font>for up to 9 months for the purposes of servicing the Tribunal.  I am advised that the services of two former members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been engaged for a period of nine months from March to November 2017 and that their contracts fully comply with pension abatement regulations.  These contracts were initially for a period of six months to the August but have recently been extended to the end of November.  My Department was not consulted nor should it have been in relation to the selection of the particular individuals concerned.</p><p>The rehiring of persons on a contract basis does not require the approval of either the Policing Authority or the Government.  Neither is there a requirement to tender for the purposes of rehiring retired individuals on a temporary basis. </p><p>Approval was also granted to retain the services of a solicitor which would require a procurement process and the involvement of the Office of Government Procurement.  In the event, those services are being provided by the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Commissioner has not availed of the sanction to date. </p><p>I am informed that the work of the two retired members supports the Disclosure Tribunal Co-Ordination Office based in Garda Headquarters which is staffed by one full-time member, seconded temporarily from the Office of Corporate Communications, to whom the normal supervisory rules apply. That Office will assist any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, serving and retired, irrespective of rank in relation to the Tribunal.  A number of additional personnel are facilitating the work of this office on an ad hoc basis as requirements dictate.  I am further informed that liaison persons have been nominated from relevant sections/Regions to deal with specific requests from the Tribunal.  Funding for the Co-Ordination Office is met from the overall Garda budget.</p><p>It should be understood that the provision of these additional resources is to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an organisation is able to cooperate with the Tribunal to the fullest extent, without unduly affecting the ability of the organisation to continue to carry out its normal vital work.  That said, there is nothing in the arrangements put in place by the Commissioner to prevent, nor could they, the right of any individual member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make any representations they see fit, relevant to its terms of reference, to the Tribunal.</p></reply>

The Mullingar courthouse is currently scheduled for completion and handover to the Courts Service at the end of November 2017.  During the construction period the Courts Service endeavoured to maintain as many court sittings as possible within the county of Westmeath.  Temporary accommodation was acquired in Mullingar (in St Loman's GAA Club) to ensure that District Court sittings remained in Mullingar.  In addition, Athlone courthouse has accommodated, on a temporary basis, increased Circuit Court sittings for civil and family law business.  </p>  <p>  The opening of the refurnished and extended Mullingar Courthouse will enable the return of sittings of the Circuit Criminal Court to Mullingar.  There are currently no plans to transfer criminal, civil and family law cases relating to the District Court Area of Athlone to Mullingar.  Consequently no consideration is being given to a reduction in District Court sitting days in Athlone.</p></reply>

Members of the ASUs are highly trained and equipped with a variety of non lethal and lethal weapons and perform high visibility armed checkpoints and patrols throughout their respective Regions.

Under the Act, a new single application procedure was introduced under which all aspects of a person's claim (asylum, subsidiary protection and permission to remain) are considered together by the International Protection Office (IPO) rather than sequentially as heretofore.  The IPO replaced the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) from the commencement date.  The Chief International Protection Officer (CIPO) and the International Protection Officers in the IPO are independent by law in the exercise of their international protection functions.  They are also bound by confidentiality provisions in respect of applicants, as set out in Section 26 of the 2015 Act.</p>  <p>  If an application for asylum or subsidiary protection has been made in the State, for confidentiality reasons it is not the practice to comment on such applications and the applicant should contact the International Protection Office directly, either by email to info@ipo.gov.ie, by telephone to the IPO Customer Service Centre at 01 6028008 or in writing to the Customer Service Centre, International Protection Office, 79-83 Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2.</p>  <p>  Transitional arrangements in the 2015 Act apply to certain applications for refugee status and subsidiary protection which were made before the commencement date and were not finalised for processing by the ORAC and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) by that date.  The prioritisation of international protection applications in the context of the scheduling of interviews is provided for in the International Protection Act 2015, subject to the need for fairness and efficiency.</p>  <p>  I am advised that when the Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2) and other supporting documentation is returned by applicants, the CIPO intends to schedule applications in the IPO for interview primarily on the basis of date of application (oldest cases first).  However, certain categories of applicant are also being prioritised such as those from refugee generating countries such as Syria and unaccompanied minors.  The IPO's approach to prioritisation has been agreed with the UNHCR and is available on its website: www.ipo.gov.ie.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-26a.1389.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017072600028#WRAA02500"><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate was established in July, 2006 under Part 5 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  The role of the Inspectorate is to promote efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Inspectorate undertakes analysis of policies and procedures in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and benchmarks them against the best practices and standards of comparable police services. </p><p>  While the Garda Inspectorate has no statutory responsibility for the monitoring of the implementation of recommendations made in its reports, a process to do so was established with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2008 which resulted in the publication of status implementation update reports twice a year on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s website.  The last such regular update was published in November 2013 when, I understand, the process was interrupted due to pressure of work.  However, the Inspectorate and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are now working towards the production, in tabular form, of a document which will indicate the position regarding the implementation of recommendations contained in a number of Inspectorate reports up to and including the Crime Investigation report.  Once completed, the results will be published on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  With regard to the Garda Inspectorate Report on Crime Investigation 2014, I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the Garda Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 will address many of the detailed recommendations highlighted in the Garda Inspectorate's 2014 Report on Crime Investigation.  The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner has established a Strategic Transformation Office to plan and oversee the implementation of the Garda Modernisation and Renewal Programme and oversee the work to address many of the recommendations made by the Inspectorate in its report on Crime Investigation, including those relating to the recording and classification of crime.  Taking account of the number and complexity of many of the recommendations in the report, full implementation is being pursued on a phased basis. I regret that the table requested by the Deputy is not readily available in the format he is seeking, however, I have requested some additional information from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the Report and I will contact the Deputy again when this information is to hand. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, I am informed that important strategic issues currently being addressed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of the Report include:</p><p>- A new Performance Accountability and Learning Framework, (and IT system); </p><p>- A Control Room Strategy to provide for centralised handling of all requests for service from the public, linked to a modern Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system; </p><p>- Improved arrangements for Rosters and Duty Management; and</p><p>- Enhancements to Incident Management, Investigation Management and Victim Engagement. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the majority of recommendations arising from this Report fall to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to examine and implement in the first instance.  However, there are a small number of these recommendations relevant to my Department for which work has been ongoing since the publication of the Report.  Several of these are being advanced under the ambit of the Criminal Justice Strategic Committee (CJSC), which was founded in 2015 to drive enhanced co-operation and collaborative change across the criminal justice sector.  The establishment of the CJSC itself in fact implements one of the recommendations of the Inspectorate report on Crime Investigation.</p><p>The CJSC is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes the Heads of the various executive bodies across the Criminal Justice sector, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Policing Authority.  The committee is also attended by members of my Department&rsquo;s Management Board with responsibilities in the criminal justice area. </p><p>  The CJSC oversees an ongoing work programme of initiatives to improve the exchange of information, expertise and ideas across the justice sector, and to identify and accelerate reforms that require structured inter-agency co-operation.  Several of these initiatives specifically address recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s Report.</p><p>  In addition, yesterday I published the report of the CSO-led Expert Group on Crime Statistics, which was established in 2014 on foot of the Garda Inspectorate Report on Crime Investigation.  This report specifically addresses six recommendations in the Garda Inspectorate Report and directly relates to the compilation of crime statistics.  </p><p>  It should also be noted that the statutory position regarding the monitoring of the implementation of recommendations made in Inspectorate reports has changed.  Section 117(A) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act provides for a role for the Policing Authority in monitoring the measures taken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement the recommendations contained in reports prepared by the Inspectorate, and in line with this provision the Authority has been requested to monitor the implementation of the 2015 Garda Inspectorate report 'Changing Policing in Ireland'. </p></reply>

Probate functions are also carried out by County Registrars at District Probate Registries in 14 provincial court offices. </p><p>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the current waiting times in the Dublin Probate Registry for the issue of a Grant on foot of  an application lodged by a solicitor is 14/15 weeks.</p><p>Two additional staff have been provided to the Probate Office, a Higher Executive Officer and an Executive Officer, and it is anticipated that the appointment of the additional staff will assist in reducing the current delays in processing applications.

However, waiting times have been markedly reduced over recent years due to measures introduced by the Board and the Deputy will be glad to know that the Board&rsquo;s budget was increased by &euro;4.15m in 2017. </p><p>I know that the Board is extremely conscious of the fact that delays in service can lead to further difficulties not just for the client but also for children, the wider family and the community, as well as the courts system.  In this regard, the Board continues to provide a priority service in respect of a number of areas such as domestic violence, child abduction, child care, and asylum and related matters.  In addition, a person admitted to the Abhaile scheme does not need to wait before they are seen by a solicitor for legal advice.  All other applications are placed on the waiting list.</p><p>An application for civil legal aid and advice can be made at any Legal Aid Board law centre, regardless of the county of residence of the applicant.  For that reason, statistics in relation to applications and waiting times are maintained by law centrerather than county.  The following table sets out the waiting times for civil legal services as of the 1July 2017 by law centre.  I am informed that some law centres operate a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach, which involves giving an applicant a short consultation (45 minutes) for legal advice.  Those persons remain on the Board&rsquo;s waiting list if they require further legal services and the wait time for this is indicated by the second column.  The majority of centres do not currently deem it necessary to operate the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach. </p><p><b>Legal Aid Board waiting times &ndash; 1 July 2017 </b><table><tr><th></th><th colspan="2">Waiting for 1st Consultation</th><th colspan="2">Waiting for 2nd Consultation</th><th colspan="2">Combined waiting time</th></tr><tr><td>Law Centre</td><td>Longest person waiting (weeks)</td><td>No. Waiting</td><td>Longest person waiting (weeks)</td><td>No. Waiting</td><td>Combined waiting time (weeks)</td><td>No. Waiting</td></tr><tr><td>Athlone</td><td>19</td><td>80</td><td>28</td><td>33</td><td>47</td><td>113</td></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>21</td><td>64</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>21</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>Castlebar</td><td>11</td><td>34</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>11</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>12</td><td>32</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>12</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Chancery Street</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td>18</td><td>65</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>18</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Popes Quay</td><td>15</td><td>60</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>15</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Cork South Mall</td><td>28</td><td>200</td><td>13</td><td>23</td><td>41</td><td>223</td></tr><tr><td>Dolphin House</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk</td><td>17</td><td>58</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>17</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>Ennis</td><td>21</td><td>68</td><td>27</td><td>13</td><td>48</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>Finglas</td><td>11</td><td>26</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>11</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Galway Francis St</td><td>12</td><td>50</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>20</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>Galway Seville House</td><td>5</td><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Human Trafficking</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Jervis Street</td><td>8</td><td>24</td><td>47</td><td>173</td><td>55</td><td>197</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>12</td><td>52</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>12</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>Letterkenny</td><td>17</td><td>46</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>17</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>8</td><td>53</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>8</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>27</td><td>61</td><td>13</td><td>16</td><td>40</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>17</td><td>67</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>17</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>Montague Court</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Navan</td><td>34</td><td>78</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>34</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Nenagh</td><td>19</td><td>69</td><td>9</td><td>45</td><td>28</td><td>114</td></tr><tr><td>Newbridge</td><td>8</td><td>42</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>8</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td>12</td><td>65</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>12</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>12</td><td>30</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>12</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Smithfield</td><td>14</td><td>59</td><td>26</td><td>25</td><td>40</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght</td><td>23</td><td>63</td><td>53</td><td>63</td><td>76</td><td>126</td></tr><tr><td>Tralee</td><td>17</td><td>122</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>17</td><td>122</td></tr><tr><td>Tullamore</td><td>7</td><td>12</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>7</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>16</td><td>43</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>16</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>16</td><td>73</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>16</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>15</td><td>68</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>15</td><td>68</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-26a.1409.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017072600028#WRAA04500"><p>As the Deputy is aware, Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle organised crime gangs and other prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime.  This comprehensive operation is supported by the enhanced Government investment in Garda resources, including an additional allocation of &euro;88.5 million for overtime in 2017.  We have also invested heavily in the Garda fleet, with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015 and a provision of &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles under the Capital Plan 2016-2021. </p>  <p>  The additional investments in policing make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor.  Under Operation Thor we have seen over 74,000 targeted checkpoints and 52,400 crime prevention patrols nationwide.  This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 4,400 arrests and 4,900 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. </p>  <p>  It is also encouraging to note that since the launch of the operation, the burglary figures in particular have shown a significant downward trend.  Indeed, the CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q4 of 2016 in respect of Co. Tipperary show decreases in a number of the main categories of crime for example: burglary (16%), robbery (10%), theft (5%) and public order offences (17%) for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, all of which parallels the implementation of Operation Thor.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme (2016-2021) places a strong emphasis on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  In this regard, community policing is a key aspect of the Garda approach to the prevention and detection of crime.  All Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  Garda&iacute; engage with a wide range of community based groups, as well in more formal settings such as Joint Policing Committees, to ensure that local issues can be aired and appropriate partnerships formed with communities to address matters of concern.  Garda&iacute; also support over 3,700 Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch Schemes nationwide, and these form an important partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent crime and protect communities, especially the elderly and more vulnerable persons.  In addition, the Garda Text Alert Scheme provides an effective means for Garda&iacute; to communicate crime prevention information to local communities. </p>  <p>  Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's ongoing commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. The Government plans to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan which is in train within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Approximately 300 appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve.</p></reply>

The ensuing report published by the Department of Finance in January 2017, &lsquo;Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance&rsquo;, included a recommendation (Recommendation No. 25) to establish a fully functioning integrated fraud database for the insurance industry to detect patterns of fraud.  The Department of Justice and Equality was charged with implementing this recommendation and set up a working group to progress this recommendation.  </p>  <p>  The recommendation proposes that the recommended database will reduce levels of insurance fraud by providing access to details of incident data which can be used to detect patterns of potentially fraudulent behaviour. Specifically, the working group was convened to determine the parameters of the database to be established and consider the policy and legislative issues as well as funding, access and content.   </p>  <p>  The working group is made up of representatives from the Crime, Civil Law and Criminal Law Divisions of my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB), Insurance Ireland and the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI). Terms of Reference were agreed by the working group, which has met on 7 occasions to date.</p>  <p>  The group has engaged in discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and the respective UK bodies dealing with insurance fraud (i.e. Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department (IFED) and the Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB)) as part of its work and these interactions have fed into a working group report, which outlines the working group's consultations, analysis and recommendations.  The working group intends to submit this report to the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner for their views, following which the report will be submitted to the Cost of Insurance Working Group, which is chaired by my colleague, the Minister of State, Michael D'Arcy, T.D. </p>  <p>  If it is determined, following this initial scoping exercise, that an insurance fraud database (including the possibility of expanding the existing industry database) is a viable option, then a further exercise will be carried out to put the necessary legislative and other measures in place to facilitate it.</p></reply>

The Policing Authority assumed responsibility for undertaking these competitions on 1 January 2017 and, coinciding with that date, the eligibility criteria were extended to include any member of the PSNI not below the rank of inspector who has served not less than 2 years in that rank.  Previously, they were confined to those in the rank immediately below.   The 2005 Act also provides for the secondment from the PSNI to certain ranks in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for a period not exceeding 3 years.  I have been informed by the Commissioner that there are currently no police officers serving in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on secondment from police services outside the State. </p>  <p>  Also of relevance is the statutory provision for former members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be re-appointed to the organisation.  The most recent applications in this respect concern former members who departed to serve in police services in Australia and have gained valuable skills and experience from that service and wish to re-join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Individuals with appropriate policing experience and qualifications gained in other jurisdictions may also be suitable for appointment to various civilian roles available within the Garda organisation.  Having regard to the Government's aim of 20% of the Garda workforce comprising civilians by 2021 it can be expected that these opportunities will increase.</p>  <p>  I am very keen to explore how further opportunities can be created to open up entry routes at all levels and I look forward to receiving the report of the Garda Inspectorate's examination of the options before the end of the year.  Those options could include, for example, fast track entry for policing professionals from other jurisdictions at the lower ranks and the targeted intake of experienced skilled police officers at the senior ranks. </p></reply>

Many of the likes and dislikes expressed by the children were also identified and addressed in the recommendations of the McMahon Report.  In implementing those recommendations  we have taken the views of children as expressed in this report into account.</p><p>The International Protection Act 2015 introduced the single application procedure for international protection.  This replaces the sequential processing system and is the single biggest reform in this area for the past twenty years.  Since January 2017, all applications for international protection are being processed under the new single applications procedure.  In responding to length of time issues, the Department, in addition to implementing the single procedure, proactively engaged in an examination of cases of those longest in the system.  These cases have been expedited resulting in substantial numbers of people who were greater than five years in the system now dealt with.  It is estimated that almost all of those identified in the Report as being over 5 years in the Direct Provision system and who do not have any impediments, such as ongoing judicial reviews, have now had their cases processed to completion. </p><p>A range of measures have been put in place to ensure that the principle of the best interests of the child can be effectively implemented from the single application procedure to living in centres.  There is ongoing implementation of the child protection and welfare policy in all accommodation centres under the direct supervision of an officer seconded to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) from TUSLA.  In addition to this, an officer seconded from the Department of Education and Skills to RIA oversees the enrolment of children in accommodation centres across the country as they link in with local schools. In addition, the remit of the Ombudsman for Children has been extended to include children in state provided accommodation centres. </p><p>My Department continues to work with Contractors at a number of centres (both State owned and commercial) to commence projects for independent living for residents.  This is a follow on from the provision of this facility at Mosney and Ballyhaunis. This will include home cooking within the family accommodation units in some instances and access to communal cooking stations for residents in other instances.  These projects allow adult family members to cook for themselves and their families rather than availing of the central catering services provided at the centres.  These projects will be reviewed and refined with a view to their application across the entire accommodation portfolio where feasible.  It should be noted that these projects can involve structural works and due regard needs to be taken of fire safety legislation and planning requirements.</p><p>The 2016 annual report from the Reception and Integration Agency of the Department contains a detailed listing of the on-site and off-site facilities available for children who are living in State provided accommodation.

I plan to hold meetings imminently with NGOs to see what might be possible.  Of course, issues relating to housing fall within the remit of the Department of Housing, Planning Community and Local Government and with each of the local authorities within the State.  It is important that we would not duplicate efforts when seeking a solution to this problem.  </p><p>The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) is working with the Irish Red Cross in relation to accommodation pledges made for persons who relocate from Greece and Italy under the EU schemes.  While those pledges were made specifically for the cohort of persons coming from Greece and Italy, it is hoped that a number of clients with leave to remain may be able to avail of some offers.  Meetings have also been held with representatives of the churches to see how they might assist.</p><p>The Reception and Integration Agency has prepared a booklet <i>'Your guide to living independently' </i>which offers guidance to all persons in State-provided accommodation centres when they are in receipt of any form of 'leave to remain'.  This booklet provides practical information on State services and is also available in several languages on the website of the Reception &amp;amp; Integration Agency (RIA) - www.ria.gov.ie.  Information sessions on these services were also provided by the Citizens Information Board <i>in situ</i>at centres.  In addition to the publication of the booklet, a number of NGOs have been awarded monies under the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) specifically to provide assistance to move out of State provided accommodation. At the beginning of July 2017, there were approximately 400 persons with some form of status continuing to reside in State provided accommodation.</p></reply>

The powers available to Garda&iacute; support them in addressing anti-social behaviours, including the prevention of nuisance or annoyance to others and forestalling damage to property or a breach of the peace. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains committed to tackling public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities to reduce this type of behaviour and enhance community safety. The Garda approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities, businesses (in particular the night time economy) and other stakeholders to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.  All Garda&iacute; have a role to play in Community Policing in carrying out their duties.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, published on 9 June 2016, places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's ongoing commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. The Government plans to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan which is in train within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Approximately 300 appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-26a.1509.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017072600030#WRCC02900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 537, 538, and Nos 565 to 572, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The Public Accounts Committee published a report of its examination of matters in relation to financial procedures at the Garda College, Templemore on 18 July last.  It follows from the Interim Audit Report prepared by the Garda Internal Audit Section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and published by the Garda Commissioner last March.  The PAC report makes a number of findings and recommendations in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department.  Those findings and recommendations will be carefully examined with a view to identifying what follow up is appropriate. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda authorities have publicly stated that they understand the gravity of the issues identified in the Interim Audit Report and are taking comprehensive steps to progress its recommendations as quickly as possible.  A high level Steering Committee, chaired by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Chief Administrative Officer, and including a representative from my Department is overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the Interim Audit Report.  That work will continue as a matter of priority with a view to completion by year end.  Although I would prefer that this work could be brought to a conclusion more quickly, the reality is that unravelling the funding model put in place in the College in the late 1980s has raised complex legal issues that have taken time to resolve through engagement with the Office of the Attorney General. </p>  <p>  The independent Policing Authority is also overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the Interim Audit Report and is expected to submit its first report on this matter to me shortly.  I have referred the PAC report to the Authority in order that it can take it into account as part of its ongoing work in this regard.</p>  <p>  The PAC report makes a number of findings in relation to my Department and, in particular, in relation to its oversight of financial matters within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These findings will be examined to determine whether any enhancements are required to existing oversight arrangements within the parameters of the statutory framework set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  It is important, however, to recall that under the Act it is the Garda Commissioner who is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote and is in law responsible for ensuring that the appropriate controls apply to expenditure within the organisation.  The Commissioner is supported in that role by a Finance Directorate headed by an Executive Director of Finance and an Internal Audit Unit.  The Head of the Garda Internal Audit reports to an independent statutory Audit Committee appointed by the Policing Authority and comprising a majority of external persons.  That Committee has responsibility, amongst other things, to advise the Commissioner, as the accounting officer, on governance and financial matters relating to her functions.  Similar to all accounting officers, the Commissioner is responsible for the preparation of an annual Appropriation Account, which is then audited and reported on, by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his annual report each year. </p>  <p>  In this context the finding by the Committee that my Department failed in not informing the Garda Internal Audit Unit when it became aware of issues in relation to the College in September 2015 is not clear.  The Committee appears to be suggesting that my Department should, when issues of concern arise, seek to circumvent the Commissioner who has, as the Deputy will be aware, statutory responsibility for controlling and directing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and instead engage directly with her Head of Internal Audit or the Audit Committee which advises her.  In any event, and as outlined in its evidence to the Committee, my Department was informed in early October 2015 by the Garda authorities that the Garda Audit Committee had been apprised of the issues at its September meeting.  The Head of Internal Audit reports to the Committee and attends such meetings.  In these circumstances the need to inform the Head of Internal Audit did not arise.</p>  <p>  The fact that the Garda Commissioner is in law the Accounting Officer does not, of course, relieve my Department of its oversight role in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Indeed, new structures have been put in place in recent years to strengthen oversight with the introduction of a formal governance agreement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Governance Framework Agreement makes provision, amongst other things, for regular governance meetings between the Secretary General of my Department and the Commissioner as well as tripartite meetings involving my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Authority.  In this context, senior officials meet monthly with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a senior management level to oversee progress on strategic and resource matters.  In addition, arrangements are in place for quarterly meetings involving my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Authority in the context of the Authority's statutory functions in relation to providing advice regarding Garda resources.  Specifically in relation to financial matters, the Executive Director of Finance in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, together with the other Heads of Finance for each Vote Body in the Justice Group, attend a monthly Financial Management Committee, chaired by the Assistant Secretary Corporate Affairs in the Department.  If these arrangements can be strengthened in someway to enhance their effectiveness, while at the same time respecting the statutory framework in the 2005 Act and not trespassing on either the Commissioner's operational independence or her legal responsibilities as Accounting Officer, that will be done. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also, of course, be aware the Commission on the Future of Policing is examining the totality of the oversight architecture in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including the Authority, the Garda Inspectorate and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and also my Department and is due to report by September 2018. </p>  <p>  I also note the findings in relation to my Department's records.  In so far as records relating to the preparations for the hand-over in July 2006 of the Accounting Officer role to the Commissioner are concerned, the Department retains its records in accordance with its obligations to do so.  In an effort to assist the Committee, the Department sought to identify whether the issues relating to the College surfaced at that time.  This exercise did not identify any relevant records on this specific point.  In relation to the absence of records concerning the origins of the funding arrangements, including the establishment of the Sportsfield Company, an extensive trawl of several thousand Departmental records going back some 30 years did not identify any relevant records.  I do not believe that one can extrapolate from this to draw any conclusions in relation to corporate governance standards in the Department today but my Department will of course continue to provide every possible assistance to the Committee. </p>  <p>  In relation to whether the Commissioner should have informed the then Minister of the issues arising under section 41 of the 2005 Act, it remains the case that while section 41 places a requirement on the Commissioner to report certain matters to the Minister, it is ultimately a matter for the judgement of the Commissioner as to when to make reports specifically citing that section of the Act.  It is not simply a question of legal judgement - it is a question of determining whether a particular set of circumstances fall within the criteria set out in the Act.  The Commissioner judged in this instance that further information required to be gathered before a decision could be taken on the making of a section 41 report.  I do not propose to seek to second guess her decision.</p>  <p>  I mention these matters to provide some context to the Committee's findings and recommendations.  The consideration and implementation of many of them will fall to Commissioner as Accounting Officer subject to appropriate oversight by my Department and the Policing Authority.  Those directly relating to my Department will, as I have said be carefully examined to see what action is required.</p></reply>

Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009, the maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority was increased from one to five years.

These figures are provisional, operational and subject to change.I am further informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is addressing the issue of knife crime through education and engagement with community initiatives.

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of resources is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.</p>  <p>  I am informed that local Garda Management in the DMR are aware of issues relating to an increase of anti-social behaviour in the locality and, in addition to routine patrols by mobile, beat and Community Policing units, have deployed additional personnel to specific areas identified as public disorder/anti-social behaviour hot-spots to alleviate this type of criminality.</p>  <p>  There are a number of specific initiatives also in place within the Region targeting public disorder and other anti-social type behaviour including: high-visibility patrols in identified crime, public disorder and anti-social behaviour hotspots; targeting underage drinking, the consumption of alcohol in public places and anti-social behaviour under Operation Irene; and the distribution of crime prevention leaflets, thereby reassuring communities and enhancing community safety.</p>  <p>  Under Operation &lsquo;Hybrid&rsquo; a schedule of rolling high-visibility armed, and unarmed, checkpoints take place in strategic locations, including within the DMR North Garda Division, the purpose of which is, through pro-active policing, to disrupt Organised Crime Gangs.  Since this operation commenced, in February, 2016, almost 36,000 checkpoints have been conducted during which road traffic offences have been detected, firearms have been recovered, warrants executed and the sale and supply of drugs interrupted.</p>  <p>  I am, of course, conscious of the impact which anti-social behaviour and the types of crime referred to have on the quality of life for residents in local communities.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to tackle public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities to reduce this type of behaviour and enhance community safety.  The Garda approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.  The Deputy will appreciate that I do not have a role in relation to Garda policing strategies in any particular local area but have brought the Deputy's specific concerns to the attention of the Garda Authorities.</p>  <p>  Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's ongoing commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The Government plans to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan which is in train within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Approximately 300 appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve.</p></reply>

In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p>  <p>  This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 26 of whom have been assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Division.  I am also informed that a further four hundred Garda recruits are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Cavan/Monaghan Division in the coming years.</p></reply>

With the completion of the short- and medium-term goals relating to the review, the Garda authorities are currently re-evaluating the outcomes of the review to date in order to inform the long-term goals associated with the review.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na highlighted the notable improvement in the rate of summons service since it commenced its review in 2014, i.e. a 12% increase in summons service rates to 69% currently. </p>  <p>  With the introduction of the third payment option on 1 June 2017, the operation of the associated provision relating to proof of postage in the context of third payment fixed charge notice/summons documentation (Section 38 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, as amended) will be closely monitored by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the coming months and it is hoped that this statutory provision will contribute to increasing compliance levels insofar as payment of fixed charge notice amounts and acknowledgement of summonses are concerned.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Commissioner has advised that some initiatives will be implemented in the short to medium term, while others will require a number of years to implement fully.  Given the highly complex nature of the Programme, timelines for projects may move for a number of reasons including, for example, extended scope or procurement phase, unforeseen delays or changes to the strategic priorities of the organisation.</p><p>The Investigations Management System, planned for implementation in late 2018, will standardise, digitise and support the management of all investigations arising from a PULSE incident.  The system will support the allocation and management of all jobs and allocation of roles and documentation relating to the running and completion of an investigation.  It will also maintain a full history of the chain of events for an investigation, information and evidence gathered and decisions made. I am advised that work is progressing in relation to the system and that contacts are ongoing with relevant stakeholders.  In the meantime, PULSE has been enhanced with new incident management functionality to enable Garda supervisors monitor the progress of incidents from initial data input right through to court outcome stage. This is an interim step pending the implementation of the Investigations Management System.  </p><p>I understand An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na currently deploys a mix of Regional and Divisional Control Room models across the organisation.  The Control Room Strategy, in the long term, will introduce a new Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system.  Pending the introduction of the new system, the following interim projects have been established to address any gaps in collating data and to provide a more professional and consistent service across the country: </p><p>-  CAD Part 1<b></b>will ensure that all calls from the public to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are accurately tracked and managed and supported by a Regional Control Room Model.  The CAD Part 1 project will extend the Cork CAD system to incorporate the Kerry Division, thereby ensuring a standardised approach across the southern region. This project is due for deployment later in 2017.  <b><font color="#00204F"> </font></b></p><p>-  ERC1 (Electronic RC1) is an initiative which facilitates the implementation of the overall Control Room Strategy initiative.  This is an interim solution that provides Divisions without the current CAD system with the functionality to record, store, retrieve and update information regarding requests for service from the public in an electronic format. ERC1 will assist in standardising the call handling and incident recording procedures prior to the deployment of the complete Control Room Strategy.  ERC1 commenced as a pilot in the Mullingar Division in 2016 and a national roll out of ERC1 to all Divisions without CAD (14 Divisions in total with ERC1) was completed during the week ending 1 June last.</p><p>As part of the longer-term strategy, Control Room technology will be significantly enhanced.  The CAD Part 2 project will identify a suitable CAD system tailored to fit the specific needs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the ultimate objective of providing a better response to victims of crime and delivering a more seamless service to the public. This new CAD system will integrate current and future Garda IT systems i.e. PULSE, Rosters and Duty Management, Contact Management, etc. to provide a holistic view of the organisation's information. </p><p>Some other key ICT projects which are currently being advanced are set out below:</p><p>-  The Enterprise Content Management project is intended to provide a single repository for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to securely store and manage content. I understand from the Garda authorities that this project will shortly go live in the Eastern Region following the completion of training in these areas. The system will then be systematically rolled out nationwide.</p><p>-  A new Property and Exhibits Management System will be used to record all property and exhibits which come into Garda possession and manage them throughout their lifecycle within the organisation from scene to court. This system is planned to go live later this year. </p><p>-  In the area of Victims Services, PULSE has been updated to include Individual Victim Assessment and Victim Engagement screens to record information about the victim themselves and any Garda interaction or engagement with the victim. </p><p>-  The e-Vetting system provides online processing of applications for Garda vetting for persons working with children and vulnerable persons and is now fully operational. This system won the national eGovernment Award for 2017. </p><p>-  A project to implement a new Rosters and Duty Management System is currently under way and it is planned to commence a pilot of the system in the first half of 2018. This system will support the management of the new rosters in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to manage the deployment of human resources on a day to day and also on a strategic long term basis.</p><p>-  A new Anti-Money Laundering application (GoAML) which will support Financial Intelligence Units to counter terrorist financing and money laundering was implemented in June 2017. </p><p>-  A project to enhance Network Access to Rural Locations is a planned initiative under the Modernisation and Renewal Programme. This initiative has identified the locations that do not currently have access to PULSE, Garda e-mail and portal, and where appropriate will provide connectivity. Work on this project is well advanced and over 100 additional stations have now been added to the Garda network.</p><p>-  A project to provide mobile access, via a smartphone device, to all Garda information systems, including PULSE, is currently being advanced.</p><p>In addition An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in collaboration with my Department, is actively progressing a number of EU ICT projects to improve police co-operation and increase border security within the EU.  These include:</p><p>-  implementation of the FIND solution which is now operational enabling the Garda National Immigration Bureau to query the Interpol Stolen Lost Travel Document Database (STLD)</p><p>-  implementation of PRUM, which is planned to go live early in 2018, and will deliver enhancements to the Automated Finger Printing System to step up cross-border cooperation in relation to terrorism, crime and illegal immigration, and </p><p>-  implementation of the Schengen Information System, which is planned to be ready for evaluation by the EU Commission by mid 2019, and which will enable the rapid dissemination of information pertaining to terrorist threats and other subversive  and non-subversive crime types across members states of the European Union.  </p><p>The Government is highly supportive of these initiatives and this is underpinned by significant Government investment under the Capital Plan of some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. </p>  <p>  The Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021 envisages a range of actions to be implemented by State, voluntary and community sector organisations aimed at preventing and responding to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to supporting this strategy, and in March 2015 a number of Garda units were brought together to leverage their experience and expertise in investigating serious crimes against the person including sexual offences to form the Garda National Protective Services Bureau (GNPSB) led by a Chief Superintendent. </p>  <p>  The GNPSB is a specialist team dedicated to making sure each and every complaint relating to child protection, human trafficking, domestic and sexual violence is thoroughly investigated and handled correctly. In addition, the GNPSB is responsible for working with other agencies to manage sex offenders in the interest of community safety. </p>  <p>  As part of the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 Protective Services Units (PSUs) are to be established in every Garda Division with specially trained staff. These units will mirror the responsibilities held by the GNPSB and will ensure a consistent approach to domestic abuse and sexual crime. The PSUs will work with the Garda Victim Service Offices in their area to ensure that the needs of victims are adequately catered for.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner that these Divisional PSUs are being rolled-out in two phases. Phase 1 involves the establishment of three Units over a 12-month period on a pilot basis. The pilot Divisions that have been identified are the Dublin Metropolitan Region West, Cork City, and the Louth Division. The assessment of this pilot phase will inform the further roll-out to each Garda Division.</p></reply>

This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders for example, the well established Community Alert Programme and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme to name but a few.  I have sought a report from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the number now in place, and their location, and I will contact the Deputy again when this information is to hand.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's ongoing commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The Government plans to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan which is in train within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Approximately 300 appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve.</p></reply>

The Programme has been formed based on recommendations made in 44 reports, both internal and external, developed over the preceding ten years as well as extended periods of consultation and workshops with senior leadership within the organisation.  The MRP aims to deliver on its objective through the realisation of a number of key outcomes described in detail throughout the chapters of the Programme launch document.  The Strategic Transformation Office (STO) has been established to oversee governance and delivery of the projects that form the MRP.</p>  <p>  With more than 80 initiatives and 135 projects, the MRP will strengthen the service An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides and ensure that they can deal with any emerging issues into the future.  Due to the scale of the programme, a phased planning approach is essential; some initiatives will be implemented in the short to medium term, while others will require a number of years to implement fully.  Given the highly complex nature of the MRP, timelines for projects may move for a number of reasons including extended scope or procurement phase, unforeseen delays to risks or issues or changes to the strategic priorities of the organisation. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works closely with my Department and the DPP, Irish Prison Service and Probation Service to tackle crime and reduce reoffending rates.  I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will use Offender and Case Management programmes, in conjunction with the Courts, Probation Service, HSE and TUSLA, to manage prolific and high risk offenders in the community to reduce re-offending. </p>  <p>  The Offender Management initiative under the MRP is currently comprised of two projects, namely JARC and SAOR.</p>  <p>  -  JARC is a Joint Agency Approach to Crime  where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prisons Service and the Probation Service work together to move repeat offenders  away from crime.  The implementation of this project under the MRP will further develop and implement operational processes to manage nominated prolific offenders in co-operation with these agencies</p>  <p>  -  SAOR is a Strategic Approach to Offender Recidivism which aims to reduce recidivism through the training of Case Managers for the organisation.  Successful implementation of this project will ensure the effective management and implementation of case managers and improved inter agency co-operation.</p>  <p>  The above programmes will continue to be rolled out throughout 2017. The various programmes within JARC are in an evaluation process and it is expected that the  evaluations of the three initial programmes will be completed before the end of this year. </p>  <p>  In addition, a Youth JARC project was initiated earlier this year which looks at the most prolific offenders aged between 16-21 and is being piloted in Blanchardstown and in Mayfield and Gurranabraher in Cork.  The selection process of the first youths for the project is under way at present.  The aim of the project, like the adult JARC, is to take a multi-agency approach to intervening in order to reduce their level of offending.</p></reply>

This includes responsibility for the formulation of proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda Stations, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities, so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  Indeed, this was the basis on which the Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme was developed and implemented, resulting in the closure of some 139 Garda stations. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the closures have allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.</p>  <p>  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government is committed to launching a pilot scheme to reopen six Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.  At its meeting on 13 June 2017, the Government noted the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s interim Report which analysed population and crime trends and, taking account of the availability of stations for reuse, makes a number of recommendations including that Stepaside Station in County Dublin be reopened on a pilot basis.  The report also indicates that the Commissioner is likely, subject to further analysis, to recommend the reopening of Leighlinbridge, County Carlow and Donard, County Wicklow in her final report.  If a second station is to be reopened in Dublin, the Commissioner has indicated that, subject to further analysis, the former station at Rush, County Dublin will be recommended for reopening. </p>  <p>  The Government has, accordingly, agreed in principle to the reopening of Stepaside Garda Station on a pilot basis as soon as any necessary preparatory works have been completed and the Commissioner&rsquo;s final recommendation in relation to Rush, Leighlinbridge and Donard Garda Stations is expected to be received shortly.  </p>  <p>  Following any decision to reopen the former stations, the Garda authorities will work closely with the Office of Public Works in relation to any necessary preparatory works required to progress the reopenings.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate is, at the request of the Policing Authority, examining the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities with a view to making recommendations to provide a more effective, visible and responsive policing service. The Authority has informed the Inspectorate that the review should take account of:</p>  <p>  -  the changing environments in rural, developing urban and suburban areas;</p>  <p>  -  the views of local communities; </p>  <p>  -  the allocation to and deployment of Garda resources at the local policing level, including the use of the Garda Reserve, Garda facilities and Garda equipment; and </p>  <p>  -  relevant recommendations made in previous Inspectorate reports.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the Inspectorate will have completed the review by mid-2018.</p></reply>

The programme, which mirrors many of the actions set out in the Civil Service Renewal Plan, covers areas such as culture; leadership and structure; audit and risk management; corporate functions and IT systems; and external benchmarks. </p><p>Significant progress has been made in implementing these recommendations as outlined below and the work of embedding and sustaining the changes continues to be prioritised in my Department.  Regular updates have been published on my Department's website.  The following recommendations have been implemented in the Department: </p><p>-  The Department&rsquo;s Management Advisory Committee was reconstituted as a Management Board, new personnel were appointed, both from within the Department and externally, and lateral mobility put into effect.  A new Deputy Secretary post was created in April 2015 to provide more cohesive leadership across the criminal justice portfolio and a Secretary General was permanently appointed in October 2016.  Both I and the Minister of State for Equality, Immigration and integration meet on a monthly basis with the full Management Board.</p><p>-  Following consultation with staff and stakeholders, a Culture and Values Charter was published in 2016 with the objective of fostering a more open, listening organisational culture. These values have been signed off by the Department's leadership team and are fed into all induction and leadership training with a view to informing the way in which the Department communicates with staff and stakeholders.  It is recognised that changes to organisational culture takes sustained effort over time and a cross grade team, led by the Secretary General, is working to ensure that this continues to be embedded in the organisation.</p><p>-  Robust supporting processes have been put in place to enhance leadership and oversight of the Department and wider sector and to facilitate more effective management and governance of the strategic objectives. A Corporate Governance Framework for the Department was published in April 2016.  Since 2015 an annual Strategic Implementation Plan has been published, which draws together in one single plan all of the strategic priorities across the Department. To support the Management Board in its oversight of this programme, a programme management reporting system has been implemented, providing the Management Board with information and status updates on strategic actions across all of the Department's programmes; In addition, progress reports are published on the Department's website.</p><p>-  Risk management processes have been significantly strengthened and the Department's Audit Committee which has a majority of external members has reviewed its processes in line with the recommendations. </p><p>-  Since March 2014, the Department has also put in place revised systems and procedures to ensure all correspondence is handled appropriately which specifies that high-priority correspondence is brought to the attention of both myself and relevant officials and followed up in a timely manner.</p><p>-  The Report made several recommendations regarding relationship management and oversight of Agencies, all of which have been implemented. Agency performance and governance arrangements have been formalised and strengthened through formal Oversight/Performance/Service Delivery Agreements and Frameworks<b></b>agreed with 24 key agencies including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In addition, as the Deputy is aware, the Policing Authority was established in January 2016 to bring a new and dedicated layer of public accountability to the administration of policing services and provide additional impetus to drive necessary changes in the policing system and its practices. </p><p>-  Formal structures have been put in place to support communication and collaboration with the agencies in the Justice and Equality sector: the Civil Agencies Network covers a range of diverse agencies and meets quarterly to share information and best practise while the Criminal Justice Strategic Committee comprising the heads of all the relevant agencies was established in 2015.  The Strategic Committee also meets quarterly and is driving effective collaboration through a detailed work-plan on a range of shared interests from international cooperation, data needs and interoperability to leadership development and victims services.</p><p>-  A programme of work in regard to Data and Information has been developed and is being taken forward in cooperation with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, including a system providing real time support to the front-line Joint Agency Response to Crime (JARC) programme, the rollout of an e-Submissions system and the development of the Justice and Equality Hub, to facilitate better collaboration and information sharing between the Department and its stakeholders and the provision of data and management information to support the development of more evidence based policy.</p><p>-  Several of the Review Group's recommendations related to Human Resources management and the Department held an open competition last year to appoint a professional Head of Strategic Human Resources.  Following this appointment, a three year workforce plan has been developed which directly supports the Department&rsquo;s 2016-19 Strategy and informs recruitment and deployment of available resources to effectively deliver on the Department's business objectives as well as identifying training needs.  The 2017 training plan includes risk management, customer service, leadership development and performance management.  The Department is also developing its HR capacity, including the recent implementation of a business partner model to try to ensure that the business needs, including managed mobility and succession planning, are being met by HR.  A HR strategy is being prepared which will build on the changes implemented since the Toland Report and which will reflect the internal Change Programme, the forthcoming Civil Service HR strategy and public service reform.</p><p>-  A Head of Communications was appointed and a strategy covering internal and external communications in support of the change programme was published in 2016.</p><p>-  New structured governance arrangements with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have also been introduced.  A Governance Framework Document is in place which makes provision, amongst other things, for regular meetings involving my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority.  Officials also meet monthly with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to oversee progress on strategic and resource matters.  In addition, arrangements are in place for quarterly meetings involving the Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority in the context of the Authority's statutory functions in relation to advising the Minister with regard to Garda resources.</p><p>In terms of recommendations not yet implemented, the Review Group recommended the development of a HR strategy which is in preparation in parallel with the overall Civil Service HR Strategy as mentioned above.  It also recommended changes to the Department&rsquo;s structure but was not definitive on the detail of this.  The Department&rsquo;s structure has been reviewed in recent months and a number of options for structural changes are under consideration.  Given the need to deal with a considerable workload on hand, it is envisaged that structural change will be implemented on a phased basis, commencing in Quarter 4 this year. It should be noted that despite concerns expressed by the Review Group about the breadth of its responsibilities, my Department's remit continued to expand significantly in recent years with responsibility assigned in 2015 for additional agencies including the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland.  In addition the Charities Regulator, the Policing Authority and the Legal Services Regulatory Authority have all been established in recent years.</p><p>In addition to the ongoing reforms in the policing area, achieving better collaborative practice and parallel to implementing the major change programme, the Deputy will be aware of the volume of work delivered over the past 3 years on the Department's business agenda across very significant areas of public life. Major achievements include the Children and Family Relationship Act 2015, the Marriage Equality Referendum, International Protection Act 2015 incorporating a single applications procedure and implementation of the McMahon report recommendations, progressing the implementation of the EU Victims Directive, establishment of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) to meet Ireland&rsquo;s international humanitarian obligations, amongst many others.</p><p>Finally, I should add that my Department is taking stock of the change programme to assess progress to date and to identify priorities for the next phase of improvement to ensure the measures outlined above are embedded and sustained and the drive for continuous improvement is maintained.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  Furthermore when allocations are taking place comprehensive consultation is carried out with local management during which all factors are taken into consideration.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p>  <p>  Rathcoole Garda Station forms part of the Clondalkin District and I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Clondalkin District on the 30 June 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 196 members of which 16 were assigned to Rathcoole Garda Station.  There are also 7 Garda Reserves and 16 civilians attached to the Clondalkin District.  When appropriate, the work of local garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and the Organised Crime Bureau.  </p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that Rathcoole Garda Station is open daily from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. subject to available manpower.  An increase in the opening hours of any Garda station would necessitate the deployment of additional Garda personnel to indoor administrative duties who may be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.  While the position is kept under review by the Garda authorities, I understand that there are no plans at this time to increase the opening hours of Rathcoole Garda station.</p></reply>

These binding standards are set out in the Code of Practice for Appointment to Positions where the Garda Commissioner has Statutory Responsibility, as published by the Commission for Public Service Appointments.  </p>  <p>   I am advised that in considering requests for reasonable accommodations, PAS has a fundamental duty to ensure it is being fair to all candidates who have entered a particular competition and that the key principle of appointment on merit is being observed.  To assist PAS in considering a request for accommodations in a fair and balanced way, its policy is to ask candidates to indicate on their application that they require special accommodations and to submit evidence in support of their request.  PAS will consider letters or reports from relevant professionals which clearly indicate the nature of the disability and the type of accommodation(s) that may be relevant to the person.  PAS has given additional time to people with dyslexia where they have supporting evidence.

The Divisional Drug Unit based at Galway Garda Station has undertaken a number of significant and successful initiatives to monitor and counteract the sale, supply and distribution of drugs, including heroin.  These include an intelligence-led initiative to monitor heroin use within the Galway Division, covering both the City and County, which resulted in the identification of a number of heroin dealers who were targeted for the purpose of law enforcement.  </p><p>As part of this initiative, a number of significant seizures of heroin were recorded and the main heroin dealers in the Division were arrested and brought before the Courts.  The details of heroin drug seizures recorded for the Galway Garda Division, provided by Forensic Science Ireland to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for each year for the period 2014- 2016 are provided in the table beneath:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Grams/mls/plants</th><th>Estimated* Street Value</th></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>67</td><td>&euro;9,440</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>66</td><td>&euro;9,963</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>250</td><td>&euro;37,565</td></tr></table></p><p>*Note:- The data provided is provisional, operational and liable to change and is valid to Friday, 21 July 2017.  The estimated street value of the drugs seized is based on instructions issued by the Garda National Drugs &amp;amp; Organised Crime Bureau in 2012 and amended in 2015</p><p>An initiative under &quot;Operation Clean Street&quot;, which targets on-street dealers, was put in place by the Divisional Drug Unit in conjunction with the National Drugs &amp;amp; Organised Crime Bureau.  This resulted in the arrest and charging of several persons for the offence of possession of drugs for sale or supply on city streets within the Galway Division.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within the Galway Division work closely with the Western Region Drug and Alcohol Task Force, through education and other programmes, to reduce demand for heroin and other controlled substances, and offer advice and practical assistance to users and family members effected by drug use.</p><p>Garda Management within the Galway Division is aware of the impact of the use and sale / distribution of drugs in the Division on families and communities, including the impact of drug-related intimidation of users and their families.  The Divisional Drug Unit and all Garda personnel monitor the use of drugs, including heroin, throughout the Division and continue to enforce all relevant legislation to the fullest, including searches of persons, property and vehicles.  </p><p>Nationally, a new National Drugs Strategy, &ldquo;Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery&rdquo; 2017 &ndash; 2025 has been launched by the Taoiseach this month.

As the Deputy will know, the 1964 Act was modernised extensively, with a wide range of amendments to that Act made in relation to guardianship, custody and access by the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  </p>  <p>  Section 3 of the 1964 Act provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court in any proceedings where guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child is in question.  The best interests of a child are to be determined in accordance with Part V of the 1964 Act, inserted by section 63 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  Section 31 of the 1964 Act sets out a wide range of factors that the court is required to take into account when determining the best interests of the child.  These factors include the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with each of his or her parents.  </p>  <p>  The law places an emphasis on recognising the rights of the child to the society of both his or her parents.  Section 11D of the 1964 Act obliges the court in proceedings under section 11 to consider whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with each of his or her parents on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  Section 25 of the 1964 Act also requires the court, as it thinks appropriate and practicable, to take into account the child's wishes in custody and access matters, having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  </p>  <p>  Section 12A of the 1964 Act (inserted by section 58 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) provides that in making any order under the Act, the court may impose such conditions as it considers to be necessary in the best interests of the child.  </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the courts when making orders under the 1964 Act in relation to matters such as the guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child to consider whether or not any conditions should be attached to such orders.  </p>  <p>  I have no role in the making of court orders, as this is a function of the courts, which are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the performance of their functions.  </p>  <p>While I have no plans at present for further amendment of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the operation of the law in this area is kept under ongoing review by my Department.</p></reply>

A copy is reproduced below for reference.  </p><p><i></i>I am informed that the queues to which the Deputy refers do not arise as a result of the operation of immigration controls at Dublin Airport but are rather a consequence of other factors outside the control of the service.  As regards throughput generally for incoming passengers to Dublin Airport, information supplied by the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) in relation to queue times for arriving passengers at the Airport shows that over 90% of all travellers are processed through immigration control in a matter of minutes, with the percentage figure being even higher for passengers of EU nationalities.  This is in the context of passenger numbers at Dublin Airport reaching record levels last year with almost 28 million passengers using the Airport.</p><p>However, there are specific pressure points outside of the control of the immigration authorities that can create some delay.  Typically, this arises when a very high number of flights arrive within a specific time period (which happens at Terminal 1 in the late evening period) and the consequent increased passenger numbers within these peak times, can impact on queuing times over these periods.  This situation is compounded when, in addition to scheduled arrivals, delayed flights also land during these peak periods.</p><p>Additional staff have been recruited for the Airport and the allocation of immigration personnel is designed to have the maximum number of staff on duty during these peak periods so that all available immigration booths are operational at these times.  The number of available booths is a function of the physical infrastructure at the Terminal.  Every effort is made by immigration officers to exercise their function as speedily as possible consistent with the requirement to protect our borders and facilitate legitimate travellers.</p><p>While the immigration authorities at Dublin Airport have no control over the number of flights or their arrival times, they have an excellent relationship with the Dublin Airport Authority and air carriers and work closely together across a number of fronts to address capacity and queue management issues where they arise, to alleviate congestion and maximise passenger throughput thus ensuring that waiting times are kept to a minimum.</p><p>I might add that a procurement exercise has been recently completed for the deployment of a permanent electronic-Gate facility at Dublin Airpor<b>t.  </b>The new electronic Gates are expected to be available for use by passengers in the Autumn.  However, while the introduction of the electronic gates should contribute overall to increased immigration processing capacity, the facility is primarily an immigration control facility rather than a queue management tool aimed at addressing spikes in passenger arrivals.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  Furthermore when allocations are taking place comprehensive consultation is carried out with local management during which all factors are taken into consideration.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Galway Division on the 30 June 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 571 with 32 Garda Reserves and 46 civilians.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p>  <p>  This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 1,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, nine of whom have been assigned to the Galway Division.  I am also informed that a further 400 Garda recruits are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Galway Division in the coming years.</p>  <p>  The information requested by the Deputy is currently being collated and I will forward it directly to the Deputy when it is to hand.</p></reply>

Under section 17(3) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, it is an offence for a licensee, with intent to evade the conditions of the licence, to take intoxicating liquor from the licensed premises for the purpose of its being sold on the account or for the benefit or profit of the licensee, or to permit any other person to do so.</p>  <p>  In its 2008 Report, the Government Alcohol Advisory Group examined specific issues relating to 'distance sales' of intoxicating liquor.  The Group drew attention to the requirement that payment must be made in such cases as part of the transaction, e.g. on-line shopping, and not later on delivery of the product.  The Group noted that sales of intoxicating liquor which had been ordered by telephone or otherwise and which were paid for by purchasers on delivery were illegal transactions and it recommended that the Garda&iacute; should target such delivery services with a view to prosecuting the licensees concerned.  Any information concerning transactions of this nature which are contrary to the provisions of the Licensing Acts should, therefore, be brought to the attention of the Garda&iacute; for investigation and possible prosecution.  </p>  <p>  Under section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, as amended, it is an offence for a licensee to sell or deliver, or to permit any other person to sell or deliver, alcohol to any person for consumption off his or her premises by a person under the age of 18 years in any place except with the explicit consent of the person's parent or guardian in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission. </p></reply>

My predecessor wrote to the relevant Ministers on this matter and expressed her support for the project.  The responses received make the viability of funding the project, as proposed, unlikely.</p>  <p>  However, my Department continues to examine the fiscal feasibility and resource implications for undertaking a SAVI 2 study and to explore obligations with regard to the necessary public procurement arrangements.  I am sure the Deputy will accept that, as stated previously, the right balance must be struck between the funding of front-line services and providing for research. My Department has recently contacted the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on this matter where they again indicated their support for the project, in principle, but their lack of resources to part fund the project. </p>  <p>  There are other sources of statistics that can be accessed.  The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) 2014 pan-European survey report on violence against women has the advantage of providing the possibility of data comparisons with each of the other 27 member states of the EU. Discussions have begun at a Eurostat level to explore the possibility of some form of replication of the FRA survey.  There is also the June 2016 pan-European Eurobarometer survey on perceptions, attitudes and awareness of gender-based violence.  Figures on sexual violence in Ireland are also available from the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, the Central Statistics Office / An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service and Sexual Assault Treatment Units.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Statistics Office are to explore the feasibility of including a module on sexual violence in its next roll-out of its crime and victimisation survey.  If it becomes an ongoing element of data gathering in CSO&rsquo;s crime and victimisation survey, the information gleaned from this work will provide indications of trends over time of peoples&rsquo; experiences of such violence.</p></reply>

Under section 34 of the 2015 Act, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority is the body which has been given the specific task of preparing, with the support of a public consultation process, a comprehensive report in relation to the education and training (including on-going training) arrangements in the State for legal practitioners, including the manner in which such education and training is provided.

The Court itself recognises the complexities around this issue in that it acknowledges the Executive function in not only controlling who should enter the State but also to regulate the activities of non-citizens while in the State and has had to consider the distinctions of rights between citizens and non-citizens in the context of Article 40.1 of the Constitution.  It has concluded that in an international protection system with no temporal limit on the decision making process, an absolute prohibition on the right to work is contrary to the right to seek employment under the Constitution.  The Court recognises that this is a matter for the Executive and Legislature to consider and accordingly has adjourned consideration of the Order the Court should make for a period of six months.  The State will make submissions to the Court in relation to the format of the Order of the Court is to make at the appropriate time.  In the interim, the legal status as regards access to the labour market for international protection applicants remains unchanged, as set out in Section 16(3)(b) of the International Protection Act 2015.  The final report on the implementation of the MacMahon Report which sets out in detail that 98% of the recommendations are fully or partially implemented reflects the judgement's impact on the area of right to work.</p>  <p>  One of the principal recommendations of the MacMahon Report was to implement a new single application procedure.  The aim of the International Protection Act 2015, which was commenced at the end of last year, is to process cases as quickly as possible so that in due course as cases on hand are cleared, persons in need of international protection are granted status quickly, thereby giving those who qualify an automatic right to work. In many EU Member States, the right to work is not an unfettered right, often arising after a particular period of time - usually 9 months to a year - and in many instances may be limited to particular job categories, the withdrawal of other financial supports, etc.  All of these matters are being carefully considered as to their impact and to reflect the existing requirements  placed on those who come to Ireland as lawful economic migrants, by an inter-Departmental Taskforce which will report back to Government in the Autumn.</p>  <p>  The judgement has significant legal, economic, policy and operational considerations, many of which impact across a range of Government Departments and services.  For this reason, a whole of Government approach has been adopted to examine the implications of the judgment and to propose appropriate solutions as quickly as possible.  The Taskforce, appointed by Government, will examine all of the available legal options to comply with the judgment, including the possibility of an opt-in to the recast Reception Conditions Directive (2013/33/EU).</p></reply>

Members complete an overtime claim form for each roster period which is checked and approved locally by their immediate supervisor and then the District Superintendent.  Claim forms are checked by the local District Finance Officer to ensure compliance with the Garda Finance Code and details are entered into the Garda electronic payment system which has built in checks and parameters that prevent duplicate and excess claims being paid.

However, the general position in relation to refusal of permission to enter the State is as follows.</p>  <p>  There are a total of twelve grounds on which an immigration officer may refuse to give a permission to enter the State and these are set out in Section 4(3) of the Immigration Act 2004 (as amended by the International Protection Act 2015).  A person may be refused permission to enter the State based on one or more of these grounds. Immigration officers are required to provide a written notice to the person refused entry that sets out the reasons for the decision.  In all cases, removals from the State are conducted in accordance with the law.  Translation facilities are available where necessary.   An immigration officer before confirming a decision to refuse permission will consult with his or her Supervisor.</p>  <p>  Section 5 of the Immigration Act 2003 (as amended by the International Protection Act, 2015), contains the main provisions dealing with the removal from the State of persons refused leave to land and specifies that a person to whom this section applies may be arrested by an immigration officer or a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and detained in a prescribed place of detention for the purpose of facilitating their removal from the State, which must be as soon as is practicable.  It is the practice to remove persons from the State on the next available flight.  Arrest, detention and removals from the State are essentially operational matters for the Garda National Immigration Bureau who work closely with civilian immigration officers on these matters.</p>  <p>  In relation to Brazilian nationals, they are not subject to any Irish entry visa requirement.  However, every non-national (whether visa required or not) coming by air or sea from a place outside the State is required, on arrival in the State, to present himself or herself to an immigration officer and apply for permission to enter the State.  The immigration officer will make all necessary enquiries and checks to ensure that the person meets the entry requirements for the intended purpose of stay.</p>  <p>  More generally Ireland operates a fair, secure and effective immigration system, and indeed, the Irish immigration system is one of the least burdensome for visitors. Immigration officers respect the dignity of all persons they engage with and carry out their functions with professionalism and care.  It is equally expected that persons seeking entry to the State provide accurate and full information as to the purpose of their entry.</p></reply>

Some of the LAGs who administered the 2007-2013 LEADER programme in Donegal also delivered the programme in other parts of the country.  For example, Comhar na nOile&aacute;n Teoranta delivered LEADER on the islands.

The programme is based on five pillars:</p><p>- Enabling the creative potential of every child</p><p>- Enabling creativity in every community </p><p>- Investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure </p><p>- Establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production </p><p>- Unifying our Global Reputation </p><p>The Programme includes an ambitious plan to deliver ten major initiatives by the end of 2017 &ndash; see https://creative.ireland.ie for further information. </p><p>The Creative Ireland Programme is not a funding body and as such does not administer any grant or funding schemes.  However, my Department, through the Creative Ireland Programme is taking the opportunity in this, its initial year, to engage and collaborate with several key cultural partners at various important national events and festivals in order to promote the objectives and underlying values of this major new Programme, and encourage deeper understanding and appreciation of the role of the creative arts.  These events and festivals are as follows: <table><tr><th>Event/Festival</th><th>Location</th><th>Cost</th></tr><tr><td>Dalkey Book Festival, (Talks Series)</td><td>Dalkey, Co. Dublin</td><td>&euro;20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Galway Arts Festival, (First Thought Talk Series)</td><td>Galway City</td><td>&euro;15,000</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny Arts Festival, (Ireland &amp;amp; Europe: Creative Visions Talk Series) </td><td>Kilkenny City, Co.

Kerry</td><td>&euro;10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>&euro;145,000</td></tr></table></p><p>The various elements of each festival being supported under the Creative Ireland Programme - particularly the Talk Series &ndash; will help provoke discussion and knowledge sharing about the importance of art, culture and creativity and examine questions such as the importance of national identity, cultural expression and creative new approaches to shared Irish and European challenges.  The target partners have the capacity and a proven track record of reaching a wide and diverse national audience through bespoke audience engagement campaigns and marketing strategies as well as being flagship opportunities to promote the best of Irish culture and creativity. </p><p>In addition to these projects, my Department provided funding to each Local Authority in 2017, to develop Creative Ireland county plans, and to curate events for Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca.  It was a matter for each Local Authority to draw up its own programme of events and activities, and these are available on the Creative Ireland website.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-26a.1811.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017072600035#WRHH05200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 650 and 803 together.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the statistics reported to Maternal Death Enquiry Ireland (MDE Ireland) require anonymisation due to the small number of such incidents occurring across the country's 19 maternity units.  Thus, naming the hospitals and maternity units where such events occurred would not meet the Data Protection standards required for protection of otherwise identifiable patient information (Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, Section 5(h)); such statistics are not, therefore, publicly available.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note updated statistical information published by MDE Ireland for December 2016: </p><p>'For the years 2012-2014, a total of 22 maternal deaths, occurring during or within 42 days of pregnancy end, were identified by MDE Ireland.  Of these 22 deaths, 20 were classified as direct or indirect maternal deaths among 204,999 maternities, giving a maternal mortality rate (MMR) of 9.8 per 100,000 maternities.  A further 2 maternal deaths were attributed to coincidental cases'.  </p><p>Per MDE Ireland, classification of maternal deaths for the triennium 2012-2014 has now been compiled in line with the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidance on classification of maternal moratality, (ICD-MM, WHO 2012)  'in recognition of the importance of maternal suicide and its direct link to pregnancy'.  This reclassification has resulted in a change in the ratios of direct and indirect maternal deaths in this period compared to the previous classification system, the UK Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths (CEMD) which used a disease based classification system but no change in the overall statistics.  The Deputy will find further detail at the following link:<i>.</i></p><p>A maternal death is classified as a Serious Reportable Event (SRE) and as such must be reported through the national Incident management System (NIMS) within 24 hours, investigations commenced within 48 hours of the organisation becoming aware of the incident, and investigations completed within four months of commencement.  I understand that maternal deaths are reported to the Coroner a a 'rule of practice'.</p><p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) Irish Maternity Indicator System (IMIS) second National Report (2015), published in October 2016, provides national results for 30 metrics from all public maternity units and hospitals for 2015.  Senior managers in hospitals are now using IMIS to monitor and manage their hospital activities and continue to take measures to improve the quality of their data and their data collection and reporting processes as well as measures to improve the quality of care delivered.  It is the intention this year, following a review of IMIS in collaboration with staff in the maternity units, to refine definitions of the existing metrics and extend the range of these measurements.  IMIS data is also being used to populate the monthly Maternity Patient Safety Statements, as recommended by the Chief Medical Officer's 2014 Report into perinatal deaths at Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  The IMIS information system supercedes earlier annual reporting as referenced by the Deputy. </p><p>The Government is committed to the progressive development of maternity services.  In 2016, Ireland&rsquo;s first National Maternity Strategy was published, followed by the HSE&rsquo;s National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death and HIQA&rsquo;s National Standards for Safer Better Maternity Services.  In 2017, a National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has been established within the HSE to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services across primary, community and acute care. </p><p>The safety of all users of our maternity services is of paramount importance.  The above initiatives and ongoing developments represent key building blocks to facilitate the provision of a consistently safe and high quality maternity service.</p><p>Finally, in relation to the publication of individual maternity unit reports I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

All healthcare infrastructure developments, including this development, must comply with DPER guidelines and EU directives and will require a lead-in time to complete the various stages.  These stages include appraisal, project brief, design feasibility, detailed design, some of which may overlap, the review of costing estimates and finalisation of financing.</p>  <p>  This project is currently at appraisal stage and is proceeding according to capital planning guidelines.  Based on this early stage of the development, it is expected that the facility will be operational by Q4 2021.</p></reply>

During 2016, the Department of Health convened a cross-sectoral Steering Group to begin work on the development of this Framework. </p>  <p>  Work on the draft framework is well advanced and a stakeholder consultation process on the draft commenced in June.  It is anticipated that the finalised framework, and an associated high-level implementation plan, will be submitted to the Minister for Health in September 2017. </p>  <p>  Recruitment of nurses and midwives is challenging in rural and urban areas at present due to a range of factors, including an international shortage and intense global competition.  Under proposals formulated at the WRC between this Department, DPER, the HSE, the INMO and SIPTU in February and March this year it was agreed that management would increase the HSE&rsquo;s National Workforce Plan for nurses and midwives in 2017 through a broad range of initiatives that will result in the delivery of 1,208 additional permanent posts.  These initiatives include  the conversion of agency employed staff into HSE direct employees and offering all graduating nurses and midwives full time contracts.  Other key measures agreed to support recruitment and retention include maternity leave cover; a career break scheme; 130 additional undergraduate places in 2017; enhanced rates of pay for retirees who return to work and offering nurses and midwives improved educational opportunities and career pathways.  Recruitment measures include careers days, HSE attendance at national and international recruitment fairs, and a communication from the National Director for HR to all Nursing and Midwifery Graduates.</p>  <p>  There has been significant improvements in the numbers employed in the public health service in the past three years, including nursing in the Dublin North East Hospital Group.  The overall number of nurses and midwives in the public health sector has increased from 34,492 (WTE's) in June 2014 to 36,467 in June 2017, while the number in the Dublin North East Hospital Group has increased from 7,837 to 8,395.  Similarly, the number of consultants has increased nationally from 2,587 in June 2014 to 2,883 in June 2017, while the number of NCHDs has increased from 4,943 to 6,058.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to develop plans for a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home care services.</p><p>The statutory scheme for home care will introduce clear rules in relation to what services individuals are eligible for and how decisions are made on allocating services.  For that reason, developing a new statutory scheme will be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home care services.  It will also help to improve access to the home care services that people need, in an affordable and sustainable way.  The system of regulation for home care will help to ensure that the public can be confident that the services provided are of a high standard.</p><p>As an initial step, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake an evidence review of the home care systems that are in place in four other European countries.  This review was published on 11 April.  The Review will help us to learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and will inform the debate and future consideration of approaches to formal home care financing and regulation here in Ireland.</p><p>Another important step in this process is the public consultation on home care services which I, along with Minister Harris, launched on 6 July.  The purpose of this consultation is to allow all those who have views on this topic to have their say, including older people themselves, their families, and healthcare workers.  It will also allow us to find out what people think about current home care services as well as the public&rsquo;s views on what the future scheme should look like.  The consultation paper is available online at <i></i><i><i>/</i></i>and I encourage all those with an interest in home care services to make a submission to the consultation.</p><p>A report of the findings of this consultation process will be published and the findings will be used by the Department in the development of the new home care scheme.</p></reply>

I have contacted the HSE regarding, the HSE funded section 39 charitable organisations that are regulated by the Charities Regulatory Authority in relation to whether they held investments in the tobacco industry through the common investment fund up to the end of 2016, and asked it to reply directly to the Deputy.  If you have not received a reply within fifteen working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow-up the matter with the HSE.</p><p>In relation to guidelines on investing in the tobacco industry, Ireland has ratified and is a party to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). The FCTC is the first global public health treaty.  It is an evidence -based treaty that reaffirms the right of all people to the highest standard of health and was developed by countries in response to the globalisation of the tobacco epidemic.  It aims to tackle some of the causes of that epidemic and Ireland has made very good progress in implementing the FCTC to date.</p><p>Article 5.3 of that legally binding Convention states the following:</p><p><i>&ldquo;In setting and implementing their public health policies with respect to tobacco control, Parties shall act to protect these policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry in accordance with national law&rdquo;.</i></p><p>Guidelines for the implementation of the above-mention Article 5.3 were developed to assist parties.  Paragraphs 4.7 and 7.2 of the guidelines state the following:</p><p><i>&ldquo;4.7 Government institutions and their bodies should not have any financial interest in the tobacco industry, unless they are responsible for managing a Party&rsquo;s ownership in a State-owned tobacco industry.</i></p><p><i>7.2 Parties that do not have a State-owned tobacco industry should not invest in the tobacco industry and related ventures.&rdquo;</i></p><p>My Department has informed Government Departments of their obligations under the guidelines.</p></reply>

GP training programmes are of 4 years duration and all trainees are required to complete 2 years in a hospital setting and 2 years in general practice with a GP trainer.</p><p>It would not be possible to increase the number of training places this year on the scale suggested by the Deputy for a number of reasons.  Firstly, the candidate selection process for 2017 has been completed and the programme commenced earlier this month.  To facilitate such an increase it would be also be necessary to recruit and train additional GP trainers and provide additional doctor training posts in the hospital setting.  Instead, the aim is to increase the number of GP training places on an incremental basis over </p><p>The annual number of training places available has been increased from 120 in 2009 to 170 in 2017. The Government is committed to further increasing this number in future years.</p><p>In relation to costs, year 1 and year 2 of training, GP trainees are based in acute hospitals and fill vacancies at Senior House Officer (SHO) level.  The cost for the 1<sup>st</sup>and 2<sup>nd</sup>years of training when trainees are based in hospitals is approximately &euro;100,000 per trainee per annum.  The cost for the 3<sup>rd</sup>and 4<sup>th</sup>years of training when trainees are based in the GP practices in the community is approximately &euro;110,000 per trainee per annum.  The overall cost of expanding GP training by a further 200 places would also depend on the cost of various training inputs required. The Department does not hold that specific data.</p><p>In 2016 the HSE and the ICGP agreed in principle to transfer operational responsibility for GP training from the HSE to the ICGP and to restructure the organisation of training programmes so as to maximise efficiency and provide a basis for further expansion.  Significant progress has been made in advancing implementation of these changes, though some practical matters are still in the process of being resolved by the HSE and the ICGP.  This transfer would also likely have implications on the average cost of GP training per trainee per annum.</p><p>Officials from my Department and the HSE are working closely with the ICGP to put in place arrangements which will ensure that the future GP workforce needs, including GP training are met.  In addition, the GP contracts review process which is currently underway will seek to arrive at contractual arrangements which will ensure that general practice is an attractive, fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future.</p></reply>

Employing staff working on zero hours contracts is not a policy of the HSE.  In 2014, a home help annualised contract was introduced for HSE employees in conjunction with staff unions which, as well as matching the actual workforce to the changing needs of the service, gives certainty to employees by way of guaranteed weekly minimum paid hours.</p>  <p>  The HSE provide services on a 24 hour a day, 365 days a year basis, particularly in acute hospitals and community care residential settings for the elderly and persons with an intellectual disability.  The HSE have advised that they have staff working on &lsquo;if and when&rsquo; contracts which provide flexibility where hours of work may fluctuate in accordance with service needs.  Staff in medical, nursing and support grades are contracted to provide their contracted hours at any time over a 24-hour period in accordance with accepted norms with regard to rostering arrangements.</p>  <p>  Employees who are engaged on such contracts may be called upon to provide cover for employees who are absent on annual leave, sick leave or other service exigencies which may arise, particularly given the 24/7 nature of health and social care services.  Employees on such contracts do not have fixed contractual hours and are not obliged to accept each assignment they are offered.  As these employees are not obliged to commit to a certain number of hours per week and may decline any assignment which is offered, this working arrangement provides flexibility for employees. </p>  <p>  Employees in the HSE and Section 38 agencies who are engaged on &ldquo;if and when required contracts&rdquo; are granted the same contractual terms and conditions of employment as their whole-time comparators in accordance with the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act, 2001 and have security of tenure.  Where additional hours become available on an ongoing basis (e.g. due to expansion of services or vacancies arising), the HSE advises managers to review the use of such contracts and facilitate any requests from employees who work on an as and when required basis for fixed contractual hours.  </p>  <p>  Any consideration or revision to social welfare entitlements is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

An important step in this process is the public consultation which I, along with Minister Harris, launched on 6 July. The purpose of this consultation is to allow all those who have views on this topic to have their say, including older people themselves, their families, and healthcare workers. It will also allow us to find out what people think about current home care services as well as the public&rsquo;s views on what the future scheme should look like.  This includes views in relation to the scope of the scheme. The consultation paper is available online at  and I encourage all those with an interest in home care services to make a submission to the consultation.</p><p>The findings of the public consultation will be an important input to the process for the development of the new home care scheme.

A further &euro;9m supported by HSE and Atlantic Philanthropies will provide Intensive Home Care Packages (IHCPs) for people with more complex needs. The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2017 provides for a target of 10.57 million Home Help Hours to support about 49,000 people, 16,750<b></b>Home Care Packages<b></b>and<b></b>190<b></b>Intensive Home Care Packages for clients with complex needs including 60 clients with dementia supported with co-funding from Atlantic Philanthropies under the Irish National Dementia Strategy. This represents a significant increase on home care in comparison to last year&rsquo;s Service Plan, which had an original target of 10.4 million hours home help and 15,450 Home Care Packages.</p><p>Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for Home Care continues to grow. It is important to note that the allocation of funding for home care across the system, though significant, is finite and services must therefore be delivered within the funding available. The level of activity and associated costs must be managed in a way that ensures that those with the greatest needs are supported and that the overall expenditure on home care services by the HSE does not exceed the available funding.  </p><p>The Programme for Government commits to increasing funding for Home Care Packages and Home Help every year.

As part of the programme, patients attend rehabilitation sessions under the direct care of nursing staff and the supervision of a consultant cardiologist. </p><p>A critical element of this type of rehabilitative care is the gathering of telemetry data, which is gathered using monitors worn by the patients, while undertaking physical activity during their rehabilitation sessions. </p><p>The Saolta University Healthcare Group has advised that the Letterkenny Cardiac Rehab programme was suspended for the last few weeks on the advice of the Consultant Cardiologist for reasons of patient safety. </p><p>This was due to the technical malfunction of some of the telemetry monitors required to monitor patients during their rehab sessions, resulting from expected wear and tear on the units.</p><p>In light of critical need for the Cardiology Rehab Service in Donegal, the Saolta Group has advised the Department of Health that they have recently given Letterkenny Hospital go ahead to order suitable replacement telemetry devices. </p><p>It is expected that the Cardiology Rehab Service will return to a normal level of operation once the new equipment is in place. This will allow the service to continue supporting cardiac patients along their path to recovery. </p><p>The Saolta Group has confirmed that at no stage have these issues affected the monitoring of telemetry for cardiac patients in need of acute care. Telemetry services continue to be in place in Letterkenny Hospital for these critical patients. </p><p>On a national level, the importance of the continued provision of these services is recognised by the Department of Health and the HSE. To this end, the HSE is currently preparing a Self-Management Support Framework which will specifically target this issue throughout the country. </p><p>In response to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have also asked the HSE to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that in recent times some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.</p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position of the Government and the Oireachtas that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may make a complaint to the HSE Local Health Office, who will deal with the matter in accordance with the HSE's Complaints Policy.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve clarity on this issue, I have asked that any difference of perspective in relation to the provision of phlebotomy services be addressed in the GP contractual review process, which is currently underway. I look forward to constructive and positive engagements with a view to achieving a satisfactory outcome.</p></reply>

The complaint was upheld by the Commissioner, who ruled that the Newborn Screening Card archive be destroyed.  A policy was developed to address both the legal and ethical requirements of the National Newborn Bloodspot Screening Programme (the programme).</p>  <p>  The policy required changes to the programme including retention of the cards for 10 years with consent; and that cards older than 10 years would be destroyed (disposed of in the child&rsquo;s 11th year). This policy was implemented on 1 July 2011, and provides that parent(s)/guardian(s) are given an information leaflet regarding the programme.</p>  <p>  At the time the blood sample is taken (heal prick test), the parent/guardian gives explicit written consent confirming that she/he has received the Parent Information Leaflet; verifies that the details for the baby on the card are correct; consents to the baby being screened and that during the retention period, the card can only be used:</p>  <p>  i) to check the baby&rsquo;s results;</p>  <p>  ii)  for other tests recommended by the child&rsquo;s doctor, for which the parent(s) permission will be sought;</p>  <p>  iii) for quality assurance to develop and improve the screening programme and the health of babies and families in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The agreed policy also required that cards older than 10 years would be disposed of.</p>  <p>  The State remains in breach of both European Union and national data protection legislation in relation to the retention of the cards without consent. The primary intention of the programme is to screen all newborn infants in the State for six conditions and has an uptake of 99.9%. As the most successful public health initiative, it is in the public interest that this level of uptake continues and that public trust and confidence in the programme is neither compromised nor undermined in any way. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health hosted the Forum in October 2016 to provide participants from a broad range of areas with the opportunity to engage in dialogue with international experts regarding the retention and possible secondary uses, including research using cards from the archive and in the future.</p>  <p>  The themes in the Forum report together with international evidence are being considered by officials in my Department to inform policy options to seal the outstanding breach of the Data Protection legislation regarding the cards retained without consent and to provide prospectively for the future retention, storage and potential secondary uses of the cards.  Work on this policy paper is well advanced and will be considered in the coming months.</p></reply>

In November 2015, they presented the draft FDI/Creme Global Reformulation Project results to the Special Action Group on Obesity in November 2015. Representatives on SAGO agreed that a validation process was required and suggested that FDI refer the Report to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) for this purpose. The FDI followed this advice and the FDI/Creme Global Reformulation Project Report was published in 2016 and is available on the FDI website.</p>  <p>  In relation to the food industry/ FSAI liaison, Food Drink Ireland (FDI) meet with FSAI periodically at the industry's request to seek their input into the industry's reformulation work and they also consulted the FSAI on the modelling used to predict the health impact of these reductions in fat, sugar and salt in foods and drinks. </p>  <p>  The FSAI have been validating food industry salt reduction work for many years by sampling foods from the market and having them analysed in the HSE Public Analysts Laboratory in Galway. These data are published annually and are available on the FSAI web site. The FSAI has only recently started to look at validation of the FDI sugar and fat reduction work and have, in the first instance, been developing baseline data on yogurts and breakfast cereals based on labelled data. A report on this work is expected to be published later this year.</p>  <p>  Reformulation information on reduction of sugar in still and carbonated drinks comes from the food industry report: Estimating the impact of reformulation and the introduction of low and no cal beverage products by FDI members on the Irish population, 2016 &ndash; a supplementary report published in line with the FDI/Creme Global Reformulation Project Report.

I want to ensure that existing GP services are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly qualified GPs.</p>  <p>  As of 1 July 2017, 2,491 GPs hold GMS contracts with the HSE and this is continuing to increase year-on-year.  A further 438 GPs hold other contracts to provide services such as immunisation, Heartwatch, Methadone and cancer screening.  The HSE, based on the demographic profile of current GMS GPs, expects that approximately 157 GPs may retire on age grounds between 2017 and 2021.</p>  <p>  Efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practicing GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible/shared GMS/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of enhanced supports for rural GP practices.  These steps should help to address the future demand for GPs by enticing GPs who may have ceased practicing for family or other reasons back into the workforce, facilitating GPs to work past the standard retirement age and encouraging more GPs to work in rural areas.</p>  <p>  Separately, the State is seeking to train more GPs to provide GP services to the population.  In 2009, there were 120 GP training places and in 2017 there were 170 training places filled. The Government is committed to further increasing this number in future years.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there are many challenges in general practice.  That is why I have repeatedly emphasised the need for a new GP services contract which will help modernise our health service and develop a strengthened primary care sector.  The next phase of engagement on a new GP contract is under way and the sustainability of general practice in rural areas will be considered in this context.  The process will also seek to introduce further measures aimed at making general practice a fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future.</p></reply>

This Implementation Programme represents a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with the Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m and the HSE &euro;15.5m. </p>  <p>  Key elements of the initiative include:</p>  <p>  -  the roll-out of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Home Care Packages for people with dementia valued at &euro;22.1 million over a three year period; </p>  <p>  -  the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, to include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points valued at &euro;1.2 million; </p>  <p>  -  measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia valued at &euro;2.7 million.</p>  <p>  The roll out of Intensive Home Care packages commenced in January 2015 and monitoring of the allocation and uptake of these packages to persons with dementia is ongoing. By May 2017, the HSE had delivered a total of 217 dementia-specific intensive homecare packages at an average cost of &euro;953 per week.  There are currently 122 people with dementia in receipt of an Intensive Home Care Package with a further 16 approved and 12 applications in progress.  In addition to the Intensive Home Care Packages the HSE has continued to provide mainstream home help and routine Home Care packages to people with dementia whose needs have been assessed as requiring these supports and within available resources. Up to 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from Intensive Home Care Packages over the lifetime of the implementation programme. </p>  <p>  It is Government policy that, wherever possible and appropriate, people should be cared for in their own homes and communities, and the National Dementia Strategy specifically restates this commitment to those living with dementia. </p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are working on a mid-term review of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy which will be published in the Autumn and will identify the achievements so far and set out the further work that is required to implement the Strategy over the next 12 months and beyond.  The resources required for the ongoing implementation of the Strategy can only be considered in the context of the Estimates and Budget process.  The mid-term review will assist in identifying further actions required and will be helpful in the context of budgetary considerations. </p>  <p>  I confirm receipt of the organisation's pre-budget submission to my Department. It will be considered as part of this process.</p></reply>

There is emerging evidence that this can be applied to support a wide range of medical conditions including mental health, care of the elderly and other chronic conditions that require constant monitoring.  This can be beneficial where care is required in remote locations.  Teleconsultations can have benefits for patients with a known relationship with their GPs and many practitioners consult for follow-up or triage with their own patients by phone or text at present.  However, teleconsultations could pose risks for those patients who have not been evaluated and examined in a face-to-face manner. </p>  <p>  The eHealth strategy envisages providing the necessary technology and infrastructure to support the wider use of telemedicine where clinicians and health care providers can support the business need.  There are no plans at present to include teleconsultations under the current medical card or GP visit card schemes.  While teleconsultation services are being provided by some practitioners, these are being implemented on a pilot basis.  The widespread deployment of teleconsultations in primary and other care settings will need evaluation in terms of patient safety, clinical effectiveness and cost in order to ensure public policy goals are being met.  There will also be a need for guidance and clinical protocols around the appropriate use of teleconsultations to be developed as well as retraining and education of staff and patients. </p>  <p>  In relation to the GP Out-of-Hours services, a national review of the current services is currently underway and is expected to be completed shortly.  This report will make recommendations regarding the future provision of GP Out of Hours services that will serve patient needs within the context of existing and planned service delivery frameworks.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there are many challenges in general practice.  That is why I have repeatedly emphasised the need for a new GP services contract which will help modernise our health service and develop a strengthened primary care sector.  The aim is to develop a new GP services contract which will be capable of accommodating developments in medicine and in technology that may occur over time.  The next phase of engagement on a new GP contract has commenced and I look forward to constructive and positive engagement in the months ahead.</p></reply>

Since that time, new organisational structures have been put in place within the HSE, including the Chief Information Officer role and the development of the entity eHealth Ireland.  Increases in capital spending and resources have been facilitated and the capacity and capability of HSE ICT to successfully undertake large scale ICT projects have been further developed.</p><p>Other recent progress that has been made in relation to eHealth development includes:</p><p>-  The first site for implementing the Maternity and Newborn Clinical Management System (MN-CMS), which is the design and implementation of an electronic health record (EHR) for all women and babies in maternity services in Ireland, went live in Cork in December 2016 with Kerry following in March 2017.  In both locations the new MN-CMS successfully provides digital, 'paper less' processes and this will be replicated to all maternity units in the coming years; </p><p>-  A National Electronic Health Record (E.H.R.) Programme is being progressed with the HSE developing a strategic business case which is currently being reviewed in conjunction with the proposal for a new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, which will be the first digital hospital in the country;</p><p>-  eReferrals<b></b>(National Electronic General GP Referrals) is an initiative that has developed the infrastructure to electronically transmit referrals from GP&rsquo;s to Acute Hospitals.  It has now been rolled out to all six hospital groups;</p><p>-  The Individual Health Identifier (IHI) is the health index of population and is part of the public service identity management framework.  It also covers all private patients.  The IHI is primarily a patient safety initiative that will also enhance patient data security and confidentiality.  On 30 May 2017, a Commencement Order and Regulations under the Health Identifiers Act 2014 were signed. </p><p>Regarding teleconsultation it is generally accepted that teleconsultations mean a virtual medical consultation between health care professionals or between a health care professional and a patient.  There is emerging evidence that this can be applied to support an integrated healthcare approach spanning primary care, mental health, care of the elderly and others. It can also be beneficial where care is required in remote locations.</p><p>The eHealth strategy envisages providing the necessary technology and infrastructure to support the wider use of telemedicine generally, and teleconsultations particularly, where clinicians and health care providers can support the business need.  There are no technological barriers to teleconsultations being made available for widespread use within the context of the health service and some teleconsultation solutions are currently being offered in the private health sector.  The wide-spread deployment of teleconsultations in primary and other care settings will need evaluation in terms of patient safety, clinical effectiveness, stakeholder engagement and cost in order to ensure public policy goals are being met.</p></reply>

The report details, from the point of view and experiences of parents who participated, various issues in relation to the  HSE Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS).  These include, for example, Access, In-Patient Care, Out-Patient Services, and suggested improvements for the future.</p>  <p>  All of the issues raised in this report reflect the strong commitment of the Government, and the HSE, to develop all aspects of CAMHS.  Significant progress has been made in this area over recent years, underpinned by additional funding given since 2012 to develop mental health services.  Notwithstanding acknowledged difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialist CAMHS staff, which the HSE is addressing on an on-going basis, it is my intention that further service improvements be undertaken across CAMHS, including better access and reducing Waiting Lists.  I will continue to closely monitor progress on the agreed priorities for CAMHS as set out in the HSE Service Plan for this year.</p></reply>

Since it is not psychoactive, it is not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation. CBD oil is sometimes marketed as a nutritional or dietary supplement, however it should be noted that it is not authorised as a medicinal product in Ireland.  </p><p>THC is the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis.  Under the Misuse of Drugs legislation products containing THC are strictly controlled and possession is unlawful except under licence.  </p><p>There are two pathways for medical practitioners to prescribe cannabis-based products for medical purposes: (i) through the Medicinal Cannabis Access Programme (which is currently being established); (ii) through the Ministerial licence application route.  </p><p>(i)<i><i>Medicinal Cannabis Access Programme:</i></i></p><p>In February I published the Health Products Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (HPRA) report &lsquo;Cannabis for Medical Use &ndash; A Scientific Review&rsquo; and undertook to establish an Access Programme for cannabis-based treatments, for patients under the care of a medical consultant, for certain medical conditions, including severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy.  </p><p>An expert reference group has been established to operationalise this access programme.  This work is being progressed.  </p><p>(ii)<i><i>Ministerial licence application route </i></i></p><p>Pending implementation of the Cannabis Access Programme, and for medical conditions that are not included in the Cannabis Access Programme: under existing legislation it is open to me as Minister to consider granting a licence to an Irish registered medical practitioner, under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, for access to medical cannabis for named patients.  In line with the Chief Medical Officer's advice, the granting of a licence for cannabis for medical purposes must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.  </p><p>The main elements of an application submitted under the Misuse of Drugs legislation for a licence for cannabis for medicinal use must include: </p><p>-  An outline of the treatment the patient has received to date and justification from the doctor as to why it is appropriate in their patient&rsquo;s specific circumstances to prescribe a Schedule 1 drug.</p><p>-  Details of the cannabis-based product which it is proposed to prescribe and administer to the patient. </p><p>-  The source of the cannabis-based product. </p><p>-  The arrangements for the ongoing monitoring and care of the patient once the cannabis-based treatment has commenced.</p><p>Ultimately it is the decision of the clinician, in consultation with their patient, or their patient's guardian, to prescribe or not prescribe a particular treatment for a patient under their care.  The Minister for Health has no role in this clinical decision-making process.</p></reply>

Public patients may access the healthcare they require in either the public or private healthcare system of another Member State under the Cross-Border Directive (CBD).  Access to healthcare abroad is based on patients following public patient pathways, i.e. they must demonstrate they have followed the equivalent public patient pathways that a patient would follow if accessing public healthcare in Ireland.  It is important to note that reimbursement is confined to the costs of the care itself and that the rates of reimbursement cannot exceed the cost of provision of the care if it were provided in the Irish public health service.  Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other HSE clinicians.  The CBD excludes certain health services, e.g. services of public health, long term care, organ transplantation, etc.  All persons on public waiting lists, other than for such exempt health services, are eligible for the Scheme.</p><p>Full details of the scheme is available on the HSE website: <i>www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/</i>.</p></reply>

This has resulted in approximately 800,000 people now being eligible for GP care without fees without having to undergo a means test.</p>  <p>  The introduction of GP care without fees to children under 6 represents a major step forward in improving access, quality and affordability of health care in Ireland.  The under 6s service contract, which includes age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and a dedicated cycle of care for children with asthma, underlines the Government's commitment to enhancing primary care and keeping people well in their community.  To date, just over 364,700 children have access to GP care without fees through a medical card or GP visit card and approximately 95% of GMS GPs have entered into agreements with the HSE for the provision of services to children under 6. Children are included in this scheme until the end of the month of the child's 6th birthday.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to extend in phases, and subject to negotiation with GPs, free GP care to all children under 18 years of age.  Legislative changes will be required for any such extension of free GP care to further cohorts of the population.  The timetable will be subject to the outcome of discussions with GP representatives on this and other contractual matters currently being discussed.</p></reply>

In 2014, PHECC developed the First Aid Response (FAR) education and training standard, building on its foundational Cardiac First Response course.</p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is responsible for the enforcement of occupational first aid (OFA) provisions of Part 7 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007.  I understand that the HSA have proposed to change over from the OFA to the FAR standard, and on 1 September next, FAR will become the recognised standard to meet occupational first aid needs in the workplace.  The HSA, PHECC and other stakeholders have been working together on the transition and I have been advised that due consideration has been given to concerns raised in relation to the variances between both standards.</p>  <p>  To address concerns, the PHECC Education and Standards Committee has prioritised the review of the FAR Standard, including its content and course duration.  This work is currently in progress, and it is anticipated that it will be completed by the end of the year.  In addition, a FAR project team is working to streamline the PHECC administrative processes for application and review for Recognised Institution status and associated FAR course approvals.  It is expected that these actions will help reduce the time needed by PHECC to review and quality assure applications from prospective organisations including current OFA training providers.  However, it will be necessary for PHECC to make certain that the high level of quality standards expected of PHECC's Recognised Institutions, and the instructors authorised to deliver the FAR education and training standard, is maintained.</p></reply>

The HSE has not formally wrote to me or the Department yet in relation to resource requirements.  However, following my appointment as Minister of State for Mental Health and Older People I have met and been briefed by officials from both the Department and the HSE on relevant issues including in particular the demand for the home care which continues to grow in parallel with the increasing numbers of older people.  In the context of these discussions the HSE provided an outline of requirements.  The HSE will be engaging further on these issues with my Department over the coming months in the context of the budget process.</p><p>The overall funding for Services for Older People is &euro;765 million in 2017 with &euro;367m for direct funding of Home Help and Home Care Packages.  A further &euro;9m supported by HSE and Atlantic Philanthropies will provide Intensive Home Care Packages (IHCPs) for people with more complex needs.  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2017 provides for a target of 10.57 million Home Help Hours to support about 49,000 people, 16,750<b></b>Home Care Packages<b></b>and<b></b>190<b></b>Intensive Home Care Packages for clients with complex needs including <b>60 </b>clients with dementia supported with co-funding from Atlantic Philanthropies under the Irish National Dementia Strategy.  This represents a significant increase on home care in comparison to last year&rsquo;s Service Plan, which had an original target of 10.4 million hours home help and 15,450 Home Care Packages.</p><p>Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for Home Care continues to grow.  It is important to note that the allocation of funding for home care across the system, though significant, is finite and services must therefore be delivered within the funding available.  The level of activity and associated costs must be managed in a way that ensures that those with the greatest needs are supported and that the overall expenditure on home care services by the HSE does not exceed the available funding.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to increasing funding for Home Care Packages and Home Help every year.  The planning and management of future health expenditure will be considered as part of the annual estimates and budgetary process which seeks to balance available funding across all of the various service areas to achieve the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of service users and prioritise areas of greatest need.</p><p>Finally I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to promoting care in the community for older people so that they can continue to live in their own homes for as long as possible.  On 6 July Minister Harris and I announced the opening of a public consultation on home care services.  The purpose of this consultation is to allow all those who have views on this topic to have their say, including older people themselves, their families, and healthcare workers.  The Department wants to find out what people think about current home care services and would also like to hear the public&rsquo;s views on what the future scheme should look like.  I strongly urge all those with an interest in home care services to make a submission to the consultation.  The consultation is an important step to inform the development of a Statutory Scheme for homecare, which is being prioritised by my Department.  The development of such a Scheme will improve the operation of the homecare system and access to services that people need in an affordable and sustainable way.</p></reply>

The HSE Breastfeeding Action Plan, <i>Breast Feeding in a Healthy Ireland</i>, 2016 &ndash; 2021 sets out the priority areas to be addressed over the next 5 years to improve breastfeeding supports, to enable more mothers in Ireland to breastfeed and to improve health outcomes for mothers and children in Ireland.

However, since May, there has been an increase in trolley numbers due to a series of factors including, increased ED attendances, ED admission rates, elective activity and delayed discharges at certain hospitals.  For example this year to the end of June attendances at EDs have increased by 1.7% nationally. </p>  <p>  In September 2016 the HSE launched its &lsquo;Winter Initiative Plan 2016-2017&rsquo; which provided &euro;40 million of additional funding for winter preparedness.  This Initiative was developed to manage the expected winter surge in demand for hospital care in an integrated way across Primary, Acute and Social Care.  It ran over the winter period, from early October and concluded at the end of March.  Following on from the Winter Initiative, a Roadmap was developed by the HSE and Department, setting out an approach to driving incremental reduction through process improvement in both trolley numbers and wait times.</p>  <p>  Currently the HSE is engaged in a process of working with Hospital Groups and individual hospitals to progress winter planning for this year.  In addition the Department, in conjunction with the HSE, continue to examine possible measures to be put in place as part of a programme of work to be implemented over the next 18 months aimed at providing improved access to scheduled and unscheduled care. </p></reply>

Any underspend that arises against agreed allocations is surrendered to the Exchequer at the end of the year.</p>  <p>  At end June 2017, the Health Vote is &euro;55m under profile in Vote terms.  However, this largely reflects profiling issues and the timing of cash disbursements to the HSE in particular.  Expenditure on capital construction and equipping is currently under profile due to timing issues on the progress of a number of projects which have not progressed as initially projected.  Expenditure is expected to progress steadily as construction begins.  My Department does not anticipate any surplus on the Health Vote in 2017.</p>  <p>  Whilst the Vote is below profile, a deficit exists in income &amp;amp; expenditure terms in the HSE, with pressures evident in acute hospital and disability services in particular.  My Department is engaging with the HSE in relation to the issue, cognisant of the need to minimise any potential deficit.</p>  <p>  It is too early, at this stage, to accurately assess any projected overall deficit in 2017.  The Department will continue to work with the HSE to ensure that every effort is made to maximise cost containment and cost avoidance measures while delivering on the commitments set out in the NSP 2017 and, as provided in the Health (Amendment) Act, that all expenditure must be managed within the level of the net non-capital determination notified to the HSE.</p></reply>

I want to ensure that existing GP services are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly qualified GPs.</p>  <p>  The annual number of training places available has been increased from 120 in 2009 to an intake of 170 in 2017.  The Government is committed to further increasing this number in future years.</p>  <p>  Further efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practicing GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible/shared GMS/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices.  These steps should help to address the future demand for GPs by enticing GPs who may have ceased practicing for family or other reasons back into the workforce, facilitating GPs to work past the standard retirement age and encouraging more GPs to work in rural areas.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have repeatedly emphasised the need for a new GP services contract which will help modernise our health service and develop a strengthened primary care sector, and health service management have already progressed a number of significant measures through engagement with GP representatives in recent years.  The next phase of engagement on a new GP contract is under way.  I am keen to ensure that future contractual terms for GPs would enjoy the support of the broad community of GPs and in this regard officials from my Department and the HSE are engaging with the relevant GP representative bodies in relation to the wide range of matters which will need to be encompassed by the contract development process.  The GP contracts review process will, among other things, seek to introduce further measures aimed at making general practice a fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to a decisive shift within the health service towards primary care in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country.  The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services will be a key element in facilitating this process.</p>  <p>  The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions.  A new contract should be flexible and be able to respond to the changing nature of the GP workforce.  It should also include provisions in relation to service quality and standards, performance, accountability and transparency.  I think this will be key in making general practice a more attractive career.</p>  <p>  Since 2015, negotiations have resulted in a number of service developments including the provision of free GP care to under 6's and over 70's, the introduction of a Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult GMS patients with Type 2 Diabetes and enhanced supports for rural GPs.  The next phase of discussions on a new GP contract is under way and officials from my Department and the HSE meet with the two GP representative bodies the IMO and the NAGP on a regular basis.  The most recent meetings were held on 12 July and 30 June respectively and further meetings are confirmed for early August.</p>  <p>  I understand that the discussions taking place are wide ranging and definitely ambitious in their scope.  I think it is important to acknowledge that this will not be a straight forward process.  As with any negotiation-type process, and given the range and complexity of the issues to be discussed, the engagement may take some time.  It would not be appropriate at this stage to comment on progress to date.  While there will be challenges for all parties involved, I would hope that everyone will remain focused on our common goal of putting suitable new arrangements in place that will work for patients, GPs, and other health care providers in primary care.  I look forward to continued ongoing positive engagement with GP representatives in the months ahead.</p></reply>

At the end of June 2017 there were 2,883 whole time equivalents.  This constitutes an increase of 296 since June 2014 and an increase of almost 700 in the past decade.  The number of NCHDs has also increased significantly, from 4,943 at the end of June 2014 to 6,058 at the end of April 2017, in order to support workforce planning, service delivery and progression of compliance with the provisions of the European Working Time Directive.</p><p>In February 2017 the HSE published &lsquo;<i>Successful Consultant Recruitment, Appointment and Retention&rsquo;.</i>This report analyses the current operational and administrative barriers to efficient creation, and approval of and recruitment to Consultant posts.  It examines the factors influencing applications for such posts and related workforce and service planning, delays in the application and approval process, the implementation of the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s regulatory functions, the interaction between the range of agencies involved in Consultant recruitment and how successful candidates are supported in the early stages of appointment.  The report proposes actions to address each of these issues and these actions are currently being implemented.</p><p>It is Government policy to have a consultant provided public health service.  For that reason, I continue to support the education and training of NCHDs, and the recruitment of additional consultants to the sector. In July 2013, a Working Group, chaired by Prof Brian MacCraith, President, Dublin City University, was established to carry out a strategic review to examine and make high-level recommendations relating to training and career pathways for doctors.  Implementation of the recommendations of the Group continues to be a priority for me, my Department, and the Health Service Executive.  Giving effect to one of the Group's key recommendations, agreement at the WRC in January 2015 has substantially restored pay for new entrant consultants.</p><p>The Programme for Government provides for negotiation of a new consultant's contract.  However, it should be noted that there are approximately 800 consultants pursuing High Court cases in respect of increases in pay provided for in the 2008 Consultant Contract.  The then Government determined in 2009 that the increases could not be paid given the economic downturn and the need to use all available health funding on the provision of services.  This Government intends to vigorously defend these cases. </p></reply>

The screening of women from the age of 25 is in line with international best practice. </p>  <p>  Invasive cervical cancer is extremely rare in women aged under 25, with less than 5 women in this age group being diagnosed with this condition each year.  While changes in the cells of the cervix are very common for those under 25, in the vast majority of cases these changes will settle and return to normal without intervention.  If the screening age was lowered to invite those under 25 for smear tests, young women could be subjected to unnecessary treatment that could have potential long-term negative effects on their health and fertility.</p>  <p>  The Department encourages all women aged under 25 to be vigilant about their health and to consult their GP immediately if they have any symptoms which could raise the suspicion of cervical cancer.  If necessary, their GP will refer them to a gynaecology clinic for further investigation. Meanwhile, any women concerned about their family risk of cancer should discuss this with their GP.</p>  <p>  The Department also encourages all 12-18 year old schoolgirls to avail of the free HPV vaccination which is offered in secondary schools.</p></reply>

According to the manufacturer&rsquo;s website &ldquo;Epidiolex development is initially concentrating on severe, orphan, early-onset, treatment-resistant epilepsy syndromes including Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and Infantile Spasms (IS)&rdquo;.</p><p>Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the market the manufacturer must seek an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), or in the case of certain medicines, the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  To my knowledge, no application for a marketing authorisation for Epidiolex has yet been submitted by the product manufacturer GW Pharmaceuticals to either the HPRA or the EMA.</p><p>In February I published the HPRA report &lsquo;Cannabis for Medical Use - A Scientific Review&rsquo;, on foot of which I committed to the implementation of a Cannabis for Medical Use Access Programme, in line with the HPRA&rsquo;s recommendations.  In March I established the Cannabis for Medical Use Expert Reference Group to advise on the development of the Access Programme.  The Expert Group is chaired by Dr Mair&iacute;n Ryan, Director of Health Technology Assessment at the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), and comprises representation from the areas of oncology, palliative care, anaesthesiology, general practice, adult neurology, paediatric neurology, multiple sclerosis, psychiatry, pharmacy, patients, and ethics as well as representatives from HIQA&rsquo;s Health Technology Assessment Directorate, the HPRA, the National Medicines Information Centre and the Department of Health. </p><p>The Expert Group is tasked with the development of operational guidance for healthcare professionals treating patients through the Access Programme.  A critical requirement for the successful establishment of a Cannabis for Medical Use Access Programme is meaningful engagement with representative bodies, clinicians, patients, and pharmacists so that these groups are integral to the drafting of operational clinical guidance.</p><p>The draft Clinical Guidance on the Medical Use of Cannabis developed by the Expert Group is out for consultation.  The clinical guidance will include the forms of medicinal cannabis that will be permitted for use under the access programme and will outline the requirements for education of healthcare professionals and patients, as well as ethical implications of such a scheme.  The systematic process employed to develop this guidance is based on the National Standards for Clinical Practice Guidance Development.  This work will take a number of months to complete.</p><p>It is important to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland (RCPI) statement, released in March 2017, on the use of cannabis products in the treatment of severe epilepsy in children and adults.  In this statement the consultants involved in the treatment of epilepsy state that <i>&quot;currently the main barrier to the prescribing of cannabis derivatives for epilepsy is the lack of clinical evidence of its long-term efficacy, as well as lack of data on long-term side effects.&rdquo;</i>The position of the RCPI further demonstrates the importance of any discussions relating to a patient&rsquo;s care being conducted in the clinical setting in consultation with the expert clinicians, the patient and their family. </p><p>It is the professional decision of the clinician, in consultation with their patient, to prescribe or not prescribe any particular treatment for a patient under their care.  The independence of the doctor-patient relationship is a fundamental principle upon which medical practice is based.  As Minister for Health I have no role in the professional clinical decision-making process.</p></reply>

While the Government's objective is to deliver a high quality, integrated and cost effective health care service the mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care centres is dependent on a number of factors.  Some of these factors are outside the control of the Health Service Executive.  Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care infrastructure is subject to suitable locations being offered / provided / available, to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff.</p>  <p>  The HSE proposes to develop a new primary care centre on the St. Davnet's Campus in Monaghan town.  A design team has been appointed and is currently compiling a Feasibility Study.</p>  <p>  Future investment in healthcare infrastructure, including this project, must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.  The HSE will continue to apply the available funding for infrastructure development in the most effective way possible to meet current and future needs, having regard to the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.  As there will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer, capital funding is not ring-fenced by project in order to ensure that the HSE has flexibility within its capital allocation in the event that one or more of the hundreds of construction projects underway at any time do not progress as scheduled.  This enables the HSE to leverage its capital allocation efficiently, so that it delivers the maximum number of priority projects for the funding available.</p></reply>

The project is in line with the overall Development Control Plan for the hospital, which is currently being finalised.  The design team was appointed earlier this year and is currently finalising the design feasibility.  It is hoped that an application for planning permission will be lodged later this year.</p>  <p>  The project is currently funded to design stage only.  Further funding for the next phase of development of this project is dependent on the costing and timing of the project, the availability of resources in the context of many other demands across the country, the future capital envelope for the health service and the overall priorities for future service development in the Ireland East Hospital Group.  It is proposed that there will be a mid-term review of the State&rsquo;s capital envelope, which will assess progress and review emerging pressures and demands.  It is expected that this mid-term review will be completed in 2017.</p>  <p>  There has been fundraising for this project by the Friends of Mullingar Hospital which I understand has raised in the region of &euro;150,000.</p></reply>

Electronic cigarettes are regulated by the European Union (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco and Related Products) Regulations 2016.  These Regulations transposed the European Tobacco Products Directive and came into effect on 20 May 2016.  </p>  <p>  The Department, in pursuing the recommendations of Tobacco Free Ireland, requested the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to carry out a health technology assessment (HTA) of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical smoking cessation products and service.  HIQA took full account of all submissions received in the course of the Health Technology Assessment.</p>  <p>  Taxation is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.

The terms of reference of this multisectoral group includes the development of clinical guidance documents and recommendations in relation to the use of HIV PrEP in Ireland.</p>  <p>  A report on population estimates of MSM (men who have sex with men) eligible and likely to avail of PrEP in Ireland, using data from the Men who have Sex with Men Internet Survey Ireland (MISI) 2015 survey, was developed in collaboration with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC).</p>  <p>  The working group is exploring questions in relation to the feasibility, acceptability and uptake of HIV PrEP in Ireland and work has commenced on identifying how these priority questions can be answered through a project within existing clinical infrastructures.</p>  <p>  In addition, the working group had explored the possibility of running a &lsquo;demonstration project&rsquo; in Ireland with the support of a manufacturer of a relevant authorised product, however, I understand that the demonstration project is not being pursued at this juncture as the window of opportunity has now closed.</p>  <p>  The working group has also progressed work on the development of standards for PrEP service provision and other issues relevant to any future &lsquo;model of care&rsquo; and implementation of a PrEP clinical service within a HIV prevention programme to people who would meet determined eligibility criteria and in services meeting agreed standards. </p>  <p>  A pharmaceutical manufacturer has submitted a rapid review dossier to the HSE and a rapid review has been formally commissioned from the NCPE (National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics).  This is in line with the standard process under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  Given the likely scale of investment that would be required to support the introduction of PrEP, it may also require a full Health Technology Assessment.  The timeline to complete this process would be in the order of at least 6 to 12 months.</p></reply>

Criteria used include the population&rsquo;s health needs, the product&rsquo;s cost and clinical effectiveness, opportunity costs, the budget impact and available resources. </p>  <p>  HSE decisions are supported by health technology assessments (HTAs), which systematically assess whether a drug is a cost-effective health intervention.  Most new medicines undergo HTAs, but not all applications have sufficient information for assessment.  Also, as HTAs frequently cannot demonstrate value for money at the price sought, lengthy price negotiations may be needed.  These factors contribute significantly to the length of the approval process.</p>  <p>  Under the 2016 Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines, the HSE may negotiate price and supply conditions.  Reaching a sustainable pricing structure can be a long process.  Put simply, some manufacturers, as monopoly suppliers, seek very high prices that may not reflect the drug&rsquo;s effectiveness and that are unsustainable for our health service.</p>  <p>It is right to exercise diligence when considering such commitments.  Every effort should be made to secure the best outcome for the patient, the health service and the taxpayer.  This includes seeking realistic and sustainable pricing and supply models for new treatments.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also begun working with other Member States to explore ways to share expertise and resources, so we can all gain access to new treatments in realistic time frames and at fair prices.</p></reply>

Statutory Instrument No. 602 of 2016 details fees applicable for 2017. </p>  <p>  I understand that the &lsquo;increase in registration fees&rsquo; referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the introduction of a new fee model to cover the cost of the HPRA&rsquo;s regulatory activities for medical devices.  This fee model, which is incorporated in S.I. No. 602 of 2016, was subject to a specific public consultation during July and August of 2015 to allow affected stakeholders to provide comments and proposals on the model. All of the details and the outcome of this consultation is publicly available on the HPRA&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  The HPRA have been engaging with industry, trade associations and others on the introduction of medical device fees since 2013 and on the basis of responses to the 2015 consultation.  During 2016 the fee model was amended and clarified based on the consultation responses and ongoing dialogue with stakeholders who engaged in the process. </p>  <p>  The HPRA has committed to review the fee model on an annual basis.  Further engagement is possible through a public consultation on this process where all stakeholders are encouraged to engage in the consultation and submit feedback.</p></reply>

It is important therefore that we upgrade our public bed stock and this is the aim of the 5 year Capital Investment Programme for Community Nursing Units which was announced last year.  This provides the framework to allow for an enhanced programme to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities, as appropriate.  Significant work was undertaken to determine the most optimum scheduling of projects within the phased provision of funding to achieve compliance with National Standards.  By the end of 2016 I understand that 14 projects were operational and a further 12 are expected to be operational by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  Under this Programme it is proposed to build a new 130 bed community nursing unit in Letterkenny by the end of 2021, through a Public Private Partnership or alternative funding model, to replace existing long-stay accommodation including that provided at St Joseph's, Stranorlar and Ramelton and Lifford Community Hospitals. </p>  <p>  Operational responsibility for delivering the programme is a matter for the HSE.  The Executive has advised that the Letterkenny project is currently at Design Feasibility stage with a projected completion date of 2021.  As part of the preparatory work for the development of the new community nursing unit, I understand that the HSE is undertaking a review of the three Community Hospitals, referred to by the Deputy with a view to identifying any options for their future use.</p></reply>

This draft Clinical Guidance document on the Medical Use of Cannabis under the Access Programme is currently out for stakeholder consultation.</p>  <p>  Work is continuing on aspects of the Access Programme such as: education requirements for healthcare professionals and patients in relation to the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes; establishment of a central registry through which the scheme can be monitored; requirements for  monitoring mechanisms through which the scientific developments in this area can be monitored over time, clarification of the ethical implications that the Access Programme may have for patients, the general public, healthcare professionals or the health system; drafting of secondary legislation under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  </p>  <p>  Work on the project and legislative amendments is progressing and will take a number of months to complete.  </p>  <p>  Cannabis is listed in Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2017, which means that it is subject to the strictest level of control; however, under the Misuse of Drugs legislation it is open to the Minister for Health to consider granting a licence to an Irish-registered medical practitioner for access to medical cannabis for a named patient.</p>  <p>  Under these existing arrangements, which will continue in parallel to the Cannabis Access Programme once it is established, medical practitioners wishing to prescribe cannabis-based products containing THC for medical purposes may apply via the Ministerial licence application route.  The Chief Medical Officer has advised that the granting of such a licence must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.  The Minister for Health has no role in the clinical decision-making process.  </p>  <p>  A licence application endorsed by the patient&rsquo;s medical consultant and submitted under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, use must include:</p>  <p>  - an outline of the treatment the patient has received to date and justification from the doctor as to why it is appropriate in their patient&rsquo;s specific circumstances to prescribe a cannabis-based product;</p>  <p>  - details of the cannabis-based product which it is proposed to prescribe and administer to the patient;</p>  <p>  - the source of the cannabis-based product;</p>  <p>  - arrangements for the ongoing monitoring and care of the patient once the cannabis-based treatment has been initiated.</p>  <p>  Where consultants require further information or clarification in relation to the licence application process, he or she should contact the Department of Health directly.  Ultimately it is the decision of the clinician, in consultation with their patient, to prescribe or not prescribe a particular treatment for a patient under their care.  It is the decision of the medical practitioner to make an application to the Minister for Health for such a licence.</p></reply>

Dr Holohan advises that the independence of the doctor-patient relationship is a fundamental principle upon which medical practice is based and that it would be neither appropriate nor ethical for the Minister for Health to seek to influence this relationship.</p>  <p>   Dr Holohan further advises that the clinical considerations that inform the judgement of a consultant who is caring for a patient are matters which are subject to patient confidentiality, and as such neither I nor my officials have any right to enquire into them.  Specifically, it would be wholly inappropriate for a Minister for Health to seek to instruct or influence any doctor to prescribe a particular treatment. </p></reply>

This Implementation Programme represents a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with the Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m and the HSE &euro;15.5m.</p>  <p>  Key elements of the initiative include:</p>  <p>  - the roll-out of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Home Care Packages for people with dementia valued at &euro;22.1 million over a three year period;</p>  <p>  - the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, to include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points valued at &euro;1.2 million;</p>  <p>  - measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia valued at &euro;2.7 million.</p>  <p>  The roll out of Intensive Home Care packages commenced in January 2015 and monitoring of the allocation and uptake of these packages to persons with dementia is ongoing.  By end of June 2017, the HSE had delivered a total of 227 dementia-specific intensive homecare packages at an average cost of &euro;953 per week.  There are currently 132 people with dementia in receipt of an Intensive Home Care Package with a further 12 approved.  In addition to the Intensive Home Care Packages the HSE has continued to provide mainstream home help and routine Home Care packages to people with dementia whose needs have been assessed as requiring these supports and within available resources.  Up to 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from Intensive Home Care Packages over the lifetime of the implementation programme. </p>  <p>  It is Government policy that, wherever possible and appropriate, people should be cared for in their own homes and communities, and the National Dementia Strategy specifically restates this commitment to those living with dementia. </p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are working on a mid-term review of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy which will be published in the Autumn and will identify the achievements so far and set out the further work that is required to implement the Strategy over the next 12 months and beyond.  The resources required for the ongoing implementation of the Strategy can only be considered in the context of the Estimates and Budget process.  The mid-term review will assist in identifying further actions required and will be helpful in the context of budgetary considerations.</p></reply>

These improvements are shaped by my Departments Healthy Eating Guidelines, which were updated in 2016.</p><p>Patient nutrition and catering in Acute Hospitals are managed locally within the HSE.  However as part of the HSE Healthy Ireland implementation, plans at hospital group level, with the support of the Acute Hospitals division, and the Health and Wellbeing division have identified two strategic actions to improve food and nutrition in hospitals.  These are:</p><p>- the development of a Food and Nutrition Policy and Implementation Plan for  hospitals.  This will support all hospitals, through their nutrition and hydration steering committees, to provide leadership and promote and sustain improvement in relation to nutrition and hydration.  This includes the nutritional analysis of menus, protected mealtimes, malnutrition screening, therapeutic diets and assistance with eating as well as the healthier food environment for staff and visitors.</p><p>Many hospitals are implementing some of these initiatives already and the HSE will provide a forum to share best practice between Acute Hospitals and drive improvements where needed in 2017 and 2018.</p><p>A project dietitian to lead on the development of a Food and Nutrition Policy in the HSE has recently been appointed and commenced work on this project.  This builds on the HSE commitment to providing healthier food environments for staff and visitors by the implementing C<i>alorie Posting on Menus</i>in all hospitals and the ongoing implementation of the HSE Healthier vending policy.</p><p>- The second project involves working with the Department of Health through the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC).  In October 2015, a guideline for the Prevention and Treatment of Under-nutrition in the Acute Care Setting was prioritised by the NCEC to be developed as a national clinical guideline.  This will ensure malnutrition screening and assessment is in place and appropriate early identification and referral on to services when required.  Work on developing the guideline is underway by a multidisciplinary guideline development group.  Five meetings have been held to date and the clinical and economic evidence are currently being assessed.  The final guideline will contain recommendations on prevention and treatment of under-nutrition and be supported by a budget impact analysis and an implementation plan.  The guideline will undergo quality assurance by the NCEC and it is planned to publish in 2018.</p></reply>

I have also listened to the various views expressed during the recent D&aacute;il debate on the report.  During this debate, the level of agreement and support for the broad vision and strategic direction outlined in the report was clearly evident, but so too was the acknowledgement and the understanding of the complexity and challenges involved in implementation. </p>  <p>  I have briefed Government colleagues on the report.  It is my intention now to move forward as a matter of urgency with putting in place the necessary structures and processes, including personnel, to undertake the development of a detailed response and plan, which will be submitted for the approval of Government later in the year.  I expect that Government will give further consideration to these matters very shortly.</p></reply>

My Department has implemented a robust monitoring framework in this regard.</p><p>The NTPF submit regular reports to the Department of Health on the number of patients treated, referring hospitals, treating hospitals, and treatment specialty.  It may not be possible to make specific information on costs in relation to individual private hospitals available due to its commercial sensitivity however, the NTPF provide to the Department financial reports regarding the waiting list initiatives.</p></reply>

Article 2 of the Convention precludes countries from fishing in another country&rsquo;s 0-6m zone.  However, Article 9 of the Convention gave countries the option to come to arrangements with their neighbours to allow access inside the 0-6 nautical mile zone if so desired.  This was the basis for the Voisinage  arrangements.</p>  <p>  The UK Government had been intimating its intention to withdraw from the Convention for some time.  It is nonetheless unwelcome and unhelpful as it suggests a signal of the UK intent to take a hard line on fisheries in the context of Brexit.</p>  <p>  However, there are no immediate direct impacts for the Irish fishing industry from this action as it will not take effect for two years and the Irish fleet is not significantly dependant on this access. The Irish fleet is heavily dependent on access to the UK 12 to 200 mile zone.</p>  <p>  Any longer term impacts will only become clear in the overall context of the Brexit negotiations. It is the message of intent and the potential implications of that intent in the wider 12 to 200 mile zone that causes concern for the negotiations to come.</p>  <p>  I spoke with Secretary of State Michael Gove recently and stressed to him the importance of long established fishing patterns by the Irish fishing fleet and the importance of these being acknowledged and protected in the context of Brexit.</p>  <p>  As the negotiations develop, unilateral sectoral announcements, like this one, will be dealt with, as this will be, within the Brexit negotiation process and there will be no room, or indeed intent, to address issues in isolation.</p>  <p>  I am working closely with our fishing industry and held a detailed public discussion with stakeholders last month in Galway.  I will remain in close contact with fisheries stakeholders as the issues develop and work with them and my fellow fisheries Ministers in the EU to ensure that we are all fully prepared for what are likely to be extremely complex negotiations.</p>  <p>  The UK has stated it wants to retain the voisinage arrangements element of the London Fisheries Convention.  It remains to be seen if it can legally do this.  On the all-island basis, however, there is still merit that we should reflect on an all-island approach to these matters.  As I said at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine recently, we will have to reflect on all relevant issues in the context of Brexit negotiations.</p></reply>

In this context, and as referred to above, Section 3 of the Act makes provision for Ministerial Policy Directives to issue to the independent Licensing Authority for Sea-fishing Boats.  I am, however, precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to individual cases, or a group of cases, with which the Licensing Authority is or may be concerned under Section 3(5) of the 2003 Act.</p>  <p>  I received proposals from a Producer Organisation (PO) which, in summary, relate to the possibility of reducing the requirement to provide 100% replacement capacity with the relevant track record to 80% (the balance being sourced from capacity without track record).  I undertook a public consultation process on these proposals and made a consultation paper available which set out the background to fleet policy and carried out an analysis of the current situation.  The consultation paper examined the implications of the proposals made by the Producer Organisation and also put forward alternative options.  Twenty-six submissions were received during the public consultation period which ended on 28 February 2017.</p>  <p>  Having carefully considered these submissions and the proposals put forward by the Producer Organisation, I can inform the Deputy that I am making my decision on this matter at present.  Once I have made my decision, which is imminent, I will advise the fishing industry representative groups accordingly.  I will also make my decision public and have my conclusions published on my Department's website as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Directive aims to protect water from pollution from agriculture and requires that measures within Member States' Nitrates Action Programmes are reviewed every four years.  The starting point of each review is an assessment by the European Commission of the results of water quality analysis and the impact of the measures within the existing nitrates regulations.  The DHPCLG commenced the third review of Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Plan (NAP) in early 2017 assisted by my Department.</p>  <p>  As part of the NAP review process a public consultation has taken place; 28 submissions were received which covered the impact of agriculture on water quality and the effectiveness of the current measures.  A review of these submissions is ongoing and being considered by an Expert Group, consisting of personnel from DHPCLG, Teagasc, the EPA and my Department.  This group will present a report to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and myself with recommendations on any changes to measures that they would propose.  Only proposals that have a sound scientific basis will be brought forward. In 2017, over 7,000 mainly dairy farmers are availing of the nitrates derogation.  The Commission will only discuss a renewal of Ireland's derogation when it is satisfied the package of measures in place under the Nitrates action programme will protect and improve water quality.</p>  <p>  The &euro;100 million Knowledge Transfer Scheme which has over 20,000 participating farmers includes a focus on environmental sustainability and in helping farmers pursue best practice, thereby reducing the risks of non-compliance and penalties.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to assist farmers in complying with the regulatory requirements; however it will be imperative that water quality is protected and that Ireland meets the requirements of the Water Framework Directive, not simply from a regulatory standpoint but also to protect and enhance our reputation as a sustainable producer of quality food.</p></reply>

Under the Terms and Conditions of the Basic Payment Scheme, an applicant, as well as meeting the scheme criteria, must comply with EU regulatory requirements relating to Cross Compliance.</p>  <p>  The Department's records indicate that the amount of nitrogen from livestock manure applied to land on the holding of the person named, (including that deposited by animals), was 267 kg per hectare, which exceeded the limit of 170 kg per hectare set down in the Nitrates Regulations.  This resulted in a penalty of 5% being applied against the 2016 Direct Payments Schemes.  The person named was notified of this decision on 25 November 2016 and of their right to seek a review of the decision.  To date no such request has been received.</p>  <p>  In addition, the person named was selected for a Bovine Identification and Registration inspection during which breaches were identified in respect of tagging, resulting in a 1% cross compliance penalty.  However, due to the maxing rules governing the application of cross compliance penalties this decision does not alter the final 2016 sanction, which remains at 5%.</p>  <p>  I understand that the person named was recently notified of the outcome of the bovine inspection and of their right to seek a review.</p>  <p>  In the event that the person named is dissatisfied with the outcome of any such review the matter can be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office.</p></reply>

To fish for mussel seed, Irish-registered sea-fishing boats require an authorisation under section 13 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  Authorisations are only provided to those boats which are directly connected with a bottom grown mussel aquaculture operator who holds a mussel seed "allocation" for his or her aquaculture site or boats that are contracted to fish on behalf of same.  An allocation restricts the amount (tonnes) of mussel seed that may be relayed onto a given site.  Boats from Northern Ireland require equivalent licenses from DAERA NI to take part in the fishery and must meet corresponding regulatory requirements. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware on 27 October 2016, the Supreme Court issued a judgment in a case taken by a number of mussel seed fishermen (Barlow &amp;amp; ors -v- Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine &amp;amp; ors [2016] IESC 62, 27th October 2016).  In the judgment, the Supreme Court found that fishing by Northern Ireland boats within the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State under the Voisinage arrangements is not permitted by law.  The Voisinage arrangements are long-standing reciprocal arrangements which allow fishing boats from Northern Ireland access to fish within the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State and vice versa.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Supreme Court upheld the High Court finding that the Voisinage arrangements are not invalid but that, as it stands, there is insufficient provision for them in domestic law.  The Supreme Court in fact noted that the arrangements were a sensible recognition at official level of practice and tradition, where fishing boats traditionally fished neighbouring waters.</p>  <p>  The application of the judgment is to all fishing by Northern Irish fishing boats in the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone, measured from the baselines, relying on the Voisinage arrangements.  Foreign fishing vessels are not permitted to fish inside the baselines.  Fishing activities that have a legal basis are not affected, such as those reliant on the access arrangements to Ireland's 6 to 12 nautical mile zone set out in Regulation (EU) No. 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council.</p>  <p>  The Government approved the publication of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill to address issues raised by the Supreme Court judgment of 27 October 2016, in so far as it relates to access for NI vessels.  If enacted and commenced, the Bill will give the Voisinage arrangements a proper legal footing.  The Bill was published in February 2017 and is available on the Oireachtas website.  The Bill has been debated in the Seanad and now is at Committee Stage there.</p>  <p>  While the Bill proposes to restore access to Northern Ireland boats to fish, under the terms of the Voisinage arrangements, boats that make use of this access are subject to the same rules and conditions that apply to Irish sea-fishing boats.  The Bill itself does not apply the specific conditions.  Therefore, other parallel associated measures will be required to ensure that rules and conditions in place for Irish sea-fishing boats are appropriately applied to Northern Ireland boats fishing under the Voisinage arrangements.</p>  <p>  The process of identifying which conditions may need to be applied is under way.  The conditions will include such restrictions as currently apply to Irish sea-fishing boats.  When the necessary measures have been identified, the most appropriate mechanisms for applying them to Northern Ireland boats will be determined.  The objective will be for these measures to come into effect at the same time as a commencement order for the Bill.</p>  <p>  Together, the Bill and the associated measures will re-establish the status quo for fishing access that existed under the Voisinage arrangements before the Supreme Court's judgment on 27 October 2016.  The only difference will be that the Voisinage arrangements will be provided for within a legislative framework.</p>  <p>  Access for Irish sea-fishing boats to the fishery, subject the conditions set out above, remains unaffected.  It is open to the persons concerned to apply to register the fishing boat in the Irish fishing fleet subject to satisfying the criteria which govern that process.</p></reply>

In addition to this requirement applicants are also required to maintain a minimum livestock density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare applied, calculated over the twelve months of the scheme year.  The minimum retention period for maintaining the requisite livestock density is seven consecutive months, so therefore livestock moved to the holding after the 31 May 2017 cannot be used in the seven month retention calculation but shall be counted towards the annual total.</p>  <p>  Livestock may take the form of cattle, sheep, goats, deer, donkeys and horses from a breeding enterprise or a combination of same.  For those applicants seeking to include donkeys to fulfil stocking density requirements, they are required to ensure that the donkey in question is owned by the applicant and registered in the name of the applicant and maintained on his/her holding.  These requirements are set out in the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme which have been circulated to all farmers.</p></reply>

In addition to grants to cover the cost of establishment, 10 annual premiums of &euro;180/ha are also available.  Trees planted under Forestry for Fibre can be harvested in 10 &ndash; 15 years, generating yields of between 150 &ndash; 300 cubic metres per hectare.  This rotation is significantly less than conventional forestry where conifer forests mature between 35 and 40 years.</p>  <p>  As well as reducing domestic heating costs Forestry for Fibre has an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon and climate resilient future; by sustainably growing trees for heat and electricity generation fossil fuels are replaced with a renewable source of energy.  Forestry for Fibre also presents opportunities for farmers to diversify their income stream by supplying firewood to local markets.</p>  <p>  Forestry for Fibre is currently being reviewed as part of the Department&rsquo;s midterm review of the Forestry Programme 2014 &ndash; 2020. </p></reply>

No further moves are permitted &ndash; this therefore removes the possibility of multiple moves of cattle before moving to an assembly centre which was possible under the previous arrangements but which was not in compliance with EU regulations.</p>  <p>  The pre-export check carried out by my Department was modified on 3rd April to ensure that cattle presented for export comply with the legislation.  The Department&rsquo;s AIM computer system carries out verification checks on compliance with the residency requirement.  Cattle presented for export that do not meet the eligibility requirements are rejected by the system.  The evidence shows that the new arrangements are operating with minimal disruption.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I reduced the veterinary inspection fees payable on live exports of younger bovines in order to remove the disproportionate impact of these fees on exports of calves relative to older animals.</p>  <p>  At a meeting I called with live exporters in April I stressed that my Department considers the live export sector to be of great importance, particularly given Brexit and the expansion of the dairy herd.  The ongoing search for new third country markets is a priority for my Department.  I welcome the fact that exports of live cattle to date in 2017 have increased by more than 40% compared to the same period last year.</p></reply>

The rate of accidents on farms remains far too high and safety is a critical issue facing farming today.  Statistics show that accidents on farms cause more workplace deaths than all other occupations combined.  To date this year there have been 14 fatal farm accidents on Irish farms.  These 14 fatal farm accidents account for over 48 percent of all fatal work accidents so far in 2017, while farming accounts for less than 6 percent of the workforce.</p>  <p>  Farm safety is an integral part of the TAMS II farm safety schemes run by my Department.  As part of these schemes there is a wide range of safety related investments that farmers may undertake.  Further it is a requirement that all farmers applying for grant-aid under the TAMS II schemes have completed a minimum of a half-day course on farm safety before they can draw down funding.</p>  <p>  In addition to the TAMS II schemes, there is a mandatory Health and Safety element included in all Knowledge Transfer Groups under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme.  These groups will directly engage in the region of 20,000 farmers with farm safety.</p>  <p>  Safety must become an integral part of farming culture.  While there are many risks in farming, farming does not have to be a dangerous occupation.  Behavioural change is what is required to prevent many accidents.  It is a case of being aware of the dangers and taking the time to do what is necessary to minimise the risk.</p></reply>

There is a well established infrastructure, at EU level and at national level, through the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, for the oversight of competition issues and for dealing with allegations of anti-competitive practices or the abuse of a dominant market position.</p>  <p>  The price of Irish beef is determined by a variety of factors, including global demand and supply, currency rates, the extent of competition from other countries, weather conditions.  At present the price of Irish cattle for slaughter stands at 4.2% above the comparable price this time last year and at 105% of the EU 15 average.</p>  <p>  Access to new markets is vital to the continued vitality of the sector as a whole.  I led a major trade mission to four Asian Countries in September of last year and one to Algeria and Morocco in November.  I also led a trade mission to the Middle East last February.  By increasing our footprint internationally we can help to mitigate the effects of Brexit and develop our agri-food sector to realise its full potential.  Additionally, this June I led a major trade mission to the United States and to Mexico.  In the US I announced a series of major initiatives for Irish beef and the mission also gave Irish producers the opportunity to learn more about expanding the scope for beef exports to that market.  In Mexico, I  commenced the process of attaining access to that large market for Irish meat exporters through a series of bilateral meetings.</p>  <p>  I am also very conscious of the vital role that live exports play in providing an alternative market outlet for Irish farmers.  These have increased by 44,000 head, or 46% in 2017 compared to 2016, both to traditional EU and third country markets and this is helping to provide market balance for cattle prices in Ireland.</p></reply>

The rate of accidents on farms remains far too high and it is important that a focus on safety must become an integral part of farming culture.  While there are many risks in farming, farming does not have to be a dangerous occupation.  Behavioural change is what is required to prevent many accidents.  It is a case of being aware of the dangers and taking the time to do what is necessary to minimise the risk.</p>  <p>  The use of the hydraulic drive system is a possible alternative for machines that have a low power requirement to drive them.  These systems remove the need for PTO drives which revolve at high revolutions per minute.  However, such systems are not suitable for machines that have a high power requirement such as balers, forage harvesters etc.</p>  <p>  My Department continuously reviews the potential for machinery improvements that provide more safe working environments.</p></reply>

This is a very important sector to the agricultural economy, making a vital contribution to both the food and feedstuffs sector.  While I am keenly aware that the very difficult harvest conditions of September 2016 posed additional problems for many growers, it was important that any measure put in place was focused and targeted at those most impacted whilst also ensuring prudent expenditure of public finances.  I am satisfied that the measure I have introduced addresses both of these requirements.</p>  <p>  This measure will provide a financial contribution of up to &euro;200 per hectare up to a maximum of 35 hectares per eligible applicant towards the cost of uninsured spring cereals crop losses in excess of 30% by yield.  Particularly hard hit growers who experienced cereal crop losses in excess of 50% will benefit from an additional &euro;100 per hectare.  Application forms including details on eligibility for the Crop Loss Support Measure are now available on my Department&rsquo;s website and from the Department&rsquo;s local office network.  Closing date for submission of applications will be Friday 25 August.</p>  <p>  This new support measure, together with the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme I introduced last autumn, the current Tillage investment scheme under TAMS II that I introduced earlier this year and provisions supportive of the tillage sector under the GLAS scheme will, when taken together, provide significant support for this essential sector and further underline my ongoing support to securing its future.</p></reply>

Under Article 8 of the EMFF Regulation, aid provided through the Operational Programme and in compliance with the rules and conditions of the EMFF is exempt from State Aid notification requirements, with two exceptions. Aid provided by Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) under the Programme for activities not covered by the EMFF, i.e. not for seafood activities, are not covered by the exemption.  Also, aid for measures under the Integrated Maritime Policy are not covered.  </p>  <p>  The Fisheries Deminimis Regulation (717/2014) exempts from State Aid notification aid provided to seafood enterprises, provided that all aid provided to those beneficiaries under the Fisheries Deminimis Regulation does not exceed &euro;30,000 over a 3 fiscal year period.  A national cap on fisheries deminimis aid applies and this is &euro;20.82 million for Ireland over a 3 fiscal year period.  There are some exclusions from the Fisheries Deminimis Regulation and these are listed in article 1 of the Regulation.  </p>  <p>  The Fisheries Block Exemption Regulation (FIBER) (1388/2014) exempts from State Aid notification requirements aid to certain activities in the seafood sector.  Aid per beneficiary must not exceed &euro;1 million per year and the eligible costs of any project aided may not exceed &euro;2 million.  FIBER includes almost all measures eligible under the EMFF Regulation.  Notable exceptions are aid for temporary and permanent cessation of fishing activities and aid for measures under the Integrated Maritime Policy.  Importantly, FIBER aid to these measures must be implemented in full compliance with the rules and conditions specified in the EMFF for such measures.  In addition to measures from the EMFF, FIBER also allows aid to make good the damage caused by natural disasters.  </p>  <p>  Where the various State Aid instruments do not provide a clear legal basis for an intervention, a Member State may submit a State Aid notification to the Commission seeking State Aid approval.   The Commission Guidelines for Examination of State Aid in the Fisheries and Aquaculture Sector (2015/C 217/01) describes the factors that will be considered by the Commission in assessing a State Aid notification concerning aid to the seafood sector.</p></reply>

To date the Commission has resisted an increase.</p>  <p>  Under the Agriculture De Minimis Regulation (1408/2013), my Department is currently preparing for the launch of the 2017 Weather Related Crop Loss Support Measure, which aims to provide financial aid to farmers, where genuine crop losses have been incurred on foot of the wet weather in September 2016. </p></reply>

However, I believe that the most effective and appropriate method to increase supply chain transparency is through a co-ordinated European wide basis.  In late 2016 the EU Council, when agreeing conclusions on strengthening farmers&rsquo; position in the food supply chain and tackling unfair trading practices, noted the option of a regulatory approach at EU level.  The Council called on the Commission to undertake an impact assessment with a view to the option of an EU legislative framework. I understand this assessment is to be published shortly.</p>  <p>  A number of steps have been taken at national level to strengthen the position of the farmer in the food supply chain, including the recognition of Producer Organisations and the introduction of a scheme to assist members of Producer Organisations to engage facilitators to assist them in their establishment and effective functioning. </p>  <p>  Another step in giving farmers more information in relation to the market place and assisting farmers&rsquo; bargaining powers has been the development of a Beef PriceWatch app by my Department.  This app allows farmers to compare reported prices across a range of grades and factories to assist them in selling their cattle.  With the introduction of the price watch app Ireland is now one of the most transparent countries in the EU.  My Department also publishes data on slaughter and price on its website on a weekly basis.</p></reply>

This initiative was supported by all sectoral stakeholders and in February of 2016 a Statutory Instrument (The European Union (Beef Producer Organisations) Regulations 2016 S.I. No 49 of 2016  was signed into law to give a legal basis for my Department to maintain a register of recognised POs in the beef sector.</p>  <p>  The recognition of POs will encourage primary beef producers to form Producer Organisations and allow farmers to engage collectively with processors.  The ultimate aim is to ensure the viable development of production by strengthening farmers' bargaining power with downstream operators.</p>  <p>  In order to assist groups of primary producers who wish to become recognised Producer Organisations, an application to the European Commission as part of the second amendment to Ireland&rsquo;s RDP has been submitted, which provides for the funding of start-up activities for Producer Organisations in the Beef Sector.  Funding will be provided for prospective POs to engage a facilitator to help with recruitment and start-up activities.  Advisors will fall into one of two categories; giving advice on setup of the PO&rsquo;s statutes, fulfilling Department requirements etc, or advice on business planning and membership recruitment.  Payment for advice in each of these areas will be capped at &euro;1,500 in accordance with the provisions of the RDP regulation.  My officials are currently in the process of finalising a Request For Tender which will be published shortly, to provide these services. </p></reply>

However I am particularly supportive of improving the safety record on farms.  The rate of accidents on farms remains far too high and it is important that a focus on safety becomes an integral part of farming culture.  While there are many risks in farming, farming does not have to be a dangerous occupation.  Behavioural change is what is required to prevent many accidents.  It is a case of being aware of the dangers and taking the time to do what is necessary to minimise the risk.</p>  <p>  There are a wide range of farm safety elements available for farmers under the TAMS II.  The funding of any additional items will come from within the current funding envelope for the TAMS II schemes.  </p>  <p>  The Farm safety Partnership Advisory Committee is a sub-committee of the Board of the Health and Safety Authority and is funded by the HSA.  A mid-term review of the Farm Safety Action Plan 2016-2018 is being undertaken to ensure that all elements within the plan will be achieved.  Funding of the Farm Safety Partnership has not been an issue to date and it is expected that the actions under the Farm Safety Action Plan 206-2018 will be achieved.</p>  <p>  A new PTO, including cover, costs approximately &euro;180, while a new cover costs approximately &euro;100 - the actual cost depends upon length and required power throughput.  If a PTO shaft becomes damaged it will need to be replaced immediately, to enable the farmer to continue working safely.   Grant-aid schemes are not suitable for supporting the purchase of replacement PTO shafts, as under the schemes it is necessary to have written approval in place before undertaking any works. </p>  <p>  The use of the hydraulic drive system is a possible alternative for machines that have a low power requirement to drive them.  These systems remove the need for PTO drives which revolve at high revolutions per minute.  However, such systems are not suitable for machines that have a high power requirement such as balers, forage harvesters etc. </p>  <p>  My Department continuously reviews the potential for machinery improvements that provide safer working environments.</p></reply>

This decision has allowed ESB eCars to deliver an extensive public network of both normal and fast charging points across Ireland, and there are now approximately 900 EV charge points installed across Ireland.  Of these, over 70 are fast charging points.  At present, ESB also provide the installation of free home charging points to the owners of EVs.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The CER decision to facilitate the delivery of EV public and domestic charging points through ESB Networks was taken on a pilot basis and, in October 2016, the CER published a consultation paper (CER/16/286), seeking views on the future ownership of the EV infrastructure.  The outcome of the CER process will determine to what extent the electricity consumer will continue to fund public and domestic charge points.  A final decision on this is expected in the coming months.  </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The current direct funding available to support the purchase of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is managed by my Department and delivered through a range of financial grants provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In May this year, my colleague the Minster for Transport, Tourism and Sport published the National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland 2017 to 2030.

Large car manufacturers are also expected to become involved in the provision of high-powered infrastructure.  A number of providers are likely to emerge onto the Irish market in the coming years, providing infrastructure at the higher end of the performance capacity scale, i.e. between 120 kW and 350 kW.

The Paris Agreement, which entered into force in November 2016, aims to limit global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with an ambition of 1.5 degrees Celsius.  The Agreement is designed to meet this objective through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by all parties to the agreement.  In this regard, the European Union submitted an NDC committing to a reduction of at least 40% in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, which will be met through reductions of 43% in the Emission Trading System (ETS) and 30% in the non-ETS sector compared with 2005 levels. </p>  <p>  Ireland will contribute to the Paris Agreement via the NDC tabled by the EU on behalf of its Member States.  The specific details of Ireland's contribution to the overall 30% reduction in the non-ETS sector, as well as the contributions to be made by other Member States, is currently being negotiated between the EU and its Member States in the context of the European Commission's Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) Proposal which was published in July 2016.  Targets have been proposed for Member States based on GDP per capita and the cost-effectiveness of domestic emissions reductions within individual Member States, with the starting point based on average emissions over the period 2016 to 2018.  In the case of Ireland, a target of 39% has been proposed, which has been adjusted downwards to 30% to reflect the cost-effectiveness of measures within the Irish economy.  </p>  <p>  The Commission proposal recognises different Member States' circumstances and the need to provide flexibility to reduce emissions as cost-effectively as possible in the context of the overall EU target.  Ireland has been actively engaged in negotiations in the Council of Ministers, and is working to ensure that these core principles are maintained in the final outcome to the negotiations.  At the Environment Council meeting of Monday 19 June, my EU counterparts and I reviewed progress to date and emphasised the need to prioritise a successful conclusion to these negotiations which retains a high environmental ambition for the EU, but provides each Member State the capacity to contribute to that ambition in a cost-effective and fair manner.</p>  <p>  The incoming Estonian Presidency has indicated a desire to reach agreement in the Council, allowing negotiations with the European Parliament to commence during its term. </p></reply>

This management is carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), the State Agency with statutory responsibility for inland fisheries.  The management policy is based on the fact that each of Ireland&rsquo;s 147 salmon rivers, river sections, estuaries etc. has its own genetically unique stock of salmon which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn and create the next generation of fish exclusive to that river. </p>  <p>  IFI is supported in its management role by scientific advice from Ireland&rsquo;s Standing Scientific Committee.  IFI also draws on international advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).  Research in coastal areas and in the marine environment concentrates on increasing knowledge of migratory patterns, marine based mortality and return rates to home rivers as stock assessments can only be carried out on the individual stock in each river. </p>  <p>  The Atlantic salmon is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive with which Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime complies.  In order to align fully with the Directive and the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) principles and in view of a sharp decline in salmon stocks, the Irish Government closed mixed stock fisheries in 2007 including coastal and offshore fishing for salmon.  Harvest fisheries are now only allowed on individual river stocks which are shown to have a surplus and in estuaries where the stocks from individual rivers entering the estuary are each meeting their individual conservation limits.</p>  <p>  A Salmon Hardship Scheme was introduced in 2007 under which, fishermen active in the commercial salmon fishery could opt to permanently cease fishing.  In excess of &euro;25 million was allocated to the scheme to facilitate payments to fishermen, with a further &euro;5 million provided for community development projects.  The scheme closed for applications on 31 December 2007 and ceased in 2008 with all funds expended.  It is considered that river stocks would be in a far more perilous state if the closure of mixed stock fisheries had not been implemented. </p>  <p>  During migration from rivers to marine feeding grounds, salmon from both rivers in Ireland and rivers in other countries travel through Ireland&rsquo;s coastal waters.  These "mixed stocks" pose particular difficulties for management as they contain individual fish often from a wide range of rivers some of which are below sustainable reproductive capacity.  Any deviation from current policy would be contrary to the international independent scientific advice as the &ldquo;home river&rdquo; of off-shore salmon cannot be identified and it is not possible to disaggregate the individuals or stock groups at sea.</p>  <p>  Such a move could potentially lead to conflict with EU and international obligations on grounds of not protecting vulnerable Irish and international salmon stocks.  The conservation imperative demands that current salmon stocks are not further eroded by mismanagement or inappropriate exploitation, whether via angling, commercial fisheries in rivers inland or through the operation of indiscriminate mixed stock fisheries at sea or in estuaries. </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to international agreements entered into at EU level and at NASCO and the prohibition of mixed stock fisheries is a key element of international best practice in salmon conservation and management.</p></reply>

Details of technologies supported under each scheme and the costs associated with each technology are listed in the following table in &euro;/MWh.</p><p>Typically, projects availing of support under the REFIT schemes are large-scale developer-led renewable electricity projects, and there are currently no grant or subsidy schemes available specifically for community-led or citizen led renewable electricity projects.</p><p>Tariff per MWh (&euro;)<table><tr><th>REFIT 1</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>Large onshore wind (above 5MW)</td><td>69.72</td></tr><tr><td>Small onshore wind (equal to or less than 5MW)</td><td>72.167</td></tr><tr><td>Hydro</td><td>88.068</td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Landfill Gas</td><td>85.622</td></tr><tr><td>Other Biomass</td><td>88.068</td></tr><tr><td>REFIT 2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Large onshore wind (above 5MW)</td><td>69.72</td></tr><tr><td>Small onshore wind (equal to or less than 5MW)</td><td>72.137</td></tr><tr><td>Hydro</td><td>88.068</td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Landfill Gas</td><td>85.622</td></tr><tr><td>REFIT 3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Combustion</td><td>89.314</td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Combustion - Energy Crops</td><td>99.822</td></tr><tr><td>Large Biomass CHP (above 1500kW)</td><td>126.091</td></tr><tr><td>Small Biomass CHP (equal to or less than 1500kW)</td><td>147.106</td></tr><tr><td>Large AD Non CHP (above 500 kW)</td><td>105.076</td></tr><tr><td>Small AD Non CHP (equal to or less than 500 kW)</td><td>115.583</td></tr><tr><td>Large AD CHP (above 500kW)</td><td>136.598</td></tr><tr><td>Small AD CHP (equal to or less than 500kW)</td><td>157.613</td></tr></table>The 2016 Programme for Government recognises that Ireland&rsquo;s long-term interests are best supported by further decreasing our dependence on foreign fossil fuels through the continued development of indigenous renewable energy.  To support the delivery of this ambition, my Department is developing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030.</p><p>The new RESS will also provide pathways for delivering on the 2015 Energy White Paper commitment to ensure communities and citizens are at the centre of the future energy transition in Ireland.  Communities are effectively being designed into the fabric of the new scheme with policy measures to incentivise community-led and developer-led community projects being identified.</p><p>The economic appraisal is being undertaken to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The appraisal also includes analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines. </p><p>My Department will publish a final public consultation on the design principles of the new RESS shortly.  Following the outcome of this public consultation, and before any new scheme is introduced, it will need to secure Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission.  Subject to this, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in 2018. </p><p>Separately, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers a number of schemes on behalf of my Department.  The Better Energy Communities (BEC) Scheme aims to support and encourage community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of homes, businesses and community facilities in a local area.  To date the scheme has supported the upgrade of more than 14,000 homes and several hundred shared community facilities, from sports clubs to community centres and childcare facilities.</p><p>SEAI also administer the Better Energy Homes Scheme on behalf of my Department.  The scheme supports private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their home.  Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating system upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER). </p></reply>

The Map shows the extent of  the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.</p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,</p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>The Map, which is searchable by address or eircode, has been developed by my Department using extensive information obtained from commercial operators.  A computer algorithm was not used to create the High Speed Broadband Map.</p><p>Information on whether specific premises are in a BLUE or AMBER area can be obtained by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering the premises eircode at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie. </i>The map will be updated to show quarterly progress of the eir rollout.</p><p>The position in relation to the areas referred to by the Deputies is set out below.</p><p>The map shows that the townland of Ballinter Co Meath comprise 59 premises.  49% of these premises (or 29) fall within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and the end of 2018 (LIGHT BLUE on map) area while the remaining 51% (or 30) premises fall within the State Intervention under the NBP.</p><p>The map shows that 100% of the townland of Kilmurry (Ed Innfield) Co Kildare fall within eir's plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and the end of 2018 (Light BLUE on map).</p><p>The map shows that 87% of the townland of Ardkilly Cork (or 59 premises) including the area known locally as Sandycove falls within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and the end of 2018 (Light BLUE on map) while the remaining 13% (or 9) of the premises within this townland falls within the State Intervention under the NBP.  In addition 100% of the townland of Ballynabooly Cork comprising 17 premises falls with the AMBER area and will be part of the State intervention under the NBP.</p><p>A full set of county statistics are available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.</p><p>Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available from eir at<i><font color="#2F2F2F"> </font></i>.</p><p>I encourage members of the general public who are in a BLUE area but who cannot access a high speed broadband service to contact my Department at <i>broadband@dccae.gov.ie</i>. quoting their eircode and query details.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers. </p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.</p><p>With the finalisation of the map and following extensive dialogue with bidders, the procurement is progressing to the next stage.  On 20 June 2017 my Department wrote to the three bidders in the NBP procurement process inviting them to submit their &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo;.  The 'Detailed Solutions' stage is the last stage of the procurement process before Final Tenders. </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.</p><p>The rate of demand for data services has increased exponentially in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on my Department's website.</p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I established an Implementation Group to drive and monitor the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.  I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13th June 2017, which is available on my Department's website at<i></i>and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017. </p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in lots covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.</p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.</p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

While the 2016 EU Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive was largely anticipated in the Strategy, the finalised Directive contains additional provisions which will have significant implications for my Department also.</p>  <p>  The NCSC is presently engaged in a series of activities supporting Departments and agencies in the protection of their networks and infrastructure.  These measures include monitoring threats, developing appropriate responses, and informing constituents of these on an ongoing basis.  The NIS Directive requires Member States to take measures to protect critical national infrastructure and ensure the security of Digital Service Providers.  As such, the legislation that will be used to transpose this Directive will set out the means that will be used to improve the protection of critical national infrastructure, and the NCSC is already well advanced in identifying the actual infrastructure involved and developing these measures in a practical way.</p>  <p>  The dynamic nature of this issue, and the risks posed to citizens and the State, are clearly significant.  The NCSC is presently undergoing expansion, both in terms of staffing numbers and funding.  While the precise resourcing and staffing of the NCSC are security sensitive issues and are not published, it can be said that the NCSC has just finished a recruitment process at two separate grades, with a number of additional staff either in clearance or already in place.</p>  <p>  The provision of public awareness campaigns and material for businesses and individuals will be a central component of the next National Cyber Security Strategy, and work has already commenced on a number of elements of a campaign.  It is hoped that the programme for Small and Medium Enterprises will launch early next year.</p></reply>

The design of the new scheme is underway, and includes an extensive independent economic appraisal.  This appraisal involves comparing the cost of supporting Solar PV (both rooftop and ground mounted), offshore wind, onshore wind and a range of other commercial renewable technologies, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment also includes analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.</p>  <p>  My Department will publish shortly a final public consultation on the design principles of the new RESS.  Following the outcome of this public consultation, and before any new scheme is introduced, it will need to secure Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission.  Subject to this, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in 2018.</p>  <p>  My stated position is that while solar has a role to play in Ireland&rsquo;s energy future, we cannot have a situation where a new support scheme leads to a disproportionate increase in people&rsquo;s electricity bills through the Public Service Obligation levy.  In designing the new RESS, the cost implications for people and businesses will, therefore, be a high priority and I will ensure that the new scheme is designed in a cost efficient manner.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland currently provides grant aid for the use of solar thermal heating technology to both large industry and SMEs.  Households can also avail of grant support for investment in renewable energy installations, including solar thermal, under the Better Energy Homes Scheme.</p></reply>

I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services to particular locations.</p>  <p>  Any customer across Ireland who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance.  If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to ComReg, which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the independence of ComReg, I recognise the frustration experienced across Ireland where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  In that regard, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The December 2016 report of the Taskforce is available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  The Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders to produce the report which contains 40 actions to alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland.  An Implementation Group has been established to drive and monitor implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.  On 20 July, I published the second quarterly progress report, which is available on my Department's website.  It shows that the momentum built up in Q1 has continued, with further good progress made in Q2.  I am also pleased at the sustained level of engagement between action owners and industry.</p>  <p>  This work will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p>  <p>  In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg&rsquo;s recent announcement of the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band will mean an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The award of 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band will provide stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in lots covering 9 urban and rural regions across Ireland.</p>  <p>  Commercial investment by mobile operators has resulted in improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction in 2012.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  However, as mobile services are a radio-based technology, services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets and the capacity of the network, as well as by proximity to mobile telephone antennas.</p></reply>

Following the publication of the Terms of Reference, I met with a number of Oireachtas members from Cavan, Monaghan and Meath on Tuesday 16 May.  This meeting provided me the opportunity to update the members on progress in relation to the proposed study and for the members to provide feedback.  My officials have been engaging directly with consultants who have worked with the Department previously on this project and I expect the procurement of those consultants to be concluded in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The impact on land and property values and the level of compensation paid in lieu of such impacts was also discussed at the meeting with Oireachtas members and at the meetings with the community groups.  Whilst it would not be appropriate for me to intrude on settled processes for addressing these issues between developers and affected landowners, in light of the concerns that have been voiced, I am commissioning research on international comparative practice on the approach to and levels of compensation provided to land and property owners in proximity to high-voltage transmission lines.</p></reply>

Consequently, measures to maintain, enhance and diversify the post office network are fundamentally a matter for An Post.</p>  <p>  It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong, viable company, in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and that it maintains a nationwide customer-focused network of post offices in the community.  The Deputy will be aware that a fundamental review of An Post, including the post office network, which will identify the strategic changes and restructuring necessary to maintain the company on a sound financial footing, is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Transforming the postal business will be difficult and will require tough decisions, but any new changes will be designed to make An Post fit for a future in which the organisation can be confident, robust and a winner in the digital world.  Government policy is to offer Government services online.  In time, it is likely that this will represent the default option in accessing services.  For the foreseeable future, however, a segment of the population will not be comfortable or able to access services digitally.  I believe that the post office network is the obvious choice for citizens as the offline gateway, with its nationwide network and existing strong relationship with offline citizens.  The potential is there so it is imperative that it is harnessed.</p>  <p>  On foot of a reconfiguration of Government Departments in July of last year, responsibility for the post office network transferred to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  When the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs published the final report of the post office hub working group in March of this year, it outlined that it is pursuing the possible opportunities for the network to provide services such as community banking and motor tax renewal.  Arrangements are in hand to reassign responsibility for the post office network to my Department in light of my overall responsibility for An Post.  The recommendations of the post office hub working group will continue to be finalised between both Departments.</p>  <p>  While decisions in relation to restructuring of An Post and the operation of the post office network are operational matters for the Board and management of An Post, I am monitoring the position closely and hope that a pragmatic approach which will ensure the long term sustainability of An Post and the post office network can be agreed.  I have had a number of meetings with the CEO and the Chairman and my officials also meet An Post on a regular basis.  I have encouraged An Post to continue to work closely with all parties to find an agreed solution to the renewal of the network.  Government will be briefed once a definitive strategy has been agreed but until such time it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this process.</p></reply>

If, after having exhausted the service provider&rsquo;s complaint handling procedures, a customer is not happy they may contact ComReg, on 1890 229 668; online at <i></i>or by email at Consumerline@comreg.ie, for further assistance and guidance.As the body that issues licences/authorisations to broadband service providers including satellite, ComReg will investigate such complaints to ensure that the companies in question are delivering services in line with its licence/authorisation obligations. </p><p>The decision by Eir to invest in infrastructure to deploy high speed broadband services to an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland was taken on commercial grounds.  Neither I nor the Department have a statutory authority to direct Eir in this regard.  The Deputies are aware that the Government&rsquo;s national broadband plan (NBP) will provide high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location - including those areas where commercial providers will not provide this service.  </p><p>The addresses and businesses referred to in the questions will be provided with high speed broadband through the NBP State led intervention should such services not be provided to them by commercial operators.  My Department wrote to the three bidders in the NBP procurement process on 20 June 2017 inviting them to submit their 'Detailed Solutions'.  This is a significant milestone in the NBP procurement process.  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.</p></reply>

Currently the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme (WHS) provides &lsquo;shallow measures&rsquo; to the majority of applicants.  The WHS scheme is free of charge to eligible applicants.  These shallower measures include attic and cavity wall insulation, draught proofing, lagging jackets, low energy light bulbs and energy advice.  This package currently costs the Exchequer around &euro;3,000 per home.  In extreme cases where the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) surveyor deems a home to be in particularly bad condition deeper measures such as doors and windows, and other forms of insulation, may be carried out.  In making this assessment, a surveyor will look at factors including the age of the home, the construction of the wall, the age of the heating system or where one is absent.  </p><p>The reason that these deeper measures are reserved for the most inefficient and poorly insulated homes is that they cost well in excess of the measures currently offered.  Were they to be offered as standard, the number of people who could be helped each year would be significantly lower.  Indeed, the measures currently offered under the WHS were selected as the best balance that could be achieved between the resources that the Exchequer can provide to the scheme, the number of homes that can receive support and the energy savings that can be delivered.  In short, the measures supported are those that can deliver the most energy savings at the lowest cost to the highest number of people.</p><p>SEAI procures a panel of contractors to deliver the measures under the WHS.  These contractors are procured on a 3 year panel and provide their costs in advance.  Therefore, contractors can be required to upgrade a wide variety of houses, and so in calculating their costs they have to take a range of different scenarios into account such as technology costs and inflation.  It is on this basis that the costs for the measures that the Deputy has outlined are provided in the following table.<table><tr><th><b>Measure</b></th><th><b>Average cost for standard house </b></th></tr><tr><td>Basic energy efficient window package</td><td>&euro;6,000</td></tr><tr><td>Internal wall insulation (dry lining) (wall area = 85m2)</td><td>&euro;7,927</td></tr><tr><td>External wall insulation (wall area = 85m2)</td><td>&euro;13,452</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-26a.3611.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017072600068#WRQQQ01500"><p>GNI is a commercial State-sponsored Body under the aegis of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  The development and expansion of the natural gas network is in the first instance a commercial matter for Gas Networks Ireland (GNI), which is mandated under section 8 of the Gas Act 1976, as amended, to develop and maintain a national system for the supply of natural gas that is both economical and efficient.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is statutorily responsible for all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and/or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.   In 2006, the CER approved a new network connections policy, which created the opportunity to reassess the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.   The CER policy stipulates that in order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be met as a prerequisite.   The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the actual consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.   This is designed by CER to obviate against uneconomic projects which would increase costs for all gas consumers.   The key factor which would qualify a town, or group of towns, in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually resulting from the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility. </p>  <p>  In terms of the cost of extending the gas network, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and more recently GNI, carried out a comprehensive assessment of towns not connected to the national gas network, which provided estimated figures on the costs of extending the network to these towns.  The final reports for this assessment was published in 2010.

The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the actual consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  This is designed by CER to obviate against uneconomic projects which would increase costs for all gas consumers.  The key factor which would qualify a town, or group of towns, in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually resulting from the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility. </p>  <p>  As regards the connection of Ballyconnell or Cavan town to the gas network, I am aware that the most recent assessment of this region under CER&rsquo;s economic criteria was undertaken by GNI between 2006 to 2010 and it was found that connecting Ballyconnell or Cavan town to the gas network remains unviable at this time in the absence of a significant new demand for gas.  Towns that were not proven viable, under the criteria set out by the Commission for Energy Regulation, are kept under review by GNI. </p>  <p>  I note that the Gas to the West project in Northern Ireland has only recently entered the construction stage, with work on the intermediate pipelines begun this month, with the high pressure pipeline being constructed in 2018.</p>  <p>  The question of whether network extensions should, where economically feasible and in line with our energy policy goals in the White Paper, provide for the possibility of future connections in order to contribute to regional and rural development needs to be addressed, in my view.  At the launch of the Action Plan for Rural Development I set out my view that there are communities partly or sometimes wholly excluded from basic criteria of modern convenience and comfort, in terms of communications, energy efficiency and fuel poverty.  My long-standing position on the gas network is that it should be developed generally in rural Ireland to provide natural gas to as many areas as possible.

The An Post Group lost &euro;13.7 million in 2016 with the core mails business losing over &euro;30m.  The financials reflect the fact that An Post has entered a period of long term structural decline in its mails business mainly due to the impact of e-substitution on mail volumes.  The same trend is apparent in the post office business which, in turn, has impacted on the level of income available to IPU members.  These difficulties prompted the various reviews of the network in recent years which aimed to set out a series of measures to secure the future of the network.</p>  <p>  The scale of the financial challenges facing An Post has necessitated a fundamental review of the company, including the post office network, in order to devise and implement a strategy to secure a sustainable future for An Post, it&rsquo;s employees and postmasters.</p>  <p>  Naturally, the outcome of the review will impact on the extent to which the recommendations contained in the various reports on the network can be implemented.</p>  <p>  We all agree that transforming the postal business will be difficult and will require tough decisions but the new changes will be designed to make An Post fit for a future where the organisation can be confident, robust, begin growing again and be a winner in the digital world.  Government policy is to offer Government services online and, in time, it is likely that this will represent the default option for accessing services.  For the foreseeable future, however, a segment of the population is not comfortable or able to access services digitally.  I believe that the post office network is the obvious choice as the &ldquo;offline gateway&rdquo; for citizens with its nationwide network and existing strong relationship with offline citizens.  The post office network can play a role in simplifying back office functions to facilitate better and more efficient processes.  The potential is there so it is imperative that it is harnessed.</p>  <p>  While decisions on restructuring An Post and the operation of the post office network are operational matters for the board and management of An Post, I am monitoring the position closely and hope that a pragmatic approach that will ensure the long-term sustainability of An Post and the post office network can be agreed.  The Government will be briefed once a definitive strategy has been agreed but until such time, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this process.</p></reply>

A key consideration in the move towards carbon neutrality will be cost effective technology and continued research and development.</p><p>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) publishes and maintains a Triple E Register of energy efficient products and equipment. Currently the Triple E product Register is based solely on the existing ) list of eligible products and eligibility criteria but it is planned in the future to extend the product range beyond that covered by the ACA.  The Register provides independent intelligence to energy end users regarding the products that are best in class from an energy efficiency perspective, as well as offering a financial incentive to organisations to procure them.</p><p>The ACA is tax incentive which allows businesses to write off the cost of eligible equipment from this register in one year rather than over eight years. This is available to businesses, including farms, paying corporate tax. </p><p>The ACA currently covers 10 different equipment categories and 52 associated technologies.  As it stands there is no category or sub-technology type specific to farm equipment, however it is likely that there are generic technologies within the existing categories that could be of interest to farmers, e.g. lighting.  New technology proposals can be submitted to the SEAI at any time. </p><p>If a supplier or manufacturer wishes to apply for a new technology type to be added to the Triple E Register, it is necessary to determine if the technology type could be included in an existing category heading, technology group or sub-technology. </p><p>Suppliers &amp;amp; manufacturers are requested to email SEAI at<i>aca@seai.ie</i>with a brief summary of the proposed technology prior to making an official proposal.</p><p>On receipt of a fully completed proposal, SEAI&rsquo;s technical experts panel will complete a comprehensive evaluation in consultation with manufacturers, suppliers and trade associations to determine the technology&rsquo;s energy efficient performance, energy  saving potential and market availability.</p><p>Separately, SEAI is collaborating with Teagasc on a pilot energy efficiency scheme in the dairy farm sector during 2017, an innovative example of the potential for co-ordinated action across two pillars &ndash; the Built Environment and Agriculture &ndash; of the recently published National Mitigation Plan. </p></reply>

The approved scheme remains intact and local authorities can use a proportion of their Discretionary Grant (15%) for LIS should they wish to do so.</p>  <p>  The Community Involvement Scheme (CIS) also remains in place in 2017 on the basis that local authorities may set aside 7.5% of their Restoration Improvement and Restoration Maintenance grants for CIS schemes if they so wish. </p>  <p>  While there is a modest increase in funding for roads this year, it will take some years yet under the Capital Plan to restore "steady state" funding levels for regional and local roads.  The primary focus has to continue to be on the maintenance and renewal of public roads.  </p>  <p>  In light of the provision in the Programme for Government indicating that, as the economy recovers, the Government will promote increased funding for Community Involvement and Local Improvement Schemes, I will review the scope for making a separate grant allocation once the planned Review of the Capital Plan is completed.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the local authority's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  I would like to explain that the difference between Local Improvement Schemes (LIS) and Community Involvement Schemes (CIS) is that the LIS relates to works on private roads while the CIS relates to works on public roads which would usually only be considered towards the end of a County Council's roads programme.</p>  <p>  Maintenance of private laneways/roads not taken in charge by local authorities is the responsibility of the landowners concerned. Due to the major cutbacks in roads funding it was necessary for my Department to cease making separate allocations to local authorities in respect of the LIS.  The approved scheme remains intact and local authorities can use a proportion of their Discretionary Grant (15%) for the LIS should they wish to do so.</p>  <p>  While there is a modest increase in funding for roads this year, it will take some years yet under the Capital Plan to restore "steady state" funding levels for regional and local roads.  The primary focus has to continue to be on the maintenance and renewal of public roads.  </p>  <p>  In light of the provision in the Programme for Government indicating that, as the economy recovers, the Government will promote increased funding for Community Involvement and Local Improvement Schemes, I will review the scope for making a separate grant allocation once the planned Review of the Capital Plan is completed.</p></reply>

Subsequently, this deadline was extended seven times as a further concession to the industry to move to more road friendly articulated vehicle combinations, such as the 6-axle articulated (3+3) combination, which I understand can operate up to a maximum 46 tonne weight limit.</p>  <p>  Given the ongoing challenges in maintaining our critical roads infrastructure with constrained resources, the derogation was ended on 30 June 2016.  This was necessary to permit a decrease in road and bridge infrastructure damage caused by such vehicles and to thereby reduce the costs to the public finances in terms of maintaining and repairing vital road and bridge infrastructure.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I must have regard to the overarching need to maintain national transport infrastructure in as cost effective manner as possible.  It is primarily for this reason, as well as the extensive 13-year period given to the industry to adjust, that the previously existing derogation has not been renewed.  While my Department and I obviously review our legislation on a regular basis, I do not believe that the position today has changed materially so as to cause me to reconsider this necessary measure to protect our roads.</p></reply>

The Programme for Partnership Government commits to proceeding with the New Metro North project.</p>  <p>  The decision to proceed with new Metro North followed consideration of the Fingal/North Dublin Transport Study and the National Transport Authority's (NTA) recommendations on the study, which identified the light-rail link as the optimum long term public transport solution on the Swords/airport/city centre corridor.  It is expected that the service will offer capacity for 9,900 passengers per hour per direction with the potential to expand services in the future if demand requires.</p>  <p>  The NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) have commenced preparatory work on the planning and design of new Metro North and a dedicated project Steering Group has been established which is meeting on a regular basis.  The NTA, in collaboration with TII, is undertaking an option analysis and selection study of possible metro alignments and station locations.  Arising from this work a final route and station configuration will be established.  It is my understanding that the NTA and TII expect that this process will be complete by the end of 2017, after which a public consultation process will be undertaken in 2018.</p></reply>

Decisions on the transport elements of the Capital Plan were framed by the conclusions reached in my Department's Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.  Based on the findings in that report it is envisaged that maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority and the bulk of the roads capital budget, approximately &euro;4.4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already underway.  My Department is making a strong case for additional funding, including the further development of a project pipeline for national road schemes.  The final decisions on allocations are, however, matters for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and Government as a whole.  Notwithstanding funding constraints TII has been undertaking some preparatory planning work with Donegal County Council in relation to the TEN-T network in the County.</p>  <p>  Cross-border Greenways projects funded under INTERREG VA from Derry to Muff, from Derry to Buncrana and from Strabane to Lifford and the proposed Multi-Modal Transport Hub in Derry will provide sustainable transport routes for people travelling to and from Donegal to Derry and Tyrone.  The promoters of these projects are aware of the necessity to progress as quickly as possible in light of the uncertainty surrounding the implications of BREXIT for EU funded projects.  There will be a review of funding arrangements of all these projects in the second half of 2018 when it is expected that greater clarity will have emerged in relation to BREXIT. </p>  <p>  With regard to Brexit, at the recent conclusion of the 2nd   round of talks, Mr Barnier said that there needs to be clearer understanding of how the UK intends post-Brexit to ensure continuation of North-South co-operation.  It is expected that this will form part of the detailed discussions in the next round of discussions at the end of August.  It will be difficult to determine how border issues will be fully resolved until we know what the new arrangements between the UK and the EU will be.</p></reply>

Essentially the route involves upgrade/realignment works on the regional routes from Dundalk to Cavan and on national routes from Cavan to Sligo.  The latter would involve a route that passes through Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  In relation to the national element as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p>  <p>  As regards the regional road aspect of the proposal, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area is a statutory function of local authorities in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993.  Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  </p>  <p>  The Capital Plan published in September 2015 provides for the gradual build up in expenditure on the maintenance and improvement of the road network over a 7 year period.  The bulk of expenditure is scheduled to be spent on maintenance of the road network with some limited investment in new projects.  My Department has provided funding to Cavan County Council (acting as lead authority with Monaghan and Louth County Councils) with over &euro;2m in the period 2007-2014 to progress the regional road element of the project to preliminary design.  At an estimated cost of &euro;150 million, unfortunately it was not possible to include the East-West Link in the Capital Plan.</p></reply>

The level of compensation provided in relation to PSO services falls under the independent statutory remit of the National Transport Authority (NTA), which has direct responsibility for this area.</p>  <p>  The funding provided to each operating company is not based upon a particular percentage based threshold but rather relates to the provision of the contracted level of services and must conform to the methodology established by relevant EU legislation.</p>  <p>  Information regarding PSO allocations to the three CI&Eacute; companies is publicly available through the NTA's Statistical Bulletin series for State funded bus and rail services.

The approach will, amongst things, ensure that:</p>  <p>  - the relevant interactions with the existing legislative framework under the 2013 Act for small public service vehicles (taxis, hackneys and limousines), are properly integrated;</p>  <p>  - the definition of 'rickshaw' will encompass all known types of rickshaw, in particular the most prevalent type of rickshaw in operation which has an electric motor which provides assistance to the person pedalling the rickshaw, and</p>  <p>  - the principles and policies will be set out in primary legislation as to the matters which the NTA may provide for in regulations, thereby giving the NTA the necessary powers to regulate.</p>  <p>  To inform the detailed drafting process I have also tasked the NTA with conducting a public consultation, as the views of key stakeholders and the public will be important in devising an appropriate regulatory regime for rickshaws.  The consultation will, amongst other things, seek to elicit information on existing rickshaw operators in relation to the scale and type of operations and users experience of rickshaws including fares charged and issues they have experienced, as well as operators'/drivers' and the public's views on how operators/drivers and vehicles should be regulated.  The NTA intends to initiate the consultation process next week.  Early consultation on proposals to legislate will mean that feedback can be used constructively and a broad consensus secured.</p>  <p>  I share the concerns which have been raised about the need for regulation of rickshaws and it is my intention to progress the drafting of the Heads of a Bill without delay.</p></reply>

Electrified rail use, in particular, is capable of achieving low emissions through utilising renewable sources of energy.  Considerable progress has been achieved in increasing capacity on the light and heavy rail networks.  For instance, the Luas Cross City project is scheduled for completion before the end of the year and it is estimated that the new line will add an extra 8 to 10 million journeys per annum on the Luas network.  Also, in 2017 we will see an increase in Dart frequency and additional commuter services through the newly-opened Phoenix Park Tunnel.</p>  <p>  Rail operators are also playing an active role in emission reductions on existing services, introducing a range of technical measures including automatic engine shutdown, configuring train length to match passenger demand and installing traction control software.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I am committed to the further development of electric fuelled public transport, particularly along high demand routes in the GDA where capacity requirements make such investment cost-effective.  We are progressing plans on the New Metro North project which is due to commence construction in 2021; while &euro;82 million has been allocated to the DART Expansion Programme between 2019 and 2022 to begin the extension of the DART line to Balbriggan, and the design and planning of DART services to Maynooth in the west and Hazelhatch in the southwest.</p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann operates the heavy rail network and is responsible for assessing rolling stock requirements for the heavy rail network in conjunction with the NTA.</p>  <p>  Noting the responsibilities of the agencies in this regard, I have referred the Deputy's question to both NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for direct reply.

In discharging its statutory responsibility, Tusla supports emergency refuges in providing services for women and children fleeing domestic violence.  Tusla also provides a range of community-based supports to victims. </p><p>In 2017, Tusla is providing &euro;22.1 million in funding to domestic, sexual and gender based violence services, an increase of &euro;1.5m over 2016 funding. </p><p>Capital funding for refuge developments falls under the remit of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and local housing authorities.  Funding provided by Tusla supports the revenue costs and contributes to support services provided by refuges.</p><p>In 2016, the provision of domestic violence refuge spaces nationally was 147 emergency refuge family units.

However, information provided by funded domestic violence services indicates that refuges consistently operate at full or near full-capacity.  Any vacancies are generally attributed to the turnover between the discharge and admission of clients.</p><p>There are currently a number of emergency refuge developments in train, with over 10 additional family units to become available nationally.</p><p>Services to victims of domestic violence in counties Cavan and Monaghan are provided by Tearmann Domestic Violence Services.  In 2017, Tusla is providing funding of &euro;192,000 to Tearmann Domestic Violence Services for the provision of support and advocacy services.  A range of integrated supports are required in order to reduce the need for women and families to use emergency accommodation and to ensure that families disrupted by domestic violence can be supported to resume normal and safe family living beyond refuge-type accommodation, within the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p>Currently, there are no emergency refuges located in counties Cavan and Monaghan.  However, there are three refuge services located in counties Louth and Meath which are responsible for providing services to women and families across the wider North East area.</p><p>Tusla recognises that there are challenges to be addressed in ensuring that there is an appropriate configuration of spaces available to all women and children who require emergency refuge accommodation, and that those with the greatest need for safe accommodation, are prioritised appropriately.</p></reply>

This grant scheme then passed to the Family Support Agency (FSA) when it was established in 2003 and subsequently to Tusla on establishment in January 2014. </p>  <p>  Up until 2011 applications were invited through an annual public advertisement.  The scheme was then closed for financial reasons and no new applications have been accepted since that time.  Those who received funding in 2011 have continued to receive an annual grant equivalent to their 2011 grant.  This Counselling Grants Scheme is for a total of &euro;245,900 annually and currently there are only 64 grantees nationwide benefitting from it.  With over 4,000 schools in Ireland 64 grantees means that less than 2% of schools are in receipt of support from this scheme currently.</p>  <p>  I have decided that until an alternative methodology for provision of counselling can be established, the grant should stay in place in its current format. </p></reply>

For this reason, the ACS will be delivered through Tusla-registered childcare providers, both centre-based providers and childminders. </p>  <p>  A working group has been established, chaired by Childminding Ireland (CMI), and including officials from Tusla and the Department, to make recommendations on reforms for the sector including proposals in relation to quality assurance, whether on a voluntary/non-statutory basis in the short term, or on a mandatory/statutory basis in the long term.  These will include recommendations in relation to childminders who are exempt from registration with Tusla (Child and Family Agency) (those minding three or fewer pre-school children, or those minding school age children only).  The recommendations are likely to include proposals to be progressed in the short, medium and long term, including the development of National Quality Standards for childminders and a proportionate system of quality assurance and regulation.  It is envisaged that the group will present its findings to me very shortly.</p>  <p>  Depending on the recommendations of the Working Group, it is possible that other approaches to quality assurance may be developed for childminding, possibly on a temporary basis pending transition to full regulation.  It is with that possibility in mind that the Heads of Bill and General Scheme for the ACS proposes the possibility that approved providers under the ACS may include both Tusla-registered providers and other approved providers whose quality has been assured by other mechanisms, to be specified in regulations.  This proposed approach to the inclusion of childminders in the ACS is dependent on the development of a satisfactory approach to quality assurance.  There is no question of providing subsidies where quality standards have not been assured.</p></reply>

Under the 1991 Act, as amended by the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla - the Child and Family Agency has a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  The Child Care Act 1991 is the key piece of legislation whereby the State, as a last resort and in the common good, may intervene to supply the place of parents. </p><p><i></i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People contains a specific commitment - under the outcome of children being safe and protected from harm - to &lsquo;review and reform, as necessary, the Child Care Act, 1991'.  This includes an examination of possible amendments of existing provisions in some instances, and also the addition of new developments in other areas. </p><p>My Department is undertaking a review of the Child Care Act 1991 and is embarking on a consultation process.  This will include an open policy debate in September.  My Department is seeking to ensure that this review results in a child-centred structure and is working closely with Tusla to help identify key themes and areas for reform and development.  Wider consultation with stakeholders will also inform the review. </p><p>The Child and Family Agency's powers to investigate allegations of abuse derive from section 3 of the Child Care Act, 1991.  Section 3 states as follows:</p><blockquote>&ldquo;(3) (1) It shall be a function of the Child and Family Agency to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.<br /><br />(2) In the performance of this function, the Child and Family Agency shall:<br /><br />(a) take such steps as it considers requisite to identify children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and co-ordinate information from all relevant sources relating to children;<br /><br />(b) having regard to the rights and duties of parents, whether under the Constitution or otherwise:<br /><br />(i) regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration, and<br /><br />(ii) in so far as is practicable, give due consideration, having regard to his age and understanding, to the wishes of the child; and<br /><br />(c) have regard to the principle that it is generally in the best interests of a child to be brought up in his own family.&quot;</blockquote><p>This statutory framework provides Tusla with the authority and obligation to investigate allegations of concern.  This position is reflected in case law.  For example, the High Court judgement of Mr. Justice Barr in MQ v Gleeson accepted that there was a duty on the health board [now Tusla] to investigate allegations of child abuse and the judgement effectively set out the parameters of that statutory duty.  Judge Barr also found that the duty imposed on the Health Board [now Tusla] related not just to &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; children who were identified or identifiable but also to children who may be subject to a specific potential future risk.</p><p>In assessing allegations of abuse, Tusla is required to take full account of natural justice and the constitutional rights of the accused.  In this context, and in order to assist staff in fulfilling the Agency's obligations under section 3, I am advised that a Tusla  internal protocol, which sets out the policy and procedures for staff to follow when responding to allegations of child abuse and neglect, is currently being updated and will be launched later this year.</p></reply>

These changes will include a new universal subsidy of up to &euro;1,040 per annum, for children aged from 6 months up to 36 months old (or commencement of the ECCE free pre-school programme) and significant increases of up to 50 per cent in targeted childcare subvention rates provided under the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Scheme for children up to 15 years old. </p>  <p>  I remain fully committed to introducing the ACS and will do so at the earliest possible date.  My Department has made significant progress in this regard.  The Government has approved the Heads of Bill for the Scheme, and officials are working intensively to plan for successful implementation of the Scheme.  However, I am conscious that this is a complex project which we must get right from the beginning.  We need to have the legislation, business processes and a new robust IT system in place.  We will need to test the System rigorously to ensure that it is efficient and easy to navigate for both families and providers. </p>  <p>  I want to build a system that will underpin childcare supports for children and investment in the childcare sector for years to come.  We are well on our way to introducing the ACS.  When fully operational it will be a state of the art system which will be capable of delivering, not just for this generation of children, but for generations to come.  In the meantime, I am satisfied that the measures I am introducing this September will honour the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering more affordable childcare to families.</p>  <p>  These childcare supports will become available to families from this September through childcare services contracted through my Department.  It is not envisaged that any payment will be made retrospectively, however a non-contact payment in recognition of administration associated with the new measures will be paid this year to all childcare providers who sign up to deliver these childcare supports on behalf of my Department. </p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff working in youth services and communities throughout the country. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that I have allocated an extra &euro;5.5m in current funding to support the provision of youth services in 2017.  This will bring the total youth funding by my Department to &euro;57.4m, an increase of 10% over last year's allocation.  The additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services. </p>  <p>  The Local Youth Club Grant Scheme supports youth work activities at a local level.  These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through the local Education and Training Boards.  The scheme is open to new entrants and is advertised locally.  Applications for funding are invited by the Education and Training Boards from local groups in their respective areas.  Each year, more than 600 local youth clubs benefit from the scheme.  In 2016, &euro;1.065m was allocated to this scheme.  In 2017, I have provided an additional 10% in funding to the scheme, bringing the total allocation to &euro;1.1715. </p>  <p>  After a period of consultation with key stakeholders it was agreed that in line with the National Youth Strategy 2015&ndash;2020 it would be a condition of the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme that at least 75% of the club/group membership should be between the ages of 10 and 21.  </p>  <p>  This grant scheme was designed to provide volunteer-led youth activities for young people aged between 10 and 21.  The clarification will ensure that the Scheme will have the maximum impact on the targeted cohort of young people while having the benefit of a built-in flexibility of 25% for those not in that age bracket. </p>  <p>  It is my view that the Scout groups will not be inconvenienced by this clarification.</p></reply>

If wage rates were to rise, my Department would have to examine the possible need for subsidy rates to rise to reflect the higher cost of delivery for childcare providers.  Subsidy rates are a matter for Government decision &ndash; they would not rise automatically in line with changes in wages.  There is no Government decision to increase subsidy rates at this time.</p>  <p>  To help support the future development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme, I will shortly be commissioning an Independent Review on the Cost of Quality Childcare.  This will be put to tender by mid-August and will be completed within a number of months.  My officials have been scoping the work that will be involved and preparing terms of reference for the study.  Issues to be examined in the independent review will include:</p>  <p>  - Average unit costs for childcare providers (both centre-based providers and home-based childminders).</p>  <p>  - Factors that result in different costs for different providers, including age of children, geography (e.g. rural vs. urban), whether a service is a community service or private, and aspects of the quality of provision.</p>  <p>  - Comparison of unit costs in high quality services with average services.</p>  <p>  - Possible impact of future cost pressures, including potential wage increases.</p>  <p>  - Analysis of the childcare market, including the functioning of the childcare market in disadvantaged areas.</p>  <p>  I anticipate that this Independent Review will be a key input in informing future decisions on the Affordable Childcare Scheme, including the setting of subsidy rates.</p>  <p>  I would like to highlight that while the Department is not an employer of childcare workers it is a significant funder of childcare services and very conscious that there is an issue with regard to the pay and conditions of workers in the sector.

I have also secured an additional once-off payment of &euro;3.5m in respect of the More Affordable Childcare measures being implemented by providers from this September.</p>  <p>  With regard to the necessity of administrative demands on providers, whilst my Department is seeking to minimise the red-tape or burden on providers, it is important that appropriate governance and compliance standards are met where exchequer funding is being used.</p>  <p>  The various childcare schemes were introduced some years ago on an administrative basis, in response to immediate, identified needs.  They were put in place within very short timescales, with limited resources to manage them to today&rsquo;s standard of financial and administrative compliance.  The schemes have benefited tens of thousands of families, helping parents to seek training and employment in circumstances where they would otherwise have been unable to work outside the home.  They have also benefited children by providing early care and education.</p>  <p>  Many of the services that have been funded are operated by small, locally based providers, and some are overseen by voluntary boards, which would not have the resources or expertise for extensive financial or administrative procedures.  With this in mind, my Department has always tried to balance the need for straightforward rules and reasonably simple procedures with the requirements of financial accountability in using taxpayer&rsquo;s money.  Working with community and voluntary organisations and a range of small to larger private services has enabled my Department to reach vulnerable children and families, most in need, all around the country.</p>  <p>  My Department has been working for some time to ensure appropriate financial and administrative compliance in the use of childcare investment, balanced with sufficient flexibility to enable small local providers or not for profit organisations to meet important needs of young families.</p>  <p>  Many of the financial and administrative issues arising will be addressed when the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) is put in place on a statutory basis, replacing the existing administratively based schemes.  I am committed to introducing the ACS as soon as possible, and am working on the legislation, business processes and ICT system necessary for a robust well-functioning scheme.  The new single scheme should be administratively less complex for providers, whilst strong on governance and compliance requirements to protect exchequer investment.</p>  <p>  In advance of the ACS, my Department has taken a number of important steps.  It has:</p>  <p>-  Put significantly increased staffing resources in place to put the schemes on a more robust footing</p>  <p>-  Revised grant agreements with providers, strengthening provision of financial reporting</p>  <p>-  Prepared improved scheme rules which were published this week to accompany the schemes, giving greater clarity about providers&rsquo; record keeping and reporting responsibilities</p>  <p>-  Commenced the commissioning of work to review, refine and implement governance and financial accountability capacity within the EY sector</p>  <p>-  Increased the number of unannounced visits by Pobal (which operates the schemes on behalf of the Department) especially in areas of particular concern and compliance: and</p>  <p>-  Ensured a substantially expanded compliance programme by Pobal since 2016.</p>  <p>  My Department has sought to balance administrative, governance and compliance demands on providers with supports such as the non-contact payments, support from the 30 City and County Childcare Committees across the country, and other quality initiatives.</p>  <p>  Managing the administrative burden on providers, whilst meeting governance and compliance requirements, is an important and complex task for my Department.  We will continue to prioritise this work so that the needs of local communities are met while value for public money is assured.</p></reply>

Data on the number of staff working in the childcare sector is gathered annually through the Early Years Sector Profile.  This is a survey which is administered by Pobal in conjunction with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs with the aim of providing a national picture of services providing early childhood care and education in Ireland.</p><p>For the most recent figures, the best indicator is the Early Years Sector Profile Report 2015-16, which was published in November 2016.  The survey on which the Report is based was completed by 79 per cent of childcare providers in April 2016.  Pobal have extrapolated the figures provided in the Report in order to establish the qualification levels for early years practitioners at a national level.  It is estimated that there are 23,291 early years practitioners currently employed in private and community services.  Of these, 7,418 hold a level 5 qualification on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), 8,926 hold a level 6 qualification on the NFQ, 1,215 hold a level 7 qualification on the NFQ , while 2,687 hold a level 8 qualification on the NFQ qualification.</p><p>The Early Years Sector Report 2015-2016 can be found on Pobal's website, <i><i>www. pobal.ie.</i></i></p><p>The figures for mid-2017 will become available in the coming months, when this year&rsquo;s data has been gathered and analysed.</p></reply>

It is an allowance in respect of the child and is provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sporting activities.  The allowance is not considered as means for Social Welfare purposes nor is it taxable. There is no intention to increase the rate of the Foster Care Allowance at this time.</p>  <p>  In response to the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015, Tusla has introduced a number of new practices.  These include the standardisation of financial supports and planning offered to eligible young people leaving care.  This weekly standardised allowance ensures equality for all care leavers engaged in training and education.</p>  <p>  Each care leaver as part of their leaving and aftercare planning will have an Individual Financial Support Plan.  This is a standardised tool to assist in identifying all the financial supports required by, and available to, each young person.  It is important to note that young people leaving care typically receive supports relating to accommodation, further education, employment and training, which are funded by other Government Departments.  This means that the part of Tusla&rsquo;s expenditure related to aftercare supports and services represents one constituent element of the total spending by the State on those in receipt of aftercare services.</p>  <p>  It is expected that each young person eligible for aftercare and engaged in education or training will have access to an income of a minimum allowance of &euro;300 per week.  The &euro;300 may be a combined amount from other departments/ agencies or may be paid in full or partly by Tusla.</p>  <p>  Where a young adult is in education or training at 18 years of age and remains in their former care placement, the aftercare allowance is payable to the foster carer(s) or supported lodgings provider.  Where a young adult continues with education / training and is in independent living, the aftercare allowance is payable directly to the young adult.  Tusla informs me that aspects of the provision of standardised aftercare payments are under review.</p></reply>

Under the Programme, Tusla provides financial support towards the running costs of Family Resource Centres nationwide.  This typically covers the employment of two to three members of staff and some overhead costs.  FRCs provide a range of universal and targeted services and development opportunities that address the needs of families.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will already be aware that there are currently two FRCs in County Kildare in receipt of funding under the FRC Programme.  These centres are based in Newbridge and the Curragh.</p>  <p>  As the FRC Programme is managed by Tusla, it is a matter for that organisation to make decisions regarding the inclusion or non-inclusion of Family Resource Centres to the Programme.  Tusla has advised that voluntary groups are welcome to submit expressions of interest to join the Family Resource Centre Programme.  However, admission to the FRC Programme is subject to competing demands and the availability of funding.</p>  <p>  I recognise that County Kildare has experienced a significant increase in its population base, and that there is a strong demand for services in the area.

My Department will spend approximately &euro;232 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 428,000 customers.</p>  <p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew.  At the end of September 2013 there were almost 396,000 receiving the telephone allowance compared to approximately 316,000 people in 2007.  This was an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum.</p>  <p>  The value of the telephone allowance in 2012 was &euro;270 per annum.  Therefore, the cost of restoring the allowance at this level in 2018 might be estimated to be in the region of &euro;118 million per annum, although the precise figure would depend upon a number of factors.</p>  <p>  While the telephone allowance was an important measure for vulnerable persons, the nature of the market has been transformed in recent years with deregulation, mobile services and bundled services including television, broadband and telephone.  It makes the former notion of an allowance covering handset rental, standing charges and a number of calls somewhat outdated, when similar assistance can be achieved by increasing the rate of core payments, which benefit people regardless of whether they have a landline or not, and which can be spent by the recipients either on their landline-related costs, or on something else of their own choosing.</p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years was given.  This increased the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, there was a further increase in the rate of State pensions by &euro;5, which has increased the maximum personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;227, and of the maximum rate of the contributory pension to &euro;238.30.</p>  <p>  Therefore, over the past two Budgets, the maximum weekly rate for State Pensions has increased by &euro;8 per week, along with pro-rata increases for Increases for Qualified Adults.  The value of these increases is well in excess of the value of the telephone allowance previously provided.</p>  <p>  Any decision to restore the telephone allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  In the previous two Budgets, the Government has concentrated resources on increasing the rate of the pension, rather than on the Household Benefits package.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Based on a similar yearly increase each year since 2013, it is estimated that the number of bereavement grant claims that might arise in 2018, were the scheme to be re-introduced, would be in the region of 28,858, and the number would be expected to increase in future years.  If there were 28,858 such grants made in 2018, at a rate of &euro;850 each, the cost would be &euro;24.53 million.</p>  <p>  Any decision to reinstate the Bereavement Grant would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  While the bereavement grant did provide support to families during a time of grief and financial pressure it is worth noting that there are still a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  Under the SWA scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.  The Government has provided &euro;31.5 million for exceptional and urgent needs payments in 2017. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Although they are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course, they may receive travel and lunch allowances. </p>  <p>  Further, an unemployed person who does not qualify for a social welfare payment due to the assessment of their means may be eligible to sign for social insurance contribution credits.  Persons signing on for credits for 12 months or longer over the previous 18 months were entitled to participate on Momentum courses through Solas, provided that they have been actively seeking work, however, they will not receive any payment.  Persons signing for credits for six months or more are entitled to participate on ETB-run VTOS courses subject to availability.  In the case of VTOS courses, participants do not receive a training allowance but may receive travel and lunch allowances.  Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also open to people regardless of their social welfare status.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to supporting as many people as possible to participate more fully in employment and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers they may encounter in finding and sustaining employment.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.  At the end of the 2016/17 fuel allowance season 376,123 households were in receipt of the fuel allowance payment.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to announce last week that from October, when the new Fuel Season begins, our customers who receive the Fuel Allowance will have the option to receive their payment in two lump sums &ndash; one at the start of the fuel season in October and the second in January.  The value of the lump sums will be &euro;292.50 each.  This will enable people to buy fuel in bulk and potentially avail of special offers or discounts on the purchase of the particular fuel that meets their specific needs.</p>  <p>  My Deparnt also pays the household benefits package at an estimated cost of &euro;232 million in 2017.  &euro;177 million of this cost relates to the electricity or gas allowance element of the household benefits package.  As of the end of June this year 424,393 households were in receipt of the electricity or gas allowance element of the household benefits package.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme, a weekly or monthly supplement may be paid to assist people whose means are insufficient to meet their needs in certain circumstances.</p>  <p>  A Fuel Supplement may be paid in lieu of the National Fuel Scheme in cases where people have entitlement but are not receiving payment from any other source.  Expenditure on SWA Fuel Supplement during the period of the national fuel scheme (from 3 October 2016 to 31 March 2017) is estimated at &euro;68,450 based on an average of 117 households receiving the payment.</p>  <p>  Under the SWA scheme a heating supplement may be paid to a person who lives alone or only with a qualified adult or child(ren) and who has exceptional heating needs due to ill health or infirmity.  There is no standard rate for a heating supplement and each payment is awarded taking into account the individual circumstances of the case.  There are currently (end June 2017) 1,510 recipients of the payment.  Expenditure on SWA Heating Supplement during the period of the national fuel scheme (from 3 October 2016 to 31 March 2017) is estimated at some &euro;585,000 based on an average of 1,650 households receiving the payment. </p>  <p>  Exceptional needs payments (ENPs) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which a person is unable to meet from their own resources.  For the period of the national fuel scheme, some 1,900 ENPs totalling &euro;495,700 were made under the ENP category of heating.  </p>  <p>  The best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling.  My Department works closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on these issues and in moving forward the actions agreed in the Energy Affordability Strategy.  In that regard, the Better Energy Homes scheme provides support towards the installation of attic and wall insulation, and heating system upgrades.</p>  <p>  The Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme which is led by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Services Executive (HSE), aims to make homes warmer and healthier to live in. It does this by providing extensive energy efficiency upgrades to those in energy poverty who are living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Asthma.  My Department is actively assisting that department in identifying the people who can benefit from this scheme.</p>  <p>  Any decision to increase the fuel allowance payment would have to be considered in the overall budgetary and policy context.  In this regard, my Department hosted its annual Pre-Budget Forum in Dublin Castle on the 21st of July, where I listened to the views of representatives from some 45 NGOs, advocacy and representative organisations, including the organisation referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The service is delivered by two companies, Seetec Ltd and Turas Nua Ltd.</p>  <p>  At present there are over 450 full-time equivalent personal advisers (excluding administrative and support staff) working with both JobPath providers.  The JobPath providers were required to set out their approach to recruitment and training of staff as part of the procurement process and the proposals submitted were taken into account in the assessment of tenders.  As there are two providers the proposals differed somewhat but shared many common characteristics including a multi-stage recruitment process of interviews and assessment centres, and a requirement for candidates to demonstrate specific experience, skills and competencies in areas such as knowledge of local labour market conditions, recruitment practice, customer service, use of IT systems, rapport building and interpersonal skills, and problem solving. </p>  <p>  Similarly the training programmes for staff within the JobPath providers share common characteristics including training modules of induction, skills/competency development, on the job mentoring/coaching and the opportunity for professional accreditation. </p>  <p>  The employers of case officers/personal advisors, including the Department itself and the Local Employment Service providers do not specify particular qualifications as a pre-requisite to appointment to the role of case officer/personal advisor. </p>  <p>  The JobPath Satisfaction Study, published earlier this year, shows that an overall majority of JobPath participants agreed that the staff are good at their jobs (95% for Seetec staff, 93% for Turas Nua staff).</p>  <p>  The Department has built a number of checks into the JobPath including on-site inspections and independent surveys of client experience/satisfaction with the service provided by the JobPath contractors.  Failure to demonstrate satisfactory performance can lead to the application of payment penalties and potentially to cancellation of contracts.  These checks and measures are in addition to the performance control inherent in the payment by results nature of the contracts. </p>  <p>  For the purposes of the JobPath service all long-term unemployed jobseekers on the Live Register are categorised into groups based on their duration of unemployment (e.g. 1- 2 years, 2 &ndash; 3 years etc.).  Selection for referral to the JobPath provider is by means of stratified random sampling using these groupings; the objective being to ensure equity in selection and also that people referred to JobPath are a representative of the long term cohort on the Live Register. </p>  <p>  In line with the Department&rsquo;s policies on activation, jobseekers aged 62 and over are not subject to the commencement of mandatory activation measures.  As such, jobseekers already over the age of 62 are exempt from selection for referral to JobPath. </p>  <p>  However, where a jobseeker has been selected for any activation programme and reaches 62 years of age while on the programme they are expected to complete it.</p>  <p>  The duration of a person's jobseeker claim is recorded in terms of days of unemployment.  Jobseeker Allowance claims are made up of continuous periods of unemployment.  Any two such periods not separated by more than 52 weeks is considered to be the same continuous period of unemployment - this is known as linking the claim.  Long-term jobseekers that may have left the live register to go into employment are still considered to be long-term if they reopen their claim within the 52 weeks.  They retain certain entitlements (for example no waiting days and other supplemental benefits) and are available for selection for activation services including JobPath. </p>  <p>  Customers who have not been in full time employment but are returning to Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments from other departmental employment schemes, for example community employment and T&Uacute;S are also eligible for selection for JobPath.</p>  <p>  Information is shared with these two companies to enable them to provide employment services on behalf of the Department.  The purpose of sharing this information is to assist in the development of tailored personal progression plans for each jobseeker in order to support them back into paid employment.  As part of the contracts for the provision of these services, there are strict obligations placed on these providers by the Department in terms of data protection.  It should be noted that the contracts in place are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Ireland and the courts of Ireland have exclusive jurisdiction over these contracts.  The companies are also contractually required to register with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and are subject to the same provisions of data protection legislation as Departmental staff.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In line with this objective and as part of the activation agenda, Case Officers employed by my Department deliver activation and case management services to jobseekers across the network of Intreo Centres.  Case Officers by their proactive engagement with jobseekers and through the provision of a range of employment supports, encourage and support Jobseekers in their efforts to find and sustain employment.</p><p>Since July 2015, when the Activation and Case Management System was introduced, a record of all stages of  the activation interactions between the Case Officer and the jobseeker is captured.  Following the registration for a jobseeker payment, the obligatory activation journey starts with the initial Group Information Session, the purpose of which is to outline the nature and purpose of the activation process and provide useful jobseeker information.  This is followed, typically within a week, by a One to One meeting between the Case Officer and the Jobseeker.  The purpose of the One to One meeting is to agree and complete a Personal Progression Plan (PPP)<b>.</b>The PPP sets out a series of jointly agreed steps and actions to help the Jobseeker improve their job prospects and achieve their employment goal.<font color="#2F2F2F">  The PPP sets out the individual needs of each jobseeker and will be tailored to their personal circumstances.</font><b></b>Subsequently, for those remaining on the live register, <font color="#2F2F2F">Activation Review Meetings</font><font color="#2F2F2F">(ARMs) are held at defined times after the PPP is agreed in order to discuss and review progress on the actions agreed in the PPP.</font></p><p>While systemized data on training, job placement rates and the percentage breakdown of those interviewed in respect of each Intreo centre is not readily available, details of the level of activation engagement activity since July 2015 to date are contained in the following table (1).  These figures do not include clients who availed of employment supports outside of the INTREO service. </p><p>Table (1) Intreo Activation Meetings<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Group Information Session Number of Attendees</th><th>Follow on 1:2;1 Meeting Number of Attendees</th><th>Activation Review Meeting Number of Attendees</th><th>Total number of Attendees</th></tr><tr><td>From July 2015 to end of year</td><td>22,9321</td><td>12,793</td><td>18,900</td><td>54,625</td></tr><tr><td>2016 (full year)</td><td>90,125</td><td>63,114</td><td>92,944</td><td>246,183</td></tr><tr><td>2017 to date</td><td>40,211</td><td>31,281</td><td>55,956</td><td>127,448</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>153,268</td><td>107,188</td><td>167,800</td><td>428,256</td></tr></table></p><p>It is worth noting that Case Officers are not solely confined to providing activation services to those on the live register but also provide a service to other cohorts such as people with a disability, who wish to avail of activation and employment supports on a voluntary basis. </p><p>Although the labour market situation is improving considerably as the recovery continues, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate unemployed people find and sustain employment.  Ensuring that as many as possible of these jobs are taken up by unemployed people continues to be a major overarching objective of the activation policies set out in Pathways to Work 2016-2020.</p></reply>

The payment is predicated on the child being resident at home. </p>  <p>  The legislative basis for the scheme is provided for in Chapter 8A of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005 (as inserted by section 15 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2008).  Section 186E of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, as amended, provides that Domiciliary Care Allowance is not payable for any period during which a child is resident in a hospital.</p>  <p>  A reduced rate of DCA (50%) is payable for children who are resident at home at weekends only, but in a care setting during the week.  DCA can also be paid for up to 13 weeks in a 12 month period, if a child is admitted to hospital.</p>  <p>  The restriction on the payment of this allowance in respect of children who are being cared for on a full-time basis in a hospital setting is limited to the period during which they are resident in a hospital and having their care needs provided for and funded by public funds.  Once they return home, DCA can be paid provided the other qualifying conditions are met at that time.</p>  <p>  Carers allowance can only be paid in respect of a child under 16 years of age if DCA is already in payment.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for a Partnership Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. </p>  <p>  Carer's allowance (CA) is a means tested payment, made to people who are providing full-time care and attention to elderly people or to people with disabilities and whose income falls below certain limits.  The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full time care and attention is required and being provided and that the means test which applies is satisfied. </p>  <p>  The means test is already one of the most generous in the social protection system in that &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person; the equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.  A married couple with 2 children could have weekly earnings of &euro;1,135 net of PRSI, superannuation and union subscription costs and still qualify for the minimum rate of Carer's Allowance.  This is equivalent to over &euro;59,000 per annum. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, considerable improvements have been introduced for carers in recent years.  In Budget 2016, the carer&rsquo;s support grant &ndash; which is payable without a means test - was increased to &euro;1,700 and the period when CA can be paid following the death of a care recipient was extended from 6 to 12 weeks.  In addition to the Christmas Bonus and the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rate, Budget 2017 introduced a measure that extends payment of CA for 12 weeks where the care recipient enters permanent residential care. </p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to further increase the earnings disregard for CA.  Any changes in this regard could only be considered in a budgetary context and be consistent with the commitments contained in the Programme for Government to support an increase in carer&rsquo;s payments.</p></reply>

This has been impacted by a High Court ruling, following a legal challenge by an un-successful applicant, which places a greater onus on the deciding officer to provide the applicant with more detail of the reasoning used in coming to their decision.  Processing times have increased as a result.  Additional staff have been assigned to the scheme in recent weeks, once they are fully trained and operational it is anticipated that processing times will be again be reduced to target levels. </p><p>At end June 2017, there were 3,725 applications awaiting decision, only 3 have been waiting longer than 6 months for a decision, these particular cases are awaiting further information from the customer.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-26a.4164.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017072600078#WRAAAA05500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1510 to 1516, inclusive, together.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, JobPath is an employment activation service that supports people who are long-term unemployed to secure and sustain paid employment.  My Department has contracted two companies, Turas Nua Limited and Seetec Limited, to deliver JobPath services.  The contracts are for four years comprising with a two year &lsquo;run-off&rsquo; period (during which time no additional clients will be referred).  As the Deputy will be aware JobPath commenced in July 2015, therefore client referrals will continue until 2019 and the &ldquo;run-off&rdquo; period will continue until 2021.</p><p>For the purposes of the JobPath service all long-term unemployed jobseekers on the Live Register are categorised into groups based on their duration of unemployment (e.g. 1- 2 years, 2 &ndash; 3 years etc.).  Selection for referral to the JobPath provider is by means of stratified random sampling using these groupings; the objective being to ensure equity in selection and also that people referred to JobPath are a representative of the long-term cohort on the Live Register.</p><p>The duration of a person's JA claim is recorded in terms of days of unemployment.  Jobseeker Allowance claims are made up of continuous periods of unemployment.  Any two such periods not separated by more than 52 weeks is considered to be the same continuous period of unemployment - this is known as linking the claims.  Long-term jobseekers that may have left the live register to go into employment for less than a year are still considered to be long-term if they reopen their claim within that period.  They retain certain entitlements (for example no waiting days and other supplemental benefits) and are available for selection for activation services including JobPath.</p><p>Customers who have not been in full-time employment but are returning to a Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment from other departmental employment schemes, for example community employment and T&Uacute;S are also eligible for selection for JobPath.</p><p>As part of the JobPath process each person is assigned a personal advisor who assesses their skills, qualifications and experience with a particular focus on identifying skill deficits. </p><p>JobPath providers arrange for the delivery of a broad range of education and training courses.  Some of these are provided in-house while others are provided by specialist training providers including the Education and Training Boards (ETBs).  In-house courses include CV preparation, interview skills and confidence coaching.  External courses include such subjects as adult literacy, IT and various construction related skills.  In addition JobPath participants may also apply for the Back to Education Allowance Scheme in order to pursue second and third-level courses. </p><p>The Department will extend the period for receipt of the JobPath activation service for up to 6 months while a customer pursues an externally delivered approved course, during that time the JobPath companies remain in contact with the person to provide any support they need whilst on the course.</p><p>For any long-term programmes of education such as a third-level course the client is withdrawn from JobPath with no financial benefit to the JobPath provider.  Customers who are commencing courses and have been approved for the Back to Education Allowance are not required to engage with the JobPath service. </p><p>The JobPath model has a number of key features which enables my Department to monitor all aspects of the service provider&rsquo;s performance and ensure contract compliance. </p><p>Every participant is provided with a service guarantee - a baseline level of service covering frequency of engagement, personal progression planning, geographic accessibility and in-employment support.  This is to prevent so called &lsquo;parking&rsquo; of clients. </p><p>Providers are obliged to accept all clients referred by the Department and have no role in the selection of clients which prevents &lsquo;cream-skimming&rsquo; of the employable jobseekers in preference to jobseekers that are more distant from the labour market.  The period of engagement with the service for any individual jobseeker is 52 weeks.  Participation is mandatory for those who are referred. </p><p>Fees are paid on the basis of performance.  With the exception of the initial registration fee, payments are made only when a client has achieved sustained employment.  All the initial set up costs have been borne by the JobPath providers.</p><p>The service providers are subject to regular audits and inspections.  In addition my Department commissions regular, independent, Customer Satisfaction Surveys to ensure that services are being delivered satisfactorily. </p><p>It is important to note that failure to achieve satisfactory customer ratings and/or failure to achieve employment placement targets may result in reductions of fees paid via the use of retention fees - in effect these are penalties that reduce fees paid by up to 15%.  Where Contractors do not address the issue that gives rise to use of retention fees to the satisfaction of the Department, the Department has the right to terminate the contract. </p><p>Regular on-site checks and inspections are carried out to ensure that JobPath is delivered in accordance with the contract.  To date, 37 on-site inspections have been carried out at provider service delivery locations around the country.</p><p>The inspections monitor compliance with the service level agreement and the contract generally, including the suitability and standard of accommodation, staffing levels, Irish language compliance, customer service and customer feedback, checking the client&rsquo;s Personal Progression Plan, Review Meetings compliance, the checking of Job Sustainment Fee Evidence Types and Exit Plans.  </p><p>JobPath is a payment by results model and all set-up and day-to-day operational costs are borne by the companies.  Payments are made on a phased basis over a 12 month period in respect of each jobseeker placed into sustained employment.  Accordingly the contractors will not be able to fully recover their costs unless they help a sufficient number of jobseekers to secure employment and then support them to sustain that employment over a 12 month period. </p><p>JobPath is assessed on an on-going basis through regular inspections and performance reporting.  My Department has begun publishing a performance report for the service on a quarterly basis.  The most recent report was published on the Department&rsquo;s website in June and can be accessed at - .</p><p>It is intended that a full econometric evaluation of the service will commence in early 2018.</p><p>The outcomes of the customer satisfaction survey, also published in January, indicate that jobseekers are having a positive experience with the service.  For example, jobseekers felt that they were receiving a good service (with 71 to 86% satisfaction vs. 5 &ndash; 8% dissatisfaction) and that the staff of the service made them feel valued (90+ %).  Finally, the Department intends to commission a full econometric evaluation of the service towards the end of 2017, when a sufficient number of jobseekers will have completed their engagement period with the service and when a robust set of outcome data will be available to facilitate the analysis. </p><p>A complaint is defined as &ldquo;an expression of dissatisfaction, measurable by reference to service standards, and requiring a response.&rdquo;  Issues covered by the complaint process may include delays, mistakes and poor customer service and also complaints made under Sections 25, 26, 27 and 28 of the Disability Act, 2005.  To date 108,343 Jobseekers have been referred to the service, with 342 complaints received in total.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s contract with the JobPath provider requires them to have a comprehensive Complaints Procedure and this is advertised in every provider location.  The procedure contains levels of escalation whereby complaints are dealt with at a level of authority appropriate to the complaint and ensuring that matters are fully addressed.</p><p>The JobPath providers log and record all complaints they receive and submit the total twice monthly to my Department.  Likewise, my Department log and record all complaints received directly in respect of the JobPath service and forward them to the JobPath provider in line with their contract obligations.</p><p>I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The companies are, for example, contractually required to register with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and are subject to the same provisions of data protection legislation as Departmental staff.  The contracts in place are also governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Ireland and the courts of Ireland have exclusive jurisdiction over these contracts.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Consolidated) Act 2005, as amended, specifies that participation in activation meetings arranged by or on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection is mandatory for those in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance.  Jobseekers are required to engage with my Department&rsquo;s activation service and this obligation applies irrespective of whether the service is provided by the Department&rsquo;s own case officers or those advisors employed by contracted companies, such as Local Employment Service, JobPath or Job Club providers.</p>  <p>  In addition all persons, including the customer in question, who are in receipt of a Jobseeker's payment must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking employment.  The application form for a jobseeker's payment advises the jobseeker that information may be exchanged with other organisations such as JobPath service providers. </p>  <p>  The purpose of sharing this information is to assist in the development of a tailored plan for the individual jobseeker in order to support them back in to paid employment.  Jobseekers who engage with the JobPath service receive intensive individual support to help them address barriers to employment and to assist them in finding sustainable jobs.  Each person is assigned a personal advisor who will assess a person&rsquo;s individual skills, experience, qualifications and work goals.  A personal progression plan is put in place which sets out a schedule of activities; actions and job focused targets, taking into account a person&rsquo;s individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

We are extremely sorry for any worry or concern this may cause to parents/guardians of children with additional care needs.  At present it is taking 20 weeks on average to finalise an application.  Applications are processed in date of receipt order.  There are a number of factors that have contributed to the extended time required to process claims.</p>  <p>  First, there is a significant increase in the volume of applications being received.  The numbers applying for DCA have increased significantly since 2009, when the Department took over administration of the scheme from the HSE.  The year on year increase in volumes over recent years has consistently been in the 15-20% range due to an increase in population and more awareness of the scheme.  Over 1,000 claims were received in May, along with a further 700 in June; whereas the average would have been 400 per month a few years ago. </p>  <p>  Secondly, following a High Court ruling in 2016, there is now a need for the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors to provide the deciding officer with a more detailed opinion on the child&rsquo;s eligibility for the scheme and for the deciding officer in turn to provide more detailed reasons for their decision when communicating this to the customer.  These factors have resulted in the time taken to finalise applications increasing significantly and as a result the numbers being processed have reduced and the timescale to finalise each application has increased.</p>  <p>  Corrective actions are being taken, with additional deciding officers recently assigned to work on the scheme.  Once these deciding officers become fully operational, the increase in claim processing capacity should allow for an improvement in processing times.</p>  <p>  Applications for DCA in respect of both children were received in the Department on 27 February and 8 May respectively.  While it is not feasible to provide an exact date of when a particular application will be decided, the applications currently being finalised were received in mid-February 2017.  Each application will be considered by a Deciding Officer and a decision notified as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-26a.4181.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017072600079#WRBBBB02100"><p>JobBridge was introduced in July 2011 in response to the sharp and dramatic increase in unemployment.  Since then more than 49,000 participants commenced a work experience placement provided by over 19,000 host organisations.</p><p>Participants are paid an allowance equivalent to their underlying social welfare payment plus an additional 'top-up' of &euro;52.50 per week for the duration of the placement.  The cost of the scheme therefore depends on the number of participants.  The net cost per 1,000 participants is &euro;2.73 million per annum.</p><p>A robust external evaluation of the scheme was conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants in 2016.  It included a cost benefit analysis that indicates that even taking account of deadweight effects and using a high estimate of potential job displacement, JobBridge breaks-even (tax gains and welfare savings) and yields a marginal positive return for the Exchequer over a two year period.  A cost benefit analysis taking account of wider economic benefits and costs and conducted in accordance with Department of Finance and EU Commission guidelines indicates that the scheme yields a positive benefit to the economy within one year.</p><p>The evaluation found that JobBridge is one of the most effective labour market programmes &ndash; increasing participants&rsquo; employment outcomes by 32%.  It also found that while participants rated the scheme positively on 18 out of 20 aspects measured, most were dissatisfied with the level of payment and a sizable minority rated the scheme negatively on some aspects, for example the quality of training offered.</p><p>Based on these findings, and taking account of the improvement in labour market conditions, Indecon recommended that JobBridge be discontinued in its current form and replaced with a new scheme.  A copy of the full evaluation can be found at: <i></i>.</p><p>The Labour Market Council welcomed the report and noted the positive employment impact of the scheme.  A majority of the Council similarly recommended that JobBridge be replaced.</p><p>Having considered the evidence and the suggestions put forward by Indecon and the Labour Market Council, my predecessor as Minister for Social Protection announced his intention to replace JobBridge with a new work experience programme that would address criticisms of the scheme and would be better suited to the much-improved labour market.</p><p>JobBridge was closed to new applications from 27 October 2016 to allow for a period of consultation with key stakeholders on design principles for any proposed new work experience programme and to facilitate an orderly wind down of the current scheme.  There are currently 350 participants on JobBridge.</p><p>The stakeholder consultation process is completed and I am currently considering options on how best to proceed.</p></reply>

It is administered through the local authorities and is one of a number of work programmes that my Department operates.  Given the capacity in the system at present through the other employment schemes such as Community Employment ( CE), T&uacute;s and the Rural Social Scheme ( RSS) and the continuing reduction in the numbers who are unemployed,  the recruitment of participants under the Gateway scheme is currently on hold.</p>  <p>  The 2017 budget for the Gateway scheme is &euro;7.2 million.  The expenditure in the current year to the end of June 2017 is &euro;2.75 million.  The estimated outturn in 2017 will be in the region of &euro;4.0 million.</p>  <p>  Based on current trends it is expected that the direct savings from abolishing the Gateway scheme in 2018 would be in the order of &euro;350,000.  In the event that Gateway was to cease and all current employees were to return to the live register at their former rates of payment, the estimated annual cost of jobseeker's allowance payments in 2018 would be &euro;260,000.  The full year net savings to the Department of Social Protection from the abolition of Gateway in 2018 is estimated at &euro;90,000.</p>  <p>  The figures above do not take account of the additional income the Exchequer receives in the form of income tax, PRSI and USC from those participating on the scheme.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It provides employers with two levels of payment: &euro;7,500 and &euro;10,000.  The &euro;7,500 is paid primarily in respect of those who are 12 months or more on the live register with the higher grant paid in respect of those who have been unemployed for more than 24 months.  The incentive is paid in monthly instalments over a two year period provided the employment is maintained.</p>  <p>  The full year cost of the JobsPlus incentive to support an employee who has been unemployed for between 12 and 24 months is &euro;3,750.  The full year cost to support an employee who has been unemployed for longer than 24 months is &euro;5,000.  The JobsPlus incentive is paid at the higher rate in respect of approximately 72% of employees on the scheme.  Therefore, the full year cost of 5,000 JobsPlus places is estimated at approximately &euro;23.25 million.</p>  <p>  The full year cost of the jobseeker's payment for 5,000 customers is estimated at &euro;52.5 million.  Therefore, the estimated net savings from moving 5,000 people who were long-term unemployed into employment, via the JobsPlus incentive, would be in the order of &euro;29 million.</p>  <p>  The above costings do not include the additional income that arises for the Exchequer from payment of income tax, PRSI and USC from employment or the additional cost from employees who may have an entitlement to receive family income supplement (FIS) or the back to work family dividend.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Those who accept direct provision are provided with accommodation, food and health services together with other facilities and services designed to ensure their needs are met while seeking the protection of the State.  My Department administers payment of the direct provision allowance to protection seekers residing in Direct Provision Centres on behalf of the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  Once a person has been granted status, they may apply for Department of Social Protection payments appropriate to their circumstances, on the same basis as Irish citizens, such as basic supplementary welfare allowance, jobseeker's allowance or one-parent family payment and child benefit, subject to meeting the rules of the particular scheme.  Payment under these schemes can be made to a person while they continue to remain resident in a Direct Provision centre prior to moving into the community, with the value of the non-cash benefits which they receive, i.e. accommodation, food and other services, assessed in the means assessment, subject to the legislation governing the means test for each scheme.  Once a person moves into the community, the rate of payment increases to reflect the change in circumstances.</p>  <p>  Exceptional Needs Payments (ENPs) are made to persons in the direct provision system and are largely paid towards clothing costs, transport costs and the purchase of child related items such as prams/buggies.  ENPs are also paid to support the move from direct provision accommodation into the community, including assistance towards rent deposits and items associated with setting up home.  All applications are determined on a case by case basis having regard to the individual circumstances presented. </p>  <p>  Housing and the provision of emergency accommodation are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-26a.4195.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017072600079#WRBBBB03500"><p>The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</p>  <p>  The changes introduced in 2011 were on foot of a Government commitment included in the National Recovery Plan published in 2010, and in the subsequent Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF.  It is the case, therefore, that there will have been 17 years notice between the passing of this legislation and the increase of the pension age to 68.</p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision, and demographic change alone is expected to increase spending on pensions by over &euro;220 million this year, not including the impact of rate increases.</p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to the new State pension age.  Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker's Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI on a Pay-As-You-Go basis, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  Rowing back on these changes, which have already been legislated for, would undermine that sustainability, to the detriment of current workers.</p>  <p>  It should also be borne in mind that these changes are modest in the context of increasing longevity among older people, and the duration of the average pension is still expected to increase based on current trends.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

We are extremely sorry for any worry or concern this may cause to parents/guardians of children with additional care needs.  At present it is taking 20 weeks on average to finalise an application.  Applications are processed in date of receipt order.  There are a number of factors that have contributed to the extended time required to process claims;  </p>  <p>  First, there is a significant increase in the volume of applications being received.  The numbers applying for DCA have increased significantly since 2009, when the Department took over administration of the scheme from the HSE.  The year on year increase in volumes over recent years has consistently been in the 15-20% range due to an increase in population and more awareness of the scheme.  Over 1,000 claims were received in May, along with a further 700 in June; whereas the average would have been 400 per month a few years ago. </p>  <p>  Secondly, following a High Court ruling in 2016, there is now a need for the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors to provide the deciding officer with a more detailed opinion on the child&rsquo;s eligibility for the scheme and for the deciding officer in turn to provide more detailed reasons for their decision when communicating this to the customer.  These factors have resulted in the time taken to finalise applications increasing significantly and as a result the numbers being processed have reduced and the timescale to finalise each application has increased</p>  <p>  Corrective actions are being taken, with additional deciding officers recently assigned to work on the scheme. Once these deciding officers become fully operational, the increase in claim processing capacity should allow for an improvement in processing times.</p>  <p>  An application for DCA in respect of this child was received in the Department on the 29th March.  While it is not feasible to provide an exact date of when a particular application will be decided, the applications currently being finalised were received in mid-February 2017.  The application will be considered by a Deciding Officer and a decision notified as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

CE will continue to be the largest programme in 2017 with 22,400 places available in over 950 schemes across the country.

No. 552/2008) provides that periods of social insurance in Ireland and in the Republic of Korea may be taken into account, where necessary, by either State in order to qualify for certain benefits and pensions. In effect, it protects the pension rights of people who have worked and paid reckonable social security contributions in Ireland and in Korea by allowing a person to combine the period of contributions in each country, if necessary, to qualify for a pension payment under either Irish or Korean law.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  The Agreement ensures that</font>the contributions paid retain a value even when the person leaves Korea. For instance, they would be particularly important if the person should need to claim an Irish invalidity pension or survivor&rsquo;s pension within a few years of returning to Ireland. Similarly, if the person did not have enough Irish contributions for State pension entitlement on reaching pension age, the Korean contributions would be added to their Irish contributions for this purpose. </p><p>As a key objective of the Agreement is to allow the social insurance contributions paid in Ireland and Korea to be aggregated, as necessary, when considering an insured contributor&rsquo;s entitlement to the range of pensions covered, it does not provide for persons to collect the value of the social insurance contributions paid on their departure from Korea. There are no plans to review this situation at present.</p></reply>

Details of rent supplement recipients and expenditure under the scheme for the period from 2013 to date are provided in the attached tabular statement.  Rent supplement&rsquo;s outturn forecast is calculated based on its expected level of activity taking into account transfers to, and the impact of, the housing assistance payment scheme (HAP) for the period under review.  Rent supplement forecast outturn for 2018 will be determined as part of the budgetary process in consultation with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government which has responsibility for HAP and other social housing solutions.</p><p>Rent supplement customer numbers have declined during the period commencing December 2013 (c.79,800) to June, 2017 (c. 41,200).  The strategic initiative of returning rent supplement to its original purpose, that of a short-term income support, facilitated by the introduction of the HAP scheme has been the main driver in rent supplement&rsquo;s base decline.  Other contributory factors include the continuing improvement in the economy leading to fewer people seeking support due to retaining and securing long-term employment allied with more people exiting rent supplement through activation and securing job opportunities.  The strategic goal is to transfer all long-term tenancies from rent supplement to HAP by 2020. </p><p>There are currently over 24,700 active HAP tenancy arrangements of which approximately 7,550 are direct transfers from rent supplement.  Analysis of recipient numbers transferring to HAP as at December 2015 to end June 2017 is provided in the table.  In addition to the ongoing transfer of long-term rent supplement recipients to HAP, the majority of new applicants seeking State support towards their rent are being supported by the local authorities under HAP rather than rent supplement.</p><p>The rental accommodation scheme (RAS) also has continued its operations in the transfer of rent supplement customers.  At the end of May 2017, local authorities had transferred a cumulative total of 58,740 households from rent supplement to RAS and other social housing supports. </p><p>I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputies.</p><p><b>Rent Supplement:  Recipient Numbers &amp;amp; Expenditure: 2013 to Present</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Recipients</th><th>% Change</th><th>Cost &euro;000</th><th>% Change</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>79,788</td><td>-9.00%</td><td>372,909</td><td>-12%</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>71,533</td><td>-10.30%</td><td>338,208</td><td>-9.30%</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>61,247</td><td>-14.30%</td><td>311,059</td><td>-8%</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>48,041</td><td>-21.60%</td><td>275,296</td><td>-11.50%</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>41,240</td><td>1</td><td>253,000 2</td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>As at end June 2017 </p><p>Forecast outturn for 2017</p><p><b>Rent Supplement:  Recipient Numbers transferred to HAP</b><table><tr><th>YEAR</th><th>Transferred from RS to HAP</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>2,100</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>3,943</td></tr><tr><td>End June 2017</td><td>2,071</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The State pension (non-contributory) is a means tested pension and is funded by general taxation, whereas the State pension (contributory) is not means tested and is paid from the Social Insurance Fund, with contributions to that fund generally improving a person&rsquo;s entitlements under that pension. </p>  <p>  It is important to ensure that those qualifying for a State pension (contributory) have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension (contributory), all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. </p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This may have the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their State pension (contributory). The scheme was not introduced retrospectively.  </p>  <p>  My Department has estimated that the annual cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost some &euro;290m in 2017, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the rate of the overall cost of State pensions.  This is a very significant cost, and the main beneficiaries would be people who already have significant means, and who do not therefore qualify for an alternative means-tested payment.</p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a State pension (non-contributory), which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  While this payment is subject to a household means-test, there are very significant disregards which mean that over 70% of such pensioners qualify at the full rate.</p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department provide a range of activation supports to newly unemployed individuals through the Intreo network to assist them in finding employment.  The current rules are designed to ensure that a person who becomes unemployed is, in the first instance, provided with the one-to one intensive activation support of a DSP case officer to try to find employment before being considered for a placement on an employment programme.    </p>  <p>  CE is primarily aimed at long-term unemployed persons, which is generally defined as one year or more on the Live Register.  CE is an active labour market programme aimed at persons who are not considered ready for entry to employment, with the programme emphasis on progression into employment and/or further education/training.  The core eligibility criterion for CE is that the person is in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a specified amount of time, generally 12 months.  </p>  <p>  The BTEA is a second chance education opportunity scheme designed to remove barriers to participate in second and third level education by enabling those who fulfil the eligibility criteria to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course. </p>  <p>  The objective of the scheme is to raise the educational and skill levels to enable jobseekers better access to the emerging needs of the labour market in line with Government activation strategy.  The BTEA is not intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.  The Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) grant, payable by the Department of Education and Skills, represents the primary support for persons pursuing education.  In general, most BTEA customers will also have certain registration and related college fees paid by SUSI.</p>  <p>  A person wishing to pursue a course of study under the BTEA scheme will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as age, in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a specific period and pursuing a full-time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education, with reference to the National Framework of Qualifications among others. </p>  <p>  To qualify for BTEA, a person must be in receipt of one of the following social welfare payments for a minimum period - 3 months if pursuing a second level course or 9 months   prior to the date of commencement of their course.  </p>  <p>  A waiting period is considered essential for the BTEA.  This scheme confers entitlement to income support for a period of education and, therefore, it is necessary to target scarce resources.

Should a young jobseeker on a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment participate on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.  This rate will be further increased to &euro;193 per week from September 2017.

It should be noted that this estimate is subject to change over the coming months in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients for 2018.</p>  <p>  I have no plans for any further increases in rates at present and any such changes could only be considered in a budgetary context. </p></reply>

The 2017 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;2.5 billion. </p>  <p>  Both the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes provide significant support to individuals so that they can work up to 3 days a week and still retain access to a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  The current days based system can provide significant income supports to jobseekers who are casually employed.  For instance an individual can earn a little over &euro;19,760 per year and still retain a small jobseeker's allowance payment, while the equivalent threshold for an individual with a qualified adult is almost &euro;33,975 if they are both working.  </p>  <p>  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from more traditional work patterns, resulting in an increase in the number of persons employed for less than a full week.  However, it is important that the structure of jobseeker&rsquo;s payments does not inadvertently subsidise unsustainably low earnings or encourage employers to offer minimal hours of employment. </p>  <p>  In addition to the two jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes my Department&rsquo;s main in-work support is the family income supplement (FIS), which targets families with children on low incomes and who work at least 19 hrs per week.  </p>  <p>  The back to work family dividend (BTWFD) scheme allows JA or JB recipients who have been jobseekers for 12 months or recipients of the one-parent family payment to retain their full increase for qualified children (IQC) for the first year in employment, tapering to 50% in the second year. </p>  <p>  Where a long term unemployed jobseeker is offered employment of more than 3 days but less than 24 hours a week, they may be eligible for the part-time job incentive scheme.  Under this scheme they can receive a weekly payment of &euro;119 per week if they are single or &euro;193.90 if they have an adult dependent.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently analysing incentives to work in the social welfare system for jobseekers with children with a view to developing the Working Family Payment.   </p>  <p>  Based on an analysis of current incomes, benefits, and taxes, ESRI research shows that people are better off in work than on welfare.  In particular, it demonstrates that more than eight out of ten unemployed jobseekers would see their income increase by at least 40% upon taking up employment.  Fewer than 3% would, in the short-term, be financially better off not in work.     </p>  <p>  The risk of facing weak financial incentives to work is higher for unemployed persons with a spouse and children, as the income support goal of the welfare system means that they tend to have higher welfare payments.  However, even among that group, less than one in fifteen would be financially better off not working and with the introduction of the BTWFD scheme, that figure drops to one in twenty.</p>  <p>  The combination of schemes available provides considerable income support for individuals who have part time employment by allowing them retain access to a social welfare payment.    </p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, long term unemployment continues to fall.

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to around 626,362 families in respect of over 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of over &euro;2 billion in 2017. </p><p>Budget 2009 reduced the age for eligibility for Child Benefit from 19 years to less than 18 years.  A value for money review of child income supports, published by the Department of Social Protection in 2010, found that the participation pattern of children in education supports the current age limit for Child Benefit. </p><p>Families on low incomes can avail of a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including: </p><p>- Increase for a Qualified Child (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments; </p><p>- Family Income Supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children; </p><p>- The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance for low income families (paid at the full-time second level education rate). </p><p>These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked with household income and thereby support low-income families with older children participating in full-time education. </p></reply>

The report of the Commission does not make any mention or recommendations in relation to means tested social welfare entitlements.   </p>  <p>  The Department operates a range of means tested social assistance schemes where, in order to qualify for the payment, the claimant must satisfy a means test which takes into account the assets and income (including earnings) of the claimant and his or her spouse/partner.  </p>  <p>  The means test for earnings includes tapering arrangements, whereby a certain proportion of earnings are disregarded in order to provide a financial incentive to work.  For instance, for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients, the first &euro;20 of daily earnings is disregarded (subject to a maximum of 3 days per week) and 60% of the remainder is assessed as means.  Similarly, for one-parent family allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s transition recipients, the first &euro;110 of earnings is disregarded and 50% of the remainder is assessed as means.  It should be noted that the level of disregards apply equally to those who receive hourly earnings in excess of the minimum wage.  </p>  <p>  Increases in the minimum wage result in an overall financial gain for means-tested social welfare recipients who are working and on the minimum wage. In addition, means tested social welfare recipients, including recipients who are working, benefitted from the increase of &euro;5 per week in the maximum weekly rates of payment announced in Budget 2017.  These increases came into effect last March and included proportionate increases for those claiming an increase for a qualified adult.  </p>  <p>  Any changes to the earnings disregards or the income thresholds of social welfare schemes would have cost implications and would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision.  This demographic change alone is expected to increase spending on pensions by over &euro;220 million this year - not including the impact of rate increases.  </p>  <p>  The current rate bands applying to the State pension (contributory) were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000.  These rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  </p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands would result in an annual cost of over &euro;60 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 million each following year.  The main beneficiaries from such a decision would be pensioners who haven&rsquo;t made sufficient contributions into the Social Insurance Fund to qualify for a contributory pension at the maximum rate, or the 98% rate applying to those with an average of 40-47 contributions per year, and who do not qualify for means-tested pension payments because they have additional means above a certain level (e.g., in receipt of an occupational pension).</p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded in the calculation of the yearly average of the pensioner.  This will generally have the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, and may result in a higher rate of pension, depending on their circumstances.  </p>  <p>  Where people do not qualify for a maximum-rate contributory pension in their own right, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Where their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them, and is subject to a personal means-test.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), based on their household means, amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. There are very significant income disregards in this means test, which result in over 70% such pensioners being paid at the maximum rate.</p>  <p>  The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirmed that the Fund provides a better return to female rather than male beneficiaries.  This is due to the redistributive nature of the Fund, where an &ldquo;expensive&rdquo; weekly PRSI contribution paid in respect of a highly paid worker results in the same entitlements as that paid on behalf of a part-time worker on the minimum wage.  The system of benefits also results in cross subsidisation of those who have made fewer contributions into the system.  For example, a person with a yearly average of less than 40% of the maximum may receive a contributory pension that is 85% of the maximum rate, where they do not alternatively qualify for a non-contributory pension at up to 95% of the contributory rate.</p>  <p>  Over 54% of the payments made by my department to people over 66 are in respect of female beneficiaries, and so changes regarding the pensions paid by the department are likely to affect more women than men, whether they are rate increases, or savings such as these.  The main focus of my department is in ensuring that the most vulnerable women and men are protected to the greatest possible extent, while ensuring there is a sustainable system where people are encouraged to work and contribute to the Social Insurance Fund, which pays for those contributory benefits and pensions.</p>  <p>  The savings created by the new ratebands were an alternative to cutting the core rate of pensions, at a time when Exchequer savings were required, and other social protection payments were being reduced across the board.  Had a similar approach been taken with pensions, affecting everyone over State pension age &ndash; regardless of their means and their contribution record &ndash; the hardest hit would have been pensioners with no additional incomes, notably those paid a State pension (non-contributory), and widows and widowers living alone on one pension payment.  A significantly higher proportion of such pensioners are women, and this would have been expected to result in more women over 65 experiencing consistent poverty, relative to men.  </p>  <p>  The alternative approach regarding those over State pension age, taken by the Government at that time, made the State pension (contributory) for new pensioners more reflective of contribution history, while maintaining the rates of payment for non-contributory and Widows/widowers pensions, as well as for contributory pensions paid to those who had contributed into the Social Insurance Fund throughout their working lives (i.e. with a yearly average of 40 or more).  This approach safeguarded those most vulnerable pensioners, whilst also avoiding a reduction for those who had paid into the system their entire working lives.  The most recent CSO figures (from 2015) show that the rate of Consistent Poverty among women aged over 65 is 2.6%, compared to 2.9% for men in the same age group.  Both of these figures are substantially lower than the rates of consistent poverty among the working age population.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The child poverty target is to lift over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020.  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the Europe 2020 poverty target is to lift a minimum of 200,000 people out of &lsquo;combined poverty&rsquo; (i.e. at-risk-of-poverty and/or basic deprivation) by 2020. </p>  <p>  The latest national data from the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) for 2015 show improvements in the key poverty targets.  Consistent poverty, having fallen to 8.8 per cent in 2014, stabilised at 8.7 per cent in 2015.  A reduction of almost 5 percentage points is now required to meet the 2016 interim poverty target.  The number of children in consistent poverty was 139,000 in 2015, reflecting a fall of 13,000 on the child poverty figures in 2014.  A new figure of 102,000 children will have to be lifted out of consistent poverty to meet the 2020 child poverty target.  The population affected by &lsquo;combined poverty&rsquo; numbered 1.6 million people in 2015, reflecting a reduction of 162,000 people on the 2014 figures.  Thus, over 350,000 people will have to be lifted out of combined poverty by 2020 to meet the Europe 2020 target. </p>  <p>  The 2015 SILC results show that we have a long way to go to achieve the national social target for poverty reduction.  Given the continuing economic recovery throughout 2016 and measures introduced in Budgets 2016 and 2017, I expect the figures for those years, when they become available, to show further improvement.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion is set out in the updated National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing poverty.  The goals include a focus on early childhood development, youth exclusion, access to the labour market, migrant integration, social housing and affordable energy.  The Department will review the Plan this year, as it reaches the end of its current term, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  The Department will also review the national social target for poverty reduction.  This review will be undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

Although the currently applicable equivalent rate in Ireland is slightly below the rate set out in the Directive, it should be noted that the European Commission recently brought forward a proposal (COM 2017/276) which, if implemented, will gradually reduce the minimum rates by 20% each year for five years, bringing Ireland into compliance and ultimately resulting in a minimum rate of tax of zero for all bands at the end of the five years.  </p>  <p>  Other than the matters addressed by the Directive, it is a matter for the State to determine the motor tax regime and rates, having regard to revenue requirements and other policy objectives, including environmental objectives. Motor tax arrangements in the UK are a matter for the UK government.</p></reply>

Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.</p>  <p>  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department.  Planning authorities must then make their own decisions based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments.  However, the matter will be kept under review, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, and his Department - which leads on renewable energy policy - in the context of the Government's White Paper on Energy Policy, published in December 2015, the development of a Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework, as well as the finalisation of a new support scheme for renewable electricity by that Department, expected in 2018.</p></reply>

The levy will be applied by planning authorities, commencing on 1 January 2019 in respect of sites which were vacant and on the vacant site register during the year 2018 and will subsequently be applied on an annual basis thereafter, as long as a site remains on the vacant site register in the preceding year.</p>  <p>  Planning authorities are empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of vacant sites, exceeding 0.5 hectares in area - with reduced or zero rates of levy applying in specific circumstances &ndash; which, in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion, were vacant or idle in the preceding year, in areas identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development.  The 3% rate of vacant site levy is consistent with the rate applied to derelict sites under the Derelict Sites Act 1990 and is considered a reasonable initial step in incentivising the activation of such sites for residential or regeneration purposes. </p>  <p>  All levies due on an individual site will remain a charge on the land concerned until all outstanding levies due are paid. Accordingly, under the vacant site levy provisions, there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development purposes for each year that a site remains vacant or idle.</p>  <p>  Planning authorities are presently engaging in the necessary preparatory work, prior to the application of the levy with effect from January 2019 in respect of sites identified on the register in 2018.  As required under the Act, this includes the identification of specific vacant sites for entry on the register as well as the registered owners of the sites in question along with undertaking a site valuation.  Vacant site registers were established in January 2017 by planning authorities and the registers will be populated as the preparatory work progresses during the year.</p>  <p>  The proceeds of the levy raised on vacant sites will be used by planning authorities for the provision of housing and urban regeneration development in the local area in which vacant sites are located.  No more than 10% of the levy monies received by planning authorities may be used on their collection and administration costs.  </p>  <p>  At this time, ahead of the full population of registers with details of sites and valuations, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the annual levies that may be raised by planning authorities through the implementation of the levy or to estimate the annual levies that may be raised from the application of different levy rates than those provided for.</p></reply>

In this regard, Action 5.1 of Rebuilding Ireland commits to the development of a National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy, informed by Census 2016 data. </p>  <p>  To this end, the Housing Agency established a working group comprising senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself to inform the Strategy.  My Department has received the output from the work of this Group and is presently engaging with key Departments and Agencies to consider the analysis and agree on the recommended actions, prior to publication.  </p>  <p>  I would like to see as much ambition as possible in bringing as many viable vacant properties back into use at an early stage.  I intend, as part of the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland, to explore what further actions can be taken and what new ideas we can bring to bear, in close liaison with Ministerial colleagues.  If budgetary measures are needed to reinforce the ambition, this may delay the publication of the Strategy.  But this will not delay the commencement of important work at local level in gathering more accurate and up-to-date information on where vacant properties are and who owns them, so that we can facilitate the re-use of many vacant properties, particularly in our cities and towns. </p>  <p>  Ahead of finalisation of the Strategy, it is important to note that my Department has already introduced a number of significant measures under Pillar 5 of Rebuilding Ireland to incentivise the increased use of vacant housing stock to help meet the needs of those in receipt of social housing assistance.  These initiatives include the Repair and Leasing Scheme, the Buy and Renew Scheme, and the Housing Agency acquisitions fund. </p>  <p>  Following my meeting with local authority Chief Executives last Thursday (20 July), I am eager to advance a number of early key actions with local authorities to ensure that the timing of publication of the strategy will not delay actions to get housing stock back into use.</p></reply>

Responsibilities are also set by the local authorities, as landlords, for tenants of social housing which are normally set out in tenants' handbooks.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Strategy for the Rental Sector, published in December 2016, sets out a number of actions in relation to standards, with the combined aim of improving the quality and management of rental accommodation. On 1 July 2017, the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017 came into operation. The Regulations specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, fire safety, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply, with new requirements introduced focusing on tenant safety, including new measures covering heating appliances, carbon monoxide and window safety. With very limited exemptions, these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units, as well as other rented residential accommodation. </p>  <p>  All landlords, including local authorities, have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). The capacity and effectiveness of the local authorities' inspections and enforcement systems are critical to ensure that the new standards result in high quality and safe rental accommodation. </p>  <p>  Last year's report by the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC) on this area of inspection activity made a series of recommendations for improvements.  As a result of NOAC's review and my own Department's consideration of the matter, the Strategy for the Rental Sector specifically prioritises strengthening the inspection capacity of local authorities and increasing the number and frequency of inspections of rental properties.  A shared services model for inspection and enforcement of the rental accommodation standards regulations will be developed by the local government sector. Procedures for a more efficient, standardised and transparent inspection and enforcement approach across all local authority areas will be introduced. Under the Rental Strategy, this is targeted for completion by Q4 2017 and my Department is working with the local authorities, through the City and County Management Association, to develop this new and more effective inspection and enforcement system.</p>  <p>  Specific ring-fenced funding for inspection and compliance activity will be identified from 2018 onwards and annual targets for both inspection and compliance will be agreed with local authorities. The objective set out in the Strategy is to increase inspection numbers incrementally each year so that, by 2021, 25% of all rental properties are inspected annually.</p>  <p>  With regard to further legislation in this area, my Department will shortly be publishing a guidance document to assist local authorities in their implementation of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017.  While I understand that certain local authorities undertake the servicing of boilers themselves and in other cases, this is the responsibility of tenants and is specified as such in tenants' handbooks, I am satisfied that in all cases, the minimum standards for rental accommodation apply and it remains a matter for each of the local authorities to ensure they are in compliance with these minimum standards.</p></reply>

In December 2016, the CER made a decision on the second regulatory period 2017-2018 setting allowed revenue for this period, including proposals on operational and capital budgets.  A copy of the CER's decision is available on its website, www.cer.ie. </p><p>Irish Water&rsquo;s capital programme is currently funded by a mix of debt, equity and an element of  customer revenue, including operational subvention (the current operational subvention in line with the domestic water charging regime set out in the Water Services Act 2014 is equivalent to the purchase of water on behalf of domestic customers relating to a product subsidy, capped charges and child allowance). </p><p>A breakdown of funding requirements on cash-flow terms in line the Business Plan is set out in Irish Water's submission to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services .  This document forecasts that the &euro;531m capital spending in cash-flow terms in 2017 will be met by &euro;270m in Equity provided by the Minister for Finance, &euro;132m in Debt and the balance will be met from funding from customer revenue and subvention from my Department. </p><p>The future funding of Irish Water from State sources is currently under review following the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.  Irrespective of the source of funding, all Irish Water spending net of customer revenue is counted as Government spending.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  </p>  <p>  From 2001, national water pricing policy required local authorities to recover the costs of providing water services from all non-domestic users of these services.  This policy provided for charges based on actual metered consumption and is consistent with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive.   Non-domestic customers, connected to a public water supply, are liable for charges.  It should be noted that the existing tariffs for all non-domestic customers are remaining in place with no changes for the time being. </p>  <p>  The CER is progressing a review of all aspects of non-domestic water tariffs and in conjunction with Irish Water will establish an enduring non-domestic tariff framework.  The CER has recently published an information note informing customers and interested parties about the project and will shortly engage in a period of public consultation on the enduring tariff framework for non-domestic water and or wastewater customers of Irish Water. </p></reply>

Pre-application Stage</p><p>The first stage is called the pre-application stage.  This is an informal stage during which officials of my Department will engage with the potential applicant in relation to elements required to progress to application stage.  They may meet with the potential applicant at this time if it is felt necessary.  The applicant then progresses to formal application stage. </p><p>2. Formal submission of an application</p><p>Once an applicant has submitted a formal application for a lease or licence the application form and supporting documentation is reviewed for completeness by either a member of the Water and Marine Advisory Unit (WMAU) or the Chair of the MLVC (Dr. Terry McMahon, Marine Institute).  In the case of the Marine Institute application, Dr. Terry McMahon was not involved at any stage in the process and this stage was carried out by a member of the WMAU.  If an application is acceptable at this stage it progresses to the consultation phase. </p><p>3. Consultation Phase</p><p>The length of the consultation period is determined by the size, nature and scale of the proposal and whether the application is accompanied by an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  In general, non EIS cases are the subject of a 21 day public consultation period whereas the consultation period for EIS cases is two months.  As the Minister with responsibility for foreshore related matters I am also free to extend the consultation period if I consider it is necessary. </p><p>In the case of the Marine Institute application (FS006566), the Minister at that time considered it necessary to extend the public consultation period on three occasions from an initial end date of 17 June 2016 to a final end date of 9 September 2016.</p><p>Irrespective of the length of the consultation period there are two types of consultations undertaken as follows: </p><p>-  Public Consultation;</p><p>-  Prescribed Bodies Consultation.</p><p>-  The public consultation invites submissions from members of the public and any other interested individuals or organisations.  Over 500 submissions were received from the public and other interested parties during the extended public consultation period in the case of the application concerned.</p><p>-  The prescribed bodies consultation invites submission from a list of bodies as prescribed under the Foreshore Regulations 2011.  With the exception of the Heritage Council, comments were received from all of the bodies contacted under the prescribed bodies consultation.</p><p>-  It should be noted that the two consultations may occur simultaneously. </p><p>-  Following completion of the public and prescribed bodies consultations, the submissions are provided to the applicant for comment.  All submissions together with the applicant's responses to the concerns raised are published on my Department's website. </p><p>4. Marine Licence Vetting Committee (MLVC) Stage</p><p>-  The Marine Licence Vetting Committee (MLVC) is an ad hoc multi-disciplinary committee which is convened, as required, for the purposes of undertaking a technical assessment of an application under the Foreshore Act 1933, as amended.  It is not established on a statutory basis and members undertake to participate in each instance as representatives of their individual organisations. </p><p>-  In all cases, the application and supporting documentation together with all the submissions received from both the prescribed bodies and the public are considered in detail during the course of assessing the application.  Screening under Environmental Legislation including the Birds and Habitats Directives (Environmental Impact Assessment and Appropriate Assessment Screening) will be formally carried out at this stage.  Only after these steps have been completed and the application fully assessed will a recommendation be made by the MLVC and a completed report provided as part of the submission for determination.  It is also open to me as the Minister with responsibility for making the decision on this application to seek advices from whatever body I deem necessary in the determination of the application.  </p><p>-  In relation to the application in question, the report of the Marine Licence Vetting Committee (MLVC), which is a key element of the foreshore decision-making process, was completed on 6 July 2017.  I expect a decision to be made on this application shortly. </p><p>5. Lease/Licence Drafting and Execution</p><p>-  After a determination has been made the lease or licence is drafted by the Chief State Solicitor's Office.</p></reply>

The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property. </p>  <p>  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs up to a maximum of &euro;40,000 will be met upfront by the local authority or an approved housing body (AHB).  The relevant local authority determines eligibility for the scheme having regard to the location and suitability of the property for social housing and also taking into consideration the extent of the repairs that may be required.  It is a condition for acceptance into the scheme that properties have been vacant for at least 12 months.</p>  <p>  Following on from the success of the initial Repair and Leasing pilot in Waterford and Carlow local authorities, the pilot scheme was expanded on a national basis from 23 February 2017.  The operation of the pilot scheme nationally is providing valuable data to facilitate a full on-going appraisal of the scheme, assess the demand and potential nationwide and also to continue to resolve any operational issues that may arise during implementation.  Any expansion or proposed changes to the conditions of the scheme are being kept under review and considered in that context. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently gathering data from local authorities in order to report progress in what was the first full quarter of operation of the national scheme and this will be published on my Department's website in due course.</p></reply>

As Minister, I am empowered to grant approved status to housing bodies for this purpose. AHBs are independent, not-for-profit organisations, which can also include housing co-operatives, which are housing organisations controlled by their members/tenants who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. </p><p>Information in relation to specific terms and conditions and number of AHB staff is not held in my Department. The appointment of personnel to AHBs, such as housing associations, is a matter for their individual Boards.  I have no role in relation to such appointments nor does my Department collate data relating to the salaries paid to staff in AHBs.  </p><p>To date, there are 547 bodies with approved status. The register of AHBs can be found on my Department's website at:</p><p>.</p><p>In 2014, my Department established an interim Regulatory Committee for the AHB Sector under the auspices of the Housing Agency, which, supported by a Regulation Office based within the Agency, oversees implementation of the voluntary regulation code (VRC) for AHBs. At present, 245 AHBs have signed up to the VRC. </p><p>In its 2015 Annual Report and Sectoral Analysis, which is available at:</p><p>, the Regulation Office stated that the 203 AHBs, which at that time had signed up to the VRC, had a total portfolio of 26,904 dwellings and estimated that this constituted more than 90% of the total estimated housing stock in the sector.  The final figures for the 2016 Annual Report are not yet available but are likely to show an increase of around 15% in the number of registered bodies with a proportionately smaller increase in the number of dwellings, as the newer registrations mostly comprise smaller AHBs.</p><p>Some key statistics from the Regulation Office's Annual Report for 2015 include:</p><p>- Tier 3 AHBs (those AHBs with more than 300 units) account for 73% of regulated stock.</p><p>- Total social housing asset value of Tier 3 AHBs was &euro;1.9bn.</p><p>- &euro;1.7bn in capital grants have been invested by Government in Tier 3 AHBs.</p><p>- The report also provides global income and expenditure figures for Tier 3 AHBs.</p><p>- Overall, AHBs report that they employ approximately 6,500 staff. This number is significantly influenced by those AHBs whose operations are predominately care and service orientated. The Regulation Office is working with the larger service- orientated AHBs to ensure greater visibility in the split between housing and other service staffing. </p><p>Rebuilding Ireland targets the delivery of 47,000 social housing units in the period to 2021. It is estimated that AHBs have the capacity to contribute around one third of these 47,000 new social housing units using a range of delivery methods, including construction, acquisitions and leasing.</p><p>Significant progress has been made by the AHB sector over the last number of years, including the delivery of 1,169 units across both capital and leasing schemes in 2016 alone.  A strong pipeline of new social housing supply is also evident in the latest Rebuilding Ireland Social Housing Construction Status Report, which is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: </p><p>http://rebuildingireland.ie/news/social-housing-construction-projects-report-2017/ . </p><p>The Report provides details of 607 social housing schemes and 10,072 associated units at various stages of development, including 249 AHB projects, with 4,209 associated units.</p><p>More broadly, details on the number of properties constructed, purchased and leased in all local authorities areas for letting to those on social housing waiting lists are available on my Department's website at the following link: http://www.housing.gov.ie/housing/social-housing/social-and-affordble/overall-social-housing-provision.  Information relating to Q4 2016 is currently being finalised and will be published shortly.</p></reply>

A proposal to establish the Expert Group, including membership and terms of reference, is currently being prepared in my Department.</p><p>More generally, the Government recognises the housing affordability pressures faced by many households, particularly in certain parts of the country.  It is for this reason that the overarching objective of the <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>(July 2016) is to increase the supply of new homes to 25,000 per annum by 2020. In particular, the aim is to increase the supply of high quality homes at more affordable price points, as quickly as possible, in areas where demand is greatest.  A copy of Rebuilding Ireland can be accessed here: .</p><p>In addition, as set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector, the commitment to develop an affordable rental model, originally contained in Rebuilding Ireland, is now being progressed by local authorities in designated Rent Pressure Zones.  In this regard, Dublin City Council and the Housing Agency, in partnership with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, have developed detailed proposals for specific sites that they control in Dublin.  My Department is currently working through those proposals with the project sponsors. </p><p>On 27 April 2017, details of some 1,700 hectares of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership were published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map, with the potential to deliver some 42,500 homes nationally. These sites can be viewed here: .</p><p>All local authorities have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for their lands by 30 September. The final model for bringing forward these lands for housing, including an affordable rental element where appropriate, will be informed by the outcome of the consideration of the aforementioned initial pathfinder sites in Dublin. </p><p>Finally, as part of the targeted review of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, my Department is examining the broader issue of housing affordability.  Again, the outcome of the consideration of the specific proposals referred to above will be factored into that review process and my Department will also be consulting with local authorities.  In this regard, as part of the review, my Department is conducting a public consultation to facilitate members of the public and interested parties to provide their opinions and suggestions on the issue.  Details of the public consultation, which is open for submissions until 11 August 2017, can be accessed at the following link: .</p></reply>

Kerry.</p>  <p>  A report on the 2016 NTICI programme is currently being finalised by my Department and it is intended to publish the report shortly.  The report will include findings and recommendations on sustaining progress on the taking-in-charge issue, which is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.</p></reply>

However, there is currently a civil remedy available concerning branches or roots of neighbouring trees encroaching on a person&rsquo;s property.</p>  <p>  The previous Minister of State for Housing and Planning wrote to the Minister for Justice in June 2012 to explore the possibility of providing a broader civil law remedy for parties affected by high trees and hedges on adjoining properties. In this regard, advice was sought on the possibility of legislative provision being made, whereby a person substantially deprived of the enjoyment of their property, such as the deprivation of light caused by high trees on a neighbouring property, could apply to the Courts for an order, and the Courts could make an order as they see fit, e.g. to cut the trees back to an appropriate height. Safety considerations relating to overhanging trees could also potentially be addressed in any such provisions. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice responded in July 2012, suggesting that disputes of this nature between neighbours could perhaps be more appropriately dealt with through mediation - which is being increasingly used internationally as a tool for the resolution of civil disputes - rather than through the Courts.  In this regard, I understand that the Department of Justice has recently published the Mediation Bill 2017, which is currently proceeding through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

Taking these costs into account, a total of &euro;1,109,748 was recouped to the region by end-2016.</p></reply>

In this regard, Action 5.1 of Rebuilding Ireland commits to the development of a national vacant housing strategy, informed by Census 2016 data.  </p><p>To this end, the Housing Agency established a working group, comprising senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself to inform the strategy.

HAP is available to all residents of direct provision that have secured a long-term right to residence in Ireland and are assessed as eligible for social housing support by the relevant local authority.  I understand that most residents of direct provision centres that have secured leave to remain are likely to be assessed as eligible for social housing support.

This is one of the issues I will be considering in the context of the recently announced review of Rebuilding Ireland, one year on from its publication, with an emphasis on building on the progress made, strengthening the measures already in place and identifying new initiatives that add value and raise ambition. </p>  <p>  As part of the review process, my Department will focus in particular on the broad issue of housing affordability, building on the measures already being advanced, for example through initiatives to use State lands to deliver mixed-tenure housing.  In this context, my Department intends to consult with local authorities and other key stakeholders in the coming weeks, as part of the broader review process.</p>  <p>  At a strategic level, under the new 20-year National Planning Framework, there will be an emphasis on managing and utilising State lands to deliver housing and to ensure an active and healthy market for development land.  In this regard, an important policy intervention in the delivery of new housing supply under Pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland is the development of State-owned lands for mixed-tenure housing, particularly in the major urban areas, where demand is greatest.  On 27 April 2017, details of some 2,000 hectares of land in public ownership were published, with the potential to deliver up to 50,000 homes nationally.  In practical terms, the development of sites such as these will mean accelerating social housing delivery and securing more homes for sale and rent at lower and more affordable price points.</p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland also commits to the introduction of an affordable rental scheme to enhance the provision of affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  As set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector, this commitment is now to be progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones.  Lands held by local authorities in such zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, and in particular targeting middle-income households, in mixed-tenure developments.</p>  <p>  In relation to cost rental, a range of measures to improve the supply of rental accommodation that meets the needs of ordinary households are being progressed under the Strategy for the Rental Sector including:</p>  <p>  - build to rent models;</p>  <p>  - use of State-owned lands to deliver affordable rental in areas of high demand;</p>  <p>  - measures to increase the supply of dedicated student accommodation to free-up units in the general rental market;</p>  <p>  - supports to bring vacant stock into use;</p>  <p>  - consideration of tax and fiscal incentives to encourage additional supply.</p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, the Strategy for the Rental Sector noted that the Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to develop a "cost rental" option, taking account of work already completed in this area, including by NESC and others.</p>  <p>  In line with this commitment, Action 12 of the Strategy for the Rental Sector provides that my Department will lead an expert group to develop a cost rental model for the Irish rental sector, addressing issues such as funding mechanisms, the need to grow the necessary institutional capacity, particularly within the AHB and not for profit sector (whether through mergers, new entrants or strategic partnerships), the households to be targeted and the appropriate regulation mechanisms.  The expert group will assess the benefits that a larger and more developed not-for-profit segment would bring to the rental sector and the housing system, and examine the feasibility and effectiveness of different approaches to achieve the desired change.  A proposal to establish the Expert Group - including membership and terms of reference - is currently being prepared in my Department.</p>  <p>  There are currently two house purchase loan offerings available to lower income first-time buyers from local authorities.  The first is a standard annuity mortgage available from all local authorities. A first-time buyer unable to get adequate loan finance from a building society or a bank, may be eligible for a mortgage from the local authority concerned to purchase a new or second hand property or build their own home in cases where the gross income (before tax) is &euro;50,000 or less for a single income household or &euro;75,000 or less in the case of a double income household.  The loan can be up to 97% of the price of the house subject to a maximum loan of &euro;200,000.  </p>  <p>  The second option for first-time buyers unable to secure adequate loan finance from a bank or building society to purchase a new or second-hand property or build their own home is the Home Choice Loan.  Home Choice Loan provides up to 92% of the market value of a property purchased, subject to a maximum loan amount of &euro;285,000.</p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.  Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.  Locally elected members adopt the annual rate on valuation they consider necessary in order to provide the required services.</p>  <p>  Under Part 5 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, the Commissioner of Valuation is conducting a revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State.  The aim of the revaluation programme is to ensure that the valuations used for rating purposes are up-to-date and reflect current market conditions.  To date, revaluations have been completed in South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Dublin City Council, Waterford City and County Council and Limerick City and County Council.  I understand that revaluations in 10 local authorities, including Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, South Dublin and Westmeath County Councils are due to be completed this year with valuations to take effect for rates purposes for 2018.  The Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 fall within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  Section 56 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, as amended by section 8 of the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Act 2006, provides that I, as Minister, can make an order directing a rating authority to limit the overall amount of income it could raise through rates in the year following a revaluation to the total amount of rates liable to be paid to it in the previous year, adjusted for inflation.  Rate limitation orders have been made in each of the local authorities that have undergone a revaluation to date and I will be making further orders later this year in respect of the rating authorities currently undergoing revaluations.  </p>  <p>  My Department has in recent years requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting, and where possible to reduce, ARVs and they have responded positively in this regard.  The national average ARV has not changed significantly in recent years.  The national average ARV decreased slightly each year from 2010 to 2015 and has increased slightly in 2016 and 2017 (less than a 1 percentage movement in each case).  Some areas are subject to greater increases or decreases in rates due to local authority mergers and the necessity to harmonise rates across new local authority areas.</p>  <p>  The legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  Many of the provisions are outdated and not suitable for business trends in the modern era.  My Department has developed legislative proposals to modernise and consolidate the legislation governing commercial rates.  Among the measures included in the General Scheme of the Bill are provisions to allow a local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support specific national and local policy objectives.   The Government approved the drafting of a Rates Bill at its meeting on 11 April 2017.  These proposals will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny in due course.</p></reply>

It is anticipated that more than 111,000 households will have their housing need met by one of these schemes in the period to 2021. </p><p>The annual cost of the three schemes to the exchequer is made up of the continuing cost of supporting the tenancies and contracts in place at the end of the previous year, and the additional cost of the new tenancies and contracts supported over the course of the year to which the allocation relates.  The cost of the schemes in future years is therefore dependent on the number of housing units or tenancies falling to be funded within each of the schemes and the rental or lease payments involved. </p><p>The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), previously referred to as the Social Housing Leasing Initiative, was introduced in February 2009.  Since then the programme has been expanded on a number of occasions to provide for new types of supply and to involve a greater range of agencies and bodies in providing accommodation.  SHCEP supports the delivery of social housing by providing financial support to local authorities for the long term leasing of houses and apartments from private owners, developers and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).  Properties made available under the programme are used to accommodate households from local authority waiting lists.  Leased properties are allocated to tenants in accordance with the relevant local authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.  My Department recoups the cost of the agreements that are made with private property owners, including AHBs, to the local authorities.  Expenditure includes the ongoing cost of contractual arrangements and relevant cost of new contracts made within the year.</p><p>Details of the funding provided and drawn-down by Local Authorities under SHCEP in 2015 and 2016 are provided in the following table.  Exchequer funding for SHCEP in 2017 is &euro;83.947m; the allocation for SHCEP in 2018 will form part of the Estimates process.</p><p>SHCEP is targeted to secure an additional 2,250 social housing units in 2017 using a variety of different delivery mechanisms, with each unit secured under a long-term availability/ lease arrangement.  Details on the number of SCHEP agreements supported by my Department in 2015 and 2016 are published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: . </p><p>There are currently over 24,700 households being supported by the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme in 31 local authority areas.  The scheme is funded through a combination of Exchequer monies and tenant differential rents collected in respect of HAP tenancies.  The  exchequer outturn for the HAP scheme in 2015 was &euro;15.64 million, while in 2016, it was in excess of &euro;57 million.  The majority of this funding supported the on-going costs of tenancies established in 2015 that continued into 2016, and the costs of the 12,075 new households supported by the scheme in 2016.  Budget 2017 has increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;152.7 million, in order to meet the continuing costs of existing HAP households, and the costs of the additional 15,000 households, targeted under Rebuilding Ireland, to be supported by HAP in 2017.</p><p>Limerick City and County Council provides a highly effective HAP transactional shared service on behalf of all local authorities.  This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord.  Accordingly, my Department does not recoup individual local authorities in respect of HAP rental payments in their administrative areas but rather recoups all landlord cost via the HAP SSC.  A breakdown of average HAP payments to landlords in each local authority area at 31 December 2016, and a breakdown of the number of households supported by HAP, including the number of Rent Supplement transfers, in each local authority area at 31 December 2016, end Quarter 1 2017 and end Quarter 2 2017, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>All households accommodated under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS)  have transferred directly from rent supplement.  My Department is currently updating and reviewing the RAS data collection and management process.  In that context, tenancy data relating to 2016 is currently in the process of being gathered from local authorities and will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website when available.  Data relating to the annual RAS spend from 2011 to 2016 and the number of households availing of support under RAS from 2011 to 2015 can be found on my Department's website at the following link: .  The provisional data indicates that some 1,256 new households were transferred from Rent Supplement to RAS in 2016. </p><p>In total, 1,645 transfers have taken place from 01 January 2016 to 31st May 2017 leaving a remaining target of 355 households to be transferred to RAS under the Social Housing Strategy national target of  2,000 transfers for the period  2016/2017, indicating that 82% of the total transfer target has been achieved to this point in the two year period.</p><p>It is not possible to project the number of tenancies that will be supported by RAS at the end of 2017 as numbers in RAS will vary as contracts end, tenants move on to other properties, landlords join or withdraw from the scheme, new tenancies are allocated or vacancies in contracted units are filled.  &euro;134.338  million has been allocated to RAS in 2017.  The budgetary process for 2018 has not yet been finalised.</p><p><b>SHCEP Funding: 2015 and 2016</b><table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>2015*</th><th>2016</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>530,205</td><td>585,327</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>64,493</td><td>196,193</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>882,570</td><td>1,595,479</td></tr><tr><td>CORK CITY</td><td>1,107,646</td><td>1,774,180</td></tr><tr><td>CORK COUNTY</td><td>3,712,136</td><td>4,203,863</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>1,248,328</td><td>1,067,305</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN CITY</td><td>7,388,093</td><td>10,345,395</td></tr><tr><td>DUN LAOGHAIRE/RATHDOWN</td><td>1,768,110</td><td>2,094,115</td></tr><tr><td>FINGAL</td><td>3,385,519</td><td>4,666,247</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY CITY</td><td>1,607,240</td><td>2,315,093</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY COUNTY</td><td>385,394</td><td>346,807</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>668,351</td><td>935,162</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>1,550,610</td><td>1,430,712</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>737,465</td><td>740,649</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>585,566</td><td>1,190,925</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>9,093</td><td>65,473</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK </td><td>270,920</td><td>504,557</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>147,813</td><td>356,011</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH </td><td>2,646,597</td><td>3,046,688</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO </td><td>790,964</td><td>856,278</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH </td><td>1,211,043</td><td>1,138,730</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN </td><td>2,262</td><td>44,782</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY </td><td>943,158</td><td>1,358,477</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON </td><td>25,901</td><td>33,549</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO </td><td>278,926</td><td>340,996</td></tr><tr><td>SOUTH DUBLIN </td><td>5,631,522</td><td>6,245,168</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY </td><td>1,742,186</td><td>1629455</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD </td><td>691,391</td><td>1,078,131</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH </td><td>1,128,189</td><td>2,006,539</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD </td><td>689,804</td><td>1,228,254</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW </td><td>318,744</td><td>576,482</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>42,150,239</td><td>53,997,022</td></tr></table>*2015 figures include offsets against local authorities' RAS Reserve</p></reply>

For example, CSO published a comprehensive report on 20 April 2017 entitled Profile 1 - Housing in Ireland which can be accessed via the following link: <i></i>.</p><p>As per this Census 2016 data, the total housing stock in the State was 2,006,645, of which 183,312 were classified as vacant households (excluding holiday homes), representing around 9% of the overall national housing stock. Furthermore, almost 80,000 vacant dwellings were recorded in our cities and large towns. Further information on the number of vacant residential properties by small area has been made available on the CSO website from 20 July 2017 at the following link: <i>  .</i></p><p>While building new homes is a significant element of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, Pillar 5 of the Action Plan is specifically focused on Utilising Existing Housing Stock, with a key objective of ensuring that the existing vacant housing stock throughout the country and across all forms of tenure, in both the public and private sectors, is used to the optimum degree possible. In this regard, Action 5.1 of Rebuilding Ireland commits to the development of a National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy, informed by Census 2016 data. </p><p>To this end, the Housing Agency established a working group comprising senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself to inform the Strategy.  My Department has received the output from the work of this Group and is presently engaging with key Departments and Agencies to consider the analysis and agree on the recommended actions, prior to publication.  </p><p>I would like to see as much ambition as possible in bringing as many viable vacant properties back into use at an early stage.  I intend, as part of the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland, to explore what further actions can be taken and what new ideas we can bring to bear, in close liaison with Ministerial colleagues. If budgetary measures are needed to reinforce the ambition, this may delay the publication of the Strategy.  But this will not delay the commencement of important work at local level in gathering more accurate and up-to-date information on where vacant properties are and who owns them, so that we can facilitate the re-use of many vacant properties, particularly in our cities and towns. </p><p>Following my meeting with local authority Chief Executives last Thursday (20 July), I am eager to advance a number of early key actions with local authorities to ensure that the timing of publication will not delay actions to get housing stock back into use.</p><p>Ahead of finalisation of the Strategy, it is important to note that my Department has already introduced a number of significant measures under Pillar 5 of Rebuilding Ireland to incentivise the increased use of vacant housing stock to help meet the needs of those in receipt of social housing assistance.  These initiatives include the Repair and Leasing Scheme, the Buy and Renew Scheme, and the Housing Agency acquisitions fund, all of which have the potential to bring more vacant and under-utilised properties back into use to meet social housing needs.</p></reply>

The amount of funding required to operate the Programmes was also affected by the cohesion process initiated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs some years previously, which resulted in a significant reduction in the numbers of local delivery structures for a range of rural and local development programmes over the following years. </p>  <p>  From 1 January 2010, the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP) and the Community Development Programme were both superseded by the new Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).  The LCDP officially ceased at the end of 2013, having operated for four years, and was implemented on a transitional basis until end of March 2015. The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP), was rolled out across communities on 1 April 2015, following a competitive process. </p>  <p>  The SICAP Programme Framework was informed, inter alia, by learning from the LCDP and previous community development programmes led out by Government.   </p>  <p>  SICAP operated for a 9 month period in 2015 and the funding allocation for that year included an allocation of &euro;2 million under the European Structural Funds (ESF) Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020 and &euro;2 million under the Youth Employment Initiative.  The SICAP funding allocation for 2016 and 2017 includes an allocation of &euro;3 million for each year under the ESF, which is matched by exchequer funding of the same amount.  </p>  <p>  In 2017, SICAP, as managed and overseen by the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each Local Authority area, will direct some &euro;38 million to support tackling poverty, social exclusion and long-term unemployment through front-line interventions. I am satisfied that the programme is ensuring that those most marginalised are benefitting from a targeted and cost effective range of supports.  In addition, the programme is ensuring that resources are allocated in the fairest way possible, to make the maximum contribution to social inclusion, job creation and economic recovery.</p></reply>

Circular: Housing 15/2017, which issued on 4 April 2017, provides direction and guidance to local authorities in the operation of HAP in incidences where the HAP supported tenant wishes to have their housing need met in a different local authority area. </p><p>The Homeless Place Finder Service which operates in Dublin and Cork can also utilise HAP inter-authority movement, in seeking potential properties suitable for households who have been identified as homeless. For example, in the case of the Dublin  Placefinder Service, because of the flexibility of HAP, the Service can support homeless households residing in emergency accommodation but who wish to have their long-term housing needs met in another local authority area, to find suitable accommodation supported by HAP. However, the rent limits that will apply to any HAP property, in respect of any household, will be those which apply in the local authority where the property is situated.  All local authorities facilitating inter-authority movement, including those assisting homeless households to exit homeless accommodation via a Place Finder Service, must consult with the new local authority in relation to the appropriate level of support that should be provided in order to ensure equity.</p><p>The following table provides details of the inter-authority movement since April, when the option was made available:</p><p><b>Summary of Inter-LA Movement (as at 19 Jul 2017)</b><table><tr><th>Area</th><th>Number</th></tr><tr><td>Intra Dublin</td><td>239</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin to other LA's</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>All other inter-LA movement</td><td>147</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>411</td></tr></table></p><p>Of the 25 households that have been set up on HAP by Dublin local authorities in other non Dublin local authority areas,  seven were homeless households. Those seven homeless households were set up on HAP by the DRHE in other local authority areas as follows: 4 Meath, 1 Kildare, 1 Wicklow and 1 Cork. During the same 15 week period the DRHE Place Finder service supported some 500 homeless households via HAP across the four Dublin local authority areas.</p><p>HAP is an important and valuable tool in supporting all households, including homeless households, who need assistance with their long-term housing needs.</p></reply>

While there may be differences in the constitution of the MLVC, in different circumstances, these differences were detailed in former Minister Coveney's letter of 12 April 2017 to the Deputy. That letter explained that "the marine licence vetting committee (MLVC) is an ad-hoc multi-disciplinary committee which is convened, as required, for the purposes of undertaking a technical assessment of an application under the Foreshore Act 1933, as amended. It is not established on a statutory basis and members undertake to participate in each instance voluntarily, as representatives of their individual organisations."</p>  <p>  This letter also highlighted the different ways in which the MLVC may operate and stated that:</p>  <p>  "The committee operates in three different ways:</p>  <p>  1. For specific categories of application, the application and supporting documentation will be assessed by either the Chair of the MLVC or a member of the Department&rsquo;s Water and Marine Advisory Unit (WMAU). Examples include site investigations, one day events, slipways, moorings and other projects deemed to be not significant in nature.</p>  <p>  2. Larger projects require the convening of the full MLVC. However, the members may not meet in person. The Chair of the MLVC will correspond with the individual members for their views on the application including any submissions from prescribed bodies and the public.</p>  <p>  3. Finally, when it is required, due perhaps to the complexity of the application and its supporting documentation or the volume of information to be assessed, the full MLVC may convene and meet to discuss the application, for example: strategic infrastructure developments." </p>  <p>  It was also highlighted that the MLVC is normally chaired by Dr. Terry McMahon of the Marine Institute. However, since the Marine Institute was the applicant in the case referred to, Dr. McMahon was not involved in any way in the assessment process and the MLVC was chaired by Mr. Richard Cronin, Senior Advisor within the Water and Marine Advisory Unit of my Department.</p>  <p>  Since participation in the MLVC is voluntary, members are invited to participate rather than being appointed. Members are representatives of their respective organisations and it is up to those organisations to ensure that their staff have the requisite knowledge and expertise to perform their duties including participating in technical evaluations of foreshore applications.</p>  <p>The MLVC makes a recommendation within a report which is included as part of the submission for determination by the Minister with responsibility for making decisions on foreshore applications.

NSAI Agr&eacute;ment (formerly the Irish Agr&eacute;ment Board (IAB), but now operating as part of NSAI) is responsible for Agr&eacute;ment assessment and certification and issues technical certification for new and innovative products and processes in building and materials technology.</p>  <p>  Irish Standard I.S. 440 &ndash; Timber Frame Dwellings was published by the NSAI in 2009 and was revised in 2014 to I.S.440:2009+A1:2014  &lsquo;Timber frame construction, dwellings and other buildings&rsquo; to include all TF buildings and refer to the Eurocodes, and this standard applies in respect of all timber frame construction up to four storeys. Since the introduction of this standard all manufacturers of timber frame housing are assessed by NSAI to assess and certify compliance with I.S. 440 and the Building Regulations. Timber frame construction which does not fall within the scope or specification of I.S. 440 may demonstrate compliance with the Building Regulations by means of Agr&eacute;ment certification and the Assigned Certifier may rely on this third party certification as a basis for certifying compliance with Building Regulations. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that while NSAI Agr&eacute;ment is responsible for assessment and certification, primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings. In response to the many building failures that have emerged in the past decade, my Department introduced the Building Control (Amendment) Regulation 2014, which require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates. </p>  <p>  Under the 2014 Regulations, owners are required to appoint an Assigned Certifier whose role, in conjunction with the builder and the project team, is to draw up and execute an appropriate inspection plan and to certify the building&rsquo;s compliance with Building Regulations on completion.  The Assigned Certifier undertakes to inspect, and to co-ordinate the inspection activities of others, during construction, and to certify the building or works on completion. Builders undertake to cooperate with the Assigned Certifier&rsquo;s inspection plans and to jointly certify the building or works on completion. In effect, the statutory Certificate of Compliance on Completion certifies that a building is compliant with all relevant requirements of the Building Regulations. </p>  <p>In 2002, my Department commissioned an independent study on the use of timber frame housing in Irish conditions which, following public consultation, was published in December 2003. The study included recommendations which have since been implemented in relation to the development of standards and on-site quality assurance and compliance certification procedures, namely I.S. 440 and the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, which I have set out in detail above.</p></reply>

In addition, standard public consultation procedures were also followed for this application. It was advertised in the Southern Star and was available for inspection at a local Garda Station for a period of 21 days. No submissions were received from members of the public. </p>  <p>  In line with usual procedures, the application was also circulated to various bodies for their views and input.  Submissions were received from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Underwater Archaeology Unit of the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Marine Survey Office, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board, the Central Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute. </p>  <p>  The licence provides for a four year rotation of zones with a stand by zone only to be harvested if weather is adverse (99 hectares/240 acres). On average, some 175 hectares/432 acres will be subject to harvest annually, less than 1% of the area of the bay. </p>  <p>  The rotational harvesting plan ensures that only a portion of the bay is harvested each year.  To strengthen the sustainability of the harvesting plan for the licensed area within the bay, the harvesting is also subject to a strict monitoring programme, and requires approval of a baseline study prior to commencement of operations. All costs associated with the baseline study and costs associated with the monitoring programme were or will be fully borne by the licensee.  </p>  <p>  The monitoring programme includes comparisons between harvested and non-harvested areas in each zone for density and height of kelp together with quantitative measurements of flora and fauna prior to commencement of harvesting and in years 3 and 5 for 15 areas within each zone.</p>  <p>  The EIA Directive applies to a wide range of public and private projects. It is a mandatory requirement for project types listed in Annex I of the Directive, e.g., the construction of motorways and airports or the construction of installations for the disposal of hazardous waste.  For project types listed in Annex II, it is up to the consenting authority to determine if an EIS is required by carrying out EIA screening based on criteria set out in the Directive.  Examples of Annex II projects include intensive fish farming, reclamation of land from the sea, extractive mining, fossil fuel storage or metal processing.  An EIA may also be required where the thresholds set out in the Directive are not met (sub-threshold EIA) or where the project or activity is proposed to be carried out in a Natura 2000 site.  </p>  <p>  If the consenting authority determines that the EIA Directive applies to a project it requires that an applicant must prepare and submit an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), following which the consent authority would carry out EIA. In the case referred to, the proposed project is not within a Natura 2000 site, it is not of a class set out in Annex I of the Directive nor does it fall into Annex II; therefore, an EIS is not required. I should, however, point out that the Marine Licence Vetting Committee considered all material pertaining to the application and concluded that subject to compliance with specific conditions, the proposed harvesting was not likely to have a significant negative impact on the marine environment.</p></reply>

The determination of whether an applicant meets the income criteria is based on a calculation of net income. Net income means that income tax, Universal Social Charge, Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning  of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, and PRSI deducted from the relevant assessable gross income. The income of all persons aged 18 years and over included in a social housing application shall be assessed for the purposes of determining whether an applicant household meets the income requirements.</p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p><p>As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of the income eligibility limits for social housing supports is scheduled to commence later this year.</p></reply>

However, there is no proposal contained in either Action Plan for an audit of vacant commercial properties and I have no plans at present to undertake such an audit.</p>  <p>  Further to the commitment in Rebuilding Ireland, I am currently considering a draft Vacant Homes Strategy as part of the targeted review of the Action Plan, and am engaging with key Departments and Agencies to consider the analysis from the Housing Agency-led Working Group and agree on the recommended actions, prior to publication in September.  </p>  <p>  I would like to see as much ambition as possible in bringing as many viable vacant properties back into use at an early stage.  As part of the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland, I intend to explore what further actions can be taken and what new ideas we can bring to bear, in close liaison with Ministerial colleagues.  However, this will not delay the commencement of important work at local level in gathering more accurate and up-to-date information on where vacant properties are and who owns them, so that we can facilitate the re-use of many vacant properties, particularly in our cities and towns. </p>  <p>  My Department is also working with Dublin City Council, in the context of the Living City Initiative, to explore the potential for further streamlining of the approach to re-developing and re-utilising vacant properties.  Dublin City Council has examined approximately 11,000 rateable units in its functional area.  From a visual analysis in a sample number of streets, the City Council has estimated that there may be approximately 4,000 vacant units above commercial premises that could potentially be converted into residential use in its functional area.  This kind of detailed analysis will be crucial in determining the scale and scope for prioritising the targeting of vacant properties that could quickly be brought back into use.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. </p>  <p>  Security of tenure under the 2004 Act is based on rolling four-year tenancy cycles. Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period.  This is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy.  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, extended the term of Part 4 tenancies from 4 to 6 years, for tenancies that commence after 24 December 2016. </p>  <p>  For a Part 4 tenancy, section 34 of the Act provides that the landlord must state in the termination notice the reason the tenancy is being terminated. The termination will not be valid unless that reason is one of the reasons set out in section 34 of the Act, for example, that vacant possession is required for substantial refurbishment of the dwelling.</p>  <p>  Notice periods for the termination of a tenancy by the landlord vary, depending on the duration of the tenancy, but periods of up to 224 days are provided for under the Act.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 introduced strengthened protections applying to tenancy terminations in order to guard against terminations on false grounds. For instance, if a landlord is terminating the tenancy on the grounds that he intends to substantially refurbish or renovate the dwelling in a way that requires the dwelling to be vacated for that purpose, the notice of termination must contain or be accompanied by a statement;</p>  <p>  (a)  specifying the nature of the intended works. A copy of the planning permission, where required and obtained, must be attached to the notice or statement. Where planning permission is not required, the notice or statement must specify the name of the contractor employed to carry out the works and the proposed dates and duration of the intended works.</p>  <p>  (b)  that the landlord is required to offer to the tenant a tenancy of the dwelling if it becomes available for re-letting within a period of 6 months, subject to certain conditions. </p>  <p>  Section 56 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides that where there is an abuse of the termination procedure in section 34, a tenant may bring a complaint to the RTB that they have been unjustly deprived of possession of a dwelling by their landlord. On the hearing of the complaint, the RTB, if it considers it proper to do so, may make a direction that damages are paid to the tenant, that the tenant be permitted to resume possession of the dwelling, or both of the foregoing directions.</p></reply>

The 1916 Centenary Commemorative Medal was awarded as a commemorative medal, personal to an individual&rsquo;s service in the Defence Forces in the course of 2016.</p>  <p>  I met with the Veterans Organisations (Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel (ONE), Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA) and Association of Retired Commissioned Officers (ARCO)) on the 15th  December last, and whilst I reiterated to them that there are no plans to award the 1916 Centenary Commemorative Medal to Veterans, it was agreed to hold further discussions between the Department and the Veterans&rsquo; Organisations to explore alternative means of recognition.</p>  <p>  At my request officials from my Department met with representatives of the Veterans&rsquo; Organisations on Friday 17th February 2017 and Wednesday 31st May 2017.  My officials proposed that a single presentation will be made to the Veterans Organisations of a commemorative plaque or framed medal with an accompanying citation in recognition of the significant contribution of members of the three organisations to the 1916 centenary commemorative events and their service to the State.   The plaque or medal would have a bar with the term Veteran inscribed on it.  </p>  <p>  The Veterans&rsquo; Organisations agreed to the proposal to recognise the contribution of veterans in 2016 in this way.  They have all since indicated their preference for a plaque. My Department has agreed that a plaque will be given to O.N.E.&rsquo;s Headquarters and to each of its 40 Branches and to each of IUNVA&rsquo;s 21 Posts. One plaque will be presented to each Veterans&rsquo; Organisation at the Veterans&rsquo; Day on Sunday 8th October 2017. The other presentations will be made separately.</p></reply>

The Focus Groups engaged in the study were conducted towards the latter end of last year and early this year. The comments quoted therein cover a wide range of issues relating to human resources management including, amongst others, pay and conditions (particularly pay for the lowest paid members of the Defence Forces), vacancies, recruitment and retention, promotion systems, performance management, leadership, culture, morale, stress and work-life balance.  The Deputy has asked a range of questions relating to specific comments within the report. As advised by the University of Limerick, their findings and recommendations are interconnected and caution should apply to reading any one particular finding in isolation. In this context, I have addressed the questions in the round in line with the holistic approach being taken in response to the Study. </p>  <p>  The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with operational requirements. As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force targeted recruitment has been and is currently taking place so as to maintain the agreed strength levels. I am advised by the Military Authorities that the Defence Forces are planning to increase the level of recruitment in 2017 and a number of competitions are currently underway in this regard. The 2017 Cadet Competition was launched on 22 March 2017. A total of 100 Cadet inductions are planned to take place in September 2017. The Defence Forces are currently advertising for Apprentice Trainee Technicians and hope to induct new Apprentices from this competition in Sept/Oct 2017.   </p>  <p>General Service Recruitment Campaigns for both the Army and Naval Service were launched on 23 February 2017. The competitions have now progressed and general service recruitment has commenced.</p>  <p>  Public Service pay is based on collective agreements negotiated with public service trade unions and representative associations. Since the survey was carried out, PDFORRA has signed up to the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA), resulting in increases in pay/salary for all their members. In addition, recent adjustments to salary scales will significantly benefit general service recruits and privates who joined the Defence Forces since January 2013 (increases of between 8% and 24% depending on the scale point). Further benefits are provided for under the extended LRA. The extended LRA proposals are under consideration by the Representative Associations.</p>  <p>  I was briefed on the Report at the end of June and I met with the Representative Associations on the 13th July 2017. I   will discuss the issues raised in the report further with them in September.  The broad range of HR issues raised in the study are being considered by senior management.  As the Deputy will be aware there is a significant ongoing programme of HR development within the Defence Organisation. This study was intended to further inform that work. </p>  <p>  I believe that this ongoing programme of HR development, much of which was set out in the White Paper on Defence (2015), will deliver more effective, energetic and sustainable Defence Forces, with an associated beneficial impact on morale into the future. As part of this programme civil and military management will bring forward proposals in respect of retaining specialists, providing for re-entry and where appropriate, direct entry, for my consideration and I expect to be in receipt of those shortly.  The Public Service Pay Commission will further examine the issue of retention of specialist personnel in accordance with the provisions of the recent Pay Agreement.  I believe that the Climate Survey process has provided an opportunity for members of the Defence Forces, including the Representative Associations, to express their views.  This is to be welcomed.</p></reply>

Personnel are posted on the basis of operational need across the organisation both at home and abroad. As there is a significant turnover of personnel in the Defence Forces, targeted recruitment takes place on a regular basis so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels. </p>  <p>The Air Corps (Pilot Officer) Cadetship competition was launched at the end of March 2017   and it is planned to induct new Air Corps Cadets in Sept 2017 from this competition.     There are currently three Cadet Classes at various stages of their Pilot Officer &lsquo;Wings Course&rsquo;. Cadets of the Senior Cadet Class are due to be commissioned as Pilot Officers in Q4 of 2017.  </p>  <p>On 13 March 2017, a class of 11 new Apprentice Military Aircraft Technicians began their training and there are three classes ongoing. The Defence Forces are currently advertising for Apprentice Military Aircraft Technicians and hope to induct 25 new Apprentices from this competition in Sept/Oct 2017. A new NCO promotion competition, to fill the ranks of Sergeants and above, including those in the Air Corps, has also been launched. There are also General Service Recruits in training.   </p>  <p>A Working Group comprised of Civil and Military personnel was established to look at ways of addressing the issue of how to retain sufficiently experienced Pilot Officers within the Air Corps. The Working Group&rsquo;s report contained a number of recommendations ranging from increasing recruitment levels to examining the current terms and conditions of pilots. Work on the implementation of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations is currently ongoing by both Civil and Military staff of the Defence Organisation.   In addition and as part of a wider initiative, the possibility of recruiting former personnel who have left the Defence Forces is also being examined. </p>  <p>  There are a number of personnel undertaking ATC training. A gradual extension of operational hours for air traffic control services in Baldonnel has already commenced and it is anticipated that this will continue as newly qualified personnel develop their experience and posts are filled. Options to ensure the longer-term sustainability of Air Traffic Control services in Baldonnel are also being identified. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that while there is significant action underway, there is a requirement to continue to build the capacity of the Air Corps and it will take some time for a return to previous levels of capability.</p></reply>

The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009-2015 and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2018 (the Lansdowne Road Agreement) define current pay policy for Public Servants and members of the Permanent Defence Force.   </p>  <p>The Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA) included proposals to increase salaries during 2016 and 2017. These benefits come in the form of increases in gross pay in 2016 for those earning up to &euro;31,000 and in 2017 for all those earning up to &euro;65,000. PDFORRA, (the representative association for enlisted personnel), signed up to the agreement in March 2017. The finalisation of negotiations under the agreement allowed for the commencement of the process for the implementation of pay increases and arrears, which are now being applied to their members.   </p>  <p>  An increase of 2.5% from 1 January 2016, for annualised salaries up to &euro;24,000 and 1% for annualised salaries between &euro;24,001 to &euro;31,000 was included in the weekly payroll of 5 July 2017. An increase of &euro;1,000 from 1 April 2017, on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000 per annum was paid on 19 July 2017. </p>  <p>The pay of general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013 will be increased further following an agreement reached between the Department of Defence, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and PDFORRA. This revised payscale, which will be backdated to 1 July 2016, and will see the gross pay for general service recruits and privates, who joined the PDF post 1 January 2013, rise by between &euro;2,000 and &euro;6,000 per annum, depending on their point on the incremental payscale. Arrangements are being made to process these payments.   </p>  <p>  Going forward, there is also potential for further increases arising from the recent negotiations on the extension to the Lansdowne Road Agreement. The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 contains proposals for:</p>  <p>  -  a 7.25% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning less than &euro;30,000 per annum</p>  <p>  -  a 6.75% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning between &euro;30,001 and &euro;32,000 per annum, and</p>  <p>  -  a 5.75% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning over &euro;32,000 per annum. </p>  <p>  The proposals have been presented to the Defence Forces Representative Associations who participated in the negotiation process. They will now be subject to ballot by members of the Associations. Future remuneration of Defence Forces personnel will continue to be dealt with within this process.</p></reply>

Given the lapse of time and the lack of verification process at this stage it is very difficult to satisfy the requirements and therefore the award of such posthumous medals is quite rare.</p><p>There are records held in the Department but these were maintained for the specific purpose of dealing with applications for medals or pensions and not to act as a record of all activities during the Easter Rising and the War of Independence. Where a person made an application for a pension or medal in respect of their service or involvement in the Easter Rising and/or War of Independence, verified evidence of service was required before the award of a pension or medal was made. Such verification was provided by surviving members of the old IRA and other related organisations who knew of the membership and activities of the applicant. However, not every individual who was involved in Easter Week and/or the War of Independence made an application for a pension or medal and in such cases there would have been no reason to seek or hold verification of membership or activities. </p><p>I note the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to using material from Witness Statements of the Bureau of Military History. However, these statements were not officially corroborated or verified and therefore they cannot be used for medal purposes. <font color="#001401">The Bureau&rsquo;s brief was &lsquo;to assemble and co-ordinate material to form the basis for the compilation of the history of the movement for Independence from the formation of the Irish Volunteers on 25th November 1913, to the 11th July 1921&rsquo;.</font><font color="#001401"> </font></p><p>The process by which applications and petitions or appeals under the Military Service Pensions Acts were investigated and verified was wound up in 1958 and as you can appreciate there are now no surviving members of the old IRA or related organisations alive who could verify membership. Due to the length of time that has now elapsed there is no mechanism available at this stage by which service and activities, in the absence of existing Departmental records, can be investigated or verified. </p><p>Any application for a posthumous medal made to my Department will be carefully considered; however, I have no plans to put in place wider arrangements or lower the criteria in relation to the posthumous award of the Service (1917-1921) Medal.</p></reply>

As the Deputies will appreciate, the Curragh being approximately 4,870 acres in area is one of the most open and accessible areas in the country. </p>  <p>  At the most recent meeting of the Curragh Forum several actions were agreed to assist in addressing a number of the problems. Notably it was agreed that a review of the Curragh Bye-Laws and the Curragh of Kildare Act would be timely, with a view to identifying amendments that could potentially provide more effective solutions to the issues of illegal encampments, illegal dumping, illegal parking and other key issues. This review is progressing.</p>  <p>  The openness and accessibility of the Curragh Plains render many of these issues very difficult to address.  Notwithstanding this, illegal dumping and camping are amongst the priorities for my  Department.  An environmental maintenance contract for the Curragh is in place and in the first six months of this year my Department has spent approximately &euro;117,000 in this regard. The work undertaken includes clean-up operations following illegal camping and dumping, the disposal of rubbish and cutting of nettles and thistles. </p>  <p>  The response to illegal dumping is managed by the Department land staff in cooperation with the County Kildare Litter Warden, and in line with the obligations of the Litter Pollution Act 1997. As I have alluded to previously, given the size and openness of the Curragh Plains it is difficult to prevent this activity. However, it is dealt with expeditiously once it has been identified. In relation to illegal camping, Section 19C of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, as inserted by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, provides that it is an offence for a person to enter on and occupy property without the consent of the owner. Under the provisions of the Act, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the power, without warrant, to arrest a person who fails to leave when requested and seize anything they bring onto the property in question. Penalties for persons found guilty of an offence under this section of the Act include fines not exceeding &euro;3,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding one month, or both. Accordingly, my officials report all incidents of illegal encampments on the Curragh Plains to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as soon as they are made aware of them. Some 39 incidents have occurred to date this year.  </p>  <p>  Work has commenced on cutting weeds, nettles and thistles on the Curragh plains and it is expected to be completed by September.
