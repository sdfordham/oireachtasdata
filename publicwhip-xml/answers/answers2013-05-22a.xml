    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-22a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052200062#WRA00600"><p>The Government is committed to reform of the State's Workplace Relations Services.  The system that developed over the last sixty years had become unwieldy and complex; it lacked consistency, involved long delays and in some cases proved expensive for users. </p><p>  In short, the system was no longer fit for purpose and it was for this reason that I have commenced a root-and-branch reform with the objective of establishing a world-class Workplace Relations Service.  I propose to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure. This will involve two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five.  We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court. </p><p>  The WRC will replace the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and undertake the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) and the Labour Court.  The Labour Court will take on the appellate functions of the EAT.  These four bodies, including the EAT, will then be dis-established following the transfer of their functions to the WRC.  The reform programme is not about abolishing any particular body.  It's about creating a two-tier workplace relations dispute resolution system that will be fit for purpose for many generations to come.  The process which I have proposed to achieve this necessarily involves the incorporation of the five existing bodies into two. </p><p>  Significant progress has been made to date and I am happy to report that in the last year a number of priority actions have been successfully delivered within the target timescale.  While considerable progress has been achieved to date on an administrative basis, completing the proposed reform requires the enactment of detailed legislation in order to provide the statutory basis for the new structures and processes.  </p><p>  A significant amount of work has been completed on the preparation of the Workplace Relations Bill which will give statutory effect to the Reform proposals.  In July 2012, I published a policy document - <i>Legislating for a World Class Workplace Relations Service</i> - which was submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in order to give the Committee an early opportunity to shape the legislation.  I had a constructive dialogue with the Committee on the basis of this document.</p><p>  Enactment of the Bill will necessitate amendments to 22 primary Acts, 12 specified parts or sections of Acts and 71 statutory instruments.  The Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill has been approved for priority drafting by the Cabinet and was included on the 'A' list for the Government's Summer Legislative Programme 2013.   Engagement is on-going with the Attorney General's Office and I am committed to the enactment of the legislation at an early stage with a view to having the proposed new structures in place from 2014. </p><p>  I intend to progress the reform programme to the next stage with the same determination that has delivered the achievements to date.  I am working towards delivery of the new two-tier Workplace Relations structure so that from next year two statutorily independent bodies will replace the current five. </p><p>  In the meantime, I intend to continue to progress the reform and bring about further enhancements for users of the services on an administrative basis in the coming months. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-22a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052200062#WRA00800"><p>Forf&aacute;s recently produced a report for Government entitled &ldquo;Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2012&rdquo;.  This Report concluded that &ldquo;While Ireland has already regained some cost competitiveness, further progress is required if Ireland is to return to strong economic and employment growth&rdquo;. </p><p>  Total labour costs include wages, taxes on income and employer and employee social security contributions.  The Forf&aacute;s Report concluded that Ireland has &ldquo;the fourteenth highest total labour costs level in the 28 OECD countries examined&rdquo;.  While Ireland has one of the lowest levels of employers&rsquo; social welfare contributions, there is no cap or reduced rate over a specified earnings threshold.  Therefore as salaries increase, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness position can be quickly eroded.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s tax wedge has grown significantly in recent years as the previous Government imposed 80% of the tax adjustment on income taxes.  The wedge is higher for higher income earners &ndash; a financial disincentive for highly skilled internationally mobile workers.  The tax wedge is important from a competitiveness perspective.  Ireland&rsquo;s 48% personal tax rate is in the top one-third in terms of highest personal tax rates of the 33 OECD countries, however, only 2 of the 33 OECD countries have lower entry levels to the higher personal tax rate than Ireland.  The marginal rate of income tax, at 52% for employees and 55% for the self-employed, is higher than in most of our competitor countries, particularly in the UK.  It also kicks in at a much lower level of income - in fact, at &euro;32,800 for a single person, the threshold is below the average income.  Tax rates of over 50% on average incomes damage inward investment and entrepreneurship, and make too many people question whether they would be better off not working at all.   That is why I have publically argued that we must also as soon as possible begin to reduce the income tax burden, starting with hard-pressed families on average incomes who have endured so much over recent years, and put a little badly-needed extra cash in their pockets.</p><p>  The Forf&aacute;s Report recommended &ldquo;no further increases in the labour tax wedge&rdquo; and identified the need &ldquo;to flag when it will be feasible to reduce marginal labour rates below 50 per cent&rdquo;. </p><p>  I have brought this Report to the attention of cabinet colleagues.  As Jobs Minister, I must be alert to the impact this can have on our ability to create employment.  This issue is raised with me when I visit the board rooms of major potential investors.</p><p>  The CEO of IDA Ireland has also stressed that in the fierce competition for international investment, Ireland must be wary of losing its attractiveness as a location to employ highly skilled labour.  As an open economy, highly reliant on FDI, Ireland must be sensitive to the impact of personal tax rates and structures on labour costs. </p><p>  The very heavy reliance on personal tax adjustments in the 2009 Supplementary Budget, Budget 2010 and Budget 2011, in particular the introduction of the Universal Social Charge, has resulted in Ireland having higher marginal personal tax rates relative to other jurisdictions.</p><p>  To summarise, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness position in terms of personal tax rates is a combination of the actual rate and the entry level relative to other jurisdictions.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-22a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052200062#WRA01000"><p>In light of reductions in manufacturing demand for certain pharmaceutical products that have become generic or are nearing the end of their commercial life, Alkermes made the decision recently to review resources at their Athlone facility.  This review has led the company to conclude that they need to reduce the number of staff in Athlone by between 100 and 130 staff, from their present workforce of 420, to take place over a two-year period, as these older product lines are phased out.  </p><p>  The company anticipate that a reduction in staff numbers will be achieved through a combination of natural attrition, voluntary redundancy and compulsory redundancy.  Favourable redundancy terms and outplacement services will be provided to affected employees and discussed as part of the consultation process.  </p><p>  I am advised that the Athlone facility will continue to play a strategic part in Alkermes' future business, and significant investment is planned for the site over the next number of years which will allow Alkermes to focus primarily on the manufacture of newer, advanced pharmaceutical product lines.  World-class development and manufacturing activities at the plant will remain robust and it will continue producing global pharmaceutical products.  </p><p>  At present there are eighteen IDA Ireland supported companies in Westmeath employing 2,444 people, and 7 IDA supported companies in Roscommon employing 896 (end 2012).  There was a net increase of 222 jobs in IDA supported companies in Westmeath in 2012 and a net increase of 53 jobs in IDA supported companies in Roscommon last year.  Significant foreign companies which have established themselves in the Athlone area in relatively recent years include <i>The NPD Group, American Medical Systems, PPD Inc, Kinetic Concepts Inc, Teleflex Medical, GTRI </i>and<i> AXA Assistance. </i>  Many of these companies have announced ambitious plans to expand their employment levels over the next few years. </p><p>  IDA Ireland is working closely with educational institutions in the Region, in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the area.  IDA is also working with FAS/SOLAS to provide guidance in developing the skill sets needed by those already in the workforce who are interested in upskilling. </p><p>  IDA has invested in the physical infrastructure required to attract FDI to County Westmeath.  This included investing &euro;3.5m in a quality flagship Business Park in Athlone, which is now an integral part of the agency's international marketing programme.  That park has planning permission for different sized units and has all necessary infrastructure, including ducting for broadband.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2013 recognises that the indigenous micro-enterprise and small business sector is central to economic recovery, job creation and the future prosperity of the Irish economy.  In pursuit of this, Enterprise Ireland are very active in support of Indigenous Irish companies in the area.  In 2012, 1,119 people were employed on a full time basis in 59 Enterprise Ireland client companies in Co. Roscommon and 2,352 people were employed on a full time basis in 97 Enterprise Ireland client companies in Co. Westmeath.  That agency continues to operate arrange of initiatives to assist their client companies in the region. </p><p>  The County Enterprise boards in both Roscommon and Westmeath assist the development of Micro-Enterprises with a wide range of supports and have been very active in both counties with a wide range of initiatives to assist their clients.</p><p>  I am confident that the on-going efforts of the development agencies will continue to enhance job creation in the Athlone area. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-22a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052200062#WRA01200"><p>The last 18 months have seen a reduction in employment levels in some Pharmaceutical companies in Ireland due to the expiry of patent protections, combined with increased competition from other overseas sites.  IDA is aware of these factors and has been working for many years to diversify the pharmaceutical base here in Ireland.  Patents on blockbuster drugs have expired in the previous decade and, in spite of this, there has been continued growth in the sector.  </p><p>  In growing the pharmaceutical sector, IDA&rsquo;s strategy has been to win leading company investment and to diversify the breadth of operations over multiproduct sites, including associated services and development of new compounds.  Ireland has been enormously successful in attracting eight of the top ten global pharmaceutical companies and the world&rsquo;s number one biotechnology company to manufacture from Ireland.  In addition, Ireland has a large number of companies outside of the top ten who manufacture and successfully export from Ireland. </p><p>  The Irish Pharmaceutical Industry is an enormously important and highly valued sector.  While the industry has been faced with some difficult years due to patent expiration and competitiveness challenges, we are starting to see an increase in R&amp;amp;D productivity with the advent of more targeted biotech therapies and personalised medicines.  2012 saw the highest number of new drugs, 39, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 16 years, and the predictions are that industry has turned a corner.  Ireland is in position to be the location of choice for development and manufacture of a number of next generation drugs.  The sector has been performing well in Ireland, with &euro;1.1bn of fresh investment announced in 2012 from five major companies, which will result in 1,200 jobs. </p><p>  Unfortunately, while some older manufacturing facilities around Ireland have been downsized or closed because of industry consolidation driven by the loss of patent protection on key drugs in recent years, others have been acquired or expanded, in particular, in the area of biopharmaceuticals.  Notable examples include the acquisition of two Pfizer manufacturing facilities by the biotech companies Amgen and Biomarin and the &euro;44M and &euro;330M expansions of biotech facilities by Genzyme in Waterford and Eli Lilly in Kinsale, respectively.  Biopharmaceuticals represent the next wave of opportunity in the industry and IDA has successfully attracted and developed globally leading programmes from Allergan, Amgen, Centocor, Eli Lilly, Genzyme, Merck, Biomarin and Pfizer, as examples.  Ireland now has a globally leading biopharmaceutical cluster in the next generation of Pharmaceutical products.</p><p>  Government agencies are continuing to invest in research and training to help the academic system support industry.  IDA Ireland, through its overseas network, remains committed to maintaining and growing relationships with key decision makers in the pharmaceutical industry and IDA Ireland can offer assistance to companies to support new investment and enhancement of technical capability. </p><p>  The overall export performance of the sector, therefore, is multifactorial and whilst there are challenges with regard to patent expiration, IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to support continuous improvement and transformation in its existing client base while seeking to win new FDI opportunities in the pharmaceutical sector. </p></reply>

I am shocked that over a thousand workers have lost their lives.  The disaster has affected many, many more people by the loss of spouses, relatives and indeed family bread winners.  I want to extend my sympathies to all that have lost loved ones and that have been hurt by the catastrophe.</p><p>  At a meeting on May 8th of the Trade Policy Committee, that is currently chaired by officials from my Department, the EU Commission reported that it is exploring several avenues to demonstrate its deep concern and interest in helping the Bangladeshi authorities improve labour conditions as well as tackling the causes that brought about this tragic event.  This includes co-operating with the ILO on a roadmap for safer working conditions in Bangladesh as well as looking at what opportunities there might be to use EU assistance, including Aid for Trade, to address the problems that exist.</p><p>  The Commission is committed to analysing Bangladesh&rsquo;s commitment to core international conventions and to working with international monitoring bodies in this context.  Bangladesh receives preferential access for its exports to the EU under the General Scheme of Preferences.  The EU will actively monitor the country&rsquo;s commitments under this trade support scheme and will report at a later date to the Trade Policy Committee to provide an update on its activities and progress in advancing working conditions in the country.  This will also include outreach to EU companies that buy from Bangladesh, to promote and help the development of higher standards of corporate social responsibility.     </p></reply>

Gross operating surplus as a percentage of turnover is a measure of the profitability for an enterprise.</p><p>  The Central Statistics Office published in November 2012 a report &ldquo;Business in Ireland 2010&rdquo;, in which 12.9% of turnover was reported as the gross operating surplus for enterprises across all sectors in the economy, higher than the EU average of 9.2%.  The figure for gross operating surplus was reduced significantly to 7.7% when foreign owned multinationals were removed from data analysis. </p><p>  Turnover per person is a simple measurement of labour productivity, in 2010 the CSO reported that for all enterprises in Ireland turnover per person was almost &euro;261,000 however this figure also falls significantly to &euro;155,000 when foreign multinationals are excluded.</p><p>  It was estimated by the CSO from the Structural Business Surveys that over 3100 or 1.9% of the 161,200 enterprises in the selected sectors of the business economy in Ireland were foreign&ndash;owned in 2010.  Despite the small number of foreign owned enterprises, they were very significant in terms of employment, turnover and Gross Value Add.  They employed almost 257,000 or 22.3% of the 1,151,000 person in the selected sectors.

This strategy was particularly successful in 2012, with three notable FDI announcements being made in the region: </p><p>- In February 2012 Abbot in Sligo announced an &euro;85m investment which will result in the creation of 175 jobs; </p><p>- In October 2012 KeyedIn Solutions announced its plans to establish a software development centre in Letterkenny with the creation of 20 highly skilled jobs over three years; and  </p><p>- Also, in October, GSK reversed its decision to close the Stiefel plant in Sligo and announced an investment of &euro;10m in the plant. </p><p>  With regard to the indigenous sector, Enterprise Ireland is actively focused on the creation of new jobs by providing a range of supports for entrepreneurs setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies, and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions. </p><p>  The New Frontiers Programme, the Agency&rsquo;s largest entrepreneur programme, is a national programme funded and co-ordinated by Enterprise Ireland and delivered locally by 13 Institutes of Technology.  In the North West the programme is delivered in conjunction with IT Sligo and Letterkenny IT.  Phase I of the 2013 programme, which commenced on March 23, 2013 with 35 participants, will finish at the end of May.  Phase II will commence at the end of June.  During the following six month period of intensive full time engagement, programme participants will be supported with a salary stipend of &euro;15,000.  By the end of December 2013 it is anticipated that a significant number of new high export and employment potential businesses will have been established.</p></reply>

A new Micro and Small Business Division has been established in Enterprise Ireland and via a Centre of Excellence will be responsible for developing an improved environment for small and micro business and utilise Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s (EI) experience and specialised sectoral approaches to business innovation and development.  It will lead, develop and manage the enhancement of a support service, delivered through the LEOs, that generates innovative, small and micro-enterprises capable of increasing, employment, exports and value added to the Irish economy.</p><p>  On Monday last, along with my colleagues the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government Phil Hogan and the Minister for Small Business John Perry, I published the Framework Service Level Agreement (SLA) and launched the Branding/Logo for the LEOs.  The Framework SLA is an important step in the overall project since it sets out clearly budgets and project evaluation methods as well as a series of demanding metrics and targets for the delivery of services by the LEOs, including the numbers of jobs and businesses to be supported.  An Enterprise Development Plan for each LEO will be devised annually by the LA/LEO, agreed by EI and appended to the SLA to take account of local circumstances.  My Department will be furnished annually with copies of each signed SLA and the respective Enterprise Development Plans.  The plan will address agreed metrics and include targets which will be established for each LEO.  A key element of this new structure will be the consistent application of policy across all LEOs from the evaluation of applications to the spending of budgets allocated. </p><p>  There has also been a significant level of engagement at local level between County Managers and CEOs of the CEBs to discuss administrative plans for locations and accommodation.  Our priorities over the coming months will be finalising arrangements for the transfer of CEB staff and amalgamating with the Business Support Units of the Local Authorities as well as the migration of IT and financial systems to ensure a smooth transition for both staff and clients.  Protocols between Government bodies (e.g. Revenue, NEES, SOLAS, Credit Review Office, Microfinance Ireland, Companies Registration Office) to provide information and access/dedicated points of contact for referral of LEO clients are in the development process.</p><p>  Legislation to dissolve the CEBs and transfer their functions to Enterprise Ireland is being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and I anticipate it will be published shortly.</p></reply>

It is in this way that we will create the environment in which sustainable jobs will be created, living standards will be raised and Ireland will be regarded as an attractive location in which to live and work. More specifically, engaging with the Diaspora to strengthen and form new relationships is a particular Government priority underpinned by the Global Irish Economic Forum.  For example, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland's Senior Management team are focusing on the roll-out of a number of joint initiatives, including marketing and events aimed at attracting entrepreneurs and start-ups to Ireland, and ongoing engagement with Irish emigrants through the Global Irish Network.</p><p>IDA Ireland engages with the Irish Diaspora working in multinational companies in its role to attract new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Ireland and to build on the existing FDI base to support Irish management to win new business.  The ability of the investor to source the very best quality people, with appropriate levels of training and experience, is a prime consideration and a real location differentiator.  Attracting skilled Irish emigrants back to Ireland is an important component in creating this skill base.  The &#8220;Succeed in Ireland&#8221; initiative to attract greater numbers of inward investors to Ireland provides direct financial incentives to people around the world to create employment in Ireland by making payments to people responsible for bringing sustainable jobs to Ireland.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) also plays a significant role in forging linkages with Ireland's Diaspora.  Under the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, EI initiatives included the establishment of a &euro;10m International Start-up Fund and a targeted marketing campaign making greater use of existing<font color="#000080"> </font>networks in the IDA and the wider Diaspora. In 2012, twelve entrepreneurs were supported by Enterprise Ireland to establish their companies here. This campaign is continuing in 2013.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland is also involved in the establishment of , a website which features opportunities in Irish SMEs in the ICT sector and allows our Diaspora a full view of the potential opportunities for employment and advancement.  The website brands the Irish indigenous ICT sector as innovative, dynamic and a great place to build an exciting career.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland sponsors/supports conferences to showcase particular sectors with opportunities.</p><p>  The Government recognises that there has been an increase in emigration, particularly amongst young people, since the start of the recession.  However, the CSO data also indicates that significant numbers of Irish migrants have been returning to the country since 2008.  For example, 20,600 Irish people returned to Ireland in 2012.  These are people who had previously emigrated seeking work, and many of them are coming home having gained skills and expertise abroad that we can now capture here to strengthen the operation and management of companies based here.</p><p>  While there will always be people who choose to emigrate for personal or professional reasons, the Government's aim is that, by continuing the process of transforming our economy step by step through the Action Plan for Jobs, we can provide opportunities for employment in Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-22a.40.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052200063#WRB00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 53 and 54 together.</p><p>  In recent years there has been a continuing series of legal challenges to the JLC and REA systems, including the 2011 Grace Fried Chicken case that resulted in the High Court striking down all Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) and the recent Supreme Court ruling in relation to Registered Employment Agreements (REAs).  As the Deputies will be aware, on 1 August last (informed by the judgment in the Grace Fried Chicken case), a new legal framework for REAs and EROs was put in place by way of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012.</p><p>  The Act provided for a comprehensive suite of measures to strengthen their constitutional and legal framework (such as procedures to be followed by the Labour Court and enhanced Ministerial and Oireachtas oversight and discretion), to allow for enhanced flexibility of application, and to restore and underpin the protections afforded to workers.</p><p>  In the judgement delivered on 9 May last in McGowan and others v The Labour Court, Ireland and the Attorney General, the Supreme Court held that Part III of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 was invalid having regard to Article 15.2.1 of the Constitution. </p><p>That Article provides, in effect, that the exclusive power to make laws is vested in the Oireachtas. The Supreme Court took the view that Registered Employment Agreements are instruments having the status of laws made by private individuals subject only to a limited power of veto by a subordinate body<font color="#FF0000">.</font>   While the Constitution allows for the limited delegation of law making functions, the provisions of the 1946 Act went beyond what is permissible under the Constitution.  The effect of this decision is to invalidate the registration of employment agreements previously registered under Part III of the 1946 Act. In consequence the Labour Court no longer has jurisdiction to enforce, interpret or otherwise apply these agreements.  As a result, all such agreements no longer have any application beyond the subscribing parties and are not enforceable in law. </p><p>  However, as was the case in relation to EROs following the 2011 High Court judgment,  existing contractual rights of workers in sectors covered by Registered Employment Agreements are unaffected by the ruling. Contractual rights can be altered only by agreement between the parties involved.  There were 6 existing sectoral REAs registered or varied by the Labour Court in recent years: two in the Construction Sector and one each covering Electrical Contracting, Printing, Overhead Powerline Contractors and Dublin Drapery, Footwear and Allied Trades. It is estimated that between 70,000 and 80,000 workers were covered by these sectoral agreements. In addition, there were over 50 employment agreements covering individual enterprises that had been registered by the Court under the 1946 Act.</p><p>  The striking down of the REAs means that new employees in these sectors can now be hired at a rate agreeable between workers and their employers. This is subject only to the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000.  From the parties' perspective, the primary objective of REAs is to provide them with a sense of certainty around terms and conditions that will apply when the employer is tendering for and working through contracts and to have in place agreed grievance and industrial peace provisions. The agreements also have the effect of ensuring that the industry terms and conditions are recognised and maintained. In addition, the existence of these legally backed agreements is recognised under European Union law and ensures, in accordance with the Posted Workers Directive, that contractors from outside the jurisdiction, who may be using employees from lower wage economies, do not obtain an advantage over local contractors in terms of wage costs.</p><p>  This is a significant judgment that requires careful consideration having regard not only to the provisions of the 1946 as it stood when the REAs were fashioned and registered but also to the amendments to the 1946 Act contained in the 2012 Industrial Relations Act.   Insofar as REAs are concerned, the Attorney General has been asked to supply advice.  That advice is awaited as is the Order of the Supreme Court.</p></reply>

Key actions are proposed across a range of areas, including; access to new funding, management training and support, costs reduction,   technology adoption and the implementation of a <i>National Step Change</i>   initiative. </p><p>  In terms of addressing our Competitiveness issues, Ireland's cost competitiveness can be improved in two ways: through reductions in costs nationally; and/or at firm level through improvements in productivity. Encouragingly, a key finding in this Strategy has been that productivity in manufacturing has been increasing over recent years - annual average growth rates in per hour labour productivity across manufacturing sectors amounted to 5.6 per cent over the period 2007 to 2010 - enhancing the competitiveness of Ireland's manufacturing firms on international markets.</p><p>  It is, of course, the case that many of the Competitiveness issues faced by the Manufacturing Sector are similar to those facing businesses generally. In a separate initiative last year, I requested Forf&aacute;s to undertake research into a number of factors impacting on Ireland's international competitiveness, to benchmark these factors and to develop proposals to systematically reduce excessive key business costs or delays.</p><p>  That wider Forf&aacute;s research indicates that in the period between January 2000 and April 2008, Ireland suffered a 22.5% loss in competitiveness.  However, in the period from April 2008 to July 2012, Irish cost competitiveness improved by 19% as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices. Prices have now fallen back to levels last seen in 2002. The research benchmarks Ireland's performance against a number of our key trading partners, as well as the OECD and Euro area averages.  Positive trends are emerging in relation to some key cost factors, including Labour costs, where our labour cost competitiveness continues to improve; Construction and new rental costs, which have fallen significantly since the collapse of the property bubble; and the cost of most business services, which have fallen to, or below, 2006 levels. </p><p>  I have asked the enterprise agencies and others to drive the delivery of a <i>National Step Change Initiative</i>  , aimed at enabling companies to take one step up to drive enhanced productivity and competitiveness, to internationalise, to deepen engagement in innovation and to collaborate to compete. In addition, IDA will, of course, continue to attract new investments in manufacturing, including 'new' and emerging sub-sectors by tailoring their marketing proposition specifically to a firm's needs, and based on Ireland's reputation for high standards in manufacturing, our skills base and R &amp;amp; D strengths.</p><p><i>  Enterprise Ireland</i>   will work closely with companies with potential to grow through expansion of business development programmes including management development and board strengthening, technology development and a range of productivity improvement programmes: The agencies currently provide supports to manufacturing firms to assist in transformational change and LEAN initiatives on enhancing productivity, leadership and management development and in stimulating innovation.  Enterprise Ireland are initiating a Development Capital Fund Scheme which will help to support established manufacturing firms as they seek to automate and to prepare for expansion.  </p><p>  In terms of the Services sector, services account for two thirds of total employment. While the majority of service firms are not supported by the State, about 125,000 persons are employed in Agency supported firms, an increase of 4.6% on 2010, with growth particularly strong in business services, ICT and financial services. The <i>Action Plan for Jobs </i>  outlines a range of sectoral initiatives to facilitate new and established companies grow in this space with particular focus on International Financial Services, Business Process Outsourcing/Shared Services, Education Services, Retail and Wholesale, Tourism, Construction Services and ICT Services. </p></reply>

They receive free food and lodging and are normally expected to perform light household duties &ndash; normally childcare - for a limited number of hours per week, while having appropriate opportunities to learn about the language and culture of the host country.  They should receive an allowance, in the same way as a permanent member of the family may receive an allowance.  Accordingly, a genuine au pair placement falls outside the scope of the employer-employee relationship.  </p><p>  Au pair applications in respect of non-EEA nationals are processed by the Department of Justice and Equality, which issues the necessary residency permits.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has responsibility for childcare matters generally.  My Department does not issue employment permits for domestic workers; they are currently an ineligible category.  </p><p>I am aware that the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has encountered individuals described as &ldquo;au pairs&rdquo; who have been found to be domestic employees and as such are fully protected by the State&rsquo;s employment rights legislation.    In these instances NERA investigates employers who are using the term &lsquo;au pair&rsquo; to avoid their statutory obligations under employment law.  Where the employment status of an individual is in question, the provisions of the &ldquo;Code of Practice Determining the Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals&rdquo; are used in order to determine the employment status of the relationship.  </p><p>  Guidance and information for both workers and employers as to the employment of persons in domestic situations is contained in the &ldquo;Code of Practice for Protecting Persons Employed in Other People&rsquo;s Homes&rdquo; which was developed in 2007 by the Labour Relations Commission in consultation with the social partners.  </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees employed on an employer-employee basis in Ireland.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment in another person&rsquo;s home, on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under law (including the right to the National Minimum Wage) as all other employees.  </p><p>Where people have concerns that employees may be exploited or are receiving less than their statutory entitlement, the matter may be reported to NERA for investigation.  Cases for redress on matters relating to Employment Equality or Employment Rights legislation can be made on the workplace relations complaint form available from NERA or online at www.workplacerelations.ie.  Further information on employment rights is available by phone from 1890 80 80 90 or online from www.workplacerelations.ie  .  </p></reply>

In cases other than those covered by the Payment of Wages Act, the Enforcement Services Unit of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has some capacity to have a determination of the EAT enforced through the civil courts. </p><p>  In general, where an award has been made in favour of an employee, the employer has six weeks in which to comply.  If the employer fails to do so within this period, the employee, or the employee&rsquo;s trade union, may make an application to the Circuit Court for an order directing the employer to comply with the determination.  Where an employee is not in a position to do so the matter can be referred to NERA Enforcement Services Unit, which may, in certain circumstances, make an application to the Courts for an order on his/her behalf.  </p><p>  In deciding whether or not to intervene in the Minister&rsquo;s name, NERA has regard to the amount of the award, the potential for achieving a favourable outcome for the claimant and the scale of the costs likely to be incurred in doing so.  The enforcement of a Circuit Court order in these circumstances is the responsibility of the relevant County Sheriff.</p><p>  Where an employer is legally insolvent and where a determination has been made by the EAT or an appeal to the Labour Court is in favour of employees, employees are entitled to seek redress from the State through the Insolvency Payments Scheme.  </p><p>  The Companies Acts make provision that a change of name shall not affect any rights or obligations of the company, or render defective any legal proceedings by or against the company, and any legal proceedings which might have been continued or commenced against it by its former name may be continued or commenced against it by its new name. In effect, it is a continuance of the same company with the same registration number as before the name change.</p><p>  As you may be aware, I have commenced a root and branch reform of the State&rsquo;s existing Workplace Relations Services with the objective of establishing a world-class Workplace Relations Service. I propose to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure. This will involve two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five. We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.</p><p>  I believe that for a workplace relations system to have credibility it must be supported by proportionate, effective and efficient compliance and enforcement measures.  The current system of enforcement of employment rights awards is cumbersome, expensive and not fit for purpose. For this reason, I am proposing to make provision in the Workplace Relations Bill for a range of enhanced compliance measures, including the use of Compliance Notices, Fixed Charge Notices and a new mechanism for enforcing awards of the WRC Adjudicators and Labour Court Determinations. I am confident that the introduction of these these measures will provide for more proportionate, efficient and effective enforcement of employment law.</p></reply>

As at 10 May 2013 thirty six (36) live CGS facilities have been put in place resulting in &euro;3,661,100 being sanctioned through the scheme by participating lenders and it is expected that 190 new jobs will be created and 115 jobs maintained under these facilities.</p><p>  My Department, the scheme operator, Capita, and the participating lenders have committed significant time and resources to the establishment and operation of this Scheme. The Minister for Small Business and I promote the scheme at every available opportunity, locally, regionally and nationally, as appropriate.  The Scheme is demand led and the take - up of the Scheme is being closely monitored.  My Department and Capita are currently actively engaged with the participating banks and the Irish Bankers Federation with regard to examining issues which may be affecting take &ndash; up of the Scheme.</p><p>  The Loan Guarantee Scheme is one of a number of significant new initiatives introduced by this Government to help businesses access the credit they need.  Each SME faces a unique combination of local economic conditions and complex relationships with customers, suppliers, and creditors. Hence I have not advocated a one-size-fits-all solution.  This is just one initiative in a programme of strategic interventions which includes the Microfinance fund, the Development Capital Scheme and the Innovation Fund Ireland.  These interventions are designed to improve access to SME finance, to aid economic recovery, and clearly shows this Governments&rsquo; determination to get our economy back on the right path.</p><p>  Quarterly progress reports are published on my Department&rsquo;s website www.enterprise.gov.ie. The latest progress report detailing the analysis and performance of the CGS for the quarterly period ending end 31 March 2013 is now available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

The IDA client base in Ireland now employs 152,785 people, a level last recorded before the global financial crisis began in 2008.  Meanwhile, clients of Enterprise Ireland (EI) created 12,861 gross new jobs (3,338 net new jobs - the highest net gain for Irish companies since 2006).</p><p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s concentration on attracting employment intensive services to Ireland is leading to the speedy creation of jobs.  A significant proportion of investments in 2012 occurred in the area of services operations, particularly serving the Europe, Middle East and Asia Market.  A notable feature of 2012 was the wide range of green field investments coming to Ireland.  In total, there were 145 individual investments, of which 66 (over 40%) were from companies coming to Ireland for the first time.IDA Ireland has also completed the third year of its five-year &ldquo;Horizon 2020&rdquo; strategy and the latest results put the organisation ahead of target in meeting its goal of creating 62,000 direct jobs by 2014 from 640 new investments.  Over the course of the first three years (2010-2012) IDA has secured 419 investments and has delivered gross job gains of over 36,000.  IDA will continue to work towards achieving its target of creating a further 12,000 jobs this year as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013.</p><p>The increase in terms of net job creation for Enterprise Ireland clients was primarily due to the strong export performance of Enterprise Ireland client companies which exceeded &euro;16bn for the first time.  In addition, more than 7,000 new job commitments were made by Enterprise Ireland clients in 2012, exceeding the target of 6,250 for the year.  Enterprise Ireland is working with its clients to build on this success in 2013.</p><p>The Government is also building on this progress through the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 which includes 333 actions for delivery across all Government Departments and 46 Agencies and Offices.  The Plan also includes seven landmark projects, or Disruptive Reforms, that the Government has identified as having potential to impact significantly on job creation.  As with 2012, employment retention and creation will continue to be our primary objective in 2013.  I am confident that we now have a structure in place that can deliver the type of actions needed to continue supporting the transition underway in our economy.</p><p>The number of jobs created and total employment in companies supported by  Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) for each year since 2010 is set out in Tables 1 to 3 accompanying this reply.</p><p><b>Table 1 showing total employment and new jobs created in IDA Ireland Client Companies in each of the years from 2010 to 2012</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Employment Data</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>Total Employment </td><td>140,281</td><td>146,215</td><td>152,785</td></tr><tr><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>12,178</td><td>13,381</td><td>12,722</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2 showing the total employment and new jobs created in Enterprise Ireland Client Companies in each of the years from 2010 to 2012</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Employment Data</th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012</div></th></tr><tr><td>Total Employment </td><td><div>159,808</div></td><td><div>166,359</div></td><td><div>169,451</div></td></tr><tr><td>New Jobs Created </td><td><div>10,987</div></td><td><div>14,023</div></td><td><div>12,861</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 3 showing the total employment and new jobs created in CEB-Supported Companies in each of the years from 2010 to 2012 </b></p><p><table><tr><th>Employment Data</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>Total Employment</td><td>32,994</td><td>32,614</td><td>33,430</td></tr><tr><td>New Jobs Created</td><td>4,510</td><td>5,331</td><td>4,858</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Directors set the interest rate to be charged on loans under the Scheme at 8.8% taking into account a number of factors including: prevailing market interest rates, the economic environment, specific risk factors and administrative overheads.  The Deputy will know that lending to microenterprises is high risk due to the high failure rates with business start-ups, little or no track record, and no security available. Therefore, pricing of loans strikes a balance between the support of new start-ups and the erosion of the taxpayers&rsquo; investment in the Scheme.</p><p>  The Credit Guarantee Scheme is administered through participating lenders (AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank).  The interest rate charged and any other fees and charges applied to any facilities are a commercial matter for the participating lenders. Their decisions are based on their own assessments of the risks.  A Premium Rate of 2% is payable by the borrower to the State in return for the 75% guarantee.  A rate of this nature had to be set to ensure the Scheme complied with EU State Aid rules and it was set at the lower end of the potential pricing spectrum.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-22a.70.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052200064#WRC00900"><p>Prompt payment for goods and services rendered is critical to the effective working of any economy and is an issue to which this Government is committed.  The reduction in the number of late payments in commercial transactions is of vital importance to business, particularly SMEs and is one of the ten principles cited in the Small Business Act for Europe as a means to help SMEs to deal with the difficult market conditions currently being experienced.  It is a principle to which this Government is also fully committed.</p><p>  The Late Payment Directive which established EU law in the area of prompt payments was originally introduced in 2000 and was recast in 2011 to modernise the law in this area.  The Recast Directive (2011/7/EU) came into effect across the EU on 16 March 2013.  The issue of prompt payment is now covered in Irish law by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 580 of 2012).  My Department continuously promotes improved payment practices and monitors the operation of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997 and the Late Payment in Commercial Transactions Regulations, 2012.</p><p>  Under these Regulations, it is an implied term of every commercial transaction that where a purchaser does not pay for goods or services by the relevant payment date, the supplier shall be entitled to interest (late payment interest) on the amount outstanding.  This legislation acts as a deterrent to late payment and as a driver for payment on time by establishing a clear expectation in law that payment will be made according to agreed terms.</p><p>  In addition to legislating for prompt payments, since 2009, Central Government Departments have been improving their respective payment times and are now obliged to pay their suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice. This 15 day prompt payment rule was introduced by the Government on an administrative basis and Departments are required to report Quarterly to my Department on their performance in meeting this target.  The last full year report shows that in 2012, 93% of payments made by Government Departments, valued at &euro;3.32bn, were paid to suppliers within 15 days.</p><p>  On 2 March 2011, the 15 day prompt payment rule was extended beyond central Government Departments and rolled out to the Health Service Executive, the Local Authorities, State Agencies, and all other Public Sector Bodies, (excluding Commercial Semi-State bodies), in respect of valid invoices received, on or after, 1 July 2011.  As part of this new extended arrangement, parent Departments are required to publish on their respective websites Quarterly composite reports covering those bodies under their aegis. The individual bodies covered by this arrangement are also required to publish their own Quarterly reports on their respective websites.  These new reporting arrangements will ensure that Ministers will be able to monitor the performance of the bodies under their aegis and will enable them to address any issues with those bodies who are not meeting obligations in respect of prompt payments.</p><p>  This Government continues to pursue work in this area which is critically important to the cash requirements of business.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2013 is a key element in the Government's policy approach to rebuilding the economy and getting people back to work.  It builds on recent achievements by driving the 15 day payment period across the public sector and enhances the ability for business to attach officially new payment requirements to relevant invoices.  It will also deliver on enhanced working relationships with representative bodies to ensure that business is fully aware of developments in this area.</p><p>  The Government has decided not to stop there and the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 contains commitments in respect of a Code of Conduct on Prompt Payments to improve cash flow for business and to take steps to enhance awareness of the need for prompt payments by all elements of business.  These commitments are for delivery in the latter part of 2013.</p></reply>

There is a growing demand for ICT skills, with employment in the Irish ICT sector increasing by around 7% in 2012.  While new job creation is a contributor to demand for IT professionals, many vacancies continue to arise as a result of turnover and replacement, rather than expansion of demand. </p><p>  Vacancies in the sector that are considered difficult to fill are estimated at about 1,800 positions. These positions are mainly for ICT professionals with several years' experience. They include computing professionals, ICT networking specialists, ICT security professionals, telecommunications engineers, ICT project managers, ICT skills combined with Sales &amp;amp; Marketing skills and ICT Technical skills combined with foreign language proficiency. There is strong global demand for such skills.  Such positions, which may be filled from domestic supply and inward migration, are taking longer to fill than they should.</p><p>  Last year my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills and I launched the Joint Government - Industry ICT Action Plan: <i>Meeting the High Level ICT Skills Needs of Enterprise in Ireland</i> .  This is a collaborative system-wide response across Government, state agencies, education and enterprise sectors aimed at building a pipeline of talented ICT graduates to sustain expansion and development of the sector and to support innovation and growth across all other sectors of the economy.</p><p>  As part of the ICT Action Plan almost 1,500 places have been provided under two rounds of the ICT graduate Skills Conversion Programme since 2012. These programmes, which are designed and delivered in partnership with industry, are targeted at graduate jobseekers who wish to acquire honours degree level programming skills for employment opportunities in ICT.  </p><p>  More than 400 people have already graduated from the programmes and a further 300 are due to graduate before the end of 2013. In addition, almost 900 people graduated from ICT upskilling programmes in 2012 under the Springboard initiative and a further 600 are expected to graduate during 2013.  The ICT Action Plan has helped raise awareness of employment opportunities in ICT generally and there have been further increases in demand for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) courses at full time undergraduate level. </p><p>  Technology courses accounted for 20% of all honours degree level first preference applications through the CAO this year.  The increase in demand from students for technology courses, including a 50% increase in first preference applications for computing over the past 5 years, is a very positive step in building the future supply of ICT graduates.</p><p>  While increasing the supply of high-level skills from domestic sources is vital, there continues to be a need to supplement Ireland's skills stock through Employment Permits.  The number of permits issued to persons in the ICT sector continues to grow, accounting for 46% of all new permits issued in 2012. In terms of occupations, professionals accounted for almost 60% of all new permits and of these the majority were for IT roles. </p><p>  The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs includes significant refinements to the employment permits system including new policies and changes. These are designed to attract the skills we require to complement initiatives in the education and training sectors so that Ireland can build its supply of high-level ICT skills and enhance its reputation as a location with a secure supply of skills and talent.  The demand for ICT skills is expected to remain strong based on recent announcements by both foreign-owned multinationals and indigenous companies in the ICT sector and across other sectors of the economy.</p></reply>

Accordingly, CEBs make their own individual decisions on the level of broadband speed necessary to deliver their services to their clients, taking account of the availability and cost of broadband services in the locality, and the business needs of their clients.  As with other service contracts, the provision of broadband services are subject to public procurement procedures aimed at maximising value for money.</p></reply>

A key element of this new structure will be the consistent application of policy across all Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) from the evaluation of applications to the spending of budgets allocated. The LEOs will be underpinned by a robust Service Level Agreement (SLA) agreed between Enterprise Ireland (EI) and each Local Authority (LA) which sets out protocols relating to budgets and project evaluation and approval. I published the SLA on Monday last and it is available on my Department's website at .</p><p>  Upon the dissolution of the CEBs, exchequer funding will continue to be secured by my Department. The allocation will be delivered by the LEOs within the Local Authority, on my behalf, overseen by Enterprise Ireland. Budgets will be allocated on an annual basis under the existing Measure 1, Measure 2 and administration (pay and non-pay) headings, and the funding will be monitored using the agreed SLA in each Local Authority. The on-going drawdown of budgets by LEOs will be contingent on reaching agreed targets.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland, through its Centre of Excellence, will have a key role in enhancing the LEO's services and supports, and its functions   include the development of standardised financial and non-financial support instruments. The highest level of corporate governance will be applied and in order to ensure that LEOs are delivering best practice supports for entrepreneurship, research into international programmes will be carried out in conjunction with the evaluation of programmes run by LEOs.</p><p>  A series of metrics have been developed in conjunction with the County Enterprise Board Network (CEBN) and the City and County Managers Association (CCMA) and form part of the Framework SLA which I published on Monday last. These metrics will be tailored to suit the particular needs of each LEO, and will be included in a separate local Enterprise Development Plan. This local plan will addresses the development needs of the small and micro-enterprises in each local area.</p><p>  Over time, the funding allocation and the allocation methodology will be reviewed by my Department and EI to ensure that opportunities for business development and job creation are maximised and that value for money is being secured across the LEOs. Such reviews will be primarily informed by the achievement of targets and performance metrics that meet local needs. It is envisaged that a competitive element to budgetary allocation will be developed and introduced over time. </p><p>  I am confident that this reform will bring about a new level of engagement and interaction at both national and local level in relation to enterprise support and economic recovery and growth, and will result in an enhanced, more consistent and coherent set of enterprise supports with positive effects in terms of start-up numbers and increased employment.</p></reply>

The ultimate aim of the reform of the existing micro and small enterprise support structures is to create an enhanced and integrated national micro-enterprise support model designed to deliver tailored supports to the highest standards, benchmarked by Enterprise Ireland and delivered in partnership with the Local Authorities.  With enabling legislation, Enterprise Ireland (EI) will be given responsibility to deliver a high quality local enterprise support system through Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in Local Authorities areas.</p><p>  All projects being considered for financial support will be evaluated by a locally appointed Evaluation and Approvals Committee, and all projects under &euro;40,000 may be approved by this Committee in line with overall Government policy for supporting enterprise development.  All projects over &euro;40,000 will be evaluated and, if endorsed by the local Evaluations and Approvals Committee, will be referred to the Enterprise Ireland Jobs Expansion Fund Committee for final approval. Projects seeking approval in excess of a cumulative &euro;80,000 over a 3 year period will also be approved by Enterprise Ireland in the same manner.</p><p>  Only a very small number of projects per annum exceed the &euro;40,000 threshold.  These are likely to be the kind of projects which are considered to have high growth and export potential and fall into the progression pathway for companies seeking further support measures from Enterprise Ireland. </p><p>  I believe that the &euro;40,000 threshold for local approval is seen as an appropriate tiering of the State&rsquo;s financial support instruments, and simultaneously ensures that clear progression pathways for support are established for businesses, as outlined in the Government decision to establish the LEO Network.  Finally, in line with the terms of the Framework SLA, the approvals threshold will be reviewed in July 2014.</p></reply>

There are 38 IDA client companies in the Region employing 5,199 people in full and part time employment. </p><p>  IDA Ireland has indicated that, in seeking to win FDI, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  In order to achieve balanced regional economic development, the Agency prioritises the marketing of urban locations as the areas of critical mass.  In the case of the North West region IDA prioritises the promotion of Letterkenny and Sligo and also promotes other locations in the region as part of its marketing efforts and in response to specific client requirements.</p><p>  In line with the transformation agenda outlined in Horizon 2020, IDA works with corporate and local management in existing client companies helping them to engage in transformation programmes to improve competitiveness and efficiencies, enhance their use of technology, up-skill employees, engage in RD&amp;amp;I and develop their business processes so as to ensure the maintenance of the existing jobs provided by these companies in Ireland. </p><p>  This strategy was particularly successful in 2012, with three notable FDI announcements being made in the region: </p><p>In February 2012 Abbot in Sligo announced an &euro;85m investment which will result in the creation of 175 jobs. </p><p>In October 2012 KeyedIn Solutions announced its plans to establish a software development centre in Letterkenny with the creation of 20 highly skilledjobs over three years.</p><p>Also, in October, GSK reversed its decision to close the Stiefel plant in Sligo and announced an investment of &euro;10m in the plant. </p><p>  Notwithstanding this success, I am mindful that, in order to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for FDI projects, it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014.  This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development.</p><p>  In the interim, IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to win FDI projects for the region.  While the global outlook for FDI continues to be challenging, the Agency has assured me that it will continue to work towards achieving its target of creating a further 13,000 gross jobs this year as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013.</p></reply>

An Enterprise Development Plan for each LEO will be devised annually by the LA/LEO, agreed by EI and appended to the SLA to take account of local circumstances in that the plan will address agreed metrics and include targets for each LEO.

However, over time there will be savings in a number of areas such as for example the removal of costs associated with the individual company status of each CEB, the closure of some CEB offices, and the introduction of more streamlined and centralised reporting processes and payroll mechanisms.  It is anticipated that any costs associated with the transition will be minimal.  Over time, the funding allocation and the allocation methodology will be reviewed by my Department and EI to ensure that opportunities for business development are maximised and that value for money is being secured across the LEOs.</p></reply>

The cost of credit is just one of a number of very important cost factors for business and this Government takes this issue very seriously.  SMEs are the engine room for jobs and growth in Ireland and the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 contains a specific section designed to deliver access to finance for this key group.  This section and its actions are being driven by the SME State Bodies Group, chaired by the Department of Finance and on which my Department sits.  The Group also supports the work of the Cabinet Committee on Mortgage Arrears and Credit Availability, which is chaired by the Taoiseach and which closely monitors developments in respect of finance for business. </p><p>  In the context of addressing the needs of the key SME sector the Deputy will be aware, that I established 2 targeted initiatives to support an additional flow of credit into the economy by filling gaps where specific market failures in the supply of credit to SMEs exists, namely: the Microenterprise Loan Fund and the Credit Guarantee Scheme. </p><p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme opened for business on 1 October 2012, to provide support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000.  It was established to improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and microenterprises and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses from all industry sectors which have been refused access to credit by banks.  To be eligible for a loan, persons must possess a business plan, must have a commercially viable proposal, must confirm that they have been refused credit from a bank, and must have the capacity to repay the loan.  The potential viability of the business proposal will be the dominant factor in all credit decisions.</p><p>  The Scheme is demand led and was designed to initially facilitate &euro;40 million in additional lending over the first five years and would allow MFI to make loans to over 500 microenterprises, creating over 700 jobs.</p><p>  A full progress report on the operation of the scheme from 1 October 2012 to 31 March 2013 can be found on my Department's website () and the Microfinance Ireland (MFI) website (  ).  It is intended that the next progress report to end June 2013 will be published in July 2013, but I can advise the Deputy that since then, up to 6 May 2013 MFI had received 173 applications, of which 60 loans were approved (valued at &euro;1,005,092 and supporting approximately 150 jobs), 82 applications declined, 17 withdrawn or appealed and 14 applications still work in progress. I am keeping all aspects of this Scheme under on-going assessment. </p><p>The second initiative is the Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS), which began operating on 24 October 2012. As at 10 May 2013 thirty six (36) live CGS facilities have been put in place resulting in &euro;3,661,100 being sanctioned through the scheme by participating lenders and it is expected that 190 new jobs will be created and 115 jobs maintained under these facilities. Quarterly progress reports are published on my Department's website ().  The latest progress report detailing the analysis and performance of the CGS for the quarterly period ending end 31 March 2013 is now available on my Department's website.</p><p>  The Credit Guarantee Scheme provides a 75% State guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to firms with growth and job creation potential.  Target groups are commercially viable SMEs, i.e. well performing companies that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services, thereby demonstrating their ability to repay the loan, but that do not secure credit facilities due to the following two market failures:</p><p>1. Insufficient collateral for the additional facilities, or,</p><p>2. Growth/expansionary SMEs which due to their sectors, markets or business model are perceived as a higher risk under current credit risk evaluation practices.</p><p>  To be eligible for the guarantee, the business must have applied for credit, and must have been refused for either of these two reasons.  Ulster Bank, AIB and Bank of Ireland are participating in the Scheme.</p><p>  The Scheme is designed to facilitate up to &euro;150 million of additional lending to eligible SMEs per annum.  The Scheme is demand led and the uptake may be lower than &euro;150 million in any given year, depending on company needs.  Take- up of the Scheme is being closely monitored by Capita, the Operator of the Scheme, and my Department.  I committed to review the Scheme after 12 months of operation.</p></reply>

It looks at the relative importance of different areas of cost for different sectors.</p><p>  The report indicates that business costs have reduced significantly in recent years with overall price levels in the economy falling back to levels last experienced in 2002.  The improvement in business cost competitiveness has been driven by significant reductions in property related costs (in terms of purchase and rent levels) and falling prices across a range of professional and business services.  There have also been relative improvements in labour costs in Ireland which fell on average by 0.9% per annum in the period 2008-2011, while labour costs increased in the euro area by 4.6% per annum on average in the same period.</p><p>  However, while these improvements are very welcome and indicate that the economy is moving in the right direction, we must continue to focus on actions to promote further cost reductions across the economy.  The Forf&aacute;s report advises that over half of recent cost competitiveness gains are attributable to favourable exchange rate movements.  The report also indicates that upward price pressure is beginning to emerge in some areas, while rigidities continue to persist within the economy.</p><p>  Despite the reductions achieved to date, labour costs, remain relatively high (over 6% above euro area averages).  Energy costs remain a cause for concern, particularly for the SME sector, while legal service prices are 11% above 2006 levels despite the recession.  The report also shows that Irish consumer prices are 12% above the euro area average.  This is a significant indirect cost for business as it puts upward pressure on wage expectations.</p><p>  The Forfas report makes a number of recommendations aimed at further improving our cost competitiveness position in relation to labour, property, transport, utility and professional services costs.  Part of the objective of the Action Plan for Jobs has been the development of proposals each year that can improve our competitiveness.  The 2013 Action Plan includes a number of specific actions in this regard which address some of the areas highlighted in the Forfas report.  The implementation of these actions, combined with the Government&rsquo;s broader agenda to enhance productivity, will play a key role in improving our competitiveness and realising our ambition of making Ireland the best small country in the world to do business.</p></reply>

According to the QNHS figure for Q1 2011, the number of people employed aged 15 to 24 years classified by broad ILO economic status was some 171,800 persons.  According to the most recent QNHS data available (Q4 2012), the number of people in employment within this cohort was approximately 154,400.  As a result of both natural decrease and net outward migration, the population of persons in younger age groups has fallen and this should be borne in mind when considering the data.</p><p>  The aim of the Government's <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>  is to create a supportive environment for enterprise to create and sustain jobs.  All of the measures in the Action Plan are designed to promote employment opportunities in different ways and many young people will benefit from the implementation of these measures.</p><p><i>  Pathways to Work</i>, the Government's labour market activation strategy, continues to provide opportunities for young people through further education and employment services.  In particular, <i>JobBridge</i>, the national internship programme, is providing valuable work experience for many young people.  A recent independent evaluation conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that 61% of interns progress to paid employment after completing their internships.  The Indecon evaluation clearly demonstrates that <i>JobBridge</i>  is delivering for thousands of jobseekers by providing them with valuable opportunities to gain relevant work experience, knowledge and skills in a workplace environment.  An increase in the number of places on the scheme, from 6,000 to 8,500, was announced in Budget 2013.</p><p>  The majority of participants on <i>JobBridge</i>  to date have been among 20 to 34 year olds.  20 to 24 year olds accounted for 27% of interns, while 25 to 34 year olds accounted for 45%.</p><p>  Further measures outlined in Ireland's National Reform Programme update for 2013, submitted by the Government to the European Commission in April 2013, include the following:</p><p>- The further implementation of the ICT Action Plan, including the provision of 760 additional places on the ICT graduate conversion programme. These programmes, which are designed and delivered in partnership with industry, are targeted at graduate jobseekers who wish to acquire honours degree level programming skills for employment opportunities in ICT.</p><p>- The Labour Market Education &amp;amp; Training Fund, known as <i>Momentum</i>, will provide a range of quality, relevant education and training interventions for up to 6,500 individuals who are long term unemployed, including young people.  Four targeted sectoral themes have been set out for the provision of this funding, one of which is aimed at the specific needs of people under 25 who are unemployed, assisting them to access the labour market.</p><p>- A review of Irish apprenticeship training has been launched to identify reforms that will re-focus apprenticeship training as an alternative progression route to third-level education for school leavers.  The review will identify reforms to ensure that newly qualified apprentices are well placed to secure paid employment after their training ends, with the system becoming more closely aligned with labour market needs.</p><p>  The Government's primary strategy to support job creation of benefit to young people is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.  Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth, most notably for young people.  In the light of the recent adoption by the EU Council of Ministers of a Recommendation on an EU-wide Youth Guarantee, the Government will seek to improve its services to unemployed young people with a particular focus on optimising the benefits of the Youth Guarantee for Ireland.</p></reply>

It provides a 75% State guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to firms with growth and job creation potential. </p><p>  Target groups are commercially viable SMEs, i.e. well performing companies that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services, thereby demonstrating their ability to repay the loan, but that cannot secure credit facilities due to the following two market failures:</p><p>  1) Insufficient collateral for the additional facilities, or,</p><p>  2) Growth / expansionary SMEs which due to their sectors, markets or business model are perceived as a higher risk under current credit risk evaluation practices.</p><p>  To be eligible for the guarantee, the business must have applied for credit, and must have been refused for either of these two reasons.  Ulster Bank, AIB and Bank of Ireland are participating in the Scheme.</p><p>The second initiative is the Microenterprise Loan Fund which was established by Government, and began operating on 1 October 2012, to improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses from all industry sectors which have been refused access to credit by banks. </p><p>  The Fund will provide support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, with commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.  To be eligible for a loan, persons must possess a business plan, must have a commercially viable proposal, must confirm that they have been refused credit from a bank, and must have the capacity to repay the loan.  The potential viability of the business proposal will be the dominant factor in all credit decisions.</p><p>  The Government has also set the pillar bank lending targets so that they rise incrementally with expected demand, with targets of &euro;4bn in 2013, increased from &euro;3.5bn in 2012. Both banks met the targets for 2012. To ensure information on the demand side is accurate and up to date, the Department of Finance continues to conduct bi-annual surveys of SMEs to assess credit demand and loan approval rates. </p><p>  Quarterly progress reports on the CGS are published on my Department's website (www.enterprise.gov.ie). The new progress report detailing the analysis and performance of the CGS for the quarterly period ending end 31 March 2013 is now available on my Department's website.  Also, a full progress report on the operation of Microfinance Ireland from 1 October 2012 to 31 March 2013 can be found on my Department's website () and the Microfinance Ireland website (  ).</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland's (EI) objective is to grow jobs in Irish companies by increasing their trade in overseas markets, which in turn will support existing jobs and job creation here.  EI works in partnership with Irish enterprises, providing a cohesive set of supports to help them win export sales on global markets.  </p><p>  EI client companies achieved a record &euro;16.2 billion exports in 2012, up from &euro;15.2 billion in 2011. The greatest export gains came from sectors such as Engineering, Software, Internationally-Traded Services and Medical Devices, while the outstanding geographical performance was to the USA, Asia Pacific and Latin America.  Exports accounted for 54% of EI clients' total sales in 2012, which are now in excess of &euro;30 billion.  </p><p>  Across the wider economy, exports of goods and services from Ireland are now well above pre-crisis levels. The total value of exports from Ireland increased by 5% in 2011 and reached &euro;173 billion.  A further 5.5% increase in 2012 saw a new record for Irish exports of &euro;182 billion. We still have one of the most flexible economies in the world and continue to have one of the world&rsquo;s most highly skilled, highly educated and productive workforces.  </p><p>  The positive impact of increased exports on employment in the Irish economy is beginning to be seen in the job creation figures of EI and IDA.  In 2012, EI client companies created a net new 3,338 jobs.  This was the Agency&rsquo;s strongest performance in 6 years.  IDA client companies created 6,570 net new jobs representing the best performance in a decade for the Agency.</p><p>  At the end of 2012, EI companies employed 145,460 people directly on a full-time basis and supported a similar number of indirect jobs in the economy.  IDA client companies employed 136,505 people directly in 2012, with a similar impact on supporting jobs in the wider economy.</p><p>  We will continue to work, through the Enterprise Development Agencies, to increase the growth in overseas markets of goods and services produced in Ireland with a view to improving employment opportunities in Irish based companies.</p></reply>

Overall, the agency-supported companies created 16,652 net full-time jobs between them over the last two years.</p><p>2012 was a particularly good year for job creation by the agencies&rsquo; clients, with IDA companies creating a total of 5,638 net new full time jobs and a further 932 part time jobs last year.  The IDA client base in Ireland now employs 136,505 people on a full time basis, a level not seen since before the global financial crisis began in 2008.</p><p>Clients of Enterprise Ireland created 3,338 net new full time jobs in 2012.  Enterprise Ireland companies now employ 145,460 people on a full time basis, along with approximately 24,000 part-time jobs.</p><p>Between them, IDA and Enterprise Ireland client companies have been creating in the region of 1,000 additional jobs per month since the Government came into office.    This is in stark contrast to the 45,000 jobs which were lost over the period 2008-2010 inclusive in the agencies&rsquo; client base.</p><p>Shannon Development client companies support approximately 6,500 full and part-time jobs.  The County and City Enterprise Boards support companies that employ in the region of 33,400 jobs.  The agency-supported companies also indirectly support a significant level of further employment throughout the economy.</p><p>In the wider economy, we have seen a stabilisation in jobs numbers in the last six months of 2012.

We have also seen relative improvements in labour costs in Ireland which fell by 0.9% per annum in the period 2008-2011 while labour costs increased in the euro area by 4.6% per annum on average in the same period.</p><p>  However the Forf&aacute;s report highlights that Ireland is still out of line with our key competitors for a range of business inputs. Labour costs, despite the reductions achieved to date, remain relatively high (over 6% above euro area averages). Energy costs remain a cause for concern, particularly for the SME sector, while legal service prices are 11% above 2006 levels despite the recession. Also the report shows that Irish consumer prices are 12% above the euro area average. This is a significant indirect cost for business as it puts upward pressure on wage expectations.</p><p>  The report indicates that certain property costs in Ireland have reduced significantly in recent years. Construction costs and rental costs for both office and industrial space have fallen dramatically for new businesses since the collapse of the property market. Rental costs for new leases of office space in Dublin, for example, have decreased by 45 per cent between 2007 and 2011. Of course, I recognise that many existing businesses are tied into higher property costs, having purchased property or entered leases with upward only rent review clauses prior to February 2010. </p><p>  The Government has taken steps to address the issue of upward only rent reviews where possible.

This is a very useful piece of independent qualitative research on the phenomenon of emigration in Ireland today.  The recommendations in the Report are, however, outside the direct remit of my Department.</p><p>  At a macro level the Government&rsquo;s strategy is to re-build the economy and accelerate the transition to a sustainable, jobs-rich economy based on enterprise, innovation and exports.  It is in this way that we will create the environment in which sustainable jobs will be created, living standards will be raised and Ireland will be regarded as an attractive location in which to live and work.  We are doing this through the Action Plan for Jobs process and have already seen the positive results during 2012 of the collective action being taken across the whole of Government to support the enterprise sector to sustain existing jobs and create new ones. </p><p>   We must also remember, though, that emigration has been a consistent feature of Irish life, and even during the Celtic Tiger years, Irish people chose to emigrate for career or personal reasons.  Nevertheless the Government is committed to ensuring that emigration returns to being an option, not a necessity, and through the Action Plan for Jobs process, we will continue to strive to provide opportunities for employment in Ireland.  </p></reply>

Products coming from Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian Territory clearly should not be labelled as produce of Israel, since the settlements are not in Israel. There has been a growing demand in a number of EU and other countries for rules or guidelines to make this clear to importers and retailers. A number of countries, such as the UK and Denmark, have responded to queries from consumers or retailers by issuing such guidelines on a national basis. </p><p>  I believe that many consumers would wish to be able to distinguish between produce from Israel, produce from Palestinians, and produce from settlements. Indeed, there is anecdotal evidence that some consumers may be reluctant to buy entirely legitimate produce from Israel because they cannot at present be confident that it does not include settlement goods.</p><p>  There is also a broader political dimension to this issue. Israeli settlements in occupied territory are illegal in international law. Products from those settlements are to a large extent produced using land, water, minerals and other resources which properly belong to the Palestinian people, and in many cases have been actively expropriated from them. It is questionable if such products should in fact be admitted to the EU at all.</p><p>  The EU has identified settlements as a major obstacle to the achievement of peace in the Middle East. Their continuing expansion intrinsically involves the continued seizure of Palestinian land, eviction of families and the destruction of their homes. Ireland considers settlements to be a major driver of the continuing conflict, and the main sticking point among the several core issues still to be resolved. </p><p>  The EU has expressed these concerns on many occasions, notably in the Conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council in May 2012. The EU and other international voices have also pointed out that the continued expansion of settlements is now close to the point where it would be physically impossible to create a viable Palestinian state on the ground, thus permanently (and intentionally) making impossible a two-state solution to the conflict, something which Ireland has supported for over 30 years.</p><p>  The EU has made clear its deep concerns about settlements. Earlier this year High Representative Ashton wrote to EU Foreign Ministers stating that she was working with the External Action Service and the European Commission to produce EU-wide guidelines on place of origin labelling for goods from settlements. Along with 12 fellow Foreign Ministers, I replied to the High Representative welcoming and encouraging this move. What is likely to emerge in due course is EU labelling guidelines, identifying settlement products as such, for use where place of origin labelling occurs &ndash; be it mandatory (for some products) or voluntary. It is not expected that this will introduce a new mandatory labelling requirement for all goods, unique to settlements.</p><p>  I believe consumers will welcome this move, and many legitimate Israeli producers may also benefit. In addition, it will send an important political signal that the EU is serious in its concerns about settlements. </p><p>  Should action at EU level prove impossible for any reason, I will proceed to re-examine the question of labelling at national level.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of observers for election monitoring missions.  We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for both elections and constitutional referendums. Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  However, they have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre.  Last year, I asked officials in the Department to carry out a review of the election observation roster.  Following a call for applications, which was issued by the Department, and an appraisal process against published criteria, 200 individuals with a strong mix of skills and experience were selected to serve on a new roster, which came into effect on 15 May 2013.  Due to the high quality of applications for the roster, a reserve panel was established from which applicants will be drawn should any roster members leave the roster.</p><p>  The call for applicants to the new roster was published on both the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Irish Aid websites, with an information note setting out the details of the application process.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that all applicants were treated fairly and impartially. If any unsuccessful applicant wishes to have their application reviewed, the procedure is that a final review will be carried out by a senior official who has not been involved in the selection process. </p></reply>

Carbon tax was applied to petrol and auto-diesel with effect from 10 December 2009, and was extended to other mineral oils and to natural gas from I May 2010.  The carbon tax on these products amounts to &euro;20 per tonne of CO2 emitted and, in the case of mineral oils, is charged as a component of mineral oil tax rates.  The introduction of carbon tax on solid fuel was delayed to allow a mechanism to be put in place to address the risk of coal products with lower environmental standards being sourced from outside the State.  Regulations to enable local authorities to regulate and control the type of coal supplied in the State were put in place by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. The commencement of solid fuel carbon tax, with effect from 1 May 2013, was announced on that basis in Budget 2013.</p><p>Initially, the tax on solid fuel is being charged at a rate of &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 emitted.

For individuals on low incomes or those whose only income source is from the Department of Social Protection, the legislation provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT in certain cases.  A person who qualifies for full deferral can opt to defer 100% of the LPT liability.  A person who qualifies for partial deferral can opt to defer 50% of the liability and must pay the balance of LPT.  </p><p>To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence. The gross income thresholds for a full deferral are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or qualified cohabitants. A person may claim a deferral if their gross income will not, &#8220;as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date&#8221; exceed these thresholds in that year. To determine whether they qualify for deferral for 2013, liable persons are required to estimate on 1 May 2013 what their total gross income for 2013 is likely to be.  Gross income from all sources consists of the total income before any deductions, allowances or reliefs that may be taken into account for income tax purposes and includes income that is exempt from income tax and income received from the Department of Social Protection but excludes Child Benefit.  Where a deferral is being claimed on this basis, the LPT1 Return must be completed and the relevant deferral selected. The return may be  submitted on-line at <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>  . </p><p>  A deferral of up to 50% of the LPT liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for married persons/civil partners/cohabitants.</p><p>  The full and partial deferral thresholds may be increased in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  The deferral option in such qualifying cases will apply until the end of 2017.</p><p>  Further reliefs apply for persons who have entered into an insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, who may apply for a deferral of the LPT that is due during the period for which the insolvency arrangement is in effect.  The Act also provides that a person who suffers both an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense, as a result of which he or she is unable to pay their LPT without causing financial hardship, may apply for full or partial deferral.  </p><p>  Interest of c. 4% per annum is charged on deferred amounts.  This is half the interest rate charged in cases of non-compliance.</p><p>Deferrals allow tax not paid in a year to be rolled forward to be paid at a later date.  Elections for deferrals are voluntary, subject to eligibility. <b></b>Taxpayers who had deferred payment, but who are no longer eligible for deferrals due to improved financial circumstances, have the option of leaving the original deferrals in place in respect of previous tax liabilities, or of paying them off either in single payments or gradually.</p><p>  Any amount deferred will be a relatively small part of the overall value of the property. </p></reply>

Those assets of an approved retirement fund which qualify as eligible liabilities under the ELG Scheme, including cash deposits, are covered by the Scheme.  The Deputy will be aware that I announced on 26 February, 2013, the ending of the ELG Scheme for all new deposits and debt liabilities from midnight on 28 March, 2013.   Eligible liabilities currently covered under the Scheme are fully described in paragraph 11 of the Schedule to the Scheme and may be briefly listed as:</p><p>-  Deposits &ndash; (to the extent not covered by deposit protection schemes in the State or any other jurisdiction);</p><p>-  senior unsecured certificates of deposit;</p><p>-  senior unsecured commercial paper;</p><p>-  other senior unsecured bonds and notes; and</p><p>-  other forms of senior debt specified by the Minister in accordance with EU State Aid rules.</p><p>  For liabilities to be eligible to be guaranteed, they must meet the criteria set out in paragraph 12 of the Schedule to the Scheme. Namely, they must not have a maturity of more than 5 years and they must be incurred in the issuance period, which runs from the date Participating Institutions in the Scheme received approval to join it to its recently approved end-date of midnight on 28 March, 2013. Additionally, in the case of deposits, they must not contain an event of default and must be denominated in a single, specified currency. The eligibility guarantee can be applied to standalone debt securities or to securities issued under programmes, as per paragraph 15 of the Schedule.</p><p>  The Deposit Guarantee Scheme Regulations i.e. European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Schemes) Regulations 1995 (S.I. No. 168 of 1995) as amended by the European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Schemes) (Amendment) Regulations 2009, currently explicitly specify which deposits are excluded from coverage. Those deposits not specifically excluded are covered by the Deposit Guarantee Scheme. Deposits held by pension funds and retirement funds fall within the category of excluded deposits, though small self-administered pension schemes (SSAPs) are included.</p><p>  The decision to include SSAPs and exclude ARFs, AMRFs and other pension funds/instruments was based on the fact that SSAPs are usually small schemes administered by the member(s) of the scheme whilst ARFs are managed by a qualified fund manager through a credit or investment institution.</p><p>  Section 16(1)(n) of the European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Schemes) Regulations 1995 (S.I. No. 168 of 1995)  as amended by the European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Schemes) (Amendment) Regulations 2009 specifies that pension schemes or retirement funds (other than a small self-administered pension schemes) are not covered by the DGS. </p><p>  Certain personal pension products such as ARFs, AMRFs and PRSAs fall within the types of funds covered by the Investor Compensation Scheme and therefore, investors in these funds may be eligible for compensation if a covered investment firm goes out of business. The limit for claims under this scheme is 90% of the amount lost on the investment up to a maximum of &euro;20,000. The Investor Compensation Company Limited (ICCL) issues compensation to eligible investors who can claim by contacting the ICCL directly.	</p></reply>

It was necessary for Revenue, in the role of administrator of the Local Property Tax, to develop a Register of residential properties in the State.  The Register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue&rsquo;s own databases, the Local Government Management Agency database and other sources.  Data from the various sources has been cross-checked to ensure that the Register is as accurate as possible and work is still in progress to refine it.</p><p>  I am informed that, while every effort has been made to correctly match residential properties to owners, there are small numbers of incomplete records.

According to this ECB Press Release, the purpose of OMT is &ldquo;Safeguarding an appropriate monetary policy transmission and the singleness of the monetary policy&rdquo;.  In the Press Release, the ECB noted in relation to the coverage of OMT that it &ldquo;will be considered for Member States currently under a macroeconomic adjustment programme when they will be regaining bond market access.&rdquo;  The Press Release also sets out that a necessary condition for OMT is strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability Mechanism (EFSF/ESM) programme. </p><p>  Such programmes can take the form of a full EFSF/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme or a precautionary programme (Enhanced Conditions Credit Line), provided that they include the possibility of EFSF/ESM primary market purchases.  Finally the Press Release also notes that the ECB&rsquo;s Governing Council will decide on the start, continuation and suspension of OMT, following a thorough assessment, in full discretion and acting in accordance with its monetary policy mandate.  The reply to PQ No 219 of 23 April 2013, to which each of the three questions refers, states clearly that the decision on whether to grant OMT or otherwise in any particular case is a matter for the ECB, which is  an independent body. </p><p>  My recent comments about a further sale of Irish paper were referencing primarily our progress in establishing full market access. </p><p>  In relation to the NTMA, I understand its comment on clarity in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s eligibility for OMT to be its assessment of the view of the financial markets that such clarity would be helpful.</p><p>  All relevant options will be considered in the light of what will be appropriate for Ireland at the time of our Programme exit. The issue of our exit options has yet to be fully considered by Government and accordingly no decisions have been taken to date. </p></reply>

The 5 steps are as follows: Step 1: Communication with borrowers; Step 2: Financial information; Step 3: Assessment;   Step 4: Resolution; and Step 5: Appeals.</p><p>  A lender&rsquo;s Arrears Support Unit (ASU) must base its assessment (step 3) of the borrower&rsquo;s case on the full circumstances of the borrower including: a) the personal circumstances of the borrower; b) the overall indebtedness of the borrower; c) the information provided in the standard financial statement; d) the borrower&rsquo;s current repayment capacity; and e) the borrower&rsquo;s previous payment history. </p><p>  Where an alternative repayment arrangement is offered by a lender (step 4), the lender must provide the borrower with a clear explanation, in writing, of the alternative repayment arrangement, including: a) the new mortgage repayment amount; b) the term of the arrangement; c) the implications arising from the arrangement for the existing mortgage including the impact on: (i) the mortgage term, (ii) the balance outstanding on the mortgage loan account, and (iii) the existing arrears on the account, if any; d) details of how interest will be applied to the mortgage loan account as a result of the arrangement; e) how the alternative repayment arrangement will be reported by the lender to the Irish Credit Bureau and the impact of this on the borrower&rsquo;s credit rating; f) information regarding the borrower&rsquo;s right to appeal the lender&rsquo;s decision, including the procedure and timeframe for submitting an appeal, and g) the borrower must be advised to take appropriate independent legal and/or financial advice.</p><p>  The Central Bank has informed me that the lender must monitor the arrangement that is put in place for a MARP case on an ongoing basis and formally review the appropriateness of that arrangement for the borrower at least every six months. As part of the review, the lender must check with the borrower whether there has been any change in his/her circumstances in the period since the arrangement was put in place, or since the last review was conducted. Where a borrower ceases to adhere to the terms of an alternative repayment arrangement, the lender&rsquo;s ASU must formally review the borrower&rsquo;s case, including the standard financial statement, immediately.</p><p>  As set out in the Central Bank&rsquo;s Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) announced by the Central Bank in March 2013, when determining whether a proposal constitutes a sustainable solution, the lender needs to evaluate both the borrower&rsquo;s actual and prospective affordability. Given this, it is affordability and sustainability that will help determine the most appropriate restructure type.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-22a.228.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052200071#WRK01600"><p>The position is that tax relief is available, at varying rates and subject to certain ceilings, in respect of interest paid by an individual on a loan used for the purchase, repair, development or improvement of his/her sole or main residence.   The relief is available up to and including the tax year 2017 on the interest paid on qualifying home loans taken out in the period 2004 to 2012.  </p><p>  Where there is an entitlement to mortgage interest relief, it is available at varying rates and subject to certain ceilings.  For example, individuals who are in the first seven tax years of their qualifying loan are entitled to a higher interest ceiling, known as the &lsquo;first-time buyer&rsquo; ceiling, on which the rate of relief is applied.  For such individuals, the interest ceilings are &euro;10,000 per annum for a single individual and &euro;20,000 per annum for married couples and civil partnerships. For individuals who have an entitlement to mortgage interest relief and who are in their eighth or subsequent years of their qualifying loan   a lower interest ceiling applies, known as the &lsquo;non-first-time buyer&rsquo; ceiling. For such individuals, the interest ceilings are &euro;3,000 per annum for single and &euro;6,000 per annum for married couples/civil partnerships. Therefore, some individuals will experience a reduction in the level of relief they receive as they enter into their eighth and subsequent years of their qualifying loans.  However, they will continue to receive mortgage interest relief up until the end of 2017.  </p><p>  The system of mortgage interest relief is designed and targeted in such a way that the relief is of greater value in the early years of a qualifying loan where the interest represents a greater proportion of the repayment.  Mortgage interest relief is of lesser value to individuals whose repayments are made up of a higher proportion of principal than interest, as would generally be the case for those who moved in to the eighth and subsequent years of their loans.    </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware the Programme for Government contained a very specific commitment to examine a proposal to increase mortgage interest relief to 30% for first time buyers who bought between 2004 and 2008. In Budget 2012, this commitment was fulfilled. It is not my intention to widen the parameters of the commitment contained in the Programme for Government.     As you will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones, but I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer, given the significant budgetary constraints. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-22a.231.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052200071#WRK01900"><p>The transport of passengers and their accompanying baggage is exempt from VAT in Ireland under paragraph 14(3) of Schedule 1 to the VAT Consolidation Act 2010.  In this respect, services provided by the coach passenger operators are exempt from VAT and as such there is no charge to VAT.  This means that a person who provides a bus or coach service does not register for VAT and does not charge VAT on the supply of their services.  This also includes the hiring of a bus or coach with a driver.  Persons who are exempt from VAT cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services incurred in relation to their business, such as fuel, tyres and mechanic charges, used for the purposes of the person&rsquo;s coach and bus service.    While persons who are VAT exempt cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services incurred in relation to their business, I would point out that there is special provision within the VAT code to allow a refund of VAT incurred on the purchase of touring coaches.  Under VAT Refund Order S.I. 266 of 2012 coach operators who are exempt from VAT may, subject to the conditions of the Order, be entitled to a refund of the VAT paid on touring coaches that are no more than 2 years old and are within specified dimensions.</p><p>  Furthermore, while VAT exempt coach and bus operators are not entitled to claim the VAT incurred on their fuel costs, I would point out that Finance Act 2013 provides for relief from excise incurred on auto-diesel used in the course of business by qualifying bus and coach operators. The relief was originally intended to apply to licensed hauliers but, following consideration, it was decided to extend the relief to tax-compliant licensed passenger transport operators.  The relief will operate on a sliding scale dependant on fuel prices generally but will not apply when the price of auto-diesel falls below &euro;1.24 (including VAT).  The maximum amount of the relief will be 7.5 cents per litre and will come into effect from 1 July 2013.  It is estimated that the relief will cost in the region of &euro;35 million gross in 2013 and &euro;70 million gross in a full year.</p><p>  With regard to introducing a charge to VAT at 9% on passenger transport services, I would point out that while it is possible under the EU VAT Directive to introduce such a charge, Ireland has traditionally exempted passenger transport services from VAT and this reduces the cost of those services for both the providers and the users of coach transport, including public transport.  What must be remembered is that the cost of supplying goods and services that are exempt from VAT is always lower than if those goods and services were subject to VAT, despite the fact that VAT inputs cannot be claimed.</p></reply>

My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability. Where school based provision is not feasible, 10 hours per week home based provision may be grant aided to eligible pupils.</p><p>  Therefore the home based scheme is designed to support children who are not in a position to attend school, and it is generally the case that the Tuition is provided at the child's place of residence. In the vast majority of cases therefore, there will be 1 child in receipt of tuition with 1 tutor providing tuition. However in a small number of cases where there are qualifying siblings, a combined allocation is made. As Home Tuition is intended to compensate for school based provision it is reasonable to reflect the school grouping principle and allocate to siblings accordingly. For example, in a school setting one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils with autism. Accordingly it is considered appropriate that a tutor can provide collective tuition to members of one family in the home at the same time.</p><p>  Further clarity on this issue has been included on the information note accompanying the application forms for the home based scheme this year.</p></reply>

The position in the case of this VEC is that it has not been required to identify non-teaching staff for redeployment, as it has been operating within its Employment Control Framework (ECF) target.</p><p>  Redeployment in the first instance takes place by means of reassignment within an employee's own employing organisation, either to a suitable post at his/her grade or at an analogous grade for which the person has the necessary skills, qualifications and competencies.  If no suitable post exists within the organisation, redeployment is to another employer within the education sector to a suitable post at his her own grade or at an analogous grade.  If no suitable post exists within the education sector, redeployment is to a suitable post within the wider public service on no less favourable basic pay and pension terms.</p><p>  Following the establishment of the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) the ECF targets for individual ETBs will be determined. At that point, an ETB may be required to identify staff for redeployment and, where necessary, my Department will communicate in this matter with the ETB concerned.</p></reply>

In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.</p><p>  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report. </p></reply>

The aim of this Bill is to establish a comprehensive statutory framework for the Oireachtas to conduct inquiries within the current constitutional parameters.  The Bill envisages a central role for the Oireachtas in both initiating and conducting a parliamentary inquiry.  Under the Bill, responsibility is assigned exclusively to the Houses of the Oireachtas to determine the requirement for a formal inquiry, the terms of reference of that inquiry, the appropriate committee to conduct an inquiry and the procedural and organisational aspects of the inquiry.</p><p>  In advance of any decision by the Oireachtas to conduct a banking inquiry and in particular in advance of agreement on its detailed terms of reference, it is not possible to make any precise assessment on the cost of such an inquiry.  However, a robust parliamentary power of inquiry can play a very important role in ensuring that lessons relating to past policy failures are learnt, which can only be to the benefit of taxpayers and citizens. I would expect that any inquiry would be conducted by a committee of the House(s).</p></reply>

The rationale for this is twofold.  First, I am responsible for employment policies in the civil service rather than the broader public service. Employment policies, including those related to dismissals, in other areas of the public service are a matter for the relevant Minister.  Second, under provisions in the Public Service Management Act 1997 and the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005, each Secretary General/Head of Office has the authority, responsibility and accountability for carrying out a range of duties in their Departments/Offices.  Among these is the management of all matters pertaining to the appointment, performance, discipline and dismissals of staff below the grade of Principal Officer. Ministers are the appropriate authority for these matters in relation to civil servants at or above Principal Officer level in accordance with the Civil Service Regulation Acts 1956 to 2005.  The relevant Minister and Secretary General/Head of Office are, therefore, responsible for dismissals in their own organisation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-22a.339.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052200076#WRP00900"><p>The position in relation to the pensions of former Taoisigh and former Ministers, along with that of public service pensioners generally is kept under review by my Department.  In this context I should point out that, over the course of recent years, several Government measures have been taken which serve, directly or indirectly, to substantially reduce pension awards and pensions in payment to higher-paid retirees from the public service, including former Taoisigh and former Ministers.</p><p>  A key measure in this context has been the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR), which applies to all public servants who retired up to the end of February 2012, including retirees in the groups referred to in the Deputy's question. This progressively structured imposition on pensions was introduced in January 2011, based on a set of income bands and percentage reductions bearing most heavily on higher-pensioned retirees. Acting on foot of my concern in relation to high public service pensions, I subsequently acted to make the PSPR even more progressive in application, by legislating for an increase in the rate of PSPR on pension amounts in excess of &euro;100,000, from 12% to 20% on the excess amount, effective from January 2012.</p><p>  In the case of former public servants who retire or have retired from February 2012 onward, pensions have also been subject to a significant effective reduction, insofar as they have been impacted by the pay reductions applied under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) legislation. These reductions have again been progressively structured, so that higher paid public servants and public service retirees, including in the groups referred to by the Deputy, have proportionately been harder hit.  In this context some of the deepest pay cuts of all have been imposed on ministerial pay, and these pay cuts will be fully reflected in the pension awards to current and future Ministers.</p><p>  In addition to these measures already taken, and as I have already announced, the Government this week, in the context of the resumed Croke Park discussions, approved the text and publication of legislation to give effect to the pay reduction for public servants  earning over &euro;65,000, along with a parallel reduction in higher-value public service pensions and other contingent measures to enable the Government achieve its savings requirements in the event of non-ratification of collective agreements.  Specifically in respect of pensions, the relevant legislation, to be published tomorrow, will implement a further cut on higher-value public service pensions, including those of former Ministers and Taoisigh.</p><p>  I should also say that Part 4 of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 amended the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010 to provide that public service pensioners with more than one public service pension (for example a retired Minister with a ministerial pension and a TD&rsquo;s pension) will have those pensions aggregated for purposes of the Public Service Pension Reduction; a commencement order to give effect to this aggregation provision is expected to be signed in the near future.  The 2012 Act also provides for the abatement of pension where a public service pensioner is re-employed in the public service.</p></reply>

It is also recognised that public procurement can be an important source of business for SMEs.</p><p>  However, when the value of a contract exceeds the threshold for publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities all public bodies are obliged to adhere to EU procurement law and must abide by the fundamental principles of transparency, equal treatment, proportionality and mutual recognition which are the basis for our membership of the EU.</p><p>  This means that we must treat all companies tendering equally and show no preference to national industry. These laws apply equally to other countries within the EU and also enable Irish companies to compete for public procurement opportunities abroad.</p><p>  Under EU law, tenderers can only submit tender prices <i>exclusive</i>  of VAT, as rates can vary in each jurisdiction. This ensures a level playing field for companies from different countries and therefore no competitive advantage or disadvantage should arise from the correct application of VAT rules.</p><p>  If a company from another European country is successful in winning a publicly tendered competition here in Ireland they will have to register with the Revenue Commissioners for VAT where they are supplying taxable goods within the State.  Where they register for VAT in Ireland they will then apply VAT in the same manner to that of an Irish company.  In addition, if a company established in another EU Member State supplies goods from that other EU Member State to non-VAT registered customers in Ireland the company will register and account for VAT in Ireland where the value of goods supplied exceeds &euro;35,000 in a 12 month period.  However, where a company established in another EU Member State supplies goods from that other EU Member State to VAT registered customers in Ireland the company will zero rate the supplies and the Irish customer will self-account for the supplies at the appropriate Irish VAT rate.</p></reply>

A further consideration is the ability of contracting authorities to effectively monitor compliance with the social clause.  Experience in other Member States, would indicate that social clauses will tend to be used for services and works contracts rather than supply contracts.</p><p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does not maintain information centrally about public contracts that have local employment or social clauses.  However under the Capital Works Management Framework in relation to public sector construction procurement, Circular 33/06: &lsquo;Construction Procurement Reform &ndash; revision of arrangements for the procurement of public works projects and for the engagement and payment of construction consultants&rsquo;, requires any amendments to the contracts, including social clauses, to be submitted to the Government Contracts Committee on Construction (GCCC) for consideration and approval as appropriate.</p><p>  The Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC) has recently approved a pilot initiative to be included in a series of 3 bundles under the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) Devolved Schools Build Programme Design and Build Framework (procured and delivered by the NDFA on behalf of the Dept. of Education and Skills), which will require the Contractor to provide for the employment of some members of the workforce employed under a public works contract to be recruited from the ranks of the long-term unemployed, in addition there is a requirement to provide opportunities for apprentices.  The NDFA devolved schools programme consists of a mix of new builds, extensions and some remedial works to existing schools both at a primary and post primary level and have been bundled into 3 separate bundles.  The projects will be constructed using the public works contract for Building Works designed by the Contractor.  Once the contracts are underway the implementation of the additional requirements will be monitored and the NDFA will report on the success of the initiative before the GCCC considers recommending their more widespread use.</p></reply>

However, access is not always feasible because of a range of issues including physical location, risks associated with dangerous structures and restrictions imposed in some cases by landowners who may wish to limit access, either temporarily or more longer term, by reason of accident risk, livestock etc.  OPW would estimate that approx 10% of the National Monument sites in its care are not accessible at any given time for various reasons.</p><p>  As part of its remit, the OPW also provides enhanced visitor access, together with Guide facilities in some cases, at 70 of the more prominent visitor locations nationally.

The aim is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.</p><p>  Reform of public procurement is one of the major projects of key strategic importance in the Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform Plan, which was published in November 2011. Procurement of supplies and services accounts for around &euro;9 billion of current spending by the State per annum. This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the Public Service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.</p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS) has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service&rsquo;s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include:</p><p>- cash savings; </p><p>- administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; </p><p>- greater purchasing expertise; </p><p>- improved consistency; and,</p><p>- enhanced service levels. </p><p>  In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements. Last year Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued Circular 06/12 which implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement for public service bodies to avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. These national arrangements will secure best value for money and facilitate contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.  </p><p>  While the key purpose of Circular 6/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, these need not be accepted as the norm. The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring on-going cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions. </p><p>  I would add that National Procurement Service tender documentation has been developed to encourage the participation of SMEs. For example, the contract for office supplies was divided into three individual lots for Stationery, ICT Consumables and Paper. SMEs that believed the scope of the competitions were beyond their technical or business capacities were encouraged to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises. Through such relationships they could participate and contribute to the successful implementation of any contracts that resulted from these competitions and therefore increase their social and economic benefits. </p><p>  Larger enterprises were also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs could be included in their proposals to maximise the social and economic benefits of the contracts that result from these tenders. For example, the indigenous company, which won the Stationery contract, with an estimated value of &euro;10m per annum, is sourcing up to 60% of their products using 136 local agents and manufacturers. </p><p>  Furthermore, in order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide.

When we launched the first Action Plan in February 2012, I said that the transformation required by our economy would not come through one big bang solution, but through deliberate and determined action across all areas of Government and the private sector. </p><p>  One year into the Action Plan for Jobs process, we can see the evidence that the strategy and architecture are working.  There were 270 individual actions committed to last year, to improve the operating environment for businesses, provide an impetus for emerging sectors, support export growth, and remove barriers to employment-creation across the economy.  Over 90% of these actions were completed during 2012. </p><p>  More importantly, there was a stabilisation in jobs numbers in the last six months of 2012.  The Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) for Quarter 4 of 2012 showed the first annual increase in employment since the middle of 2008.  Last year, 12,000 jobs were created in the private sector, particularly in export-oriented companies which have been the focus of the Action Plan for Jobs.  This compares to the 250,000 private sector jobs lost in the three years before this Government took office.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland and IDA client companies created almost 10,000 net jobs between them last year, through their focus on enterprise, innovation and exporting.  This was the best performance of the agency client companies in many years.</p><p>  I acknowledge that job losses continue to occur in parts of the domestic economy.  However, we need to bring about a re-structuring of the economy based on strong foundations, and appropriate levels of activity that are sustainable in the longer-term.  </p><p>  This year&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs includes 333 actions for delivery across all Government Departments and 46 Agencies or Offices.  In addition to continuing to support export-oriented growth, the Plan includes a number of measures to support the domestic economy.  These include actions relating to the Retail and Construction sectors, supporting small and micro-enterprises through the new Local Enterprise Office structure, improving access to finance for businesses including SMEs in the domestic economy, and improving our cost competitiveness.</p><p>  As a small open economy, Ireland is heavily influenced by developments in international markets. However, the merit of the Action Plan for Jobs is that every year, each Department is required to focus on changes that can be brought about to make a practical contribution to the target of supporting the creation of 100,000 extra jobs in the economy by 2016.</p></reply>

The project is predominantly in the field of astrophysics and it will enable scientists to study the early universe, discover new planets and monitor the Sun&rsquo;s affect on the Earth. </p><p>  LOFAR is expected to give new views of the Universe and inspire young scientists and engineers. The proposers indicate that the impact of LOFAR on a wide range of astrophysical topics will be immense &ndash; revolutionising the study of transient stars and galaxies; enabling the first studies into the early Universe after the Big Bang; completing the most extensive surveys of galaxies at low frequencies; and providing a new insight into the Sun-Earth connection. LOFAR will have applications in geophysics, meteorology, and agriculture.</p><p>  I-LOFAR is the Irish Low Frequency Array proposal to build a cutting-edge radio telescope in Birr Castle Demesne, Co Offaly, thereby allowing Ireland to join the International LOFAR network. Indicative overall costs for the project here are thought to be in excess of &euro;2m and there would also be on-going associated annual maintenance costs. The I-LOFAR project proposal is being led by Dr. Peter Gallagher, a solar physicist at the School of Physics, Trinity College Dublin. A proposal was submitted by Trinity College Dublin in relation to the I-LOFAR project under the SFI Infrastructure 2012 call but the proposal did not attain a sufficiently high ranking in the review process to warrant funding in that particular competition. This does not preclude any new bids being made by Trinity College or other colleges for the I-LOFAR project under any future exchequer supported competitive research calls.  </p><p>  The recognition that a country of Ireland&rsquo;s size can only excel in a focussed number of fields of research is increasingly acknowledged. The Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group, formally adopted by Government in 2012, aims to accelerate the delivery of economic outcomes from Government investment in public research organisations by aligning future competitive public investment by research funders to 14 opportunity areas. Astrophysics is not one of the designated 14 priority areas though it is accepted to be of some relevance to the information and communications technologies fields.</p><p>  To realise the full impact of our research investment, detailed action plans have been developed for each of the 14 priority areas. The action plans, now being implemented, focus on ensuring that there is coherence in the approach to funding in these areas amongst funding agencies, that the research base is aligned with enterprise needs, including development of appropriate skills and that the wider ecosystem for innovation is supportive. The action plans are live documents that will continuously evolve so that they remain current and ensure a dynamic, responsive environment for innovation and technology development.  The report calls for on-going review of priority areas on a regular basis to ensure their continued relevance and to also ensure that new opportunities are identified.As well as aligning funding to the 14 areas, the actions identify wider eco-system or framework conditions that need to be addressed to allow investment in the Priority Area yield the optimum return.</p></reply>

Key actions are proposed across a range of areas, including; access to new funding, management training and support, costs reduction, technology adoption and the implementation of a <i>National Step Change</i> initiative.</p><p>  In terms of addressing our Competitiveness issues, Ireland's cost competitiveness can be improved in two ways: through reductions in costs nationally; and/or at firm level through improvements in productivity. Encouragingly, a key finding in this Strategy has been that productivity in manufacturing has been increasing over recent years - annual average growth rates in per hour labour productivity across manufacturing sectors amounted to 5.6 per cent over the period 2007 to 2010 - enhancing the competitiveness of Ireland's manufacturing firms on international markets. By implementing these actions and building on progress made to date, I believe that this will lead to a more vibrant sector with enhanced prospects for additional job creation in a wide range of skill levels.</p><p>  Ireland currently has a very diverse range of manufacturing businesses with many exciting and innovative companies in high-technology and emerging sectors.  We are well placed to take advantage of our current position to build on this expertise in both the FDI and indigenous companies.  There are very exciting opportunities in sectors such as Food, Pharma/Biopharma, ICT Hardware, Medical Technologies and Engineering.  Utilisation of Innovation Science and Technology will be crucial in pursuing competitiveness for the industry.</p><p>  It is, of course, the case that many of the Competitiveness issues faced by the Manufacturing Sector are similar to those facing businesses generally. In a separate initiative last year, I requested Forf&aacute;s to undertake research into a number of factors impacting on Ireland's international competitiveness, to benchmark these factors and to develop proposals to systematically reduce excessive key business costs or delays.</p><p>  That wider Forf&aacute;s research indicates that in the period between January 2000 and April 2008, Ireland suffered a 22.5% loss in competitiveness.  However, in the period from April 2008 to July 2012, Irish cost competitiveness improved by 19% as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices. Prices have now fallen back to levels last seen in 2002. The research benchmarks Ireland's performance against a number of our key trading partners, as well as the OECD and Euro area averages.  Positive trends are emerging in relation to some key cost factors, including Labour costs, where our labour cost competitiveness continues to improve; Construction and new rental costs, which have fallen significantly since the collapse of the property bubble; and the cost of most business services, which have fallen to, or below, 2006 levels.</p><p>  The provision of adequate and appropriate finance for both the manufacturing and services sectors is crucial, but as you will appreciate, EU grant aid is a less significant factor now than in former years. Obviously all potential sources of grant aid are pursued.  In relation to property rental issues for the sector, the Manufacturing Development Forum, who advise me on relevant issues relating to manufacturing, have not highlighted the impact of upward only rent reviews as a serious impediment to their operations.</p></reply>

Clients of Enterprise Ireland created 3,338 net new full time jobs in 2012.  EI companies now employ 145,460 people on a full time basis.</p><p>These results show that the Enterprise Development Agencies have been to the fore in delivering on the commitments set out in the Action Plan for Jobs.

This is undertaken on an on-going basis by Government, the State Agencies and other independent bodies. In addition to work carried out by my own Department, Forf&aacute;s provides independent and rigorous research, advice and support in the areas of enterprise and science policy. This work informs my Department and the wider Government in its responses to the needs of the business environment.</p><p>  During the preparation of the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, I met with a wide range of business representatives. I also held a series of regional meetings in 2012 to hear the concerns of the enterprise sector. In addition, I also meet regularly with the CEOs of Forf&aacute;s, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to keep informed of developments in the enterprise sector.</p><p>  In the preparation of the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, more than 55 submissions were received, containing over 600 individual proposals for consideration. Some of these are already being addressed through Government actions generally, or through specific actions contained in the Action Plan for Jobs.  However, we are also considering what further action we can take in relation to individual actions through the Action Plans for Jobs in 2014-2016, the budgetary process and other mechanisms.</p></reply>

Innovation is an integral part of the Government&rsquo;s overall economic policy and a key pillar in our 2013 Action Plan for Jobs is &lsquo;using research and innovation to drive job creation&rsquo;.  Supporting innovation is one of the key areas which I have been working on directly to support job creation by enterprise.  The progress being made is demonstrated by the fact that we are climbing back up the international competitiveness tables; our exports are at record high levels, and IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland had their best years for jobs growth in 2012 for ten years and five years respectively.</p><p>  In a modern economy, highly innovative sectors deliver high returns. In Ireland, we have some of the largest and most dynamic medical device and pharmaceutical companies in the world. Nine of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in the world have a base in Ireland, as do eight of the top 10 medtech companies. The life sciences sector in Ireland accounts for over 50,000 jobs and &euro;50 billion worth of exports. High value added, productive manufacturing is increasingly dynamic, sophisticated and innovative and requires investment in research and development. Statistics show that exports from R&amp;amp;D performing companies have increased from &euro;44bn in 2003 to &euro;111bn in 2011, while for non-R&amp;amp;D performing companies, exports decreased from &euro;48bn to &euro;30bn over the same period.  IDA, whose client forms employ some 130,000 people, has transformed its investment profile with RDI projects increasing from &euro;80m in 2004 to &euro;700m in 2011 - representing some 50% of IDA investment wins.</p><p>Delivering further job creation opportunities is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s strategy of accelerating the economic and societal return on our STI investment. Research Prioritisation will see the majority of competitive public research funding aligned with 14 priority areas where we are most likely to get economic returns, particularly in the form of jobs.   Other initiatives include expanding the remit of Science Foundation Ireland to cover applied research; a new Intellectual Property Protocol which gives more clarity and certainty around ownership of IP emerging from state funded research; the establishment of a Central Technology Transfer Office to act as a one stop shop providing an effective interface between industry and the research community; and the R&amp;amp;D tax credit scheme which continues to encourage business to invest in research.</p><p>  The Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey reports on job gains and losses in companies that are supported by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Shannon Development. The survey does not measure jobs created in the categories of innovation and technology but rather in specific sectoral categories.  As innovation and technology are aspects of employment across most sectors it is not possible, therefore, to disaggregate the information as sought by the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, there are a range of measures in place which aim to match available skills with employment opportunities.</p><p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), which reports jointly to me and to the Minister for Education and Skills, publishes an annual Skills Bulletin which provides a review of employment trends, job opportunities and demand for skills in the Irish economy.  It is available on the website of the EGFSN at .</p><p>  The F&Aacute;S Skills and Labour Market Research Unit which provides the EGFSN with data, analysis and research, also manages the National Skills Database.</p><p>The new Intreo employment service, operated by the Department of Social Protection, provides a personalised service to unemployed people, based on their individual needs. It includes advice on education, training and personal development opportunities, job search assistance as well as information on, and access to, a range of income supports. Intreo also provides a wide range of supports and services to assist with company employment needs and is designed to make sure companies can access potential employees from the live register. Further information on Intreo can be found on the Department of Social Protection's website, .</p><p>  JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme, which came into operation on 1st July 2011 has seen over 17,400 internships commenced since its introduction.  The aim of the National Internship Scheme is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training, or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills.</p><p>  An independent evaluation of JobBridge conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that 61% of individuals who have participated in JobBridge have progressed into employment within five months of completing their internship placements.  This high level of progression into employment exceeds that of similar schemes across Europe, suggesting that JobBridge is an effective labour market intervention.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.</p><p>  In addition to promoting medium-term economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures in the short-term to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market.</p><p>  In this regard the State already provides a significant number of initiatives which are of relevance to young people and the Department of Social Protection took steps in Budget 2013 to increase funding and places for schemes such as JobBridge, Community Employment, T&Uacute;S and a new state employment scheme in the local Government sector.  In total an additional 10,000 places will be provided.  Other relevant provision is made through the training and education programmes delivered through F&Aacute;S and the further education sector.</p><p>  At an EU level the most recent initiative for dealing with the youth unemployment problem is the Council Recommendation for an EU-wide Youth Guarantee, which was formally adopted last month as part of the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  The Recommendation is that Member States should:<blockquote>  Ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.</blockquote>  While Member States are encouraged to implement the Recommendation as soon as possible, it is recognised that implementation will need to be more gradual in countries with higher levels of youth unemployment and particularly severe budgetary problems. The government will now review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.</p><p>  In this context, the Government intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to maximise the impact of a youth guarantee in Ireland. We have sought funding from the European Commission for a proposed pilot Youth Guarantee project in the Ballymun area of north Dublin, and numerous organisations (e.g. IBEC, Ballymun Job Centre, National Youth Council of Ireland) have agreed to participate in this pilot.  It is hoped that the findings from this pilot will inform both national and EU policy in relation to the implementation of a youth guarantee.</p><p>  The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the gradual implementation of a guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly, require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.</p><p>  In terms of targets, the government's Action Plan for Jobs sets out to help create the right environment for the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016. In this context, the Department of Finance anticipates that the overall unemployment rate will fall from 14.7% in 2012 to 12.3% in 2016.  This could be expected to see youth unemployment fall from over 30% in 2012 to 24% or less in 2016. It is to be hoped that any measures taken by government in relation to the implementation of the youth guarantee will see youth unemployment fall even further than this.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.</p><p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for the State pension (contributory) easier by disregarding time spent out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme was introduced in and took effect from 1994.  Eligibility for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is conditional on firstly meeting the standard qualifying conditions for State pension.</p><p>  There are no plans to review the effective date for this scheme as backdating the scheme further than 1994 would involve considerable costs.  The 2007 Green Paper on Pensions indicated that to back-date the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme to 1953, the year when the unified system of social insurance was introduced in Ireland, would cost the Exchequer in the region of &euro;160m.  Costs in relation to this scheme, under the current rules, are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994.</p><p>  The standardisation of State pension age to 66 is one of the reform measures planned which aims to increase the sustainability of the Irish pension system and this was provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011. The State pension (transition) which applies for one year for persons of age 65 will cease from 1st January 2014 and thereafter, State pension age will increase to 67 in 2021and 68 in 2028.  The number of women affected by this change is minimal given that only 0.05% of women came from homemaking to State pension transition.</p><p>  People who are affected by the upcoming changes may be able to avail of a social welfare payment where there is an income need and details of same are available at www.welfare.ie.</p><p>  In relation to women and social insurance payments, the recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors. It further confirms that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women, have and will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund due to the redistributive nature of the Fund.</p></reply>

It was introduced in 1999 to replace 'Smallholders Unemployment Assistance' for low income farmers, without the requirement to be available for and genuinely seeking work. Farm assist recipients retain all the advantages of the jobseeker's allowance scheme such as retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.</p><p>  Farm assist is a flexible payment and any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cash-flow issues, due for example to bad weather, can ask his/her local social welfare / Intreo office to review the level of means applying to his/her claim.</p><p>  The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is designed to reflect the actual net income and looks at gross income, less any expenses necessarily incurred, from farming. Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.</p><p>  I met with a delegation from the Irish Farmers Association on 15th May 2013 to discuss a range of issues, including difficulties arising as a result of fodder shortages and the operation of the farm assist scheme generally. Officials from the Department are also in contact with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in relation to the fodder situation.</p></reply>

It is a fundamental qualifying condition for these schemes that a person must be available for full-time work.

While the general conditions for qualifying for benefits and the design and financing of schemes remain a matter for the individual Member States, the EU Regulations determine, amongst other things, where a person is to be insured and what benefits must be exported outside the State.</p><p>  Generally speaking, the competent State for payment of social insurance is the country of last employment and that country is usually responsible for the payment of benefits.  With regard to the export of benefits, the position is that most contributory payments can be paid to someone resident in another country provided that Ireland remains the competent State under the EU Regulations.  If a person becomes employed in another Member State then competency will usually change.</p><p>  However, the Regulations also provide for a particular class of benefit known as a special non-contributory benefit.  These benefits are generally social assistance type non-contributory payments which are financed from general taxation.  Such benefits are provided in the Member State in which the person resides and in accordance with its legislation.  Accordingly, such benefits are not exportable.</p><p>  In Ireland the benefits classed as special non-contributory benefits include blind pension, jobseekers&rsquo; allowance, State pension non-contributory, widow's, widower's (non contributory) pension, disability allowance and mobility allowance. There are no plans to request a re-classification of any Irish benefit to make it exportable to another EU or EEA State.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.

Expenditure on FIS for 2012 was of the order of &euro;224 million in respect of some 32,000 families.  The estimated expenditure for 2013 is expected to be &euro;229 million in 2013.</p><p>  The FIS payment preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he/she was unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.  To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with - or is supported by - him/her.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p><p>  An integral part of the FIS scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment.  The rate of payment may be increased if an additional child is born in the course of the 52 weeks.  On the other hand, the rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings.  A key advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.  This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides a real incentive to workers with families to avail of employment opportunities.</p><p>  The one-family parent payment (OFP) scheme has played an important role in providing income support to lone parents since its introduction as the Lone Parent&rsquo;s Allowance (LPA) in 1990.  The number of OFP recipients stood at 87,855 in April, 2013.  The cost of the OFP scheme was &euro;1.06 billion in 2012 and is estimated to be &euro;935 million in 2013.</p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012 introduced several changes to the OFP scheme, including the phased reduction of the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which a recipient&rsquo;s payment ceases to 7 years from 2014 for new entrants and from 2015 for existing recipients.  Originally, this phased reduction was set to occur in January of each year from 2013 until 2015.  However, Budget 2013 contained amendments to postpone the dates of the OFP scheme age changes &ndash; meaning that the phased reduction of the maximum age limit of the youngest child will now not apply until July of each year from 2013 until 2015.  The reforms to the scheme aim to provide the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to escape poverty and social exclusion, participate in education and training, develop their skills set, enter the workforce and, ultimately, attain financial independence and social well-being for both themselves and their families.</p><p>  Some OFP recipients are presently in receipt of both the FIS and OFP payments.  Under current FIS legislation, these recipients will be reviewed at the end of their 52 week period, when the loss of their entitlement to the OFP payment as a result of the OFP reforms would be taken into account.  I am conscious of the impact that these provisions will have on those recipients and officials from my Department are currently examining this issue. </p><p>  The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is a means tested weekly payment for people who have insufficient means or no income which provides a basic income support payment to eligible people whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  The Government has provided &euro;161.4 million for the basic SWA scheme in 2013.  The main purpose of the basic supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need.  The scheme is subject to certain terms and conditions and a claimant can receive SWA while waiting for a claim for another payment to be processed or if they are not entitled to any other weekly payment.</p></reply>

The existing legislation covers the registration of deaths in the State. </p><p>  Usually when a person dies abroad the death is registered by the authorities in that country and a certified copy of the death registration is obtainable from that country.</p><p>  In general, only deaths which occur within the State can be registered here although there are some exceptions such as for the death of a person on board an Irish aircraft etc., the death of a member of the security forces serving outside the State or where a death occurs in a country which does not have a system in place to register deaths.  </p><p>  However, I realise that there are situations where it is very important for families to have the death of their loved one registered in Ireland.  For that reason I have asked my Department to examine the options for providing a mechanism that deals with these cases in a way that addresses the concerns of families while ensuring the validity of the current registration process.</p><p>  This issue is currently being considered in my Department along with a number of other proposed amendments to the Civil Registration Act (2004) and in this regard it is hoped that legislation will be introduced in 2013.</p></reply>

The Committee includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector.  Real progress is being made in tackling and resolving the issues faced by residents of unfinished estates.  The Committee is meeting on a regular basis to oversee this effort.  It has produced a guidance manual on resolving and managing unfinished estates, a key stakeholders code of practice and a guide for residents living in unfinished developments, all of which are available at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.  Site Resolution Plans have been identified by the National Co-ordination Committee as a key tool in resolving issues associated with unfinished housing developments.  Such plans enable stakeholders, including developers, local authorities, financial institutions, NAMA and residents to collaborate in determining how best to pursue resolution of problematic sites.  The process also entails working with stakeholders in identifying the best long-term solution for developments in terms of their configuration, use of vacant buildings and ownership.  Such solutions also take account of the best interests of residents.</p><p>  Under the public safety initiative for unfinished housing developments, my Department has allocated some &euro;3.877 million to 21 local authorities from the funding made available to address immediate public safety issues.  Some &euro;2.49 million was approved in 2011 and some &euro;1.38 million was approved in 2012.  My Department will continue to examine and approve claims in 2013 as they are submitted by local authorities.  The types of works that have been approved to date include fencing off unsecured and hazardous areas, capping pipes, installing street lighting and undertaking other works to secure sites.  Some &euro;2.515 million has been drawn down by local authorities to date.  It is not considered necessary to allocate additional funding to this scheme at this time as the funds available are adequate to service this initiative.  This funding is targeted at developments where a developer has abandoned the development and serious public safety concerns exist.  If the developer is still active, it is the responsibility of the local authority planning department to pursue the developer for completion of the development in line with the terms of the original planning permission.  Similarly, where a developer is inactive but still in place, the enforcement of the planning conditions is a matter for the relevant planning authority.  As outlined in the National Housing Development Survey 2012, the results of which I published in November 2012, real progress has been made in tackling the issues faced by the residents of unfinished housing developments, with a 37% decrease in the number of unfinished developments since 2010 and nearly 300 developments effectively resolved in the last 12 months.  It is likely that some estates will ultimately need to be demolished as suitable alternate uses may not be found in all cases.  Demolition is unlikely to arise where viable alternative solutions, including possible deployment for social housing purposes, are identified.</p></reply>

The list of unfinished housing developments eligible for the exemption was compiled by local authorities utilising the categorisation employed for the purposes of the National Housing Survey 2012. The Survey was carried out over the course of summer 2012 by my Department in conjunction with local authorities and the Housing Agency.</p><p>  The categorisation methodology for the survey was different to that which was used in 2011 and which provided the basis for the waiver from the household charge. That earlier categorisation related largely to the level of on-site activity at the time the 2011 survey was carried out and had less to do with the physical character of a development. The 2012 survey was based purely and objectively on the actual state of completion of a development, and established that there were 1,700 unfinished developments, with 1,100 of them deemed to be in a seriously problematic condition. This represents a 37% reduction in unfinished developments since 2010.</p><p>  Only developments that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included in the LPT regulations. For purposes of preparing the final list of developments to which the exemption from the local property tax would apply local authorities were asked by my Department in February 2013 to confirm or update the then existing list of estates in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo; as appropriate. A small number of local authorities&rsquo; returns were queried by my Department at an aggregate level where it appeared that the list of developments being put forward for inclusion under the exemption was inconsistent with the results of the 2012 survey or where, for example, developments with no completed units or those completely unoccupied had been proposed for inclusion. Authorities were asked to examine their lists again with a view to achieving greater consistency with the results of the 2012 survey.</p><p>  The survey methodology is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie. </p></reply>

One consideration would be as to whether disclosure of information would be restricted to criminal convictions of violence only or would include information on domestic violence orders made under the civil law Domestic Violence Acts 1996 and 2007.  As domestic violence orders are made by the courts "in camera", the release of information on the perpetrator would have implications for the privacy of victims.</p><p>  The implications of the Data Protection Act, 1988 on the possible disclosure of information would also need to be considered, especially in the case of civil orders for which the evidential test is lower than for criminal proofs.  </p><p>  Full consideration of what additional protection such registers might afford over what is presently available would be required.  Information from such registers as are available internationally at present vary widely.  They are in the main quite restrictive and limited to police personnel.  They operate best to identify perpetrators of violence who move between police jurisdictions, as in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Ireland is unusual internationally in operating a police force which has a national jurisdiction.  Information from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na PULSE system is readily available to all Garda&iacute; attending domestic violence situations.  </p><p>  I also understand that, it is standard practice for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to act immediately in situations where they have information that a person is at risk and in need of protection.  </p><p>  At present provisions of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001 may apply to convicted sex offenders who have committed an offence within a domestic situation.  Under the 2001 Act, information is not made available to the general public but may be made available on a limited &quot;need-to-know&quot; basis in particular cases.  </p><p>  In addition a &quot;Monitoring&quot; or &quot;Protection&quot; Order may be made under Section 26 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 in relation to serious offences under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997 (causing serious harm, threats to kill or cause serious harm, and false imprisonment). </p></reply>

It has passed all stages in the Seanad.The Bill is intended to work in harmony with the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012. However, elements of that Act concerning the disclosure of convictions are under review at present having regard to a recent judgment of the UK Court of Appeal in <i>(On the Application of) T and others v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester</i>   [2013]. The Court considered the circumstances in which it is appropriate to disclose convictions for minor offences with particular regard to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. While the judgment concerns legislation that differs from the 2012 Act and the proposed Bill, I take the view that the legal principles identified by the Court in relation to the application of Article 8 merit consideration.  In the event that some modifications are required to the 2012 Act my intention is to bring them forward by way of amendment to the Bill and to make any consequential changes to the Bill itself that are required to ensure that the two regimes work in harmony.  Until this work is complete I am not in a position to give an indication of the likely timing of Report Stage. However, I am conscious of the importance of the Bill to the reintegration of offenders and I will endeavour to ensure that there is no undue delay.</p></reply>

The findings of the Referee were final, conclusive and binding on all persons and tribunals whatsoever and could only be reopened on the ground that evidence not available prior to the making of a report by the Referee became available. The power to request the re-opening of a particular case was removed by subsequent legislation. In each case referred for investigation, the Referee reported to the Minister for Defence as to whether the applicant was or was not a person to whom the 1934 Act applied. If the applicant was a person to whom the 1934 Act applied then a "service certificate" awarded by the Minister for Defence under Section 10 of the Act (based on the Referee&rsquo;s findings) would have rendered an applicant eligible for the award of a pension.</p><p>  In 1938, the person in question, now deceased, submitted an application under the 1934 Act on the basis of his activities in Fianna &Eacute;ireann. His application was duly investigated by the Referee and Advisory Committee. In 1941 the Referee reported to the Minister that the applicant was not a person to whom the 1934 Act applied. In such circumstances the then Minister could not issue a service certificate under the 1934 Act. In accordance with a Government decision taken in 1942, the Service (1917-1921) Medal was awarded in two classes: (a) Medal with bar to persons who were in possession of a military service certificate entitling them to a pension under the Military Service Pensions Acts in respect of active service in the period subsequent to 1916 and prior to 11 July 1921 and to those persons not in possession of a certificate who satisfied the Minister for Defence that had they applied for a pension, their service was such as would have merited the award of a pension; (b) Medal without bar to persons who were members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann (Irish Republican Army) Fianna &Eacute;ireann, Cumann na mBan or the Irish Citizen Army for the three months ending 11 July 1921.</p><p>  The deceased person in question applied for a Service (1917-1921) Medal in August 1943 and a medal without bar was subsequently issued. The Military Service Pensions (Amendment) Act 1949, amongst other things, reopened the cases of applicants who had previously been rejected under the 1924 and 1934 Military Service Pensions Acts by allowing them to appeal against such rejections. The Military Service Pensions (Amendment) Act 1953 fixed 18 September 1953 as the latest date for appeals by way of petition under the 1949 Act. Correspondence was received on the applicant's behalf in 1954; however, no action could be taken as the closing date for petitions had passed. The Referee and Advisory Committee concluded its work in September 1958. In the circumstances, it will not be possible to further consider the issue of a service certificate under the 1934 Act in this case.</p></reply>

The European Council will discuss three clusters of issues. These are (a) increasing the effectiveness, visibility and impact of CSDP; (b) enhancing the development of defence capabilities; and, (c) strengthening Europe&rsquo;s defence industry. As part of Ireland's Presidency of the European Council, I hosted a seminar in Dublin Castle on 17 May, 2013, to discuss these issues. The seminar formed an integral part of the preparatory process of developing the agenda for the European Council discussion, with presentations from the European External Action Service, the European Defence Agency, the European Commission, Member States, academia and industry. In my own address, I underlined the importance of this Council meeting and the need for clarity and consensus at EU level to ensure that the EU can effectively respond to emerging international crises. I pointed out that achieving the EU's ambition in Common Security and Defence Policy requires a greater willingness amongst Member States to coordinate their efforts, rather than continuing to act individually. There is also a need to ensure that the Union has the requisite resources and military capabilities, able and willing to effectively respond to emerging international crises that could ultimately have an adverse effect on the EU and on the security of our States and our citizens. Having capabilities is one thing, but as I said at the seminar, the political will to deploy them is a key and missing component, which Heads of State and Government will need to address in December. I also pointed to the important role which the Defence Industry plays in support of jobs, growth, leading edge technology and innovation and, with a particular focus on our own national capacity, the contribution which SMEs can make in this regard. Contributors and participants had the opportunity to consider this and to debate the issues across the three clusters mentioned above.</p></reply>

This remains a very challenging situation for farmers and the extension to 24 May will allow both farmers and Co Ops to have some certainty around the supply of fodder over the coming weeks.

We should be maximising production in the coming period and I have asked Teagasc to prioritise this policy in their advisory campaigns over the summer months.  It is clear that the main cut of silage will be delayed this year and as a consequence we need to look at the potential for the growing of additional fodder later into the season.

The EU legislation has been transposed into national legislation via S.I. No. 357 of 2011 - European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011 (as amended).  Regulation 504/2008, which came into effect on 1 July 2009, provides that if an equine animal has not been identified within six months of the date of its birth, or by the 31<sup>st</sup> of December in the year of its birth, whichever date occurs later, it cannot be admitted to the food chain.  It also provides that all equine animals registered after that date<b></b>  must be identified with a passport and a microchip. </p><p>  At present, 9 Passport Issuing organisations are approved to issue passports in Ireland, including 3 Passport Issuing Organisations that issue passports for equidae that are ineligible for entry to studbooks.   Passports for equidae which qualify for registration with a breed society must be issued by the relevant breed society as provided for in Regulation 504/2008.</p><p>  I made an announcement in March that I would like to see the establishment of a single Passport Issuing Organisation, which would necessitate an amendment to EU legislation.  Subsequently, the EU Commission published an Action Plan for dealing with the fall-out from the horsemeat issue, indicating that it intended to submit a proposal to the Agriculture Council of Ministers and the European Parliament to amend existing legislation to provide that competent authorities take over responsibility for issuing passports. A formal Commission proposal is expected in the second half of 2013. I have indicated that I will move to the final stage in the establishment of a single Passport Issuing Agency once EU legislation provides me with the overarching legal base to put this into effect. In the meantime, my Department is engaged in discussions with the PIOs with a view to enhancing the controls on passports at all stages of the process, including veterinary certification, quality of the paper used, security features etc.  </p><p>  In line with a commitment I gave earlier in the year, my Department has taken significant steps to establish a central equine database on the Animal Identification and Movement [AIM] system which contains data on cattle, sheep and pigs.  The infrastructure for the central equine database is now in place.  The central equine database can be used to supplement the checks carried out by Department staff in the premises that slaughter equine animals, in particular to check that any horses presented for slaughter have been correctly identified and are eligible for slaughter for the human food chain. In addition, under new rules recently adopted, a keeper presenting a horse for slaughter must have a registered equine premises while keepers from outside the State are accommodated through the use of a generic herd number.  The database will be interrogated to check whether a horse presented for slaughter has originated in registered premises.  Aside from the usual Veterinary checks, the passport of an animal presented for slaughter is examined to ensure that it has not been tampered with, that the markings recorded on the passport match the animal and that the animal is eligible for entry to the human food chain.</p></reply>

My Department is complying with this statutory target for the employment of people with a disability.  The most recent data available shows that 3.3% of staff have declared that they have a disability; this corresponds to 114 employees within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>  My Department is committed to providing the supports necessary to enable staff with disabilities to participate fully in the workplace and it is also supportive of initiatives to provide work experience placements to people with disabilities.  The most recent initiative which my Department participated in is the Job Shadow Initiative, which is a project designed to bring people with disabilities and local employers together in the spirit of collaboration to enable job seekers explore the world of work.

A Cross Compliance inspection relating to the Single Farm Payment was carried out on the holding concerned on 27 February 2013. When conducting inspections, my Department&rsquo;s personnel take prevailing weather conditions into account.  For example, where the practice is to cut rushes and it has not been possible to top them in the current year, inspectors will take a broader assessment including whether there is evidence that they have been cut in previous years.</p><p>  During the course of this inspection, a parcel was identified where there was no evidence of grazing, cutting or topping having taken place for a number of years and rushes had become dominant as a result. Furthermore a second parcel of land was identified where severe poaching had occurred due to the out-wintering of cattle. As a result of these findings, a penalty of 5% has been recorded against the applicant&rsquo;s 2013 Direct Payments. The applicant was notified on 3 April 2013.  A request for a review of this decision has been received and is currently being examined. The applicant will be notified of the outcome of this review as soon as possible, which can, in turn, be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office within 3 months of the date of the review.</p><p>  The person named commenced REPS 4 in June 2008 and received payments for the first four years of their contract.  REPS 4 is a measure under the current 2007-13 Rural Development Programme and is subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications to be completed before any payments can issue.  These checks have now been completed for 2012 and the Year 5 75% payment amounting to &euro;5,400.82 issued for payment on 14 May 2013 less deductions of &euro;2,269.22 for penalties/reductions for over-claims on land declared and non-compliance with the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme.  The remaining Year 5 25% balancing payment amounting to &euro;2,556.68 issued for payment on 20 May 2013.</p><p>  Successive EU audits have made it absolutely clear that compliance with the Regulations must be strictly adhered to and that all administrative checks must be passed and eligibility conditions met before payment can issue.  If the person named is dissatisfied with the application of penalties in this instance, there is a &ldquo;right of appeal&rdquo; procedure to the Agriculture Appeals Office, Kilminchy Court, Portlaoise, Co. Laois.  The appeal must be made within three months of the date of notification of the penalties.</p></reply>

Operations in a total of four plants were suspended (in some cases on a voluntary basis) for varying periods arising from the investigation. Information in relation to activities by traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain outside of the jurisdiction has been passed to Europol and other Member States to facilitate continuing investigations in other countries.  </p><p>  My Department is considering the possibility of instituting legal proceedings where appropriate, as indicated in the report. It is important to note in that context that while some of the failures referred to in the report risked reputational damage to the Irish food sector, they did not breach EU or national law.  The fact is that the Irish authorities were the first to discover and disclose this problem of adulteration of beef products, which turned out to be a pan European problem. The investigation team worked closely with colleagues in other Member States, facilitating investigations in those countries. Exposure of this malpractice will result in improved consumer protection not just in Ireland, but also in the UK and elsewhere. We remain fully open to assisting any other Member State or entity with regard to ongoing investigations in other jurisdictions and will continue to do so in a transparent manner, as has been the practice throughout the equine DNA investigation.</p></reply>

The Food Harvest High Level Implementation Committee, which I chair, monitors progress and by end 2012, the value of overall primary production had risen by 21%, (2020 target 33%) and the value of exports had increased by 12%, (2020 target 42%).  By end 2010, the latest data available from the CSO, value added production had improved by 5.6%.</p><p>  I am aware that, like many other sectors, farmers can find it difficult to get credit due to the strict assessments introduced as a result of the global financial crisis.  I am, of course, also conscious of the effect on farmers&rsquo; incomes due to the increase in input costs as a result of the current fodder shortage. Consequently, I recently announced an extension of the imported fodder transport scheme for a further two weeks and the doubling of the fund to &euro;2 million.  To date some 30,000 tonnes of imported fodder have benefited from my Department&rsquo;s contribution.  This remains a very challenging situation for farmers and my Department is continuing to monitor the situation on a day-by-day basis.  </p><p>  My officials are in regular contact with farm bodies, various national banks and the Banking Federation concerning the availability of credit to farmers.  I am aware that a number of banks have designed new credit facilities specifically tailored for the agri-food sector in recent months. Also, despite the concerns expressed about lack of credit, a relatively small number of cases from the agri-food sector have come before the Credit Review Office.  My officials have assisted one of the farm organizations in explaining the work of the Credit Review Office, so that they can help their members in this regard. I would encourage farmers to make use of this system should they have difficulty in accessing credit.</p></reply>

The situation has prompted action by the wider industry and farm bodies, which is very welcome. In keeping the situation under constant review, I decided, given the ongoing shortages in some areas, to extend the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme to 24 May and to double the funding available to &euro;2 million. Simultaneously, my Department&rsquo;s Emergency Welfare System continues to respond to individual emergency situations. Fodder, eligible under the scheme and delivered into the country will be covered up to next Friday 24 May. I have also decided, as an exceptional measure, that any definite purchases that have been placed by that date, but which will be delivered during the following week, will be included under the scheme.</p><p>  I also decided that a formal request should again be made to the EU Commission seeking agreement to pay an advance from 16 October of the 2013 Single Farm Payment which, being the first day of the new EU financial year is the earliest potential payment date and almost two months ahead of the standard timeline. It will be recalled that my successful approach to Commissioner Ciolos for agreement to making an advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment was prompted by the very wet weather experienced throughout last summer.</p><p>My Department will continue to make every effort to ensure that payments under the 2013 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme commence as early as possible in September, while taking into account of the need to adhere to the requirement in the governing EU Regulation, which provides that all eligibility checks must be finalised before full payments can commence  .</p><p>  To date, over 29,300 of the remaining 30,200 REPS 4 participants have been paid a total of nearly &euro;170m in respect of the 2012 application period, with almost &euro;35m of this issuing in 2013. A further &euro;1m issued in the past week to REPS 4 farmers. Payments to the final 900 query cases are ongoing and are expected to be finalised shortly.</p><p>  Following the issue of over 2,000 AEOS payments valued at approximately &euro;3m over the last two weeks, a further &euro;700,000 will issue to nearly 300 more farmers in the next week. This will bring the total paid under AEOS 1 and 2 applicants to over &euro;40m in respect of the 2012 application period, &euro;15m of which issued in 2013 alone. </p></reply>

In particular, the NEWB has a key role to respond to instances where children are not attending school regularly, or where there is concern about a child's educational welfare. Supporting and promoting attendance, participation and retention are the core responsibilities of all staff and services working within the remit of the NEWB. The Board works closely with families and schools, and other agencies and services where appropriate, to ensure children have the benefit of professional collaboration and coordination in meeting their needs. </p><p>  The Education Welfare Service, and its network of Education Welfare Officers (EWOs), is a key resource for the Board in delivering on its statutory remit. EWOs have the statutory authority to enter schools during a school day to inspect the attendance records of a school. </p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 obliges schools to record and monitor attendances and to report absences to the EWO in specific circumstances; such as where a child is absent for 20 days or more, where a child is expelled or suspended for six days or more cumulatively, or where the principal of a school has concerns about the educational welfare of a child. I am advised by the NEWB that cases where there are significant concerns about any child's attendance at school, or where a child is identified as &#8220;at-risk&#8221; of persistent poor attendance or early school leaving, then these cases are prioritised by the Board. Accordingly, I will refer the matters raised by the Deputy to the NEWB for its appropriate attention.</p><p>  The NEWB also has strategic and operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme within its remit to deliver an integrated continuum of educational welfare services. The identified schools as well as others serving the children of Labre Park Travellers' Site receive support through projects of the School Completion Programme. The SCP projects support children identified by the Local Management Committees through the provision of a range of supports and interventions designed to retain young people in the formal education system to completion of senior cycle and to generally improve their school attendance, participation and retention.</p><p>  The NEWB participates on the Traveller Education Strategy Advisory and Consultative Forum, which is chaired by the Department of Education and Skills. The objective of the forum is to monitor implementation of the Traveller Education Strategy and to support traveller parents in their responsibilities to ensure their children remain in school and to develop mechanisms to improve educational outcomes for traveller children.</p><p>The NEWB has made significant progress towards delivering an integrated school support service on the principle of &#8220;<i>One Child, One Team, One Plan&quot;.</i>  This streamlined national approach to education support services will enhance the Board's support to schools, children and their families.</p></reply>

The decision to offer smear tests to women aged 25 and over was made following very careful consideration of the benefits to the population and the potential risks to individual women. This involved both Irish and international experts in cervical cancer and screening who examined international evidence and experience as part of the process.</p><p>  The recommendation from the International Agency on Cancer Research (IARC) is that effective population based cervical screening programmes should be aimed at women aged over 25 years. National cervical screening programmes in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England have all changed the screening age from 20 to 25 in recent years. This measure was taken to prevent too many young women undergoing unnecessary treatment and side effects. </p><p>  Changes in the cells of the cervix are extremely common in women under 25. In the vast majority of cases, these changes will settle and go back to normal by themselves. If the screening age was lowered to invite women under 25 for smear tests, young women could be subjected to unnecessary treatment that may have potential long-term negative effects on their health and fertility.</p><p>  Cancer of the cervix is extremely rare in women aged under 25. The average age in Ireland for the diagnosis of cervical cancer is 46. In 2010, 310 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer and of these women, just three were aged under 25.  </p><p>  I would encourage all women aged under 25 to be vigilant about their health and go immediately to their family doctor (GP) if they have any concerns or symptoms such as abnormal bleeding. In such cases, it is not a smear test through a screening programme that is needed, but a biopsy. Her GP will make arrangements for her to have one, through a hospital service. Early detection of cervical cancer, particularly in younger women, is important in effectively treating it.</p><p>  The best way to prevent cervical cancer in women younger than 25 is to encourage 12-18 year olds to avail of the free HPV vaccination being offered to all secondary schoolgirls. </p></reply>

Instead, funding under the Scheme was targeted at hospitals with the highest number of delayed discharges in an effort to alleviate pressure in Emergency Departments. The hospitals targeted were the Dublin Academic Teaching Hospitals (DATHs) and Cork University Hospital.</p><p>  It is understood that the HSE  re-commenced the chronological operation of the placement list with effect from 9th   May 2013.

All of these changes are designed to ensure that there will be no recurrence of this deception and that consumer protection measures are strengthened.   </p><p>  The Environment Food and Rural Affairs Committee (EFRA) of the UK House of Commons is chaired by Anne McIntosh MP.  Following the work of FSAI, the Committee began to inquire into food &quot;contamination&quot;, that is the undeclared presence of horsemeat in beef products.  The FSAI was invited to and did attend a meeting of the Committee on 23rd April 2013 to assist with its inquiries.  The Committee appears to have formed a theory that Ireland is mainly responsible for the adulteration of beef products with horsemeat and that the FSAI conducted its survey of beef products based on a &quot;tip off&quot;.  Both of these suppositions are incorrect.   </p><p>  The FSAI survey of beef products was a routine activity.  It was not based on a &quot;tip off&quot; or so called &quot;intelligence&quot;.  It was based on common sense and an understanding of the food chain which FSAI is required to police.  A brief examination of the notifications from the EU's Rapid Alert for Food and Feed (RASFF) on adulteration of meat products shows that at least 23 countries were the source of adulterated products and the raw materials used came from at least 14 of those countries.</p><p>  The EFRA Committee complained that the FSAI only informed the FSA UK about the results of its survey on 14th January 2013, the day before the FSAI issued its first press release on the subject.  It is important to note that the FSAI was careful to ensure that its survey results were reliable and scientifically sound.  Given the likely implications for trade and consumer confidence, FSAI was also careful not to be the source or cause of unfounded rumours about the authenticity of processed beef products.  For these reasons, the FSAI was only in a position to inform the food business operators and my Department after it validated confirmatory tests which were received late on Friday 11th January.  My Department advised me of the situation on Monday 14th January - the same day the Food Standards Agency (FSA) UK was informed.   </p><p>  The FSAI and the Food Standards Agency Northern Ireland (FSA NI) meet regularly and co-operate frequently on many levels, particularly in relation to food incidents.  During  2012 the FSAI and the FSA UK also had a number of meetings and discussions in relation to the slaughter of horses destined for the food chain.  On 23rd November 2012 at a scheduled meeting between the senior management teams of the FSAI  and the FSA NI , FSAI informed FSA NI of the survey work  which was in progress, and of the development of  test methodology for horse DNA.  FSAI also informed FSA UK's chief scientist on 10th January that authenticity checks on beef products were under way.   </p><p>  At all times the FSAI has communicated all relevant information on the outcome of the investigation to the food safety regulatory agencies across Europe (including the UK) and to Europol, the European policing agency.  The FSAI does not accept the factually inaccurate and unfounded allegations being made by Anne McIntosh MP.  Criminal investigations are under way across Europe by appropriate authorities and prosecutions may follow.  The FSAI  and the FSA UK have been collaborating with each other on this issue.  Catherine Brown, CEO, FSA UK said at the EFRA Committee hearing on 14th May that there was no outstanding information from the FSAI.  However,  a number of enquiries to the UK authorities are still outstanding in relation to the role of a number of UK based companies which were significant suppliers of beef to processing companies in Ireland.</p><p>  It is worth noting when the FSAI initiated the testing of the authenticity of the beef products, neither the FSA UK nor any other food control body including private inspection bodies were carrying out such  checks on beef products for the presence of horsemeat.  To conclude I would again emphasise that the FSAI considers there is no risk to consumer health associated with the identification of horse meat in certain beef burger products.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has taken primary responsibility as the key issues concern labelling, traceability and potential fraud of meat products.  More than 23 EU countries are now involved and investigations by the authorities are ongoing across Europe.</p></reply>

It is difficult to carry out a comparison of subvention levels between transport authorities internationally for a number of reasons, some of which are: the subvention payments for the bus mode is not normally separated out from the other modes such as light and heavy rail and is usually presented as the subvention for all the public transport in the particular region; some transport operators and authorities report transport revenues as a single item and don&rsquo;t identify the revenue associated with subvention; some transport authorities centralise the marketing and customer facing activity which doesn&rsquo;t get reflected in the provision to operators.</p><p>  The 2009 Deloitte Report, Cost and Efficiency Review of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann highlighted that grants and subsidies to other comparable  bus operations outside Ireland  varied greatly. The Report also noted that it was more difficult  to identify comparable operators for Bus &Eacute;ireann  given their mix of services.</p><p>  While the Deloitte Report is frequently cited as providing a Europe-wide comparison of PSO levels to bus operators, this is not the case and it is wrong to represent the study as such. The Deloitte Report compared the PSO provided to Dublin Bus to the subsidises provided to operators in Brussels, Zurich, Amsterdam, Lyon and London and in the case of Bus &Eacute;ireann,  compared the PSO received by it to national operators in the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland.</p><p>  Despite the limitations in developing such analyses, I am advised that on the basis of recent research undertaken on behalf of the National Transport Authority (NTA), the subvention levels for operations similar to Bus &Eacute;ireann vary between 32% and 70%. This is based on a comparison of subvention levels in 4 countries, namely, Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland.</p><p>  If the Public Service Obligation payment is the only subsidy considered, the subvention to Bus &Eacute;ireann in 2012 was 34% of their total PSO revenues. However if the payment for the Free Travel Scheme is included, 45% of Bus &Eacute;ireann revenues are subsidised by the State. This places Bus &Eacute;ireann in the low to middle of the range of subsidy payments of those countries compared.</p></reply>
