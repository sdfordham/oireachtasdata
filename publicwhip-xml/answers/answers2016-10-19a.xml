It was informed by the macro-economic and fiscal parameters set out in the Summer Economic Statement. </p><p>My Department also published a Mid-Year Expenditure Report in July.  This new Report set out the detailed expenditure context for Budget 2017, including baseline pre-Budget Ministerial Expenditure Ceilings for all Departments. This report provided the starting point for the examination by the Oireachtas of budgetary priorities for 2017.</p><p>The Minister for Finance and I met with the Committee on Budgetary Oversight in advance of the presentation of the Estimates to the House, to discuss budgetary priorities.  The Committee published its report on Budget 2017 on 3 October which has been responded to, in respect of expenditure issues, in the Expenditure Report 2017 and in summary form on the Budget 2017 website. </p><p>The commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government to develop a process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights is key to the issue of equality-proofing expenditure decisions also discussed in FLAC's response.  </p><p>In this regard, my Department has already developed a new Social Impact Assessment Framework designed to focus on the impacts of public expenditure on recipient households.  In addition to publishing a detailed paper on the overall Framework on the Budget 2017 website , a social impact assessment of Targeted Childcare Schemes and the General Medical Services Scheme were also published. This work will compliment the existing ex-post impact assessment conducted by the Departments of Finance and Social Protection using the SWITCH model to assess the impact of the main tax and social welfare measures in the Budget.  The most recent SWITCH model analysis, conducted by the ESRI and published in the Irish Times last week, found that the greatest gains in Budget 2017 are in the lowest income quintile,<font color="#2F2F2F">driven largely by the welfare rate increases in the Budget.</font></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-19a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016101900077#WRA01000"><p>There is a substantial increase of &euro;1.9bn in Gross Voted Expenditure in the Estimates for 2017.  This represents an increase of almost 3.5 per cent.  As well as including &euro;0.9bn for various expenditure pre-commitments such as demographic related expenditure pressures and the Lansdowne Road Agreement, there was &euro;1bn allocated for additional measures.  These measures include:- additional staffing in Health, Justice and Education;- progressing the Action Plan for Housing in 2017; and - the introduction of a new single Affordable Childcare Scheme and a number of increases to Social Welfare rates. </p><p>While in technical terms, Ireland's General Government Expenditure as a percentage of GDP is projected to decrease - from an estimated 28.3% in 2016 to 27.8% in 2017 - a number of significant factors need to be taken into account in assessing this trend.</p><p>The recent revisions to Ireland's GDP level for 2015 published by the CSO highlight that the ratio set out above must be interpreted with very significant caution.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the recent report of the D&aacute;il Committee on Budgetary Oversight - which highlighted the limitations in key macroeconomic variables to accurately reflect developments in the economy in light of the scale of these revisions.  Indeed, the Department of Finance warn in Budget 2017 documentation using inflated national accounts figures as a basis for future policy commitments.<font color="#2F2F2F">  </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Furthermore, given Ireland's relatively young population, adjusting for the demographic profile of the population also impacts on comparisons with other European countries.</font>This is illustrated on page 14 of the Mid-Year Expenditure Report which shows adjusted public expenditure in Ireland 2014 (as a % of GNI) being above the EU average when account is taken of defence and age-related expenditure.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Finally, account should also be taken of the severity of Ireland's public finance crisis relative to that in most other EU countries.</font></p><p>Budget 2017 marks the third year in succession that gross voted expenditure has been increased.  The focus over the coming years must continue to be on moderate, sustainable increases.  In this fiscal context, the ongoing review and evaluation of existing programmes and expenditure, rather than targeting a certain expenditure to GDP ratio, can better support effective delivery of public services.</p></reply>

From 1 November 2013 pre and post-2011 pay scales were merged into a single consolidated scale applicable to each grade. Generally, the third point of 1 November 2013 payscale is equivalent to the first point of scale of the pre 2011 scale. </p>  <p>  The Lansdowne Road Agreement provides the mechanism through which outstanding issues of concern to new recruits to the public service can be addressed in a negotiated way.  This is reflected in the  recent agreement between my Department, D/Education and Skills, the INTO and the TUI in respect of new entrant teacher pay restoration . Contingent on the introduction of certain reform measures, a new incremental salary scale will be developed which is designed to address the current difference in pay for teachers recruited since 1 February 2012.  The revised salary arrangement will be implemented in two phases on 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018. The effect of this will be to assimilate all post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 new entrants to teaching onto a single new salary scale which will incorporate the honours primary degree allowance.  This new arrangement will apply to members of the teachers  unions which have signed up to the Lansdowne Road Agreement (INTO and TUI).</p>  <p>  The Government is wholly committed to the implementation of the Lansdowne Road Agreement as the most appropriate way for progress to be made on pay restoration and reform of our public services into the future.  This agreement shows how the LRA can resolve issues of concern for our public servants.</p></reply>

It provides a framework for the application of best practice and is intended to take account of developments in respect of oversight, reporting requirements and the appointment of Board members.  The Code is based on the underlying principles of good governance: accountability, transparency, probity and a focus on the sustainable success of the organisation over the longer term.</p><p>The updated code outlines the respective responsibilities of the Board, Chairperson, parent Department and Minister, it also outlines the role of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Code also provides that the term of a contract of a CEO is normally<b></b>limited to a single contract period of between five and seven years but there is no maximum length of service for CEO's. </p><p>The updated code can be found at the following link: </p></reply>

These sites are operated either on a full-time or a seasonal basis and include nationally and internationally known locations such as Newgrange, Clonmacnoise and the Rock of Cashel.  OPW also facilitates public access at about 300 open National Monument sites such as Carrigafoyle Castle where visitors are free to enjoy sites on an unaccompanied basis.  Given that these sites are unmanned, it is difficult to be precise about the number of visitors.  However there is no doubt that they form an important part of the Cultural and Heritage offering to tourists all around the country.</p>  <p>  The cost of presenting Guided Heritage sites represents a considerable commitment by the State, the direct wage costs alone for which will amount to over &euro;7.3m in 2016.  Obviously OPW cannot hope to maintain a full Guided presence at all locations.  At unmanned sites the objective is to provide site safety so that visitors can enjoy them in their natural state.  As the Deputy is aware, the Carrigafoyle Castle site is in a semi ruinous condition and safe access is not feasible to all parts.  Additionally, it should be borne in mind that the nature of the location and the underfoot conditions at certain times of the year, and in certain light levels, mean that it is not always feasible for visitors to walk the site.  Taking everything into consideration, including staff costs and demands on resources elsewhere, it is not proposed to provide a guide service to this particular Monument at this time.</p></reply>

A further consideration is the ability of contracting authorities to effectively monitor compliance with the social clause.  This may be more difficult where some of the work is to be performed in another Member State.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that a revised set of EU Directives governing public procurement was transposed into Irish law last May. There is now greater scope and legal clarity in relation to the use of social criteria in the context of an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.</p><p>In this context, the Office of Government Procurement is assessing the scope for the use of such clauses and will be developing practical guidance to assist contracting authorities using procurement as a driver of wider public policy goals such as sustainability, where appropriate.</p></reply>

This exceeds the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government in which the Government committed to a split of at least 2:1 and reflects the Government's commitment to rebuilding and investing in public services.</p>  <p>  Despite the significant increase in gross voted expenditure outlined above for 2017, Ireland's General Government Expenditure as a percentage of GDP is projected to decrease from 28.3% in 2016 to 27.8% in 2017. It is therefore important when comparing spending in public services relative to the rest of the European Union to take account of the basis for the comparison as this can have a significant impact. The Deputy will appreciate that the recent revisions to Ireland's GDP level published by the CSO highlight that the ratio set out above must be interpreted with very significant caution taking account of the exceptional factors impacting on the measurement of GDP for Ireland. Indeed, the Department of Finance has included an alternate analysis in the Budget 2017 documentation warning against using this inflated figure as a basis for future policy commitments. Furthermore, given Ireland's relatively young population, adjusting for the demographic profile of the population can also impact on the comparisons with other European Countries. This is illustrated on page 14 of the  Mid-Year Expenditure Report which shows adjusted public expenditure in  Ireland 2014 (as a % of GNI) being above the EU average when  account is taken of defence and age-related expenditure.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, for the third consecutive year, the Government was in a position to allocate significant additional resources to public spending with a &euro;1.9bn increase in Gross Voted Expenditure compared to 2016. As well as including &euro;0.9bn for various expenditure pre-commitments such as demographic related costs and the Lansdowne Road Agreement, there was &euro;1bn allocated for additional measures including: additional staffing in Health, Justice and Education; progressing the Action Plan for Housing in 2017; the introduction of a new single Affordable Childcare Scheme; and a number of increases to Social Welfare rates.</p></reply>

To ensure that the independence of the process was preserved, I also appointed a retired High Court Judge, Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy, to oversee the preparation of summaries and recommendations in the notification letters of the outcome of the process.

This Part, comprising sections 7 to 36, deals with the establishment of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, its membership, appointment, functions, staffing and other matters including disqualification or removal from membership. The Authority comprises eleven members of whom a majority, including the Chairperson, are to be lay persons. </p>  <p>  The selection process is intentionally built around a framework of ten prescribed nominating bodies set out in section 9 of the 2015 Act. This framework was introduced by the Government by way of ensuring the independence of the new Regulatory Authority in terms of both its appointment and its functions. It also seeks to represent a balance of interests, in the membership of the Authority, between legal practitioners and those clients who avail of their services.</p>  <p>  The ten bodies concerned are, the Citizens Information Board; An t&Uacute;daras um Ard-Oideachas; the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission; the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission; the Institute of Legal Costs Accountants; the Consumers Association of Ireland; The Bar Council; the Legal Aid Board; the Honorable Society of the King&rsquo;s Inns and Law Society. The Law Society has two nominees reflecting the fact that solicitors outnumber barristers being regulated under the 2015 Act by five to one &ndash; upwards of 10,000 practising solicitors as compared to upwards of 2,000 practising barristers.</p>  <p>  Each of the prescribed nominating bodies puts forward one primary and one substitute nominee for consideration for membership of the Regulatory Authority under the terms and criteria set out in the 2015 Act. This includes by reference to their relevant expertise as set out in section 9(3) and with regard to the objective of there being no fewer than four members who are women and four members who are men under section 9 (6). This is with the exception of the Law Society which, again because of the ratio of solicitors practising in the State which I have just mentioned, puts forward one nominee of each sex.</p>  <p>   While members of the new Regulatory Authority are duly appointed by the Government under these procedures, under section 9 (2)(a) of the 2015 Act, a resolution approving such appointment has first to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Resolutions of both Houses approving members of the Authority were passed in July 2016 with resolutions concerning one remaining alternative nominee passed by the Houses last week. Once the required resolutions of approval have been passed the Government formally appoints the members of the Authority.</p>  <p>  The ten prescribed nominating bodies, therefore, put forward their nominees under the procedures set out in Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, as appropriate to their functions and objectives as may be set out, in each case, under legislation or under common law. It will, therefore, be for each of those bodies, in the first instance, to identify their nominees for membership of the new Regulatory Authority under their applicable internal governance procedures. It is, for example, for the Council of the Bar of Ireland, as a private body, to competently conduct the indoor management of the Council and to oversee the conduct of its own business in accordance with its own rules and procedures.</p></reply>

Article 41.3.2 (iii) of the Constitution provides that a court may only grant a dissolution of marriage only where it is satisfied that "such provision as the court considers proper having regard to the circumstances exists or will be made for the spouses and any children of either or both of them and any other person prescribed by law".  </p>  <p>  The Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 allows the courts to make proper provision for affected parties by means of orders in areas such as maintenance, property, pensions, periodical payments, lump sums and financial compensation. As the financial circumstances of the parties may change over time, section 22 of the Act provides that any of the parties may apply to court for variation or discharge of previous orders which were made in relation to the divorce. </p>  <p>  There are no current proposals to hold a referendum in relation to amendment of Article 41.3.2 (iii) of the Constitution in order to provide for "clean break" divorce.</p></reply>

The EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.</p><p>The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and the need to provide for adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  These are considered by insurance companies on a case by case basis.</p><p>My Department has embarked on a review of policy in the insurance sector which is being undertaken in consultation with the Central Bank and other Departments and Agencies. The objective of the Review is to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector.</p><p>As part of that Review, I have established the Cost of Insurance Working Group, chaired by the Minister of State Eoghan Murphy T.D.  This Working Group is examining the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance and identifying what short-term, medium-term and long-term measures can be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  The Working Group, which is focussing initially on the issues of rising motor insurance premiums, is due to provide me with an initial set of recommendations at the end of this month. From November to December, the Working Group will then develop an action plan to enable the relevant Government Departments and Offices to commence the implementation of these priority actions. It is my view that the implementation of the action plan  will also have an impact on other areas of  non-life insurance. </p><p>The core areas to be examined by the Working Group in the first phase are:</p><p>-  The motor insurance sector generally, at present and in recent years</p><p>-  The effects of legal costs and litigation processes on insurance costs</p><p>-  The current claims compensation arrangements and the cost of claims</p><p>-  Insurance data and information</p><p>-  The impact of accident rates</p><p>-  The impact of unlawful activity on the insurance sector, and</p><p>-  Other market issues.</p><p>A number of additional issues which impact on consumers and the business sector in relation to motor insurance are also being considered, including the cost of insurance to taxi drivers and hackneys.The Working Group on the Cost of Insurance has met with the National Transport Authority and with taxi driver representatives as part of the consultation process.  I am satisfied that issues facing the taxi industry are being considered as part of this cost of insurance review process.</p></reply>

To this end, Rebuilding Ireland- Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, under the direction of Minister Coveney and the Department of Housing, Planning Community and Local Government, with cross Departmental support including from the Department of Finance, was launched in July.</p>  <p>  This comprehensive Action Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector. While the primary focus of the Action Plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time-bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector, pending the delivery of the structural elements of the Action Plan.</p>  <p>  My officials considered the potential impact of the "Help to Buy" incentive, as part of their analysis of the proposal and the design of the relevant parameters of the incentive. Given the critical nature of the housing crisis and the urgency with which a Governmental response was required, there was insufficient time to commission an independent impact assessment in relation to this measure.</p></reply>

CBAs form a key element of the new Junior Cycle.  Therefore, students who are taught by a teacher who is a member of the ASTI will not receive a grade for their CBAs and also since the written Assessment Task which is to be completed by students is linked to the second CBA, which is worth 10% of the marks for the final examination, these students cannot complete the Assessment Task, or gain marks for this examination component. Candidates for Junior Cycle English in 2017 who do not complete the assessment task can only be marked and graded based on a maximum of 90% of the available marks.</p>  <p>  Given the very unfair position in which the ASTI directive now places teachers and students of English, my Department has been seeking to positively engage with ASTI to find a solution.  </p>  <p>  It is unprecedented for a second level teachers union to proceed with an industrial action that directly impacts on State examination students in this way.  I am sure that this was not the original intention of the directive, but ASTI&lsquo;s failure to date to lift the directive so that some current third year students of English are not disadvantaged is unacceptable and flies in the face of a longstanding code of honour in respect of the timing and nature of industrial action to avoid disrupting State examination students.  ASTI need to immediately suspend their directive to allow these students to complete their Assessment Task.  This suspension can be without prejudice to discussions in the meantime between the Department and ASTI on issues of concern that they may wish to have addressed.</p>  <p>  My Department has formally requested the ASTI to provide an immediate derogation from their directive regarding the CBAs for current teachers of English, while talks between my Department and the union proceed, in order that some current third year English students are no longer unfairly and unjustifiably disadvantaged</p></reply>

Legal advice provided to my Department indicates that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to: &ndash; </p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs. </p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP). </p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan. </p><p>- an independent appeals process. </p><p>Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who might qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The NCSE published a Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act in 2006. This report concluded that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.</p><p>My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. </p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement remaining sectors of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted. The level of additional expenditure required would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Accordingly it is not possible to provide an accurate breakdown of the areas in which these costs would be incurred. </p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>These reports include the NCSE policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools, published in 2013, and the Report of the Working Group on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for pupils with Special Educational Needs, published in 2014. </p><p>The alternative model was piloted in 47 schools during 2015/16 school year and the effectiveness of the pilot is currently being reviewed. This review will allow us to take into account the learning experiences of schools, principals, pupils and the views of parents over the course of the pilot. </p><p>It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice. </p><p>Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, I have also committed to consulting with stakeholders to see how best to progress sections of the EPSEN Act that were introduced on a non-statutory basis.</p><p>Following the recent Budget I announced that I would be introduction a new model for the allocation of resources teachers in schools from September 2017. My Department has also introduced measures to provide for educational plans to be prepared for all students accessing Special Needs Assistant support.  </p></reply>

The plan is expected to include targeted measures in the area of:  </p><p>- Supporting School leadership </p><p>- Developing Networks and clusters for DEIS teachers and schools </p><p>- Supporting new teaching methodologies. There is evidence that, for example changing the way literacy is taught to children who struggle can achieve major improvements in results </p><p>- Exploring ways in which the work of schools can be better integrated with other state supports within the community.</p><p>The results of mainstreaming will be carefully monitored before any decisions around mainstreaming are considered.</p><p>As you know no new school has been included in DEIS since 2009, now a new assessment framework is being developed using centrally held CSO and DES data for the identification of new schools for inclusion. The number of schools to be included in the programme will be determined by this proposed new identification process which will assess all schools in the country, including those not currently participating in DEIS. It will not be necessary for schools to make an application. </p><p>Implementation of actions arising from the Plan for Educational Inclusion will begin in the 2017/18 school year, and will be a continuing theme in our wider Annual Action Plan for Education. </p></reply>

The NCSE has also advised that the current model can lead to unnecessary labelling of children from a young age.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has proposed a new resource teaching allocation model which will, when introduced, remove the formal requirement for diagnostic assessment to access additional support and which will provide resources to schools based on school profiles.</p>  <p>  A pilot of this new model was conducted in 47 primary and post primary schools over the course of the 2015/16 school year.</p>  <p>   A review of this pilot has been completed and a report of the review is currently being finalised. I understand that the review will indicate that the new model has been positively received by schools and parents.</p>  <p>  Schools indicated that they welcomed the increased flexibility and autonomy provided by the model to allocate resources based on need. Most schools believe the model allows more scope for team teaching, targeted interventions, mix of in-class and group work, with less focus on withdrawal and one to one teaching. Schools welcome the move away from the unnecessary labelling of children in order to secure resources. Schools also welcomed that they no longer need to wait for diagnosis and that this facilitates intervention at an earlier stage based on the schools identification of need. In addition schools indicated a belief that they were broadly well supported in meeting the needs of children with Special Educational Needs.</p>  <p>  As part the recent Budget announcements, I therefore announced that following development and piloting over the past number of years, a new model for the allocation of teaching resources for children with special educational needs will be implemented from September 2017. </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;18 million will be provided in 2017 to provide for around 900 resource teacher posts.  Further details regarding implementation of the new model will be announced in the coming months.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-19a.189.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016101900080#WRD03700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 84 together. </p>  <p>  The overall concern in recent years has been to protect the value of weekly social welfare rates.  Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7 billion, is the largest block of expenditure in my Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement. As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually. This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years. The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy. </p>  <p>  The conditions for the State pension (contributory) are reviewed on an ongoing basis, and there have been a number of changes over the years which impact upon whether someone qualifies or not.  The main such changes in recent years are as follows: </p>  <p>  1.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided for the necessary amendments to increase the State pension age in line with the National Pensions Framework as set out in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  It provided for an increase in the age for qualification for the State Pension from 66 years to 67 years from 2021, and a further increase to 68 years from 2028.  It also discontinued the State Pension (Transition) for new claimants with effect from 1 January 2014. </p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million. While its abolition would not realise that saving in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments (although at a lower rate than that of the State pension), and some may have claimed an Increase for a  Qualified Adult on their spouses&rsquo; pensions, it is estimated that well over half of that cost may have been saved each year as a result of this measure. </p>  <p>  It is estimated that the net saving in 2017 is likely to be in the region of &euro;75-80 million.</p>  <p>  2.  &ldquo;Developing the National Pensions System &ndash; Final Report of the National Pensions Board&rdquo; published in 1993, recommended that the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a contributory pension should be increased to 520 (i.e. 10 years) and the necessary legislation to effect these recommendations was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997 which provided for their implementation in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised at 260 from 2002, rising to 520 from April 2012. </p>  <p>  At the time this measure was introduced, the Exchequer annual savings were expected to be in the region of &euro;6m per annum in the short term, but rising substantially on a cumulative basis in the long term.  </p>  <p>  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced, replacing the bands which had been in place since 2000.  While this does not impact upon whether someone qualifies for a State pension, it may impact upon the rate new claimants qualify for, and in some cases may result in them claiming an alternative payment.  The effect of this was to reduce the rate of State pension (contributory) attracted by those on lower yearly averages.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that the exchequer savings arising from the current rate bands (relative to the ones in place from 2000-2012) will be at least &euro;50 million in 2017, and that this will rise at a rate of some &euro;10m annually.</p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a full rate State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;222, which is 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if a person&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;209, which is 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory).</p>  <p>  There has, in recent years, been a significant increase in the number of people receiving a State pension. It is not possible to state the numbers of people who do not qualify as a result of particular changes in criteria, as a significant number would not, as a consequence, enter the State pension system.  Some, for example, might be the spouse of a public service pensioner with a significant income, and might not qualify for a means-tested payment.  If such people do not claim a State pension (contributory) or an alternative, their circumstances would not generally be part of the statistics available to my Department. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

CIB delivers on this remit through a network of delivery partners which includes 51 local Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS) and 42 local Citizens Information Services (CIS).  In 2016, CIB has a budget allocation of &euro;50m from the Department of Social Protection, of which &euro;20.6m is allocated to MABS and &euro;14.8m is allocated to CIS.I want to reassure the Deputy that the Government is committed to maintaining and, where appropriate, strengthening the local services delivered by the CIS and MABS.  I acknowledge the cooperation of MABS in implementing the recently extended range of supports and services available to borrowers in serious mortgage arrears under a series of Government initiatives, most recently through ABHAILE, the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service.  Similarly, I want to acknowledge the developments on the CIS side in relation to advocacy.  These MABS and CIS developments are funded and supported by my Department, including through the provision of additional staffing and other resources where required.  This demonstrates my ongoing support for MABS and CIS, and my commitment to investment in local, enhanced service availability for citizens.</p><p>While local CIS and MABS services are well regarded in their respective communities, particularly by those who need and use their services, there is nonetheless a need to streamline and improve the governance arrangements for this large number of companies, which will include a reduction in the overall number of Boards of Management.  The existing structure comprises 93 independent local companies (51 MABS and 42 CISs), under the remit of CIB, each with separate voluntary Boards of Management, comprising an average of 9.2 members serving.  This results in a governance structure of over 850 people, with 93 companies operating individual administration systems and processes, such as payroll and financial systems.  There is a significant administrative and resource effort required to continue to support such a model, and opportunities for greater efficiencies in the use of public funds and staff resources exist, including the delivery of enhancing frontline services for citizens.</p><p>An independent report in 2014, followed by consultation with the services and work by a design group resulted in a restructuring proposal for a regional model for MABS, reducing the number of companies from fifty one to six, and for CIS, reducing the number of companies from forty two to six.  The proposal has recently been considered by the Board of CIB which has decided to establish a Restructuring Sub Committee comprising a number of CIB Board members, a number of staff of CIB, and representatives of the service delivery partners CIS and MABS, to develop an optimal regional structure for the network of companies together with an implementation plan.  The Sub Committee is due to report back to the Board of CIB in early 2017.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that, irrespective of the regional structure chosen, there will be no diminution of locally provided services to the public, no closure of service locations, and no staff redundancies.  In fact, the aim of this Board restructuring is to ensure that any efficiencies and savings achieved in governance arrangements can be used to expand and enhance local service delivery.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Our Embassy in Washington and Consulates elsewhere in the US are very active in advocating for immigration reform, while the issue is also regularly addressed in high level political contacts between Ireland and the US Government.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach discussed the prospects for immigration reform with Vice President Biden during his visit to Ireland in July.  While in Washington for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, the Taoiseach and I met President Obama, Vice President Biden, Speaker Ryan, Senator Chuck Schumer and other key Congressional contacts from both sides of the aisle.  During these meetings we emphasised the plight of the undocumented Irish in the US and encouraged both Houses of Congress to work on a bipartisan basis towards a comprehensive package of immigration reform measures.</p>  <p>  I also availed of my visit to New York for the United Nations General Assembly last month to meet Irish community leaders in the United States, to discuss with them the prospects for achieving immigration reform and to reassure them of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the issue.  In addition, Minister of State McHugh met representatives of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, representing a broad group of Irish centres across the United States, in New York on 20 September.  That meeting was also attended by Senator Billy Lawless of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  The Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our Embassy in Washington continue to work closely with Irish American community leaders in actively pursuing all viable opportunities to advance immigration reform.  While there is little prospect of comprehensive reform being achieved within the lifetime of the current Congress, our Ambassador and Embassy staff are working with their contacts on both sides of the political aisle to prepare the basis for a renewed initiative once a new Administration and Congress have been established in Washington DC.</p></reply>

GCC wrote to the OPW in September 2016 setting out its proposals in this regard.  The OPW, in reply, confirmed its agreement in principle to the advancement of a potential scheme for South Galway and to provide any technical assistance that the Council may require as the Council will be the Contracting Authority in this case.   Specific funding arrangements have not been set out as it is too early in the process.  Once the tendering process for the required consultants has been completed the Council will revert to the OPW in relation to specific funding requests before entering into any contractual agreements.  If approved, funding will be provided to the Council for the appointment of the consultants to examine options and develop potential solutions to deal with the problem and to undertake any surveys which may be required.  Due to the particular geological and ecological characteristics of the area, the development of a possible scheme will be more complex than is normally the case with a flood relief scheme.  The study area has yet to be defined and agreed and so a map of the area cannot be provided at this time.  The Council will prepare a map outlining the extent of the study area as part of the procurement process for consultants.  Subject to a viable scheme emerging which is both cost beneficial and environmentally acceptable and which meets with general public acceptance, the Council may request confirmation of funding arrangements from OPW to undertake its construction. </p>  <p>  As part of the investigation into the problem there will be significant consultation with statutory bodies and the general public during the course of the scheme development where input and knowledge from the local community will be considered very important.  If a viable solution emerges it will have to be brought forward through planning either under the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Acts or the Planning and Development Regulations at which stage the public will have every opportunity to make further submissions on the proposals.</p></reply>

In summary, when a member dies after retirement, a spouse's pension of one-half of the former member's pension is payable.  Dependent children are also entitled to a child's pension of one-third of the spouse's pension for each of the first three eligible children.</p>  <p>  The original pre 1984 scheme did not allow for the payment of a pension to a spouse who married or had children post retirement.  Thus, the scheme allowed a refund of contributions if the individual had not been married up to the point of retirement.</p>  <p>  In 1984, a revised Scheme which extended eligibility for benefits to spouses who married or had children after retirement was introduced and members of the original scheme and certain retirees were given the option of transferring to the revised Scheme.</p>  <p>  One of the benefits of the Revised Scheme was that the spouse of a post retirement marriage was eligible for a spouse's pension.  The disadvantage of the Scheme was that there was no facility for repayment of contributions on retirement if the individual concerned did not have a spouse and would not therefore be in a position to avail of any benefit under the Scheme.</p>  <p>  For members who remained in the original Scheme there was an entitlement to claim a refund of contributions in the event that the member remained unmarried at the date of retirement.  Many members of the scheme availed of this option and received a refund.</p>  <p>  Members of the Spouses' and Children's Contributory Pension Scheme regardless of their marital status i.e. persons in civil partnerships or those in opposite or same sex marriages are not discriminated under any aspect of the public service pension schemes.</p>  <p>  Public service spouses' and children's schemes are structured on a group insurance basis and the member contribution rates take account of the fact that payment of benefits will not arise in respect of all members.  On that basis I have no plans to review the scheme at present.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-19a.253.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016101900081#WRE04600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 to 109, inclusive, and 111 to 114, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  Reviewing voted expenditure for the current year, gross voted expenditure of &euro;39,836 million to end-September was &euro;439 million (1.1%) below profile, with gross voted current expenditure &euro;364 million (1.0%) below profile and gross voted capital expenditure &euro;76 million (3.4%) below profile.  In relation to specific areas of an infrastructural nature which might require extra expenditure, as set out in the Expenditure Report 2017, it is estimated that an additional &euro;200 million of capital funding will be required for necessary repair work to transport infrastructure arising from flood damage at the start of the year and for expenditure arising from the rescheduling of school building works.  This was signalled in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report in July and the inclusion of this capital expenditure in the revised expenditure ceiling for 2016 was set out in the Expenditure Report published last week.</p>  <p>  Over the last number of years, my Department had a key role in ensuring Ireland met or exceeded its key fiscal targets in each year of the EU/IMF programme of financial support resulting in a successful exit from the programme in December 2013 and from the Excessive Deficit Procedure at the end of 2015.  Sustainable public finances will remain essential for continued economic and social progress.  The reformed Stability and Growth Pact will also be an important aspect of budgetary planning in the future, ensuring a closer alignment of expenditure growth with the medium-term potential growth rate of the economy.</p>  <p>  There is an ongoing requirement to implement reforms that improve how public services are delivered, and that achieve savings which can be reinvested in frontline services.  The Public Service has delivered significant productivity gains and service improvements over the last number of years, as set out in the Annual Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan (published April 2016).  We must build on this progress, and it is essential that targeted recruitment and investment in public services is done in tandem with further public service reform measures.  This includes, for example, more digital delivery of services, improved customer service and business processes, and greater use of shared services.  When Departments identify savings arising from such reform measures, such savings are in general made available to Departments to reinvest in the delivery of services.  It is also very important to ensure that the public service workforce operates in a manner which maximises the positive impact on public service provision of the increased numbers announced in the Estimates for 2017.</p>  <p>  In my Statement on the Expenditure Estimates on Budget day I announced that a spending review will take place in advance of Budget 2018.  It is anticipated that this review will provide more policy options on a number of Government priorities.  As set out in the Expenditure Report 2017, between 2014 and 2017, gross voted expenditure is forecast to grow by 9%.  This is in comparison to three year expenditure growth figures of between 26% and 57% experienced in the 1999 to 2008 period.  A return to such unsustainable levels of increase is not possible.  Therefore, with an ongoing requirement for cost restraint, the systematic examination of baseline expenditure is required to ensure that resources are directed towards emerging and agreed public service priorities.</p>  <p>  Policy decisions for a wide variety of expenditure items are informed by an ongoing level of analysis.  An example of this is the work carried out by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES).  Several policy papers were published alongside Budget 2017 and are available on the Budget.gov.ie website.  Furthermore, a review of the Capital Plan will take place in 2017.  While the final details of the process for the review are currently being put in place, previously this type of process has involved rigorous analysis, both internally in my Department as well as in other Government Departments, on how best to allocate our scarce capital resources in order to achieve the best value for money while also meeting the Government's priorities for economic and social progress.  As set out in the Mid-year Expenditure Report, the Government is committed to investing a further &euro;5.14 billion in the period 2017 to 2021, over and above the amounts included in the Capital Plan published in September last year.  The first part of this additional amount is reflected in the allocations for 2017 set out in the Budget Estimates.</p>  <p>  Regarding the issue of Departmental allocations being sufficient, Budget 2017 represents the third consecutive year in which the Government was in a position to allocate additional resources to public spending. Gross voted expenditure in 2017 is to increase by &euro;1.9 billion compared to 2016.  As well as including &euro;0.9 billion for various expenditure pre-commitments such as demographic related costs and the Lansdowne Road Agreement, there was &euro;1 billion allocated for additional measures including: additional staffing in Health, Justice and Education; progressing the Action Plan for Housing in 2017; the introduction of a new single Affordable Childcare Scheme; and a number of increases to Social Welfare rates.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate in light of the foregoing, that a series of important measures are in place or being planned in order to ensure that, for the future, that is an intensified ongoing focus on the totality of resources allocated to current and capital public spending, rather than on the proportionately small volume of additional new resources available for funding service developments announced at budget time.</p></reply>

Most recently, the new four year Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association provides for an annual downward only price realignment which will ensure that the prices of medicines in Ireland continue to reduce in line with price reductions across the reference countries. This Agreement is expected to deliver savings of &euro;600 million from IPHA companies, with an additional &euro;150 million expected to be delivered by non-IPHA suppliers of branded medicines.</p>  <p>  The implementation of generic substitution and reference pricing has also contributed to significant price reductions. The prices of reference priced products are generally of the order of 70% - 80% lower than the prices paid when medicines were on patent. The implementation of generic substitution and reference pricing delivered savings of &euro;47 million in 2014 and &euro;94 million in 2015.  This ensures that generic drug prices in Ireland will continue to fall towards European norms.</p>  <p>  As a result of these measures, the average price of an item dispensed on the General Medical Services Scheme has reduced to below the price paid in 2001 and the average Drug Payment Scheme price is below the price paid in 2000.</p>  <p>  The State also provides a number of supports for persons with the cost of medicines. Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange health services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Crohn's disease suffers aged over 70 will also benefit from the prescription charge changes outlined in Budget 2017.  The Government intends to reduce the per item prescription charge by 50c, from &euro;2.50 to &euro;2.00, and reduce the monthly cap by &euro;5, from &euro;25 to &euro;20.  This initiative will require changes in primary legislation and pharmacy payments systems.  Subject to the enactment of the necessary legislation, the Government intends that the reductions will take effect on 1 March 2017.</p>  <p>  Patients may also be able to claim tax relief on the cost of certain medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist or consultant.  Relief is at the standard rate of 20%. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government also includes a commitment to reduce the cost of medicines by reducing the annual required co-payment on the Drugs Payment Scheme and further reducing prescription charges for medical card holders.</p></reply>

Since 2011 this function has been suspended.</p><p>The NTPF supports the management of in-patient, day-case and outpatient waiting lists, by working with the HSE to assist hospitals in developing local demand and capacity planning and providing technical guidance materials to ensure the highest standard of data quality and practice. The expertise amassed by the NTPF in respect of waiting lists has proven invaluable in assisting the HSE to administer previous waiting list initiatives and in carrying out smaller-scale targeted initiatives in areas such as endoscopy.</p><p>The <i>Programme for Partnership Government</i>emphasises the need for sustained commitment to improving waiting times for patients, with a particular focus on those patients waiting longest. At my request, in August, the HSE developed an action plan to reduce, by year end, the number of patients currently waiting 18 months or more for an inpatient / daycase procedure. Also within current resources, the NTPF is currently implementing an Endoscopy Initiative which aims to ensure that, by year end, no patient will be waiting 12 months or more for an endoscopy procedure.</p><p>In line with the Government priority, the Budget 2017 provides for the treatment of our longest-waiting patients. Funding of &euro;20m is being allocated to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55m in 2018.  Planning of this initiative is at an advanced stage by the NTPF, my Department and the HSE.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  </p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets. The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap.</p>  <p>  The Scheme has a number of important safeguards built into the financial assessment which ensures that:</p>  <p>  -  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care;</p>  <p>  -  An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his/her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater.  This is in recognition of the fact that, although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing;</p>  <p>  -  If an applicant has a spouse/partner remaining at home, he/she will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;</p>  <p>  -  If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;</p>  <p>  -  Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account for the financial assessment, including health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence;</p>  <p>  -  A person&rsquo;s eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drug Payment Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or residence in a nursing home.</p>  <p>  In addition to these safeguards, where an applicant&rsquo;s assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is known as the  Nursing Home Loan (Ancillary State Support), the purpose of which is to ensure that a person does not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care. A nursing home resident can apply for this deferral at any stage. </p>  <p>  When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years. The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme. In advance of the Review, submissions were sought from groups or bodies who wished to make a contribution, and the Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) made a submission in this context on which they expanded at a subsequent meeting with officials of the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners and, when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  I have recently met with the IFA and invited them to present their submission at the next meeting of the Working Group. The Working Group met on the 11 of October and the IFA gave a verbal presentation to the Group. The issue is currently being considered. </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government has committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small business and family farms. </p></reply>

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health. The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. </p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers. Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests. NIAC recommended that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.  </p>  <p>  By January 2016, over 200 million doses of Gardasil had been distributed worldwide. In Ireland over 580,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and over 220,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010.</p>  <p>  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use. The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.   In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the statutory regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  </p>  <p>  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports of suspected adverse reactions submitted to the HPRA are reviewed and followed up as necessary to ensure all relevant information is available, prior to onward reporting to relevant stakeholders, including the European Medicines Agency (EMA). At EU level, regulators continuously monitor this cumulative reporting experience as part of the ongoing assessment of the safety of HPV vaccines.  In addition, pharmaceutical companies are obliged, as a condition of the authorisation to market a medicine, to submit reports of adverse reactions received directly, to the HPRA.  In accordance with its reporting obligations, the HPRA provides anonymised details of reports received to the EMA, the WHO and to the relevant pharmaceutical companies. The fact that a suspected adverse reaction has been reported does not necessarily mean that the medicine has caused the observed effect, which may have also been caused by the condition being treated, a new condition the patient developed, or by another medicine that the patient is taking.  Further data are usually needed to complete the picture.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women. It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition. It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services. The HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.  </p>  <p>  In November 2015, the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine. The review, which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase. The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined. The European Medicines Agency has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines. Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information. </p>  <p>  On 12 January 2016, the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information. This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states.</p>  <p>  I encourage the parents of all eligible girls to ensure that their daughters receive this important cancer preventing vaccine. </p></reply>

Prior to deciding whether to reimburse a medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available. </p><p>The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) of pharmaceutical products for the HSE, and can make recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process. The NCPE used a decision framework to systematically assess whether the drug  is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p><p>I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi). This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.</p><p>The NCPE has completed its HTA and submitted it to the HSE. The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the  manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug. The NCPE have confirmed that  all relevant costs were included in the analysis.</p><p>A summary of the HTA has been published on the NCPE website and is available at:.</p><p>The HSE has since had further engagements with the manufacturer in an effort to secure significant price reductions for Orkambi.  The HSE will consider the outcome of these engagements and any other, together with the NCPE recommendation, in making a final decision on reimbursement.</p></reply>

The potential that technology offers to improve patient safety and to enhance the delivery of health services in Ireland is recognised by the Government.  The table below shows the outturn for ICT since 2011 in capital and revenue expenditure. Current expenditure in relation to ICT developments is focussed on a wide range of systems including infrastructural support projects, patient administration systems as well as new critical developments such as the national laboratory information systems (LIMS), the Maternal and New Born Clinical Management System, the Medical Oncology Management Systems and a new financial management system. <table><tr><th>HSE ICT</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016<br /><br />Projected </th></tr><tr><td>Capital</td><td><br /><br />&euro;15m</td><td><br /><br />&euro;22m</td><td>&euro;39m</td><td>&euro;39m</td><td>&euro;53m</td><td>&euro;55m</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue</td><td>&euro;86m</td><td>&euro;86m</td><td>&euro;87m</td><td>&euro;95m</td><td>&euro;100m</td><td>&euro;103m</td></tr></table></p><p>My Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to enable improvement in the use and application of eHealth and ICT technology in healthcare. In 2013, the Government published an <i>eHealth Strategy for Ireland </i>which set out a digital path for health services improvements. The main objective of the eHealth strategy is to ensure a national approach to ICT and eHealth initiatives.  As part of that strategy, an Office of the Chef Information Officer has been established along with the entity <i>&lsquo;eHealth Ireland&rsquo;</i>within the HSE structure to progress the eHealth agenda. The strategy sets out a number of enablers to progress eHealth including the setting up of an eHealth Advisory Committee for the HSE, an Irish eHealth ecosystem and the development of a system of health identifiers underpinned by the Health Identifiers Act, 2014. This Act gives the legal basis for the development and the deployment of identifiers that will cover patients, health care organisations and professionals in the health service. The development and the deployment of the Individual Health Identifier will be a significant patient safety initiative along with being a key enabler for eHealth deployments. </p><p>The HSE recently developed a business case for an Electronic Health Record (EHR) for Ireland which is a plan for a consistent and sustained investment over a number of years in technology across the continuum of healthcare in the acute, primary and community sectors. The aim of this plan is to ensure that the right information, about the right patient is available wherever required, in a safe and secure environment. It is envisaged, if the plan proceeds, that the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital will be the initial site for implementation of an EHR in an acute setting thus providing a paper &lsquo;lite&rsquo; digital hospital. In developing a national electronic health record we must build on the progress to date in ICT deployment but also the lessons learnt from other jurisdictions in developing an optimum solution for Ireland. This programme, if progressed, will require a substantial investment in ICT and it also offers the opportunity for re-configuration of services with the potential of a safer, patient centred and more integrated approach along with significant efficiencies. My Department is currently assessing the EHR programme and engaging with stakeholders on how to further progress this programme of work.</p></reply>

Many contain high levels of added sugars.  Because high caffeine drinks are not recommended for certain population groups, specific EU labelling requirements apply for beverages exceeding 150mg/l of caffeine.  The labelling must specify that they have a high caffeine content, are not recommended for children, pregnant or breast-feeding women and must also state the caffeine content expressed per mg/100ml.</p>  <p>  At the request of the Department of Health, Safefood published a review of energy drinks in Ireland in 2016.  The review recommended an information awareness campaign for younger adults and a code of practice for retailers to avoid sales to children.  </p>  <p>  My department is working with the food industry, retailers and advertisers on a code of practice in relation to advertising, promotion and product placement of food and beverages.</p></reply>

On foot of this, my Department engaged with representatives of the waste industry to agree a way forward that results in customers paying no more for the same level of service than they were paying in June 2016 for waste collection over the 12 months to 1 July 2017.  Legislation () was signed on 30 June, 2016 to remove mandatory pay-by-weight charging for household waste collection.  However, it is still open to a company to charge on a pay-by-weight basis and if they are charging the same fee for the same level of service then this does not run contrary to the agreement.  Indeed, many companies already had a pay-by-weight element to their charging structure before the agreement was reached and their customers are quite happy with this approach.</p><p>The responsibility for ensuring the accuracy of the weighing instruments for the purposes of charging for waste collection on a weight basis rests with the National Standards Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s (NSAI&rsquo;s) Legal Metrology inspectors.  The NSAI has provided information on its role in this regard, which is available to download at: <i></i></p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming. </p><p>The procurement process aims to identify an entity or entities to build, roll-out, operate and deliver high speed broadband of at least 30 Mbps download and 6 Mbps upload speeds to all premises within the intervention area.  Last week, I announced that the three bidders in the procurement process have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution for rural Ireland under the National Broadband Plan intervention.  Householders and businesses may potentially get speeds not just of 30Mbps but up to 1Gbps with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds. This is a solution that will endure for 25 years and beyond and put Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity.  </p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i></i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including Co Meath. Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode. The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to </p><p>The townlands of Stackallen, Smithstown and Julianstown are included in the AMBER area and  are therefore included in the procurement process. Over 750,000 premises are within the State intervention area. This includes over 31,000 premises in County Meath.</p><p>The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network to the over 750,000 premises in Ireland, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland.

As the waste industry began releasing its proposed prices under pay-by-weight in June 2016, the Government relayed its concern to the industry regarding the reported escalation of waste bills for customers of certain companies and it was not implemented. However, my Department engaged with representatives of the waste industry to agree a way forward that results in all customers paying no more for the same level of service than they were currently paying for waste collection over the 12 month period to 1 July 2017.  The Irish Waste Management Association, Greyhound and CityBin were directly involved in the discussions which led to the agreement.</p>  <p>  The charges applied by waste management companies are a matter between those companies and their customers, subject to compliance with all applicable environmental and other relevant legislation, including contract and consumer legislation.  In this regard, if a person has concerns regarding changes being made to any contract, advice may be sought from the Competition and Consumer Protection Agency, who can be contacted on 01 402 5500.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Budget 2017 has provided an additional &euro;5.5m in current funding to my Department to support the provision of youth services. This additional funding will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services. Following the Budget 2017 announcement, my Department will commence a process with national organisations and local services to identify service development needs for 2017 and to agree the 2017 allocations. Every effort will be made to complete this process as soon as possible.</p></reply>
