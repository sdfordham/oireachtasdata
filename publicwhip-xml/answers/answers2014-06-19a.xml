The Afforestation Scheme is a voluntary scheme and is one of a number of land-use options open to landowners. </p><p>A number of strategic actions specific to increasing the forest area have been recommended in the soon to be published <i>Forests, products and people &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s forest policy &ndash; a renewed vision. </i>This document takes account of the final report and recommendations of the Forest Policy Review Group.  Amongst these are as follows:</p><p>- to reduce the differential between farmer and non-farmer premiums and review annually to determine whether further differential adjustments are warranted to mobilise private sector and institutional investment;</p><p>- DAFM to review the incentives for planting larger areas and for consolidating existing forest areas to increase long term competiveness and efficiency in harvesting and transport; and</p><p>- DAFM to encourage State organisations and Local Authorities to convert part of their land bank holdings to public purpose forestry and in particular native woodlands;</p><p>The draft Forestry Programme for the period 2014 &ndash; 2020 has taken these recommendations on board by introducing changes to existing afforestation schemes, by designing new schemes and by retaining both the conservation and establishment elements of the native woodland scheme.  The most significant changes being introduced is the single rate of premium which will make forestry more attractive to non-farmers.  The new &ldquo;Forestry for Fibre&rdquo; measure will allow participants to fell at between 10 and 15 years thereby significantly reducing the length of time before the financial benefits of the plantation can be recovered.   The Agro forestry measure, which is being introduced for the first time as an afforestation scheme, will provide further options for farmers who wish to continue grazing livestock while at the same time grow trees.  This scheme is being introduced on a small scale pilot basis which will then be reviewed.   One of the benefits of agro forestry is that it could act as an introduction to forestry for farmers who may subsequently decide to plant a more traditional forest crop. </p><p>Other support measures such as support for knowledge transfer groups, targeted training and producer groups aim to incentivise forest holders to manage their plantations more effectively and to co-operate with neighbouring forest holders when it comes to harvesting and road building.  </p><p>Further details regarding the new forestry Programme 2015-2020 are due to be submitted for public consultation in July 2014. </p></reply>

As part of the package of measures, I announced the introduction a maximum landing size for lobster of 127mm due to the importance of very large lobsters to the reproductive potential of the stock.  The decision to introduce this new conservation measure followed on from consideration of over 250 submissions received during public consultation and of expert advice from the marine agencies.  During the first 2 years of operation of this new measure, in order to provide support for potential financial losses throughout the transitional period, fishermen will be paid up to 75% of the market price for v-notching &lsquo;oversize&rsquo; lobsters and returning them live to the sea.</p><p>  The voluntary v-notching conservation programme has been an important contributor to the sustainability of Irish lobster stocks.  It was with this in mind that I also announced an increase in grant aid for voluntary v-notching of lobsters from the existing maximum of 55% to a new maximum of 75% as part of the new Sustainable Inshore Fisheries Scheme to be delivered by BIM.</p><p>  During the public consultation on the proposals for the lobster fishery, many fishermen, particularly inshore fishermen who depend heavily on lobster for their income, put forward a variety of alternative proposals to safeguard lobster stocks into the future.  These alternatives included but were not limited to strengthening participation in the v-notching programme by a variety of means.  I would like to see inshore fishermen themselves explore and develop such proposals to ensure the long-term sustainability of lobster and other important fisheries they rely upon.  It is for this reason that I also announced the establishment of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) to provide inshore fishermen with their own space for convening and bringing common initiatives forward.  A network of Regional Inshore Forums (RIF&rsquo;s), based on and linked to the community-led Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) around the Irish coast, will nominate delegates to bring forward regional proposals to the NIFF for wider industry discussion.</p><p>  The purpose of the Forums will primarily be to develop and facilitate implementation of policies and initiatives relating to the sustainable management of the inshore fisheries within six nautical miles.  From the ground-up, inshore fishermen need to be involved in designing policies that affect their livelihoods.  I hope inshore fishermen will embrace the opportunity this new initiative provides to ensure the Forums become a successful platform for developing this important sector of Ireland&rsquo;s fishing industry.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-19a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061900053#WRB00700"><p>The industry wide strategy for developing the sheep industry in Ireland was set out in the Food Harvest 2020 document which envisages a 20% increase in value terms of the sector by 2020.  My approach to building on the significant achievements of the strategy up until now is to drive the development of the industry at home and increase Ireland`s market share of the world market.  This will ensure that producers and processors can plan for the future, increasing the value of the industry for the benefit of all.</p><p>In terms of the performance of the sector in 2013, I am pleased to note that for the third consecutive year Irish sheep throughput grew,<i></i>reaching 2.61 million head, a rise of 8%. These developments led to sheepmeat production rising by around 3% to stand just over 55,000 tonnes. The total value of Irish sheepmeat exports is estimated to have increased by over 4% in 2013 to reach &euro;220m. The market outlook for Irish sheepmeat in 2014 looks reasonably stable as a result of ongoing tight EU sheep supplies and a reduced presence of New Zealand lamb.  Average prices to date this year are almost 6% ahead of 2013.</p><p>At producer level I continue to put in place incentives to ensure that producers see a viable future in the sector. Earlier this year the I announced the extension of the Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP) for a further year. In committing funding of &euro;3m to the programme in 2014 I am acknowledging the success of the 2013 scheme in which 4,000 producers participated. Support for the sheep sector also comes from the sheep grassland Scheme for which I have prioritised funding over the last four years. This scheme delivered &euro;68 million directly to the incomes of Irish sheep farmers and I am very pleased that the scheme will operate again in 2014, with an increased budget of &euro;15 million.</p><p>In addition to the budget for the 2014 Scheme being increased from &euro;14 million to &euro;15 million, there is the additional benefit to participating farmers in that payments under the Scheme will not be liable to Modulation, which previously applied at varying rates up to a maximum of 10%. The Modulation deductions made in respect of payments under the 2013 Scheme represent 7.5%. While it is envisaged that the payment rates will be increased under the 2014 Scheme, allowance must be taken of increased sheep numbers but overall I expect that an additional &euro;2 million will be paid to sheep farmers in 2014 under the scheme.</p><p>As you are aware I am proposing under the new CAP that payments received under the 2014 Grassland Sheep Scheme will be incorporated into the calculation of the entitlement value in each year of the new regime for those farmers who participated in that Scheme. This will have the effect of increasing their entitlement value and ensure that such farmers do not lose through the cessation of the scheme at the end of 2014. This will include the additional &euro;2 million payable in 2014 and will mean that enhanced funding will be available to sheep farmers under the new regime.</p><p>Under the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) I have made provision for improving efficiency and profitability in sheep production under the knowledge transfer measure and the lessons learned from STAP will inform the development of this measure. The RDP programme will provide support to farmers by means of a range of measures across a number of priorities, including environmental objectives. The new agri-environment scheme, GLAS (Green Low-carbon Agri-environment Scheme) will support, among others, extensive and hill farmers, who have shown themselves to be careful custodians of the countryside in previous agri-environment schemes. GLAS intends giving priority to those commonage farmers who reach a collective agreement on the management of these valuable landscapes.  It also includes a menu of environmental actions, many of which will be suitable for all sheep farmers.</p><p>On the export front I intend to drive further the search for new markets.  My Department in consultation with the meat industry and in cooperation with Bord Bia and the Irish Embassies abroad is constantly pushing for new markets and opportunities. The usefulness of alternative markets as a buffer against market volatility was obvious in the sheep export statistics for 2013.  Because of the economic downturn in the UK and France our exports to those markets dipped but we were able to offset this loss with increased exports to Belgium, Germany and Sweden thereby showing a positive net result for the sector at the end of the year.</p><p>This week I met with Mr. Liu Yunshan the 5<sup>th</sup>ranking member of the Chinese Communist Party Politburo Standing Committee and First Secretary of the Central Secretariat of the CPC.  I informed him of the progress Ireland has made in our efforts to gain access to the Chinese market and thanked him for the agreement of the Chinese authorities to initiate access procedures for sheepmeat from Ireland.</p></reply>

Following months of intense lobbying and negotiation, I announced on 12 June 2014 that I had secured &euro;148 million from the new Fund for the period 2014 to 2020 for the development of the Irish seafood industry and the coastal communities that depend upon it. This funding is more than double the amount that was available to Ireland during the last Common Fisheries Policy and will ensure a strong seafood industry in Ireland that can grow and expand to meet its potential up to 2020.  Ireland&rsquo;s EMFF allocation is to be provided through 5 discrete funding envelopes, namely &euro;71 million for investment in the seafood industry, &euro;32 million for data collection, &euro;37 million for control and enforcement, &euro;5 million for implementation of the Integrated Maritime Policy, and &euro;1.3 million for storage aid.</p><p>  The new CFP is a major overhaul of the way which fishing is carried out in EU waters, the purpose of which is to provide a framework for the long term sustainability of fish stocks and the whole industry.  The EMFF Fund will provide support for our fishing fleet to meet the challenges of the new discards ban.  It will support the development of the seafood processing sector, a sustainable aquaculture industry and the communities that depend on a vibrant seafood industry.  The new fund will help our seafood industry to develop and maintain long term sustainability and economic strength.</p><p>  My Department has been working since 2013 on developing a new Operational Programme setting out the arrangements for spending Ireland&rsquo;s allocation under the Fund and has engaged with stakeholders on a number of occasions to date.  Further public consultation and strategic environmental assessment will take place over the summer 2014.  The new Operational Programme must be submitted to the European Commission for adoption before the end of 2014.</p><p>  While the co-financing rate for some measures in the EMFF Regulation is fixed, notably data collection at 80% and control and enforcement at mostly 90%, other measures are a matter of national discretion.  I will be discussing this matter with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the near future, having regard to the general budgetary situation for the coming years and we will agree what co-financing by the Exchequer is appropriate.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-19a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061900053#WRB01300"><p>The 2008 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) formed part of the EU Climate and Energy Package in 2008 for the post-Kyoto period 2013-2020. Under the Effort Sharing Decision, Ireland&rsquo;s target is to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to 2005 emission levels by 2020. The ESD does not set individual sectoral targets.</p><p>  My Department along with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, as well as other relevant Departments, has continually made a strong case to the European Commission that there is a need for a more coherent approach to target setting as far as agriculture is concerned. In particular given that worldwide demand for production of food will increase by some 50% by 2030, EU policies must avoid downward pressure on food production, and maintain and enhance the EU contribution to sustainable global food production.</p><p>  The Irish agri-food industry strategy, Food Harvest 2020 (FH2020) set targets for increases in the value of agriculture output and exports by 2020 and for a 50% increase in milk volume.  The Commission is very aware of the targets contained in FH2020, and these are factored into all discussions on the 2020 targets and indeed on ambition to 2030.</p><p>  The communication for a framework on climate and energy for 2030 was published by the Commission in January 2014. The inclusion of a subsection on agriculture and land use is a welcome first step towards seeking an approach to ambition for the sector that is realistic and consistent with meeting the twin challenges of sustainable food production, in the light of rising global demand, and climate change mitigation and adaptation, in the light of overall EU and global objectives.</p><p>  My Department is supporting other Government Departments in negotiations on the 2030 climate framework to ensure the interests of Irish agriculture are reflected. The Department will also seek to build alliances with other member states to further support the development of appropriate policies for the treatment of agriculture and climate change.</p></reply>

I expect to be in a position to submit the draft RDP to the European Commission for evaluation and approval shortly.</p><p>The proposed Beef Data and Genomics Programme is, subject to Commission approval, intended to deliver an accelerated improvement in the quality and environmental sustainability of the beef herd through the application of genomics technology. This will help farmers to maximise productivity in a sustainable way, while supporting improved quality and traceability in the national suckler herd, as set out under the Food Harvest (FH) 2020 strategy.</p><p>The programme will provide support to farmers to take samples for genotyping from selected animals in their herds and to provide vital breeding data to support the development of a national cattle breeding databank. The data will provide farmers with the tools to select higher quality and more efficient breeding replacements through the use of cutting edge genomic technology. The selection of more efficient animals with the right genetics for easy calving and high weight gain thereafter, that can be finished earlier, will have a substantial environmental dividend and will also contribute to improving productivity, reducing input costs and improving margins for farmers.</p><p>Improved knowledge on the genetic merit of an animal should facilitate more informed on-farm selection decisions with the eventual outcome of increased genetic gain for a range of performance traits and therefore greater farm profitability. Using data gained from the implementation of genomic selection in Irish dairy cattle since 2009, genomic selection is expected to increase genetic gain by up to 50%; however this is dependent on good accuracy of selection for which the main requirement is individual animal performance data on a very large number of animals of known parentage.</p><p>Some &euro;295 million has provisionally been allocated for BDGP and payments will, subject to the approval of the programme by the EU commission, be paid to farmers for work carried out, including the development of a herd breeding plan, training and transaction costs. Among the activities being considered for the programme are the:</p><p>- recording of animal events,</p><p>- recording  of a range of performance criteria,</p><p>- taking and sending for laboratory testing tissue (DNA) samples from selected animals, and</p><p>- selection of high quality replacement bulls and heifers over the  five period of their BDGP contract.</p><p>Officials in my Department are currently in discussions with the EU Commission on the final details of the programme and it will be some time before the final details are known.</p></reply>

Key objectives of the scheme will be to:</p><p>- produce high quality hardwood timber where appropriate (including oak, sycamore and cherry);</p><p>- encourage continuous cover forestry and close-to-nature silvicultural techniques; and</p><p>- enhance the quality and diversity of landscapes. </p><p>As this is the first occasion agro forestry will be funded under the afforestation scheme, support for this type of forestry will be launched on a small-scale pilot basis; the target area to be planted will therefore be relatively small compared to the other afforestation categories.</p><p>In accordance with EU State Aid rules only 80% of eligible costs can be funded; premiums will be available and will be paid for five years and will cover the cost of maintenance only. Once land is converted to agro-forestry it will be classified as forest land and the provisions of forest legislation will apply. Support for the establishment of demonstration plots for research purposes may also be considered under this measure.</p><p>Further details regarding this scheme are due to be submitted for public consultation in July 2014.</p></reply>

The changes to the Farm Assist scheme were made in order to bring the scheme into closer alignment with the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed persons, and were part of the overall package of measures agreed by the Government in Budget 2013.</p><p>  There were 10,300 recipients of Farm Assist in 2013, with total expenditure of almost &euro;100 million. The scheme is based on Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, and was introduced in 1999 to replace the &lsquo;Smallholders Unemployment Assistance&rsquo; for low income farmers.  Farm Assist recipients retain all the advantages of the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance scheme, such as retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.</p><p>  The headline rates of Farm Assist are being maintained so that farm families with the lowest income are least affected by these changes. Farm Assist remains a flexible payment and any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cash-flow issues, due for example to bad weather, can ask the local welfare office to review the level of means applying to his/her claim.</p><p>  All farms, and in particular lower income drystock farms, benefit significantly from the &euro;1.2 billion in single farm payments paid by my Department each year.</p><p>  The new Rural Development Programme will also be a vital support to farm families in terms of enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, managing natural resources in a sustainable manner, and ensuring the balanced development of rural areas.

In fact, in 2013, Ireland&rsquo;s horticultural industry, excluding potatoes, had a farm-gate output value of &euro;314m.  This represented a 6% increase on the value of output for the sector in 2012.</p><p>  Mushrooms represent over one third of the value of output for the sector and a significant proportion of our crop is exported to the UK.  The value of output from the mushroom sector has grown significantly in recent years on the strength of an Industry/EU co-funded mushroom promotion campaign operating on the UK market since autumn 2010.  Given the success of the original 3-year mushroom promotion campaign on the UK market, Bord Bia, with support from the Industry, submitted an application for a further 3-year mushroom promotion campaign which commenced in Autumn 2013 and covers both the Irish and UK markets and will see a spend of &euro;2.7 million over the period.</p><p>  The mushroom sector has also benefited strongly from participation in the EU&rsquo;s Producer Organisation Scheme which is administered by my Department.  Ireland&rsquo;s largest Producer Organisation, Commercial Mushroom Producers (CMP) consists of 54 mushroom growers who, through their Producer Organisations, receive substantial aid through the scheme each year.</p><p>  Through the National Development Plan, a total of &euro;13.6m was paid to applicants under the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector over the period 2009-2013.  This competitive grant aid scheme supports capital investments in specialised horticultural equipment and buildings that contribute to at least one of the scheme&rsquo;s four objectives namely: to improve the quality of output, to facilitate environmentally friendly practices, to improve working conditions and to promote diversification of production.</p><p>  A further &euro;5 million in funding has been awarded to 163 successful projects under the 2014 Round of the Scheme.  This will support investments by growers of approximately &euro;13 million before the end of this year.</p><p>  In support of the sector my Department implements the EU Marketing Standards for fresh fruit and vegetables by conducting inspections to verify these products meet quality and labelling requirements.  One of the key points in these inspections is verification of country of origin labelling.</p><p>  On the research front Teagasc is researching the benefits of creating new horticulture energy hubs that will allow new horticultural enterprises to reduce their energy costs while at the same time allowing the energy generator benefit from meeting their targets regarding utilisation of excess heat.  Utilisation of such excess heat has the potential to reduce heating costs for some horticultural growers by up to one third.  For a crop like tomatoes this could translate into a 20% reduction in overall production costs.</p><p>  Teagasc is responsible for providing education and training as well as an advisory service for Ireland&rsquo;s agri-food sector and has recently invested &euro;2m in developing its horticultural training facilities at the Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin.  In addition following consultation with employers in the horticultural sector Teagasc are currently re-focussing their horticultural courses to meet industry demand for skilled commercial horticulture focussed graduates.</p><p>  Teagasc also plan to develop a horticulture technology hub at Ashtown which will cover horticulture education, research and advisory services all under one single management structure.  This should lead to strong efficiencies and synergies especially between the horticultural food production side and food research team based at Ashtown. This &euro;5m investment will involve construction of new mushroom tunnels, glass and protected structures as well as new classrooms and seminar rooms.</p></reply>

As of 1 January 2015 that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form. </p><p>  In developing the shape of the new system of Direct Payments in Ireland, I have been very conscious of the needs of sheep farmers, in particular those who farm on hill and commonage land. In general, sheep farmers hold low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme. </p><p>  When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer&rsquo;s entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307/2013 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme. This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.  </p><p>  I have decided to apply this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the value of the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme for those farmers concerned. The Grassland Sheep Scheme is the only Article 68 scheme that is being incorporated into the calculation of entitlements under the new Basic Payment Scheme. If such incorporation does not take place the value of such payments would simply remain in the national fund and would be redistributed generally among all farmers who establish entitlements. </p><p>  The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019. Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision the group of farmers who receive the Grassland Sheep Scheme will have an immediate financial benefit in 2015 as part of their payment under the Basic Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be fully aware of the value of these EU funded Direct Payment Schemes, with farmers benefiting annually from funding of over &euro;1.5 billion under Schemes such as the Single Farm Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the Agri-Environment Schemes, etc. </p><p>  The European Commission has an obligation to ensure that Member States manage and use the EU funding granted to them in accordance with the very restrictive provisions governing the Schemes and general financial provisions. Under the Common Agricultural Policy, this is done by way of a Clearance of Accounts procedure. This is a formal process and both the Commission and Member States are obliged to adhere to the requirements laid down in the legislation. </p><p>  Deputies will be aware of the process, which involves audit missions, follow-up correspondence, a formal bi-lateral meeting followed by further correspondence, leading ultimately to the Commission&rsquo;s letter of findings. This letter, which was recently received, proposes significant corrections totally &euro;181.5m, significantly ahead of the level that might reasonably have been anticipated. </p><p>  However, we have the right, and fully intend availing of this right, to ask for the matter to be reviewed by the Conciliation Body. This body will review the case and seek written and oral observations from each party. It will make its recommendations, which the Commission will consider before arriving at its final definitive decision. Ultimately it is open to each Member State to initiate legal proceedings in the European Court of Justice in relation to the Clearance decision.</p><p>  This is an extremely serious process. During the years 2002 to 2012, the Commission imposed financial corrections amounting to almost &euro;5 billion on Member States. Ireland&rsquo;s share of this total amounted to &euro;25.6 million (or 0.5% of the total amount corrected &ndash; one of the lowest percentages among Member States). Under the EU Regulations, the Commission has to right to impose a flat-rate correction of 2%, 5%, 10% or greater, depending of its assessment of the risk to the EU Fund involved. </p><p>  On the other hand, the level of the correction can be based on the assessed risk, if the Member State can establish the risk and the Commission is satisfied with the calculations. In such circumstances,  if the risk is dealt with by the Member State by collecting the debts arising from the over-payments, the amounts collected is taken into account by the Commission in its final assessment. This is the approach Ireland is following.</p></reply>

A tiered approach is being applied to entry into the Scheme and the tiers are based on a consideration of priority environmental assets and actions.</p><p>  The proposed maximum payment is &euro;5,000 per annum, with the Scheme building up to the inclusion of some 50,000 farmers with a total envisaged expenditure of &euro;1,450m over the programming period.  It is envisaged that the number of Scheme participants at end of 2015 will be 25,000; at the end of 2016 will be 35,000 and at the end of 2017 will be 45,000 with the full complement of 50,000 being achieved in 2018. I expect most farmers to achieve the maximum payment under the Scheme.</p><p>  It is also proposed that, within budget limits, a GLAS+ payment would be put in place for a limited number of farmers who take on particularly challenging actions which deliver an exceptional level of environmental benefit.  It is proposed that this payment will be up to &euro;2,000 per annum.  </p></reply>

However, my Department is represented on a Monitoring Committee on Coursing, which was established in 1993/94, to monitor developments in coursing. This committee, which also includes representatives from both the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Irish Coursing Club (ICC), keeps the situation under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interest of animal welfare both for hares and greyhounds alike. Since 1993, Irish Coursing Clubs have made it compulsory for greyhounds to be muzzled while they chase the hare thus making injury to hares a very rare occurrence. Veterinary Inspectors from my Department attend and monitor coursing events.</p><p>  In relation to digging out, under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, lawful hunting of an animal may take place unless the animal is released in an injured, mutilated or exhausted condition. The Hunting Association of Ireland and The Irish Working Terrier Federation have set out rules and procedures for the use of hunt terriers. It is intended that these rules and procedures will be examined in the context of Section 25 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 with a view to adapting them as modern Codes of Practice under the Act. </p><p>  Badgers are protected by national legislation and are listed within the Berne Convention.  My Department monitors the animal welfare aspects of badger culling on a continuous basis and is satisfied that culling has contributed to a significant reduction in the incidence of TB in cattle and that the arrangements and procedures involved in culling result in minimal injury to badgers.  </p><p>  A Code of Practice for fur farmers has been drafted under the new Animal Health and Welfare Act and includes a series of practical measures to assist fur farmers adapt the highest standards of animal husbandry and provide practical assistance for breeding and rearing of animals. This code is currently available on my Departments website.</p><p>  With regard to the use of animals in circuses, my Department is working with circus representatives on the preparation of a code of practice. This code when enacted will be complemented by unannounced inspections by my officials.</p></reply>

We are currently developing a low carbon agriculture sectoral roadmap under the Heads of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2014 and this roadmap will take into account the targets in the industry&rsquo;s Food Harvest 2020 strategy as well as existing mitigation commitments. The roadmap will also outline a longer term view and seek to balance the objectives of allowing the food industry to grow so as to meet the food security challenges that face the world as well as the need to meet future climate change ambition.  </p><p>The Environmental Analysis Report on Food Harvest 2020 found that the adoption and use of high technology and best production methodologies at farm production level will yield the best environmental outcomes and result in the most effective mitigation measures. The new Rural Development Programme (RDP) for the period 2014-2020 is being informed by the findings and recommendations in this report and the &lsquo;<i>Marginal Abatement Cost Curve for Irish Agriculture&rsquo; </i>(September 2012 prepared by Teagasc), and will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas. </p><p>The measures in the RDP 2014-2020 will be designed to support the smart green growth message of Food Harvest 2020 and thus encompass the themes of technology, efficiency and sustainability. The main elements of the consultation document in terms of proposed measures are:</p><p>- a substantial new agri-environment/climate scheme (GLAS), which will build on the progress made under REPS and AEOS;  </p><p>- incentives for on-farm capital investment, which will incorporate support for investments with clear sustainability benefits; </p><p>- knowledge transfer and innovation measures including support for the European Innovation Partnership, which are aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions;</p><p>- a new beef data and genomic technology that will have a range of benefits in terms of sustainability, profitability, animal health and welfare, quality assurance, and herd quality;</p><p>- other supports aimed at collaborative farming, artisan producers and organic farming.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s policy position is to seek an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.   Teagasc has carried out a recent study entitled &lsquo;<i>Carbon-Neutrality as a Horizon Point for Irish Agriculture&rsquo; </i>(December 2013) which aims to address and provide a scientific framework for the challenge posed in seeking an approach to carbon-neutrality in the longer term for agriculture. My Department will continue to work closely with other Departments and agencies in developing the technical capacity necessary to underpin evolution of national climate policy and the development of a definition for carbon neutrality in the agricultural sector.   </p></reply>

The Commission are suggesting the delineation be carried out a LAU2 level &ndash; District Electoral Division (DED) in Ireland&rsquo;s case. To qualify under the new system, an area will need to show that at least two-thirds of its utilised agricultural land meets at least one of these criteria.</p><p>The resultant Areas of Natural Constraint would be subject to a fine-tuning process. These so called Second Stage Criteria are designed to remove areas which, although they meet the biophysical criteria, are deemed to have overcome the natural disadvantage and, therefore, should not benefit under the Scheme. The Second Stage Criteria would not apply to the criteria Low Temperatures, Heat Stress and Slope. The suggested ones for the other criteria are as follows:</p><p>- Soil Moisture Balance: Fine tune using % of area that is covered by fixed irrigation.</p><p>- Drainage: Take account of the artificial drainage, which can in effect move soils from one class to another.</p><p>- Texture and Stoniness, Rooting depth and Soil Chemical properties: Fine tune using production related indicators.</p><p>Commencement of the process must firstly await finalisation of the Teagasc innovative Irish Soil Information System (ISIS), which is designed to complete the national soil survey and which is scheduled for completion  later this year. On completion of ISIS the necessary comprehensive delineation may initially commence to see which land is included and excluded as Areas of Natural Handicap. Under the CAP Reform agreement, Member States have until 2018 to introduce a new regime.  </p></reply>

The basis for these inspections is governed by EU legislation and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must be conducted each year. Details of these inspections and the regulations involved are published in the Terms and Conditions of the schemes which are sent to every applicant annually.</p><p>  These inspections are a necessary requirement in order to draw down approximately &euro;1.6 billion of EU funds annually and to avoid EU disallowances. The inspections are subject to repeated audits by the European Commission, the European Court of Auditors and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Office and this ensures an independent verification that inspections are conducted in full compliance with the legal requirements. In abiding with the findings of these audits my Department ensures that these inspections are conducted in a fair and equitable manner and in full accordance with the legislative provisions. Furthermore inspecting officers are very experienced and are regularly trained to ensure that they carry out inspections in a professional manner, with a process of continuous oversight by supervisors and random verification of inspections to ensure a fair and consistent approach. In implementing the inspection programme, my Department takes maximum possible account of the realities of farming. </p><p>  A comprehensive appeal mechanism is in place in order to protect the interests of farmers who have difficulties with the inspection findings or who consider that the inspection has not been conducted in accordance with legislative requirements. This appeal system incorporates the option for a farmer to initially seek to have the inspection outcome reviewed internally by an officer more senior than the inspecting officer. Where the farmer remains dissatisfied, the decision can be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office and ultimately to the Office of the Ombudsman, which brings an entirely external and visibly independent dimension to the process.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s network of regional offices throughout the country, together with the Animal Welfare helpline, are valuable resources and provide a reporting mechanism for any person concerned with an animal welfare issue. My Department also continues to provide considerable financial supports to both animal welfare organisations to assist their work in animal welfare activities and to local authorities to assist their work in dealing with abandoned horses. In this regard funding of &euro;1.8m was provided to animal welfare organisations to support their activities in 2014 and funding of &euro;3m was provided in 2013 to local authorities for their work in control of horses.</p><p>  A feature of the new Act is that it provides for my Department to enter into service agreements with other bodies to act as authorised officers for the purposes of the Act. In this regard, service agreements have been agreed with the ISPCA, granting inspector&rsquo;s of that body greater powers to perform their current functions. The support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is crucial in enforcing the Act and my officials will continue the collaborative approach built up over many years with the Gardai in ensuring compliance with animal health and welfare legislation. Codes of Practice are also a feature of the new act. These are designed to provide practical guidance relating to various parts of the act and will play an important role serving as guides to good welfare for those working with animals and reflecting best practice internationally.</p><p>  In conclusion, the Animal Health and Welfare Act was a priority for me and I am confident that its enactment will facilitate a more effective implementation of animal health and welfare legislation.  I am satisfied that adequate resources are being provided for this purpose.</p></reply>

Qualifying &ldquo;Young Farmers&rdquo; will be eligible to apply to the National Reserve for an allocation of new entitlements or a top up on the value of existing entitlements and also to participate in the Young Farmers Scheme. </p><p>  The definition of Young Farmer includes the criteria that such persons are aged 40 or less in their first year of application and that they have established their holding within five years of their first application under the Basic Payment Scheme. This definition is included in the new Direct Payment Regulation, applies to all Member States, and no Member State has any discretion to vary these conditions. Member States may however add further qualifying criteria. In this regard, to ensure that limited resources are targeted specifically at persons who have a genuine interest in agriculture, I have decided to apply the following educational requirement:</p><p>-  S/he has successfully completed a recognised course of education in agriculture giving rise to an award at FETAC level 6 or its equivalent.</p><p>  The essential purpose of the Young Farmers Scheme is to assist young farmers in the initial stages of establishing a farming enterprise in their own name and to encourage generational renewal. It is for this reason that the payment is restricted to those who are establishing a farming enterprise or have established such a holding in the previous five years. In addition the restricting of the payment to a maximum of five years will make it possible to support those young farmers who will come on-stream in the years subsequent to 2015. </p><p>  Most farmers who have been farming for more than five years hold existing entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme. Where such farmers hold low value entitlements they will benefit significantly from the process of convergence that will apply under the Basic Payment Scheme. They will also benefit from the Greening payment which, as it is calculated as a percentage of a person&rsquo;s payment under the Basic Payment Scheme, will converge in line with the Basic Payment. </p><p>  The National Reserve under the current Single Payment Scheme operated up to the scheme year 2012 and many of the group in question were in a position to avail of an allocation of entitlements or a top-up on existing entitlements during one of those years. </p><p>  I am however very conscious of the group of young persons who were unable to avail of the Installation Aid Scheme and who are also excluded from the benefits of being a &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; due to the five year rule. I am actively investigating alternative ways in which this group may be assisted. </p></reply>

Dairy farm incomes increased by 31% last year, although this followed a reduction of 27% the previous year. Average income fell for all non-dairy farm systems. </p><p>It should be borne in mind that almost all dairy farms are classified by Teagasc as full-time farms in terms of the labour input required, whereas most drystock farms are classified as part-time in terms of labour input required. A further point is that family farm income does not equate to farm household income. On 28% of all farms the farm holder had an off-farm job, and on 51% of farms either the holder and/or spouse had an off-farm job in 2013, both marginally higher than in 2012.  Overall, it is estimated that on 75% of farms, either the farmer and/or spouse had another source of off-farm income, be it from employment, pensions or other social welfare payments.</p><p>While a number of drystock farmers will convert to dairy in the post-quota era, I expect that only a relatively small number of larger scale drystock farmers will be in a position to do so.   All farms, and in particular lower income drystock farms, benefit significantly from the &euro;1.2 billion in single farm payments paid by my Department each year. </p><p>The new Rural Development Programme will also be a vital support to farm families in terms of enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, managing natural resources in a sustainable manner, and ensuring the balanced development of rural areas. The Government has given a clear signal of its commitment to a strategic investment in rural Ireland and the agri-food sector by providing National Exchequer funding to bring the total amount available for RDP schemes to over &euro;4 billion in the period to 2020.</p></reply>

Against this background, we must ensure that there is proper coherence between trade and agricultural policy in the EU.

In particular, it is my clear objective that any disruption to our current levels of production arising from the Reform should be minimised. There was a distinct danger for Ireland that the Commission proposal to move to a &lsquo;flat-rate&rsquo; would redistribute funds away from our most productive farmers and land, to the less fertile areas of the country. While recognising that it is no longer possible to justify variations in the level of support on the basis of out-dated historical references, my guiding principle was that the redistribution of funds should take place in a gradual, phased manner over the five years of the new scheme thereby allowing farmers to adjust to the new level of income support. </p><p>  For this reason, the redistribution of funds in Ireland will be managed solely through the mechanism of the Internal Convergence Model as originally proposed by Ireland. This model provides a clear methodology for the redistribution of funds from those who currently hold high value entitlements to those who hold low value entitlements. It is predictable and easily tracked and will make it possible to provide very clear information to farmers regarding the level of support they can expect to receive for the period 2015 to 2019. In addition it achieves the stated objectives of a gradual phased redistribution of funds in a fair and objective manner. </p><p>  Any farmer with an Initial Unit Value below 90% of the national average entitlements value will see the value of their entitlements increase. The &lsquo;minimum entitlement value&rsquo; by 2019 has been set at 60% of the national average while I have also applied a &lsquo;maximum value&rsquo; whereby no farmer will receive a payment per hectare of over &euro;700 by 2019. </p><p>  I have also applied significant priority to young farmers under the Direct Payment Regulation and this priority is supported in our implementation. In common with many other EU Member States, Ireland has experienced a significant aging of our farming community and I have looked to the category of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; as a means of encouraging generational renewal. In this context I have decided to apply the maximum amounts permissible of 3% of our Basic Payment ceiling to the National Reserve and 2% of our National ceiling to the Young Farmers Scheme for 2015. To ensure that the benefits of the &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; category are targeted at those who have a genuine interest in agriculture as a career, I am also applying a requirement for a high level of education in agriculture. </p><p>  In determining eligibility under the new Scheme, I also decided to implement the so call Scottish Derogation measure which allows my Department to allocate entitlements to those who never held entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme but who were actively farming in 2013. In addition farmers that were not eligible to receive a payment in 2013 (and therefore do not have an automatic allocation right) but who produced fruits and vegetables in 2013 will be eligible to receive an allocation of entitlements under the new reform. A minimum area of one hectare will be applied to this group.  </p><p>  In determining the number of entitlements to be allocated under the Basic Payment Scheme, Ireland will make use of eligible land declared in 2013 and 2015, whichever is lowest. This option is of particular importance in Ireland where much farming activity is based on leased land and where a future &lsquo;land reference&rsquo; would have resulted in very disruptive land speculation. </p><p>  The outcome is a reasonable and balanced compromise between the need for a fair redistribution of funds while ensuring that such distribution continues to reflect the realities of agricultural production in Ireland. </p></reply>

However, I am aware that at least one airline requires a passport, not for travel within the common travel area, but rather as the only approved means of establishing the identity of Irish travellers.  Customers are made aware of this airline requirement at the time of flight booking and accept this requirement as just one of a number of terms and conditions of the booking.    Ultimately customers have the option which airline to use and can travel without a passport within the common travel area with other carriers.  Accordingly, I do not believe that enacting legislation envisaged by the Deputy would address the question of the voluntary terms and conditions to be accepted by Irish travellers when making a flight booking. </p></reply>

These thresholds were last increased in Budget 2008 from &euro;35,500 and &euro;70,000 with effect from the 1 May 2008.</p><p>  With regard to increasing the thresholds, I would point out that Ireland already operates the third highest registration threshold for goods and the fourth highest threshold for services in the EU. Indeed, some Member States do not operate any VAT registration threshold, requiring all businesses to register for VAT irrespective of their level of turnover.  While the registration thresholds are designed to reduce the administrative burden on businesses and Revenue, registration thresholds are not intended as a means of keeping small businesses permanently outside the VAT system. Therefore in setting registration thresholds levels, the objective is to strike an appropriate balance between the desirability of reducing the administrative burden on small businesses and the need to avoid undermining tax compliance or causing competitive distortions relative to registered firms.</p></reply>

If the Deputy has concerns in particular cases that individuals are not genuinely self employed, the Revenue Commissioners would be happy to examine any such cases.   </p><p>  I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is a national audit project (known as the &quot;contractors project&quot;) underway since July 2013, concerned with service professionals who provide services through a company under contract to third-party clients, including clients in the pharmaceutical industry referred to by the Deputy. </p><p>  In 2011, through normal audit activity, Revenue identified a potential issue in situations where professionals providing engineering  services formed companies (of which they were both directors and employees) which then contracted with client companies, often multinationals, for the provision of the services of the individual.  A characteristic of these companies was that they typically had no other business, and no non-director employees.  In a number of such cases examined, the level of expenses reimbursed tax free to the director/contractor was found to be excessive and in several cases included expenses which either had not been incurred at all, or were personal rather than business-related.</p><p>  A pilot project operated in Revenue's South West Region in 2012 and 2013 which  audited 119 companies with additional liability in 107 cases, and a further 24 directors of contractor companies have also agreed settlements.  The total additional tax liability was &euro;2,801,977.  Penalties of &euro;906,433 (32%) and interest of &euro;857,216 were imposed.  By this time it was clear that there was a pattern of behaviour which warranted a national audit project.  A list of companies was compiled from the business sectors identified in previous audits, where there were few or no employees apart from the directors, and which exhibited one of the following characteristics: (a) travel and subsistence expenses amounting to more than 20% of turnover; (b) other expenses amounting to more than 20% of turnover, or (c) the combination of both amounting to more than 25% of turnover.  The cases fell into the categories of professional, scientific and technical services (60%), information and communication services (38%) and certain administrative and support services (2%).  In addition to cases from this list, audits which remained open in the South West Region at 1 July 2013 were subsumed into the national project.</p><p>  Since 1 July 2013, a total of 385 company audit cases have been closed, with additional liability in 299 cases, and a further 49 directors of contractor companies have also agreed settlements.  Additional tax of &euro;5,969,630 has been identified, with penalties of &euro;1,765,995 (30%), and interest of &euro;1,639,623.  At the moment 368 companies remain under audit, and Revenue is now moving to bring these cases to finality.  Most of the audits now open indicated their intention to make a disclosure to Revenue some months ago and availed of a concession whereby Revenue agreed to allow additional time and to provide guidance in compiling disclosures.  Revenue has now written to those taxpayers advising that the process of preparing disclosures must be completed urgently if the benefits of voluntary disclosure (which encompass lesser penalty and non-publication provided certain specific conditions are met) are to be preserved. </p><p>  In the course of the contractors project it has become clear that the provision of services under contract is a large and growing practice with many thousands of contractors involved in a range of professional services sectors.  Many of these professional contractors operate companies in a traditional mode, where they employ staff, operate from an established place of business, and provide a range of specialised services on the open market.  For such companies, Revenue's project has generally found little or no additional tax liability arising from travel expenses.  Another, quite different type of contracting also exists in considerable numbers, where an individual's services are obtained, often through the facilitation of a recruitment agency, and a contract is concluded with the individual's company.  In some cases, a company may be provided to the individual for this purpose.  Typically, the work is done at the client's premises and the contractor's company has no other business.  Between these two types of contractor there are a huge number of individual variations.</p><p>  Revenue published two tax briefing articles in 2013 which made it clear that, where the services of an individual are being provided through an intermediary, as opposed to the traditional provision of goods or services to the market generally, the expenses which may be claimed against tax liability are similar to those that may be claimed by an employee.  Thus for example an individual going to work abroad under a contract must bear the cost of doing so him/herself regardless of whether the contract is with the person or with his/her company.  </p><p>  As the current phase of the contractors project comes to a conclusion, Revenue will review the outcomes in detail and decide how best to reflect them in future audit activity.  At the same time, Revenue will examine the impact of emerging practices in other areas, for example in the use of contractors operating abroad, to ensure that they pose no risks of loss to the exchequer.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-19a.107.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061900056#WRE01100"><p>To be eligible for an exemption from the charge to Local Property Tax (LPT), a liable person must obtain a certificate from a competent person, such as an engineer or a geologist, confirming the presence of significant pyritic damage and, I am informed, a liable person cannot claim the exemption until the relevant certificate has been issued in respect of the residential property concerned.  In the absence of this certificate, LPT must be paid in full or by means of one of the approved phased payment arrangements. </p><p>It is not clear from the Deputy's question whether the necessary sampling and testing of the sub-floor hardcore material has been carried out on foot of the results of the Building Condition Assessment and whether the relevant certificate has issued to the property owner.  Section 10A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that a temporary exemption from the charge to Local Property Tax (LPT) will apply for a period of at least three consecutive years for residential properties that have been certified under Regulations made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government as having &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot;.  </p><p>The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Pyrite Exemption) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 147 of 2013) require that residential property owners demonstrate significant pyritic damage in accordance with I.S. 398 Reactive Pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material Part 1, which was published in 2013 by the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  This standard provides guidance on the Building Condition Assessment, as well as on the sampling and testing to be carried out, to establish the presence of significant pyritic damage.</p><p>As regards the period from which the exemption can be claimed, the standard procedure is for property owners to start the period of exemption from the liability date following the issue of the certificate. The exemption is linked to the three year valuation period and, depending on when in a 3-year valuation cycle the certificate is issued, the exemption may last for up to five years.  For example, where a property owner received the relevant certificate in June 2014 then on 1 November 2014 (liability date for 2015) he/she can claim the exemption for the five year period of 2015 to 2019. Where a property qualifies for the exemption, it continues to apply even where the property is subsequently remediated before the end of the exemption period.  </p><p>As the Deputy can appreciate the rules governing when, and for how long, the exemption applies are complex and are best explained by the use of examples.  I am advised that further detailed information and examples on how the exemption for residential properties with significant pyrite damage operates are provided by the Department of Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government, , or they can be accessed from the LPT pages of the Revenue website .</p></reply>

This figure was shown coming from the NPRF and a note to the table indicated that the contribution from the exchequer was put at zero as the figure was calculated net of the proceeds from the share sale to private investors.</p><p>  In order to understand the background to this presentation, the relevant transactions need to be broken down into their component parts.  First the NPRF subscribed for its pro-rata share of the 2011 rights issue i.e. approximately &euro;1.2bn of ordinary shares and that is the figure shown in the table. Second there was a contractual agreement to sell approximately &euro;1bn of these rights issue shares to a North American investor consortium at the same price. Third there was the investment of &euro;1bn in Contingent Capital Notes (&quot;cocos&quot;) made by the Minister directly i.e. from exchequer funds. Fourth in order to mitigate the impact of this outlay on the exchequer, the Minister subsequently directed the NPRF to transfer the funds from the ordinary share disposal to the exchequer and this transfer is disclosed in the 2011 NPRF Annual Report. The coco investment and the disposal proceeds effectively offset each other and explain why the exchequer contribution in the table is shown as zero.</p><p>  The State's equity holding in Bank of Ireland was 36% on 1 January 2011 and post the NPRF's net &euro;0.2bn investment in the ordinary equity of the bank, the State's shareholding fell to 15.1%, if one includes approximately 0.1% held separately by the NPRF in a discretionary fund.  </p><p>  The disposal to the North American consortium completed in two tranches, with the first shares transferring on July 29th 2011 and the second on October 12th 2011. If the State had not agreed to sell a portion of the shares it was entitled to as part of the bank's rights issue, it would have maintained its stake at 36% but at a significant additional cost to the taxpayer during what was a very difficult period for the country. Moreover as I have said in recent days, the announcement that private investors were prepared to put money into Bank of Ireland at the time had significant knock on benefits for both the bank and the State itself.</p></reply>

In recent times, we have, for example, published alternative presentations of Exchequer returns, provided presentations and infographics along with the Budgetary material, published monthly revenues and expenditures of all sectors of general government and published working papers on selected issues. Consistent with the requirements of the two-pack, in October, alongside other euro area member states we will be publishing a draft budgetary plan for the first time, and the CSO will be publishing new data on contingent liabilities with potentially large impacts on public budgets, government guarantees, non-performing loans, and liabilities stemming from the operation of public corporations. Under the two-pack our economic forecasts are provided for endorsement to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, under my colleague Minister Brendan Howlin TD has expanded the information provided in the Expenditure Report to include performance budgeting information, comprehensive reviews of expenditure and a new public spending code.</p><p>  We have also taken part in an IMF Fiscal Transparency Assessment, and the recommendations from that report have been referred to a steering group for consideration and implementation as appropriate. This report includes recommendations relating to a public sector balance sheet and incorporating more information on revenue and expenditure flows in budget documentation.</p><p>  However, it is important to recognise that the provision of additional information adds a burden to my officials. Adding extra material must be considered carefully so as not to hamper the core forecasting and monitoring requirements that we are legally bound to provide and, which, as a consequence, is our priority. We will continue to improve the budgetary and financial information in all relevant documents, taking care to ensure that it is useful to stakeholders.</p></reply>

Cyprus, Greece, Portugal and Ireland did not have to present a DBP, as the surveillance took place in the context of the programme.  Therefore the assessment of the euro area was based on the 13 Member States that submitted DBPs.  In the case of Austria, Germany and Luxembourg, DBPs were submitted by outgoing governments and on a no-policy change basis.  Ministers carefully scrutinised and discussed each other's Draft Budgetary Plans. It was agreed that the fiscal plans for 2014 were broadly appropriate.  The Eurogroup welcomed the fact that no draft budgetary plan was found  to be in serious non-compliance with the obligations of the SGP and that consequently no resubmission of a DBP would be requested by the Commission. I agreed with my colleagues on this conclusion.  The Eurogroup concluded that fiscal consolidation efforts are delivering results and that the euro area is making its way out of the crisis.  The euro area's government debt level is expected to stabilise in 2014 and the deficit is planned to fall below 3 per cent of GDP.</p></reply>

This decision has been taken to give schools the flexibility to develop their Junior Cycle programme mindful of the educational needs of their own students and mindful of the principles, statements of learning and key skills as set out in the Framework.  In fact, the new Framework  includes a strong focus on education for active citizenship and the promotion of human rights and responsibilities.</p><p>  Education about active citizenship and human rights issues are an integral component of the Framework for Junior Cycle.  For example, one of the 24 'Statements of Learning', that encompass the key knowledge and skills that students will develop during their junior cycle, requires that students will &quot; value what it means to be an active citizen with rights and responsibilities in local and wider context&quot;.  In addition, the 8 key skills which underpin the new Framework for Junior Cycle, include &quot;working with others&quot; whereby students should realise and experience how they can &quot;contribute to making the world a better place&quot;.  As students will be expected to experience these principles, statements of learning and key skills, it is anticipated that education for active citizenship and education about human rights and responsibilities will continue to be an important part of the new Junior Cycle.</p><p>  I recently approved a new short course in CSPE that has been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).  This short course will be available to schools to implement from this September, should they wish to do so, as part of their Junior Cycle programme.  This programme is in fact designed for 100 hours of teaching compared to less than 70 hours for the existing CSPE syllabus.  The new short course aims to inform, inspire, empower and enable young people to participate as active citizens in contemporary society at local, national and global levels based on an understanding of human rights and social responsibilities.  One of the three strands in the short course focusses on 'rights and responsibilities'.  The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights (UNDHR), the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), are key documents which underpin the course. Informed by these documents, CSPE students will be expected to participate in activities which include designing a campaign to highlight a human rights issue.</p><p>  As with Junior Cycle, education about active citizenship and human rights issues are also reflected at Senior Cycle.  As part of transition year, students are afforded the opportunity to further interrogate some of the themes encountered in CSPE at Junior Cycle.  This is facilitated by the availability of resources and materials that have been developed by as number of NGOs, including Amnesty International, for use by transition year pupils.</p><p>  I have also indicated my intention to introduce 'Politics and Society' as a new optional Leaving Certificate subject.  One of the objectives of the draft syllabus, which has been developed by the NCCA, is to develop 'a sense of care for others and a respect for and a valuing of diversity in all areas of human life within the parameters of human rights principles'.  In addition, the draft syllabus is structured around four key areas. One of these areas is 'Active Citizenship'.  The Politics and Society subject will be made available to schools once the NCCA has advised my Department on a number of outstanding issues.</p></reply>

The type of evidence required is dependent on the applicant's individual circumstances.  Compelling independent evidence of irreconcilable estrangement must be provided to allow a grant awarding authority to fully satisfy itself that the conditions for the application of exemption are met.  Evidence from services, including the Courts services and the Health Service Executive, working in a professional capacity with the family or the student, which demonstrates and confirms the genuine and irreconcilable nature of the estrangement would generally be necessary for an awarding authority to satisfy itself of the veracity of the case.

A shared report of this Group Supporting a Better Transition from Second-Level to Higher Education was published in March 2013.The report contains three key commitments to:</p><p>-Reduce the number of level 8 degree programmes in higher education and make them more broadly-based;</p><p>-Reduce the number of grading bands (A1, A2, B1, B2 etc);</p><p>-Address problematic predictability in the Leaving Certificate exams.</p><p>The full report is published on the Department's website  Supporting a Better Transition from Second Level to Higher Education: Key Directions and next Steps&quot;,</p><p>Since the report was published the SEC and the NCCA have been looking at the extent of problematic predictability in the Leaving Certificate examinations.  These key state agencies also agreed to reduce the number of grading bands used in the Leaving Certificate Examinations, acknowledging that the very large number of grades was contributing to a culture of teaching to the test and rote learning.  Following discussions at 2 major consultation events of practitioners, students and other stakeholders as well as intensive discussion and analysis by the NCCA and the SEC, a new model for grading of the Leaving Certificate Examinations is emerging with eight grading bands (to replace 14 bands currently) based on 10% grading bands.Further information is available on the Department's website Key Directions Update &ndash; Easter 2014.</p><p>I am aware that in light of the high stakes nature of the Leaving Certificate examination system and the associated transition into higher education, that major changes will not occur without adequate notice being given to schools, students and parents.  The intention, therefore, is that any new arrangements will begin to be implemented on a phased basis with the first stages for those entering fifth year of second level in September 2015.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds such as nationality, organisational size, etc. and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. </p><p>  The Government acknowledges the significant role that SMEs play in the Irish economy and is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting. </p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the Office of Government Procurement has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'Meet the Buyer' events hosted nationwide.  These 'Meet the Buyer' events are run in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and Inter-Trade Ireland. To date the OGP has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide.  These events afforded suppliers an opportunity to meet and discuss the issues with public service buyers and provide networking opportunities for suppliers and encourage consortia-building.</p><p>  My Department has also recently finished reviewing and updating existing guidelines and procedures aimed at promoting SME participation in public procurement.  Circular 10/14, launched on 17 April, sets out new initiatives aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses that want to tender for public contracts and also to ensure that engaging with government procurement is easy and low cost.  The main thrust of the circular is as follows:</p><p>- buyers are advised to undertake market analysis prior to tendering in order to better understand the range of goods and services on offer, the competitive landscape, including the specific capabilities of SMEs etc.</p><p>- the circular promotes transparency in procurement by requiring supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 be advertised on the Government's electronic tendering portal, e-Tenders,;</p><p>- it encourages suppliers including SMEs to fully use e-Tenders and avail of its facilities in relation to registration, e-tendering and automatic alerts in relation to future tendering opportunities.</p><p>- buyers are encouraged not to set turnover thresholds at more than twice the estimated contract value and puts limits on insurance levels for suppliers where possible</p><p>- promotes greater use of &quot;open&quot; tendering and less use of &quot;restrictive&quot; tendering</p><p>- it  encourages SMEs to consider using consortia where they are not of sufficient scale to tender in their own right or where they may lack certain capabilities necessary to provide a compelling proposition</p><p>- it encourages Contracting Authorities to break large contracts down into lots where reasonable to do so. This enables smaller businesses to compete for these smaller elements of a larger contract. This has to be done in a way however that does not expose the State to undue risk or significant management overheads.</p><p>  The SME Working Group, established under the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, was consulted on the new Guidelines.   The new Circular has been broadly welcomed by industry representative associations.</p><p>  The SME Working Group is chaired by the Office of Government Procurement and includes representatives from ISME, IBEC, Inter Trade Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Competition Authority, the Small Firms Association, Chambers Ireland and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Ireland.  The focus of this group is to develop and monitor strategies for SME access to public procurement.  The group also has regard to actions aimed at maximising procurement opportunities for SME in the public sector. </p><p>  At EU level there is a growing recognition of the need to promote and facilitate SME participation in public procurement. The New EU Directives on Procurement are currently being transposed into Irish law by the Office of Government Procurement. They are intended to make it easier for businesses and SMEs to tender for public sector procurement contracts.  They are designed to simplify the rules and provide more flexibility for public purchasers.   The directives contain measures specifically designed to improve access for SMEs and start-ups. These include:</p><p>- A limitation on requirements for participation, to avoid unjustified barriers to SME participation.  In particular, except in justified cases, turnover requirements are explicitly limited to two times the estimated contract value.</p><p>- Acceptance of self-declarations will have to be accepted for evaluating the capacity and capability necessary to select them as tenderers until the award stage and the promotion of e-procurement with mandatory electronic availability of procurement documents;</p><p>- Contracting Authorities will now have to comply or explain in relation to the division of contracts into lots;</p><p>- Member states will be required to provide the Commission with detail on SME participation. Such monitoring can support consistent application across all Member States and ensure that the objective of greater SME involvement is being delivered.</p><p>  I am pleased to advise that my Department has accelerated some of the key measures contained within these new Directives and included them in the recent Circular 10/14 as set out above. </p><p>  The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.  The Office of Government Procurement will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.</p></reply>

No. 140 Freedom of Information Act, 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) Regulations 2014).  Irish Water will continue to be subject to FOI under the new legislation.  Records dating back to July 2013, the date of the establishment of Irish Water, are available under FOI.  Furthermore where a commercial state body provides a service under a contract to a public body subject to FOI, the records relating to that service will now be subject to FOI, following enactment of the new FOI legislation.  The case for extending the application of this principle to other commercial state bodies in a monopoly position will be considered in the context of Report Stage for the Bill. </p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note the following features of the new legislation:</p><p>- Extension of FOI to all public bodies as a default with limited exceptions as set out in the Bill bringing long-established high profile exclusions from FOI within remit; and to significantly funded bodies to enhance accountability of such bodies;</p><p>- Reversal of restrictions to Government records including the very wide definition of Government introduced in 2003, restoration of the strict definition of what constitutes a Cabinet record, communications between members of Government will no longer be exempt from FOI and restoration to the original five years of the ten-year prohibition on the release of Cabinet records;</p><p>- provision for some liberalisation of the mandatory 'class' exemption put in place in 2003 in relation to diplomatic communications and defence matters;</p><p>- Requirement by public bodies to prepare and furnish publication schemes to promote the proactive publication of information outside of FOI with the publication schemes encompassing at a minimum the requirements of the current  sections 15 and 16 of the 1997 Act;</p><p>- Provision of a number of key principles to guide public bodies in the performance of their functions under the Act to achieve greater openness and strengthen accountability;</p><p>- Extensions of the functions/powers of the Information Commissioner, provisions to ensure that FOI requests relating to information held electronically are dealt with effectively; </p><p>- Confirmation that there is a general right of access to records held by public bodies and in applying exemptions, the right of access should only be set aside where the exemptions very clearly support a refusal of access.</p><p>  The FOI Bill will, therefore, once it is enacted by the Oireachtas very significantly strengthen the legal framework for FOI in Ireland. </p></reply>

This in turn affects the social insurance benefits to which they are entitled.  Generally an individual is classified for PRSI purposes as an employee or as self-employed.</p><p>  Where an individual is classified as an employee PRSI is payable on their earnings by the employee and their employer.  Generally employees pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI class A.  Class A provides employees with entitlement to the full range of social insurance benefits including short term benefits in respect of illness, unemployment and maternity as well as long term benefits such as widow/widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension and State pension contributory.  Where an individual is classified as self-employed, he or she pays class S PRSI at the rate of 4% on their earned income from self-employment.  Those paying class S can have an entitlement  to certain short-term benefits (i.e. maternity benefit) as well as long term benefits such as  widow/widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension and State pension contributory.  In order to determine an individual's correct rate of PRSI, my department uses the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals.</p><p>  The report from the advisory group on tax and social welfare, published in May 2013, identified trends in the labour market which have resulted in some workers being classified as self-employed, whereas their employment characteristics would properly determine them as employees.  The report suggested that in some cases persons have falsely declared themselves as self-employed so as to avail of different tax treatment.  In other cases, employees have been falsely declared as self-employed so as to circumvent employer obligations under labour legislation.  If the Deputy can supply my department with the details of the specific case to which he is referring, I will be happy to have it investigated and the insurability determined under the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals.</p></reply>

The average time taken to answer a call in 2014, up to the end of May, was 3 minutes 55 seconds.  The Department endeavors to provide the most responsive phone service possible to its customers.  A call management system is in place across all headquarter buildings, including disability allowance, which allows managers to monitor and manage call volumes.  It provides a flexible means of managing sudden peaks in customer demand and allows for the active management of calls by way of assigning, where feasible, more staff to the phone lines at peak periods.  LoCall numbers have been in operation across the Department's scheme areas for many years.  This system has worked successfully in conjunction with the Interactive Voice Response technology to facilitate customers making contact with the appropriate section of the Department, at a low cost to the caller.  There are no plans to provide a single free phone number across the Department at this time.  In addition to the telephone service the Department provides a range of contact channels for customers including e-mail, SMS (text), through our website<i><i></i></i>and face-to- face.  In line with the principles of quality customer service, the Department keeps its contact channels options under review in order to make full use of new and emerging technologies to broaden the choice of service delivery channels for customers.</p><p>Furthermore, to equip staff to deal effectively with customers, the Department provides training in customer service which includes communicating effectively with customers, effective telephone techniques, active listening and the importance of understanding and empathy.

The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. </p><p>To be eligible for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, a person must:</p><p>- Permanently live in the State (exception may be made where EU regulations apply),</p><p>- Be aged under 66,</p><p>- Have started insurable employment or self-employment before the age of 56,</p><p>- Not work full-time, although for the purposes of this scheme, a person can work and earn less than &euro;38 gross per week,</p><p>- Care for a child (under 12) or an incapacitated person on a full-time basis. </p><p>It is important to note that the homemaker's scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions must also be satisfied.  These require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age. </p><p>The homemaker's scheme was introduced from 1994, and as with most schemes, this was without retrospective effect.  The possibility of backdating was considered in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions.  This found that that backdating it to 1953 would cost approximately &euro;160 million in additional spending annually.  The amount reduces to &euro;150 million if backdated to 1973/74.  However, this remains a very significant additional cost that would have to be met from either cuts in Exchequer spending, or increases in taxation.  Consequently, the Government has no plans to backdate this scheme prior to 1994.</p><p>Persons who have insufficient contributions to qualify for a full State pension (contributory), may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory).

Schemes for other types of lone parent families began to be introduced in 1970 when the first scheme for deserted wives was announced, followed by provision for unmarried mothers in 1973 and provision for prisoners' wives in 1974.  Following the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare (1986), a unified social assistance scheme for lone parents was introduced in 1990, known as the lone parent's allowance (LPA) to provide support for all lone parents, whether a man or a woman, and regardless of the circumstances which originally gave rise to their lone parenthood.  The one-parent family payment (OFP) scheme, which was introduced in 1997, builds on the LPA scheme.</p><p>  The number of OFP recipients stood at 77,400 in April, 2014.  The cost of the OFP scheme was &euro;935 million in 2013 and is estimated to be &euro;863 million in 2014.  Both the OFP maximum personal rate for the parent (&euro;188 per week) and the increase for each additional qualified child (&euro;29.80) remain untouched since 2011.  An OFP recipient can also earn up to an average of &euro;425 per week and still receive the OFP payment.  </p><p>  The OFP scheme has played an important role in providing income support to lone parents since its introduction.  However, in the past, this income support was passive in nature, with little systematic engagement being made by the State with recipients.  This engendered long-term social welfare dependency and associated poverty among one-parent families.</p><p>  Despite significant levels of State spending on OFP the results have been poor in terms of tackling poverty and social exclusion rates among lone parent families who continue to experience higher rates of 'consistent poverty' in comparison to the population generally.</p><p>  The reforms to the OFP scheme that were introduced in Budgets 2011, 2012, and 2013, aim to address these issues.  They aim to provide the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to escape poverty and joblessness, to participate in education and training and by entering the workforce to attain financial independence for both themselves and their families.</p><p>  The reforms to the OFP scheme also aim to bring Ireland's support for lone parents in line with international provisions &ndash; where there is a general movement away from long-term and passive income support.</p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, introduced changes to the OFP scheme, including the phased reduction of the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which a recipient's payment ceases to 7 years from 2014 for new entrants and from 2015 for existing recipients.  </p><p>  Special Provisions exist for customers who are in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) and, also, for those who are recently bereaved.  These savers can extend payment of the OFP beyond the maximum age limit threshold for these customers.</p><p>  OFP recipients affected by these changes are supported to transition to other social welfare income support payments as appropriate, including family income supplement (FIS), carer's allowance (CA) and jobseeker's allowance (JA) including the JA transitional arrangement.  </p><p>  Previous OFP recipients who avail of a jobseeker's payment are required to engage with the Department&rsquo;s activation service, where they are provided with access to a range of educational and employment supports to increase their skills and assist them in securing employment.  This is a significant reform for lone parents as it is the first time that this cohort has access to the Department's full activation process.  Lone parents, in receipt of a jobseeker's payment, who do not engage in the activation process, will be subjected to the same penalty rates and disallowances as every other jobseeker.</p><p>  The income disregard of the OFP scheme is also being reduced on a phased basis for new and existing recipients of the payment.  It is currently &euro;90 per week and will reduce to &euro;60 per week by 2016.  The OFP earnings disregard does seem to have played a role in facilitating lone parents to enter the workforce but it may also have had the effect of trapping lone parents in low-paid part-time employment in order to keep their earnings below the disregard.  The result is that, despite the fact that 36% of OFP recipients are in employment, relatively small numbers are moving off the OFP scheme because their earnings exceed the upper limit.</p><p>  The reforms to the OFP scheme aim to provide affected lone parents with access to a wide range of supports and services.  These supports are designed to enable lone parents' secure improved outcomes for themselves and their families by enhancing their prospects of securing long term financial independence.  </p></reply>

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  </p><p>  Any person of working age who does not qualify for jobseeker's benefit may claim means tested jobseeker's allowance.  Subject to means and other qualifying conditions, self-employed persons may claim jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or there is reduced demand for their services.  </p><p>  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person's income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  </p><p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.  </p><p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker's allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker's allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker's benefit. </p></reply>

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 8.5%).  </p><p>  Self-employed workers may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker's allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person's income from one year to the next are taken into consideration. </p><p>  It is recognised that the downturn in the economy had an impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels.  This may be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker's allowance purposes.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p><p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral. </p><p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker's allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker's allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker's benefit. </p><p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  </p><p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  </p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I will reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.</p></reply>

These decisions were taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.  For example,	there are currently 5.3 people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately 2.1 to 1 by 2060.  The over 65 year old population is also projected to increase from 11% of the total population in 2010 to 15% in 2020 and to 24% in 2060.</p><p>  There are approximately 17,000 additional pensioners coming into receipt of State pension each year.  In the absence of reform, it is estimated that State expenditure on pensions (including public sector occupational pensions) would increase from approximately 7.5% of GDP in 2010 to 11.7 % in 2060.  In 2013, the overall Departmental expenditure figure was &euro;20.2 billion and expenditure on pensions accounted for 32% of this.  </p><p>  Whilst the increase in life expectancy is a very welcome development, this also has obvious and significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision. The fundamental principle involved here is that longevity in the workforce needs to be supported if people are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement. </p><p>  A number of policy reports on pensions have been completed including a Green Paper on Pensions (2007) and a National Pensions Framework in 2010.  I commissioned the OECD Review of the Irish Pensions System which was completed in 2013.  </p><p>  Arising from the changing demographics described, these policy reports and the need to provide for sustainable pensions and longer working lives, a range of reforms have been introduced recently to the pension system as follows -</p><p> In January 2014, State pension age was standardised at age 66 with the cessation of State pension transition. The State pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.</p><p> With effect from April 2012, and as provided for in legislation in 1997, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions.</p><p> As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension were introduced. These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.</p><p> As announced in Budget 2012, the period for which a claim for State pension can be backdated is six months. This change came into effect in April 2012.</p><p>From December 2013, the number of paid contributions required for Widow&rsquo;s/Widower&rsquo;s/ Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s pension increased from 156 contributions to 260 contributions.</p><p>  It is also planned to introduce a &ldquo;total contributions approach&rdquo; to determine eligibility for a State pension. The level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life. The proposed date for the introduction of a move to a total contributions approach is 2020, but this may be subject to change. </p><p>  It is Government policy through the provision of generous tax reliefs to support private supplementary pension saving to allow individuals cater for an adequate income in retirement.  The Deputy will be aware the Government has previously highlighted its concern at the currently low supplementary pension coverage rate of approximately 50% of workers.  This is why the Programme for Government includes a commitment to reforming Ireland&rsquo;s pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers. </p><p>  The OECD Review of the Irish Pensions System provides an international perspective on Ireland&rsquo;s retirement-income provision. Whilst endorsing pension policy reforms undertaken to date, the report also makes a number of recommendations for future reform. The OECD&rsquo;s key recommendation is to improve the adequacy and sustainability of pensions by increasing coverage in the funded part of the pensions system through a universal mandatory or quasi-mandatory employment based pension system. </p><p>  The OECD has indicated in its report that its first preference is a mandatory scheme, with its second preference being automatic enrolment, whereby people would be automatically enrolled but could opt out.  I have previously stated that a soft-mandatory approach such as that envisaged by an auto-enrolment scheme, using scale to achieve greater cost efficiencies for the member, has been proven a successful and proactive way in which we can increase supplementary pension coverage.  However, it is recognised that introduction of any such initiative would be best supported by a more favourable economic environment than is currently the case.  The recommendations contained within the OECD report are currently being considered.</p></reply>

This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and   </p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are under way and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. </p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched.  While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns.  Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. </p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.  This commitment is a clear expression of the Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. </p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network.  It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users.  The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is under way in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention.  I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out.  This list is available on my Department's website, .  Currently, a total of 40 areas in County Meath have been identified as requiring an intervention.  This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise.  Further locations may be identified as this process continues.  Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention.  I expect that this mapping exercise will be concluded in the autumn. </p><p>I would point out that the EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard, I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 36 fibre-based broadband networks in County Meath by July 2016.</p><p>I would emphasise to the Deputy that in line with EU State Aid Guidelines the State will set timelines for investment commitments to be met by commercial operators.  If such investments have not happened within the timelines, the State will have to intervene so as to ensure nationwide access to high speed broadband services.</p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end strategy for the State led intervention.  It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed strategy.  EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised.  This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

Testing</i>has been carried out in a number of the buildings/dwellings on the sites identified which has confirmed the presence of deleterious material (sulphates/pyrite) in the blocks.  The solution identified in those cases appears to be for demolition and rebuilding.  Further testing is being carried out on other buildings/dwellings on the sites identified and the results will determine the appropriate course of action in respect of those dwellings/buildings.   </p><p>Remediation of construction defects is a matter for resolution between the contracting parties and my Department understands that in each case the costs of resolution are being pursued, in the first instance, with the relevant contractors and suppliers in accordance with the terms and conditions of the construction contracts .   </p><p>The pyrite remediation scheme, which was published by the Pyrite Resolution Board in February of 2014, was developed having regard to the recommendations set out in the report of the independent Pyrite Panel and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Pyrite Resolution Act 2013.  The Panel was established in September 2011 to explore options for a resolution to the problem of pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material which at that time had manifested itself in dwellings in a number of areas.  The Panel reported to the Minister in July 2012.   </p><p>It is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  It is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with <i>I .S. 398 - 1 :2013 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol</i>.  In addition, applicants under the scheme must be able to demonstrate to the Board that they have no practicable options, other than under the scheme, to secure the remediation of their homes.   The scheme applies to dwellings in the five local authority areas identified in the pyrite report - Meath, Kildare, Offaly and the administrative areas of Dublin City and Fingal.  The Panel identified those areas following an extensive consultation process.   </p><p>The Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 provides the statutory framework for the pyrite remediation scheme and while the Act provides that the scheme can be amended, replaced or revoked, this can only be done in accordance with the scope of the Act.  The provisions of the Act apply only to dwellings affected by significant damage attributable to pyritic heave consequent on the presence of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material and not to damage arising in any other circumstance. </p><p>In this context, the scheme cannot be extended to include pyritic damage, or other forms of damage, which is not provided for in the Act.   </p></reply>

In addition, the legislation also provides that disbursements from the Fund may be made for purposes of community benefit.</p><p>In accordance with the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2012, the objectives underpinning disbursements from the Dormant Accounts Fund remain unchanged; allocations will continue to focus on programmes or projects to assist the personal and social development of persons who are economically disadvantaged, the educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged and persons with a disability.</p><p>A new Disbursement Scheme was prepared, in accordance with the 2012 Act , after consultation with various Ministers , including the Minister for Health, the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Social Protection.

My Department, together with Pobal, is currently in consultation with the Minister for Health, the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Social Protection and other Ministers as appropriate in relation to the Action Plan, which I expect to be finalised in the coming weeks.  Under Government Accounting procedures, disbursements on Dormant Accounts measures are paid in the first instance &ldquo;up front&rdquo; from the relevant Department&rsquo;s Vote in the same way as with any other spending programme. Government Departments have to source funding for Dormant Accounts programmes from their Exchequer allocation in the annual Estimates process.</p><p>Once spending takes place, it is reimbursed to the Exchequer from the Dormant Accounts Fund in the form of Appropriations-in-Aid payable through each Department&rsquo;s Vote. The Government Departments will ensure that disbursements will have regard for the three themes set out in the Act, the priorities and policies of Government and the availability of monies within Departments for the proposals and measures to be adopted under the Action Plan.  These are the first rounds of preparation of a Disbursement Scheme and Action Plan under the 2012 Act.  The Department will review the experience involved in advance of the preparation of the next iteration of the Disbursement Scheme and Action Plan.</p></reply>

Housing authorities do, on occasion, accept households on to RAS where they have been less than 18 months on rent supplement. This occurs where there are exceptional circumstances and where a long term housing need can be demonstrated. This has been applied in respect of homeless persons and for households with special needs.  Bringing persons into RAS before the 18 month period has elapsed has also been applied administratively to facilitate a landlord who is bringing a number of properties across with tenants on rent supplement for different periods. It has also been used to facilitate persons moving back to employment.</p></reply>

This compares with a figure of 19% at the 2009 local elections.  The lack of equality in participation by women in politics has been recognised as a lacuna in public life for some time and I welcome this small, but important, increased level of representation by women in local government.  The Government is committed to further improving the participation of women in politics and has introduced legislation linking the State funding of political parties under the Electoral Act 1997 to the achievement of a gender balance in candidate selection at D&aacute;il general elections.</p><p>  Part 6 of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 provides that in order to receive full State funding, a qualified political party must select at least 30% women candidates and at least 30% men candidates at the next general election. Seven years from the next general election, this will rise to 40% commencing at the general election held next after that. Payments made to political parties will be reduced by half in the event that this condition is not fulfilled. The provision is designed as an incentive mechanism to encourage political parties to apply a more equal gender balance in the selection of candidates.</p></reply>

I strongly believe that the new CFP will achieve that goal.</p><p>  A key element of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of the MSY Principle (Maximum Sustainable Yield). This should lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for Irish fishermen and more sustainable fishing patterns.</p><p>  The reform also contains a commitment to continue and further strengthen conservation measures in the biologically sensitive areas, including that off the South and West coast of Ireland (new Irish box). This commitment will also protect the livelihoods of coastal communities, including those families depending on the sector, by ensuring that fish are allowed to grow to maturity, are more plentiful and fished in an environmentally responsible manner. A new framework of Technical measures will also be introduced to avoid and minimise catches of juvenile fish.</p><p>  Following months of intense lobbying and negotiation, I recently secured &euro; 148m of EU funding for the period 2014 to 2020.  This will support the fishing industry adapt to the new CFP and support development of the Irish seafood industry and the coastal communities and families that depend upon it. Ireland must now prepare a programme setting out the arrangements for spending the fund and submit this to the Commission by 20 October 2014.</p><p>My Department has been working on the new Operational Programme since 2013 and has engaged with stakeholders on a number of occasions to date.

These measures enhance the possibility of achieving Ireland&rsquo;s ambitious growth strategy for the agri food sector, as envisaged in Food Harvest 2020.</p><p>  In particular the CAP Reform package established agreement on the basic share of the direct payment and on rural development reforms, which secures the production base of the Irish meat and livestock sectors.  This in turn leaves farmers and other operators at the production base of the agri food sectors better positioned to both meet the competitive challenges and exploit the export opportunities of the international marketplace.</p><p>  The agri-food industry is Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous manufacturing industry.  Collectively the industry is responsible for some 140,000 jobs and has an annual output of more than &euro;20 billion, with a huge reliance on exports. </p><p>  Given this importance of exports, I have consistently placed great emphasis on developing relationships in new and expanding markets for all Irish meats and dairy products in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future. I am continuing to work with industry to raise the profile of the Irish agri-food sector generally.</p><p>  Notwithstanding current difficulties, there is a strong demand for meat globally and my focus continues to be to enable Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise. My Department engages on a daily basis with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassies&rsquo; personnel on market access issues. These initiatives have led to a number of notable successes in securing agreement to import from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran which allow the import of Irish beef. To date in 2014, the Lebanon has agreed to re-open its market to Irish beef, sheepmeat and cooked meats. A certificate has also been agreed with Hong Kong allowing for the export of Irish sheepmeat and agreement has been reached with Namibia on a certificate for the export of beef, sheepmeat and goatmeat.</p><p>  On the dairy side my Department strongly supported the decision to abolish milk quotas on the basis that quotas were widely regarded, by both the Irish dairy sector and market analysts, as a brake on the potential of the sector to respond positively to market opportunities.  All indications are that the abolition of quotas next April will bring about an expansion in the sector as the industry begins, in earnest, the quest to achieve the 50% increase in production target it set for itself in Food Harvest 2020. For my part I have been working on a number of fronts to prepare the industry for the move to a quota free environment and equip it to respond to the market opportunities arising.</p><p>  There is no doubt that the realisation of this increased production target will be dependent on the achievement of maximum efficiency at production and processing levels.  It will require particular focus on the changes needed in milk processing, in on-farm competitiveness and in the transfer of technology and knowledge to dairy farmers.  It will also require investment in R&amp;amp;D and in marketing.  The Irish dairy sector is well placed to deliver on those objectives. Significant progress has already been made in gearing the industry up to meet the challenge of a liberalised market.  At farm level my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, has been providing support to milk producers through various measures:  The Dairy Efficiency Programme has provided assistance to help improve skill sets and increase on-farm efficiency, so that they can achieve better economic returns.  More enhanced Knowledge Exchange measures are being proposed under the new Rural Development Programme. The Dairy Equipment Scheme encouraged capital investment to ensure farmers are equipped to gear up for expansion and a follow on Scheme is also proposed under the new Rural Development Programme.  Support for AHI and ICBF programmes to improve animal health and genetics are helping to position the milk production sector to capitalize on the market opportunities afforded by an increasing global population and expanding demand for dairy products. At processor level, the major players in the sector are currently engaged in significant capital investment and expansion to prepare themselves for the increased production.  The promoters of these expansion plans are confident that the demand from emerging markets will ensure strong returns for their dairy products.  Over 85% of Irish dairy production is exported and growth in global population is forecast to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products. </p></reply>

I have sought to ensure that beef farmers have the necessary supports to enhance the profitability and sustainability of their livestock enterprises.  The broad outline for developing the beef industry in Ireland was set out in my Department&rsquo;s Food Harvest 2020 (FH2020) strategy.  The Beef Activation Group was established in February 2011 to consider the steps necessary to achieve the targets for the beef sector contained in the FH 2020 strategy.  FH 2020 initiatives have had a positive impact on the beef sector since 2010 include: the launch by Bord Bia of the Origin Green Programme; the retention in 2012 of the Suckler Cow Welfare Programme; an increase in the number of advisors dedicated to beef in Teagasc; a trebling of the number of farmers in the ICBF Herdplus Programme; the launch of the Beef Technology Adoption Programme in 2012, worth &euro;5m per year; the extension of the Teagasc / IFJ BETTER Farm Beef Programme to cover every county in Ireland.</p><p>  This year, I announced details of an investment package worth up to &euro;40m to beef farmers in 2014, aimed at sustaining a critical mass in the suckler cow herd, the seedbed for our beef industry.  This package includes: &euro;23m for the Beef Genomics Scheme; &euro;10m for the Beef Data Programme; &euro;5m for the Beef Technology Adoption Programme; &amp;amp; &euro;2m in residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme.  I also announced details in relation to the financial allocations for the new Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 (RDP) as well as outlines of the proposed measures for inclusion.  The development of a new RDP will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.</p><p>  Under the new RDP, beef suckler farmers will be eligible for participation under a range of measures, including: a substantial new agri-environment/climate scheme (GLAS), which will build on the progress made under REPS and AEOS.  This will provide for a maximum payment of &euro;5,000 for up to 50,000 farmers and a further payment of up to &euro;2,000 for a limited number of farmers who take on particularly challenging actions; continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now known as Areas of Natural Constraint) to the tune of about &euro;195 million per year; incentives for on-farm capital investment, including support for the expansion of the dairy sector following the abolition of milk quotas in 2015; knowledge transfer and innovation measures, aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions; a new beef data and genomics measure worth up to &euro;52 million per year aimed at improving the genetic quality of the beef herd; a separate strand of the support for on-farm capital investment will be ring-fenced for young farmers at a higher rate of aid intensity of 60%; &amp;amp; other supports aimed at collaborative farming, artisan producers, organic farming etc.</p><p>  The Government is confident that this range of measures will, when taken together with other Pillar I direct payments, assist suckler farmers to improve their on farm viability. </p><p>  Another aspect of my strategy for the continued development of the beef sector is to constantly develop relationships with existing and in new and expanding international markets, raising the profile of Ireland and increasing international confidence in Irish production and control systems. Since taking office I have led trade missions to China, the US, Algeria and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the Middle East. The US has lifted its ban on the importation of beef from the European Union and my Department is currently working with the meat industry to advance the various technical requirements to ensure commencement of trade at the earliest possible date. </p><p>  There is a strong demand for meat globally and my focus is aimed at enabling Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise. My Department engages on a daily basis with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassies&rsquo; personnel, on market access issues. These initiatives have led to a number of notable recent successes in securing market access from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran.  This year to date we have agreed access terms with the Lebanon and Namibia. In 2013 the value of beef exports is estimated to have increased by 10%, driven by a 5% rise in output and a similar jump in average prices. As a result, exports were valued at &euro;2.1 billion. I expect that our export performance will continue to improve.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s investment this year in the beef sector is a strong vote of confidence in the sector. It exemplifies the smart, green growth initiatives envisioned in the FH2020 strategy and, coupled with additional support measures under the new Rural Development Programme, will underpin the development of a sustainable beef sector with long-term growth potential.</p><p>  I recently launched a beef roundtable to bring together the various stakeholders to discuss current issues. There have already been a number of initiatives in the wake of this forum. These include: The Beef Roundtable discussions will reconvene quarterly to exchange intelligence on market developments and forecasts particularly in relation to supply, demand, prices, product specifications, retail changes etc; I have committed to launching a &lsquo;Beef Pricewatch&rsquo; online tool to make price information more accessible and free of charge to farmers.  Work has commenced and already as an initial step the department has improved  its website in order to make price information more user friendly for farmers.</p><p>  My Department is examining the possibility of legislating for the recognition of producer organisations in the beef sector, and will shortly be launching a consultation with key stakeholder groups in this regard.  This initiative could provide a vehicle for collective action by farmers in a way that can give them the advantages of scale and market presence, as well as a useful vehicle for transferring technology and expertise to improve profitability at farm level.  My  Department will prioritise its targeted on-farm capital investments for suckler farmers through the new Rural Development Programme; Bord Bia has allocated &euro;0.5m to expand and target promotion of Irish beef through its campaigns in the UK and in certain continental markets.</p><p>  During the first beef forum, I had requested Mr. Michael Dowling, Chairman of the Beef Activation Group, to review the implementation of the Group&rsquo;s report, after intensive consultation with all stakeholders. That report has been delivered, and I have asked roundtable participants to reflect on its recommendations.</p></reply>

Levels of discards in the EU vary depending on the size and nature of the fishery.  Ireland has been to the forefront in the drive to reduce and eliminate discards for many years and I was delighted to launch an Irish &ldquo;discard&rdquo; atlas in 2011, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet targeting whitefish on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  This was the first publication of its kind and placed Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards and assisted in advancing the case for a phased elimination of discards as part of the CFP reform package.</p><p>  Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish was a major component of the negotiations for the reform of Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) which were concluded under the Irish Presidency in 2013.  To this end I was pleased that agreement was finally reached whereby a practical and phased discards policy or landing obligation will be introduced, beginning in 2015.  The phasing in period means that fishermen will have time to adjust and implement changes that will allow for the avoidance of non target species where there are particular problems with the relevant by-catch (such as that the stock is overfished and needs to be allowed to rebuild).</p><p>  In that context, I have established a national Discards Implementation Group, under the Chairmanship of Dr. Noel Cawley, to advise on the issues arising in the effective implementation of the new policy and to recommend practical solutions and arrangements that take into account the situation of the Irish industry.  The primary aim of the group is ensure that the Irish fishing industry are fully prepared for, and engaged in, the implementation of the discards ban.</p><p>  The work of Dr. Cawley&rsquo;s group also contributes directly to the work of the regional group of Member States (Ireland, Belgium, France, UK, Netherlands and Spain) who have the primary responsibility in the development of specific &lsquo;Discard Plans&rsquo; for fisheries in north western waters.  The first of these, for pelagic fisheries, will come into effect on 1 January 2015.  From the outset of the Common Fisheries Policy revision process, Ireland&rsquo;s overarching goal was to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to safeguard fish stocks for future generations.  I strongly believe that the new CFP will achieve that goal.</p><p>  The new CFP, in particular the phased elimination of discarding will mean real meaningful reform to how EU waters are fished in the future.  The agreement is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters, utilising best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas in the future.  It will provide the framework for the long term sustainability of fish stocks around our shores, the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processing while supporting the communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.  The new CFP will support the rebuilding of fish stocks in European waters and will allow for setting TACs and quotas to reflect catches when a landing obligation is introduced on the basis that for the first and subsequent years, discarding of that stock will no longer be allowed. In the longer term as fish stocks reach and are maintained at healthy levels, it will support increased fishing opportunities for our fishermen.</p></reply>

This Plan sets out the practical measures that will be taken to advance the National Disability Strategy over the period 2013 to 2015.</p><p>  Progress on the Implementation Plan is reviewed by the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group (NDSIG) through thematic meetings which deal with specific issues.  Such meetings are attended by all relevant bodies to ensure cross-sectoral input and review.  All actions in the Plan relevant to the chosen issue are discussed and the progress made is mapped against commitments in the Plan.  Two such thematic meetings were held in quarter 4 of 2013 and focussed on the themes of Irish Sign Language and Housing.  The next themed meeting in quarter 3 of 2014 will focus on employment.  In addition to the ongoing implementation of the actions being undertaken by the relevant Government Departments two new initiatives are currently being progressed.  These are the drafting of a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities and a review of the Implementation Plan with respect to how it addresses the needs of people with autism.</p><p>  At my request, the National Disability Authority (NDA) and Mr. Christy Lynch (founder member of the Irish Association of Supported Employment) have initiated the drafting of a comprehensive employment strategy.  A draft framework for the Strategy was agreed by the Senior Official's Group on Disability on 30 July 2013 and subsequently issued for consultation with all relevant stakeholders in August.  Work is ongoing to finalise this Strategy.</p><p>  I have also requested the NDA to examine how the Implementation Plan reflects the needs of people with autism.  The NDA, as part of that examination, engaged in a consultation exercise with autism stakeholders and examined existing service provision across relevant departments for people with disabilities.  The outcome of this process is under review by the NDSIG before further consideration of the issue will be under taken by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy.</p></reply>

The Deputy will also be aware that the Prison Service must accept all persons committed by the courts into custody and does not have the option of refusing committals.  I am informed by the Irish Prison Service  that as of Wednesday 18 June 2014, there was a total of 34 women were in custody in Limerick Prison.  A Business Case for the Modernisation of Prison Facilities in Limerick Prison is currently being drafted by the Irish Prison Service. Part of the proposed redevelopment includes the provision of high quality prison accommodation for female prisoners with capacity of approximately 50 individual cells and 8 custodial apartments.</p><p>  The Irish Prison Service provides to those in custody a wide range of rehabilitative programmes, which have the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead non-offending lives on release.  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning through Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.</p><p>  On 6 March 2014 the IPS published a Women&rsquo;s Strategy entitled &quot;An Effective Response to Women Who Offend in March 2014.  The Women&rsquo;s Strategy  sets out how the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service will work together, as well as with other statutory, community and voluntary sector partners, to provide women-focused interventions to help reduce offending, improve opportunities for reintegration and to improve outcomes more generally.  This co-operative approach is a direct result of the Joint Strategy published last year which aims delivers more effective offender management.</p><p>  I am informed that the IPS has also been expanding the number of accredited vocational courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years.  Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled the Irish Prison Service to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.  Female offenders in Limerick Prison now have the opportunity to avail of this certified training in the laundry and in industrial cleaning.</p><p>  Educational services are available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies including the VECs, Public Library Services, colleges and the Arts Council.  The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole-time teacher equivalents, which has remained unaltered since 2007.

The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 defines "hatred" by reference to race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation.  Directive 2012/29/EU establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime is a separate EU instrument.  This does not address the criminalisation of incitement to hatred.  It includes a requirement for the individual assessment of victims to identify specific protection needs and to determine whether, and to what extent, they would benefit from special measures in the course of criminal proceedings due to their particular vulnerability to secondary or repeat victimisation, intimidation or retaliation.  Such assessments include the personal characteristics of the victim.  Recital 56 of the directive indicates that personal characteristics, in this context, includes "gender and gender identity or expression".  The Member States are required to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the directive by November, 2015.</p></reply>

Section 35 of the 2009 Act, which entered into operation on 1 December 2009, contains specific provisions in respect of easements acquired by prescription, i.e. acquired on the basis of long enjoyment of the easement concerned. It originally provided that such an easement would be acquired at law only on registration in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds of a court order under that section.</p><p>  Parts 12 and 13 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 contain amendments to the 2009 Act and the Registration of Title Act 1964 which simplify the procedures for acquiring easements based on prescription. These amendments permit the Property Registration Authority to register such easements without a court order under section 35 of the 2009 Act where the Authority is satisfied that there is an entitlement to it. However, where the Authority is not satisfied that there is such an entitlement, e.g. where there is disagreement as to its existence between the parties concerned, a court order under section 35 of the 2009 will continue to be required. This is similar to the procedure which applies in respect of applications for registration of title based on adverse possession of the land.</p><p>  The updated rules applicable to the new arrangements are set out in the Land Registration Rules 2012 (S.I. No. 483 of 2012) and 2013 (S.I. No. 389 of 2013) which are available on the Authority's web site (www.prai.ie).</p><p>  I have no plans at present to make any further amendments to the law in relation to easements as set out in Part 8 (Chapter 1) of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 and the Registration of Title Act 1964.</p></reply>

An application fee of &euro;175 is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a fee is payable by applicants on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.  The certification fees were last changed in 2008.</p><p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  Every application must be assessed to establish if the statutory requirements are met.  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process. I might also add that following the grant of citizenship it is no longer necessary for the person concerned to register their presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau which requires the payment of a fee of &euro;300 per registration.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware formal citizenship ceremonies have been introduced at no extra cost to applicants.  These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.</p><p>  All of the fees payable under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 are kept under ongoing review by my Department.</p></reply>

They were found to be of no relevance to Ireland, given our regulated fluoridation levels. The view of the Expert Body is that the overall design of the studies is poor and they do not provide evidence of any effect on children's IQ from either high or low fluoride levels. This view was shared by SCHER (Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks) in its 2011 Review. </p><p>  The review by Choi is the only paper on fluoride quoted in the report referred to by the Deputy. The report is a review, which contains no new data. The researchers have labelled chemicals as neurotoxicants without indicating how they arrived at the conclusion or whether other agencies agree with them. It should be noted that the Deans of Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Dental Medicine continue to support water fluoridation as a safe public health measure for people of all ages. </p><p>  The Department of Health keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review. As part of this ongoing work, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population and on the environment is being conducted by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department. This review will be completed by December 2014.</p></reply>

The move towards individualised budgeting will also mirror the wider changes in the health sector described in Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 &ndash; 2015, which envisages a migration towards a more person-centred service and a closer alignment between funding and the outcomes.</p><p>Individualised budgeting may take many forms, ranging from a method of determining resource allocation to agencies based on assessed client need and actual costs, to a money follows the person   model, a brokerage system or a personal budget model administered by the individual service user.  Further work is necessary before decisions can be taken on the form or forms which individualised budgeting will take, but the essence of it will be that the individual is given more choice and control over how the money allocated to meet their needs is utilised.  </p><p>The move towards an individualised budgeting framework raises legal and practical issues, and will require careful consideration and planning. <i>Future Health</i>explains that central to the introduction of individualised budgeting will be suitable financial systems; transparent and comprehensive governance arrangements; a National Standard Needs Assessment framework; underpinning legislation and the introduction of a regulatory system for providers to ensure quality and safety for the recipients of social services.</p><p>Demonstration projects are already underway to examine the practical aspects of introducing this major change in the disability sector and to establish the costs and benefits.  An analysis of the projects will commence towards the end of 2014 to determine their wider applicability, clarify the issues which must be resolved before the projects can be scaled up, and identify the best way forward.  The completion of this analysis is a primary recommendation in the VFM Review and is required for all significant public service expenditure proposals.   </p></reply>

In order to mitigate the impact on frontline services of the reduction in employment numbers, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.  The Haddington Road Agreement provided the health service with over 5 million additional employee hours.  These hours are being used to replace staff who have left, to allow for further employment reductions and to reduce spending on agency and overtime. Subject to approval by senior managers, arrangements are in place in the HSE to allow the recruitment of staff where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement.  In addition, the HSE continues to fill a significant number of development posts in line with service priorities identified by Government. </p><p>  The HSE is aware of the need to address orthodontic waiting times and commissioned an independent national review of orthodontic services to give guidance as to what changes will be desirable.  The review has now been completed. The key issue highlighted by the review, which has assessed services nationally, is that the Orthodontic Service should be fully integrated within the Primary Care Service. This is under consideration by the HSE to be implemented as part of the HSE's reform programme. In addition, an initiative to reduce waiting times through the provision of additional services is currently being explored by the HSE. In the Dublin North East area a pilot scheme, which will involve the use of orthodontic therapists, is being introduced.  It is expected that these changes will have a positive impact on waiting times.</p></reply>

At the last Census in 2011, there were approximately 535,000 people aged over 65 in the population, representing an increase of 14.4% since 2006.  By 2041 there will be an estimated 1.3 million to 1.4 million people aged over 65 years, representing 20-25% of the total population.   The greatest increases are expected in the over-80 years age group, where numbers are expected to increase four-fold from 110,000 in 2006 to about 440,000 in 2041.</p><p>  The Programme for Government committed to completing and implementing the National Positive Ageing Strategy (NPAS).  The Strategy was published and launched in April 2013 outlining Ireland's vision for ageing and older people. The Strategy contains a large number of action areas around older people's participation in society, health and social care provision, financial and physical security, and the need for an evidence-based approach to policy making. Preparations are now in train for the implementation of the National Positive Ageing Strategy and the arrangements for this implementation will be finalised as soon as possible. The needs of our older people are, and will remain, a very high priority for  the Government, and the resources that are available will always be applied to provide the best possible mix of supports and services. </p><p>  Residential care in Ireland is provided through a mix of public, voluntary and private nursing home facilities. Most of the residents receive significant financial support towards the cost of their care under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. While there will always be a need for long-term residential care, older people have consistently said that they want to be facilitated and supported to stay in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.   Accordingly the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme which is currently being undertaken is considering how residential and other supports and services should be balanced in the future to  support older people in ways that best  meet their wishes and that make the best possible use of available resources. As a first step, in 2014 an additional &euro;23m has been provided to strengthen community and home-based services and to develop more flexible and responsive approaches to care.   This is in addition to the budget of &euro;315m already provided for home help and home care package services which are delivered to some 56,000 people at any one time.</p><p>  With the above said, the Government is acutely aware of the implications for service requirements of the projected demographic trends, and all relevant information will be taken account of in future decisions.</p><p>A   key priority identified in the HSE's National Service Plan for 2014 is the implementation of a Single Assessment Tool (SAT) for older people. This standardised framework will uniformly assess dependency levels, allow resources to be targeted towards those with the greatest needs and enable supports and services to be designed in the most appropriate way possible. The first phase of implementation of the SAT will commence in 2014 with a minimum of 50% of all new entries to the NHSS, Home Care Package and Home Help Schemes assessed by the SAT in the last quarter of 2014, with full implementation of SAT by the end of 2015.</p></reply>

However, it is generally accepted internationally that healthcare costs are rising and will continue to do so into the future.  </p><p>  There a number of factors which are driving health costs upwards year on year including an ageing population, an increase in chronic diseases, the development of new cost-intensive medical technologies and a rise in public expectations.  </p><p>  Ireland is not immune from these trends.  We are now in the midst of relatively rapid population ageing, and this is a trend which will continue over a number of decades.  Over the next few years, the population aged 65 and over will increase by approximately 20,000 per year. By 2021, the population over the age of 65 will have increased by close to 40% since 2011, representing an additional 200,000 people. Chronic diseases and their risk factors are also major drivers of healthcare costs - 80% of health spending relates to chronic conditions &ndash; as well as associated economic losses.  By 2020 the number of adults with chronic conditions (such as overweight and obesity, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cancer and dementia) will have increased by around 40% with relatively more of the conditions affecting those in the older age groups. An additional factor in driving health costs upwards is the advances in the development of highly cost-intensive medical technologies and treatments.  </p><p>  I believe that managing the impact of these significant financial, resource and demographic pressures on the health system in Ireland in the years ahead, while delivering safe and high quality health and social care services, will only be possible by way of a reformed health system.  That is why the Government is committed to ending the present unfair, unequal and inefficient two-tier health system and to introducing a single-tier system, supported by universal health insurance.  This reformed system will provide access according to need rather than ability to pay. It will deliver best outcomes for available resources and will treat patients at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, effective and efficient and as close to home as possible.</p><p>  In addition, I am also keen to shift the emphasis towards health prevention, promotion and improvement in the years ahead.  This has already begun through the Healthy Ireland policy framework which represents a whole-of-Government and cross-sectoral approach to addressing the growing demands on health services due the increase in the incidence of chronic illnesses and an ageing population. Protecting health and putting in place targeted, cross-sectoral and cost-effective prevention programmes and policies will assist in reducing the prospect of unaffordable future health costs which will certainly arise if current health trends are not addressed.  </p></reply>

It is therefore important to make the most efficient use of resources in healthcare delivery.  This requires, inter alia, increasing emphasis on models of care that treat patients at the lowest level of complexity and provide safe quality services at the least possible cost.  This is particularly important in the light of increased demand for services arising from population growth, increased levels of chronic disease, increased demand for drugs and new costly medical technologies and treatments.  </p><p>  That is why the Government is committed to ending the present unfair, unequal and inefficient two-tier health system and to introducing a single-tier system, supported by universal health insurance which will provide access according to need rather than ability to pay. The reformed system will deliver best outcomes for available resources and will treat patients at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, effective and efficient and as close to home as possible.</p><p>  Primary Care is widely recognised as a cost effective way to deliver essential health care services and the implementation of the Primary Care Strategy is a priority for this Government.  The Strategy involves a move away from the older hospital centred model to focusing on the delivery of care in the community and home.  In a developed primary care system, 90 to 95 per cent of people&rsquo;s day-to-day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting, providing &lsquo;the right care, in the right place, at the right time&rsquo;, where people have direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of GPs, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and other health care disciplines thus avoiding more expensive acute treatment.  Since this Government came into power in March 2011, 37 primary care centres have opened and infrastructure development is underway or at an advanced planning stage at a further 43 locations where delivery is expected over the period 2014 to 2016/early 2017. The HSE also plans to enhance the services of existing Community Intervention Teams during 2014 with an increased emphasis on helping people avoid hospital admission or return home earlier.  </p><p>  The Department of Health and the HSE are also focussed on implementing the Government&rsquo;s reform programme for acute hospitals including establishment of acute hospitals into a small number of groups, each with its own governance and management, to provide an optimum configuration for hospital services for the delivery of high quality, safe patient care in a cost effective manner. </p><p>  The Special Delivery Unit works intensively with management and staff in acute hospitals to embed process/system improvements at hospital level, to monitor and audit these improvements, to validate waiting lists and to capitalise on additional productivity arising from the Haddington Road Agreement.  Hospitals, in conjunction with the HSE National Clinical Programmes, seek to ensure that patients' average length of stay is within the national targets established by the Clinical Programmes, and monitor such activity regularly.  </p><p>  A key part of this is proactive management of discharge planning, with patients moving to lower acuity beds at other facilities, such as smaller hospitals or nursing homes, for rehabilitation and convalescence if appropriate.  Other measures which positively affect cost containment include ongoing improvement in the management of clinical pathways for patients, and optimisation of the use of Medical Assessment Units / Minor Injury Units / Urgent Care Centres, as alternatives to over-reliance on Emergency Departments. </p><p>  In addition, I am also keen to shift the emphasis towards health prevention, promotion and improvement in the years ahead.  This has already begun through the Healthy Ireland policy framework which represents a whole-of-Government and cross-sectoral approach to addressing the growing demands on health services due to the increase in the incidence of chronic illnesses and an ageing population.

Healthy Ireland supports a whole-of-government approach to address the determinants and predictors of health and wellbeing, many of which fall outside the health sector, e.g. housing, transportation, education, workplaces and environment along with an individual&rsquo;s socio-economic status.  </p><p>Critical to the success of Healthy Ireland is an active, central Government policy driven approach where Healthy Ireland&rsquo;s actions are systematically embedded into the policies and programmes of relevant government departments, local authorities and statutory agencies. It is equally important that there is active engagement at local level, empowering and encouraging individuals to take the steps which they may need to take to protect their own health and wellbeing. </p><p>Within the HSE, Health Promotion is an integral part of the prevention and management programme for people with a range of illnesses and chronic disease.  The increasing prevalence of lifestyle related and chronic diseases requires a more expanded scope and systemic provision of activities such as therapeutic education, effective communication strategies so as to enable patients to take an active role in chronic disease management or motivational counselling. The website www.healthpromotion.ie also provides information on , quitting smoking, h, , p, misuse of  dand sexual health.</p></reply>

Separately, as the Deputy will be aware, it is  an offence under the Road Acts to drive without due care or regard or to drive dangerously. A person who is observed driving dangerously as a result of their cup holding would be liable for prosecution under those provisions.</p><p>  However while individuals may engage in such activity, it is not a major issue for road safety requiring a specific action. Mobile phone usage is. It is unlikely that a person is going to be holding a mobile phone if they do not intend to use it. Therefore to ensure that there was a clearly understandable and easily enforceable provision in legislation to stop this form of distraction, this particular requirement was introduced. It is unlikely that someone would be making or receiving a call, texting or browsing the internet through their cup.</p><p>   The new regulations further restrict the use of mobile phones while driving with the emphasis specifically on the prohibition of texting while driving.  The regulations close a loophole which may have permitted motorists to send a text message if a phone was held in a cradle within the car and prohibits the sending of an SMS or MMS message, or an email. </p><p>  I do not intend to bring in a specific offence of cup holding but in the interests of safety, the Deputy is advised not to hold a cup while driving.</p></reply>
