    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-25a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052500050#WRA00600"><p>The aim of the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) is to relieve critical infrastructural blockages in order to enable the accelerated delivery of housing on key development sites in urban areas with high demand for housing.   </p>  <p>  On 28March 2017, Minister Coveney announced funding of &euro;226.5 million for 34 projects under the LIHAF to build essential public infrastructure, including roads and bridges.  These public infrastructure projects will be key to the early delivery of 23,000 housing units over the next four years.  There is further potential for approximately 46,000 additional homes on these 34 sites in the longer term, bringing the projected yield up to 69,000 homes once sites are fully built out.  </p>  <p>  LIHAF will facilitate additional social housing of 2,300 housing units in the short term through the 10% Part V social housing dividend, with a further potential of 4,600 housing units in the longer term.  Furthermore, a number of the projects, such as those which include lands in local authority ownership, will deliver more than the mandatory levels of social housing under Part V.  For example, in relation to the 36 hectare site at Kilcarbery which is owned by South Dublin County Council and where LIHAF funding will support essential public roads and a pumping station, the tenure mix is anticipated to be 30% social and affordable housing and 70% private housing. </p>  <p>  In addition to the accelerated and increased supply of housing generally and increased levels of social and affordable housing in some cases, the Government is also seeking an increased affordability dividend for the eventual purchaser of private housing.   As part of the application process, local authorities were asked to secure commitments from developers in this regard, for example, through identifying the consequent price reduction, arising from the State-funded enabling infrastructure, for the house purchaser, or through selling a proportion of the homes at below market rates.  The specific approach in individual cases will vary according to the scale and ownership status of each site. </p>  <p>  Local authorities that have secured LIHAF funding for selected sites are currently engaging with relevant landowners and housing developers to conclude specific agreements in relation to finalising timelines for delivery of the housing units and the required affordability commitments.  I expect that final agreements will be in place by the end of June to facilitate the signing of formal grant agreements with each Local Authority in respect of LIHAF funding. This will pave the way for work to proceed on procuring the infrastructure involved and, crucially, advancing the delivery of the badly needed associated housing.</p></reply>

Over 500 rapid build homes are now advancing through the planning design, procurement and construction stages, and work is underway to ensure that a further 500 units are advanced in the coming months, bringing the number  of units in the programme to 1,000 by end year. An additional 500 units are targeted for delivery in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that local authorities are working to  deliver the maximum number of units possible during 2017.  Of particular note is the establishment of a framework of rapid build contractors by the Office of Government Procurement, which means that local authorities across the country will be able to run quicker procurement competitions and advance rapid build projects to site more efficiently and effectively.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the rapid build programme needs to be viewed in the context of the wider range of social housing build, acquisition and leasing programmes, which are being advanced by local authorities and approved housing bodies (AHBs). In relation to the construction programme more generally, an updated Construction Status report was published last week showing that, at end Q1 2017, the pipeline of projects had expanded to in excess of 600 projects, involving over 10,000 units, an increase of some 1,600 units in the first quarter of the year alone. Projects continue to be added to the pipeline on a weekly basis.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-25a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052500050#WRA01400"><p>As set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector published in December 2016, the commitment to develop an affordable rental model contained in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan is now to be progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones.  Lands held by local authorities in such zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, targeting middle income households, in mixed tenure developments.</p>  <p>  In this regard, an important policy intervention in the delivery of new housing supply under Pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland is the development of State-owned lands for mixed-tenure housing, particularly in the major urban areas, where demand is greatest.  On 27 April 2017, details of some 2,000 hectares of land in public ownership were published, with the potential to deliver up to 50,000 homes nationally.</p>  <p>  I have asked all local authorities to be innovative and proactive in developing these sites. The final model for each site, including the affordable rental element, will be the subject of careful consideration by the local authority concerned, the elected members included, who are best placed to know and provide for the housing need in their area. Indeed, the Dublin local authorities are well advanced in bringing large-scale sites forward for mixed tenure housing, with projects advertised that can deliver circa 3,000 mixed-tenure homes in the Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council areas alone.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-25a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052500050#WRA02000"><p>Government policy, as set out in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, is to deliver sustainable communities with an appropriate tenure mix for all our citizens, irrespective of the method of housing provision.  An appropriate and balanced mixture of tenures in new developments is necessary in order to avoid the significant effects of social isolation and limiting of opportunities that can occur with large mono-tenure estates, frequently necessitating their regeneration and remediation at a later stage with considerable cost exposure to the State, as well as a well documented negative legacy for the residents involved.</p>  <p>Local authorities are tasked with the provision of social housing for which approval is sought from my Department. The decision in relation to the size of development is made by the local authority on the basis of local need, available lands, permissible densities and what is considered locally appropriate, taking account of the 2007 policy document, "Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities".  In this regard, my Department provides guidance on the scale of social housing which would be suitable in a particular context or area. This guidance is based on the size of the host town or city and the proportionate nature of the development to ensure good social integration and cohesion.</p>  <p>  The achievement of scale in the overall social housing construction programme does not require excessively large individual projects.   Less than one year since the launch of Rebuilding Ireland  , over 10,000 social housing dwellings in more than 600 developments nationwide are now in the social housing construction projects pipeline, showing already that scale of overall delivery and the achievement of sustainable communities are not mutually exclusive.</p></reply>

I note that there is considerable common ground between the NERI report and the Government&rsquo;s Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan and the Strategy for the Rental Sector. </p><p>For example, and in line with Rebuilding Ireland, the NERI report concludes that: </p><p>-  Supply is the most significant challenge at present;</p><p>-  There is a need to increase public investment in new permanent social housing stock;</p><p>-  Traditional patterns of demand are changing: increased labour market mobility and wider economic factors are encouraging a lesser  reliance on home ownership;</p><p>-  A significant proportion of the required new stock needs to be  provided specifically for rental;</p><p>-  The State needs to create the right conditions for investment in the delivery of rental accommodation;</p><p>-  Local authorities, approved housing bodies and the Housing Finance Agency all have a key role to play in the delivery of housing.</p><p>Through Rebuilding Ireland, the Government is progressing a range of actions to meet these challenges. Over the lifetime of the Plan, the overall social housing stock will be increased by providing 47,000 social housing units through local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies using &euro;5.3billion in capital funding and Housing Finance Agency loan finance. </p><p>In addition, under the Strategy for the Rental Sector, a range of supply side measures are being progressed including:</p><p>-  build to rent models; </p><p>-  use of State-owned lands to deliver affordable rental in areas of high demand; </p><p>-  measures to increase the supply of dedicated student accommodation to free-up units in the general rental market;</p><p>-  supports to bring vacant stock into use;</p><p>-  consideration of tax and fiscal incentives to encourage additional supply. </p><p>In addition to the commitment to advancing projects to deliver additional rental accommodation, the Strategy for the Rental Sector noted that the Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to develop a &quot;cost rental&quot; option, taking account of work already completed in this area, including by NESC and others. This is also the central recommendation in the report by NERI.</p><p>In line with this commitment,  Action 12 of the Strategy for the Rental Sector provides that my Department will lead an expert group to develop a cost rental model for the Irish rental sector, addressing issues such as funding mechanisms, the need to grow the necessary institutional capacity, particularly within the AHB sector (whether through mergers, new entrants or strategic partnerships), the households to be targeted and the appropriate regulation mechanisms.The expert group will consider the proposals put forward by NERI - including the proposal to establish a semi-State company to progress the cost rental model - in the course of its work, a report on which is scheduled to be delivered by Q4 2017.</p><p>I am committed to supporting the development of mechanisms that can deliver funding for social housing in a manner that is off-balance sheet and does not negatively impact on the general government balance. Action 2.4 of Rebuilding Ireland provides that the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) will work with the private sector to establish a funding vehicle capable of facilitating off-balance sheet investment in delivering social and private housing. Work on developing the new funding vehicle is underway within the NTMA.</p></reply>

In particular, the Guidelines outline a range of densities appropriate to different location types, from lower densities at the edges of smaller towns through to densities in the range of a minimum of 50 dwellings per hectare in larger urban areas along public transport corridors.</p>  <p>  However, the Guidelines do not set out specific policy advice in relation to height of buildings alone, in isolation from broader location, design and layout considerations nor would it be appropriate to do so, given variability in urban contexts and the inappropriateness of a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; height policy for very diverse urban areas.  Rather, it is a matter for local authorities to ensure the appropriate application of the Guidelines in their statutory development plan and development management processes.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, my Department is currently in the final stages of completing a cost review of multi-unit and apartment developments, which is due to be finalised later this Summer.  This review is examining the key aspects of viability issues, including building height limitations, and will inform further policy development in relation to this matter. In light of the review outcomes, the intention is to engage further with relevant local authorities like Dublin City Council to address any building height issues arising.</p></reply>

This work is already well underway and we are increasingly seeing new social housing construction projects move onto site.

This is available at the following link: . </p><p>The construction projects listed in the Status Report are either on site, at different stages of planning and design or have recently been completed.  As would be expected, given housing need, the Dublin area local authorities and those adjacent to Dublin feature very strongly in this construction programme. The same is true in relation to the delivery in the wider greater Dublin area of social housing through other means, which are also being vigorously pursued through the resources available under Rebuilding Ireland. This includes the acquisition of houses and apartments, the long-term leasing of homes by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies, including via the National Asset Management Agency&rsquo;s Special Purpose Vehicle,  and the accelerated roll-out of the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme.</p><p>Further new social housing projects are being added to the delivery pipeline on a continuous basis.This delivery will continue to be aligned with housing need and this is evident particularly in relation to the rapid delivery programme, where a number of build projects are on site in the greater Dublin area that will deliver 200 new social homes over the coming months, with work already underway at advancing a further round of projects.  I am keen that all local authorities advance their projects as speedily as possible and I have assured them that the necessary funding is available.</p></reply>

Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned. Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.</p>  <p>  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department.

In addition, national-level policy approaches in relation to residential densities in urban areas are set out in my Department&rsquo;s Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas. These place a heavy emphasis on the importance of provision of public infrastructure, such as public transport, community and sports facilities.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, progression of the forthcoming National Planning Framework, to be titled "Ireland 2040: Our Plan", will further clarify and enhance urban development policy in this area, including in relation to identifying the potential to sustainably build up the economic vitality, population levels and supporting social and physical infrastructure of town centre and inner urban areas.  These areas have, in many cases, witnessed a sustained movement of people outwards to suburban and wider settings. </p>  <p>  In terms of funded programmes, my Department provides funding to support social inclusion and for social cohesion in communities. The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State. The Programme was rolled out in April 2015, and will run until 31 December 2017. Its aim is to tackle poverty, social exclusion and long-term unemployment through local engagement and partnership between disadvantaged individuals, community organisations, public sector agencies and other stakeholders. SICAP is a key intervention for the harder to reach, with delivery in each area (or Lot) overseen and managed by the relevant Local Community Development Committee (LCDC) in each local authority area. </p>  <p>  The SICAP funding allocation for 2017 for front-line delivery nationally is &euro;37.5m, which includes an allocation of &euro;3m under the European Social Fund (ESF) Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department recently launched the national &euro;2 million Communities Facilities Scheme which is under the remit of my colleague, Catherine Byrne T.D., Minister of State for Communities and the National Drugs Strategy.  The Communities Facilities Scheme is targeted at both urban and rural areas and will fund projects that seek to enhance communities, address disadvantage and improve social cohesion at a local level. The Scheme is being managed at a local level by the LCDCs in conjunction with the Municipal Districts, under the remit of the local authorities.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government included a commitment to launch a recast RAPID programme which will provide &euro;2 million this year, in capital funding, for projects in disadvantaged urban areas and provincial towns.  My Colleague, Damien English, T.D., Minister of State for Housing and Urban Renewal, intends launching the recast programme shortly.</p></reply>

It also includes some re-connections to the grid, where properties that have been unoccupied for over two years are being brought back into use.  </p>  <p>  In this context, my Department has published data indicating that, based on ESB connections, 12,666 homes became available in 2015, 14,932 homes in 2016 and, based on current trends, it is anticipated that this figure will rise to 18,000 homes in 2017.  My Department does not have a breakdown of the 14,932 homes connected to the ESB Grid during 2016 in the categories  requested.  My Department is working closely with the ESB to obtain additional and more granular data from its dataset to gain a deeper understanding of the various components of the overall connection dataset. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Building Control Management System (BCMS), it is important to note that the BCMS was introduced with effect from 1 March 2014 to facilitate building control authorities, building owners, builders and construction professionals in discharging their responsibilities under the Building Control Act 1990, as amended. The building control process includes a requirement, in certain circumstances, to lodge a statutory Certificate of Compliance on Completion (CCC) in respect of buildings, including dwellings.  While this represents another useful source of data on residential completions, it also has a number of limitations.  </p>  <p>  Firstly, CCCs apply only to works commenced on or after 1 March 2014 so would not apply to homes completed recently but which were subject to a commencement notice submitted prior to 1 March 2014.  Secondly, one-off houses were given the facility to opt out of the statutory CCC process from 1st September 2015, so not all single homes constructed will appear in these returns.  Finally, a CCC may cover multiple buildings or works, so the number of CCCs registered on the BCMS does not correlate to the number of building units completed. My Department is actively engaging with the Local Government Management Agency, which hosts the BCMS, with a view to developing its potential further as an additional source of data in relation to house building activity.</p>  <p>  In relation to building energy ratings (BERs), I understand that, in line with the European Union (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 243 of 2012), a BER Certificate must generally be obtained before a new dwelling may be occupied or offered for sale or letting.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), which comes within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, is the statutory agency responsible for the day-to-day administration of the BER Scheme.  Local building control authorities are responsible for enforcement of the obligation to obtain BER certificates, in line with the 2012 Regulations.  My Department is examining the potential of BER records to act as a further statistical input to the suite of housing activity data, and will continue to work with this and all other available datasets.</p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office, which is the State&rsquo;s authoritative voice in relation to the provision of high quality and independent statistical information supporting evidence-based decision-making,  established an independent group in January 2017, chaired by an Assistant Director General, to examine housing statistics: my Department is a member of that group.  This Group is considering the best analytical approaches to reconciling and combining datasets in this area and will have oversight of, and a direct involvement in, the examination of any output arising from the variety of analyses currently underway.   </p>  <p>  My Department has also established a new Housing Data Analytics Group, with membership from the CSO, Central Bank, local authorities and others to examine this complex area and to monitor and review the various sources of data collected nationally to provide a comprehensive and coherent suite of statistics relating to housing matters.</p></reply>

The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.  </p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda originally set out in the Social Housing Strategy 2020, a review of the income eligibility limits for social housing supports is scheduled to commence later this year.</p></reply>

The practical effect of the measure is that for the next three years rents for more than 186,000 households who currently rent their homes in these areas, will be lower than they would have been if market rents had continued to apply.</p>  <p>  My Department also continues to monitor the impact of Rent Pressure Zones in relation to social housing supports that operate in the private rental sector, for example, the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS).  Each of these schemes is different in their operation and specific advice has been provided by my Department to local authorities in that regard. One of the benefits of the introduction of the Rent Predictability measure in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) is that it will assist local authorities and tenants to secure units within the private rental market at a more sustainable and predictable cost.  </p>  <p>  A review of the Rent Predictability measure will take place next month. At that point, the provisions will have been in place for 6 months, we will have rent data from the Residential Tenancies Board for quarter 1 of 2017, and it will be possible to ascertain the effectiveness of the Rent Predictability Measure and whether any changes need to be made.</p></reply>

As set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector published in December 2016, the commitment on affordable rental is to be progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones. Lands held by local authorities in rent pressure zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, targeting middle income households, in mixed tenure developments. The cost of providing rental units is to be permanently reduced by lowering the initial investment and development costs for providers - AHB or private - allowing the rental units to be made available at below market prices without the need for ongoing rental subsidies.</p><p>In this regard, an important policy intervention is the identification of State-owned lands for mixed tenure housing, particularly in the major urban areas, where demand is greatest. On 27 April 2017, I published details of some 2,000 hectares of land in public ownership, which has the potential to deliver up to 50,000 homes nationally. Full details of these sites can be accessed on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map at the following link: .</p><p>I have asked all local authorities to be innovative and proactive in developing these sites. The final model for each site will be the subject of careful consideration by the local authority concerned, the elected members included, who are best placed to know and provide for the housing need in their area. Indeed, the Dublin local authorities are well advanced in bringing large-scale sites forward for mixed tenure housing, with projects advertised that can deliver circa 3,000 mixed tenure homes in the Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council areas alone.</p></reply>

In this regard, Action 5.1 of Rebuilding Ireland commits to the development of a National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy, informed by Census 2016 data, to</p><p>- inform the compilation of a register of vacant units across the country,</p><p>-  identify the number, location and reasons for longer-term vacancies (i.e. over 6 months) in high demand areas, and</p><p>- set out a range of actions to bring vacant units back into reuse.</p><p>To this end, the Housing Agency, which has lead responsibility for co-ordinating the development of the Strategy, established a working group comprising senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself to inform the Strategy. As the deliberations of Working Group were nearing completion, it was agreed to await publication last month of 2016 Census data on housing so as to ensure the Strategy would be informed by the most up-to-date and comprehensive data available.  </p><p>It is now anticipated that the Strategy will be published in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Amongst the most important of those measures are the net change to the total housing stock, the net change to the occupied housing stock and the numbers of units occupied which the residents report were constructed since 2011. All measures of stock are subject to additions as well as removals and there is no accepted measure at this time of the level of removals between Census waves, whereas my Department has provided an estimate of the additions to the stock for many years.

Other areas, including those adjoining and surrounding rent pressure zones, do not meet the criteria for designation and therefore have not been designated.  The Housing Agency will continue to monitor the situation and may recommend further areas for designation. If future rent rises mean that new areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as rent pressure zones.</p>  <p>  The pressures in the rental market are borne out by the data published recently by Daft.ie, showing that rent asking prices rose nationwide by an average 13.4% in the year to March 2017. However, the report also shows that rent inflation in Dublin has slowed over the last quarter. This is an early indication that the Rent Predictability Measure is having the desired effect. </p>  <p>  A review of the Rent Predictability Measure will be carried out next month.  At that point, the provisions will have been in place for 6 months, data from the Residential Tenancies Board&rsquo;s Rent Index Report for Quarter 1 2017 will be available, and it will be possible to ascertain the effectiveness of the Rent Predictability Measure and whether any changes need to be made.</p></reply>

The use of hotels for emergency accommodation is a much more significant issue in the Dublin Region than in the rest of the country.  At the end of March, a total of 870 homeless families were housed in commercial hotels and B&amp;B&rsquo;s in the Dublin Region.  At end-April this figure has fallen to 695, of which 592 were in commercial hotels and 103 in bed and breakfast accommodation.  Data for May is not yet available.</p>  <p>  In order to meet the Rebuilding Ireland target that, by mid-2017, hotels will only be used in limited circumstances to provide emergency accommodation for homeless families, the accommodation needs of families currently in emergency accommodation in hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation are being addressed by the housing authorities through a mix of social housing solutions, such as tenancies under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme and general social housing allocations.  Housing authorities are also putting in place new supported emergency accommodation facilities which will provide homeless families with a greater level of stability, services and supports than are available in hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation, while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  </p>  <p>  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.

Of this, 350 (10%) will be delivered as social housing in accordance with the provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended). It is also intended that a commercial agreement, with confirmed funding, will be entered into prior to commencement of development, between Dublin City Council, my Department and the owners/developers of the residential element of the overall SDZ area, for a further 550 new homes, the majority of which will be affordable rental housing and the balance provided as social housing with a particular focus on housing for older people. </p>  <p>This objective takes account of and implements Government policy as set out in the Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness: Rebuilding Ireland  , including Actions 2.4 and 2.8 (delivery of additional social housing over and above Part V through a variety of means); 2.16 (housing for older people, including assisted living); 3.1 (Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund or LIHAF); and 4.6 (affordable rental), together with policy promoting tenure diversity in the City Council&rsquo;s Housing Strategy.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector published in December 2016, the commitment to develop an affordable rental model contained in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan is now to be progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones.  Lands held by local authorities in rent pressure zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, targeting middle income households, in mixed tenure developments.</p>  <p>  In this regard, an important policy intervention in the delivery of new housing supply under Pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland is the development of State-owned lands for mixed tenure housing, particularly in the major urban areas, where demand is greatest. On 27 April 2017, I published details of some 2,000 hectares of land in public ownership, which has the potential to deliver up to 50,000 homes nationally.</p>  <p>  I have asked all local authorities to be innovative and proactive in developing these sites. The final model for each site will be the subject of careful consideration by the local authority concerned, the elected members included, who are best placed to know and provide for the housing need in their area. Indeed, the Dublin local authorities are well advanced in bringing large-scale sites forward for mixed tenure housing, with projects advertised that can deliver circa 3,000 mixed tenure homes in the Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council areas alone,</p>  <p>  The question of the criteria to apply to determine eligibility for affordable units is currently under consideration.</p></reply>

There are currently more than 22,000 households in receipt of HAP, including 7,000 households that were previously supported by Rent Supplement. There are currently more than 17,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation  to households supported by  the HAP scheme. Approximately 315 to 350 new households are being supported by HAP each week. </p>  <p>  My Department does not hold information on the age demographic of HAP recipients. However, a summary of the household classes supported by the HAP scheme at 31 March 2017 is set out below:</p>  <p>   - Single / Single Sharing - 31%</p>  <p>   - Couple / Couple Sharing - 4%</p>  <p>   - Lone Parent with Children - 39%</p>  <p>   - Couple with Children - 26%</p>  <p>  The Homeless Pilot of the HAP scheme has been operational since February 2015, across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region, and is being implemented through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE). The focus of this pilot remains the transitioning of qualified households from emergency accommodation, including hotels, into private rented tenancies. To qualify for HAP under the homeless pilot scheme, a household must generally be accepted as homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988 by one of the four Dublin local authorities. The Homeless HAP support has also been used to prevent households from entering homelessness and homeless services.</p>  <p>  While eligible homeless households may source accommodation for themselves, a dedicated placement team, the Dublin Place-Finder Service, has also been established to engage directly with property owners and support qualified households to find suitable tenancies and to ensure that any additional supports that may be needed are put in place. This is a particularly important service for households currently residing in emergency accommodation in the Dublin region.</p>  <p>The implementation of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness is being advanced across a number of Departments and agencies, including the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, under the oversight of the Cabinet Committee on Housing, chaired by An Taoiseach. The long-term solution to the current homelessness issue is to increase the supply of homes. Accordingly, Rebuilding Ireland   is designed to accelerate all types of housing supply &ndash; social, private and rental.  During the lifetime of the Plan some 47,000 new social houses will be provided, supported by Exchequer investment of over &euro;5 billion, and housing output generally will be progressively increased towards the target of producing 25,000 houses per year through all channels. </p>  <p>  It is intended that housing needs of those currently homeless, including young people, will be met through housing supports such as HAP, the homeless HAP scheme, and general social housing allocations.  Significant outputs are being achieved in this regard, with over 3,000 sustainable exits from homeless accommodation into independent tenancies delivered during 2016, a record level of exits in a calendar year. This includes more than 800 homeless households supported by HAP during 2016.  A target of 1,200 additional households to be supported through the Homeless HAP pilot scheme has been set for 2017, and more than 600 such households have already been supported by the scheme this year.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the  HAP scheme under review.

This a vital initial step in the new State Housing Land Management Strategy being developed within the context of the National Planning Framework, to be titled &quot;Ireland 2040: Our Plan&quot;.</p><p>The map is the result of a significant amount of work carried out by my Department, local authorities, the Housing Agency and other State and semi-State bodies. The datasets published on the map include details of over 700 local authority and Housing Agency-owned sites, totalling some 1,700 hectares, including location and size, as well as 30 sites (comprising some 200 hectares) owned by State or semi-State Bodies, situated in major urban centres.  The map also shows the locations of 144 active private construction sites, encompassing some 5,200 new dwellings, which are under construction in the Dublin region. </p><p>The map is freely accessible on an interactive portal at  and data on sites can be extracted in a number of forms, including on a local authority basis.</p><p>The opening up of State-owned lands for the development of mixed tenure housing is a key objective under Rebuilding Ireland  . I want to see the supply of high quality social and affordable homes, to buy or rent, delivered as quickly as possible from key sites, particularly in the major urban areas where demand is greatest.  I have asked all local authorities to be innovative and pro-active in developing these sites. </p><p>In the first instance, the specific approach to housing delivery on each site, including the optimum tenure mix, is a matter for the local authority concerned, including the elected members, who best understand the housing needs in their area.  Already, South Dublin County Council and Dublin City Council are well advanced in bringing large-scale sites forward for mixed tenure housing, with projects advertised that can deliver around 3,000 mixed tenure homes on 4 key sites, located in Kilcarbery (South Dublin) and Infirmary Road, Emmet Road, and Oscar Traynor Road (Dublin City). I expect other local authorities to follow suit. </p><p>Mixed tenure development on State-owned land provides a strong opportunity to provide social and affordable housing quickly in a fully integrated and sustainable community. Importantly, it allows for risk-sharing and far quicker delivery of social housing and housing more generally as part of the full development of each site. For example, in relation to a major site in Dublin City at O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, I have already announced Stage 1 funding approval of almost &euro;18 million for 56 social homes on the site. Only building social houses on the rest of the site  would mean slower delivery, over a 10- or 15-year period, as capital funding becomes available. </p><p>I am committed to ensuring that the State extracts the most beneficial use of its currently under-utilised assets for much needed housing in the shortest possible timeframe, and maximises the social dividend, in particular by increased and speedier delivery of high-quality social and affordable homes, to buy or rent.  My Department will continue to work with local authorities and other State agencies to this end.</p></reply>

This comprises some &euro;4.5 billion in capital funding and &euro;844 million in support of programmes funded from current expenditure.  Under Pillar 2 of Rebuilding Ireland  , my Department is working closely with all local authorities in relation to increasing and accelerating the delivery of a range of social housing programmes and supports, including rapid build homes. </p><p>Over 500 rapid build homes are currently advancing through various stages of delivery, including construction, and a further 500 rapid build homes will be advanced in 2017, with another 500 units to be delivered in 2018. Sites for rapid build schemes are currently being identified in Louth, Wicklow, Kildare, Meath, Cork, Waterford, Galway and Limerick.</p><p>Local authorities have been responding positively to the need for a ramp-up in rapid build delivery. The establishment of a framework of rapid build contractors by the Office of Government Procurement means that local authorities across the country will be able to run quicker procurement competitions and advance rapid build projects to site more efficiently and effectively. In addition, the Part 8 planning procedures have been revised to facilitate the acceleration and delivery of local authority own development proposals, including social housing projects and infrastructure servicing housing development. </p><p>Other actions are underway by local authorities to respond to housing need and meet the needs of homeless people within their areas. These include targeted acquisitions, the new Repair and Leasing initiative and the range of current-funded programmes, such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme, Housing Assistance Payment and various leasing arrangements under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme. Again, properties sourced under these programmes are used to accommodate persons on the local authority housing waiting lists, including those in emergency accommodations or at risk of homelessness. </p><p>Building on the early actions taken to make affordable housing more viable through re-affirming apartment guidelines and reforming the development contribution regime, a number of other actions are underway to make residential property delivery viable, at a far greater scale, and at more generally affordable prices and rents. For example, the announcement, on 28 March 2017, of &euro;226 million funding for housing infrastructure on 34 high-impact sites, through the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), will act at the catalyst for the delivery of some 23,000 homes by 2021 and an overall figure of up to 70,000 homes in the longer term  in areas of greatest supply constraints. Details of the projects approved under LIHAF can be accessed at the following link: .</p><p>Through the range of actions currently being progressed under Rebuilding Irelandto increase the supply of homes across all tenures, the Government will create the conditions required for the restoration of a more sustainable and normally functioning housing market, capable of providing homes, to buy or rent, at more affordable price points, where and when they are required.</p></reply>

Houses sold to first time buyers under the various affordable housing schemes were priced at a significant discount from their market value. Buyers were free to sell their properties at any time. However, in order to prevent short-term profit-taking on the resale of the houses to the detriment of the objectives of the schemes, the schemes contained a clawback provision.</p>  <p>  Under the clawback provisions, as set out in the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, as amended, where the purchaser proposes to sell the unit within 20 years of the date of purchase, he/she must refund to the local authority a percentage of the proceeds of the sale of the unit. The percentage of the proceeds to be repaid will be related to the proportion of discount from the market value originally received from the local authority. A full refund must be paid if the unit is sold within the first 10 years of occupancy. A reduction of 10% per annum is given for each full year of occupancy between 10 and 20 years and after 20 years of full occupancy no refund would be due to the local authority.</p>  <p>  However, where a person is selling an affordable home and the clawback amount payable would reduce the proceeds of resale below the initial price actually paid, the legislation provides for the amount of the clawback payable to be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid that result.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to amend these provisions, which I consider to be equitable and reasonable.</p>  <p>  In relation to local authority loans, these are for first-time buyers only, and I have no plans to amend the position.</p></reply>

In this regard, any proposal to revise the pyrite remediation scheme is ultimately a matter for the Pyrite Resolution Board and would require detailed consideration of the evidence to support the case for an amendment to the scheme.</p>  <p>The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol  .  In addition, applicants under the scheme must be able to demonstrate to the Pyrite Resolution Board that they have no practicable options, other than under the scheme, to secure the remediation of their homes.</p>  <p>  The scheme provides for the recoupment of the vouched cost of alternative accommodation, furniture removal and storage subject to limits of &euro;3,000 and &euro;2,500 (inclusive of VAT) respectively.

In addition, earlier payment in part or in whole may be made where a scheme participant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Housing Agency that payment of these costs only on completion of the works would cause financial hardship.</p>  <p>  My Department is in regular contact with the Pyrite Resolution Board and the Housing Agency with regard to the implementation of the scheme and is satisfied that the arrangements that are currently in place provide the necessary flexibility to enable scheme participants to meet their alternative accommodation needs while their homes are under remediation.</p></reply>

It also brought section 3 of the Act into operation on the same date to the extent required to enable the partial commencement of section 19 to have effect.</p><p>Section 144 of the Act of 2000 enables the Board to determine such fees, subject to Ministerial approval, and once approved, requires that the Board to give public notice of new fees for a period of at least 8 weeks prior to coming into effect.  On foot of the commencement of these provisions, I approved the Board&rsquo;s proposed fee schedule for strategic housing developments on 8 March 2017 and the Board undertook the necessary public notice arrangements on 15 March 2017.  A copy of the fee schedule is available on the Board&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i>.</i></p><p>The Act of 2016 also provides for the establishment of a dedicated Strategic Housing Division in the Board to make determinations on planning applications in respect of strategic housing developments, assisted by additional dedicated technical and administrative support resources which the Board has been given approval to engage with the necessary arrangements now being progressed in this regard.</p><p>A separate Commencement Order will be required to bring the substantive strategic housing development provisions in Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the Act into operation.  In conjunction with this, section 12 of the Act of 2016 enables me as Minister to make regulations to provide for matters of procedure and administration to support the operation of the strategic housing development provisions.  The drafting of the supporting Regulations and Commencement Order is at an advanced stage and I expect to be in a position to approve and sign these shortly.  My Department will then issue a Circular letter to the Board and planning authorities advising of the commencement of the provisions and providing any additional guidance required with regard to the operation of the new arrangements.  Once commenced, applications for large-scale housing developments as defined in the Act of 2016, including qualifying residential development that forms part of a larger development scheme but is capable being carried out on its own, will be made to the Board.  </p><p>The Board already has powers, in limited and specific circumstances, to grant planning permission on appeal for a proposed development in the case where a planning authority has refused permission on the grounds that the proposed development materially contravenes the development plan.  Where it grants planning permission in these circumstances, the Board must indicate the main reasons and consideration for its decision.</p><p>Under the new arrangements, planning applications in respect of strategic housing developments may be made to the Board only in respect of lands that have already been zoned for such purposes by the local elected members in the development plan or local area plan for the area.  The Act of 2016 empowers the Board to grant planning permission for a strategic housing development that materially contravenes the development or local area plan and requires the Board to set out the main reasons and considerations for doing this.  However, the Board cannot grant permission where the proposed development would materially contravene the zoning objective of the relevant plan.</p><p>Importantly, members of the public will continue to be able to make submissions and observations to the Board about applications for strategic housing developments in the same manner as currently applies in respect of planning applications submitted to the local planning authority or appealed to the Board.  Applications will be notified to the public by way of site and newspaper notices in the normal manner and a copy of the application will be available for inspection at the offices of the Board and the planning authority for the area concerned.</p></reply>

It also concluded that the current financial model of the scheme may not be capable of delivering the scale of cases that could benefit from the scheme over time.  </p>  <p>In parallel, Rebuilding Ireland   acknowledges the scale of the current pressures in terms of new social housing supply and proposes more direct intervention by local authorities to expand and accelerate overall social housing supply particularly in the short term.  An expansion of the MTR scheme whereby the local authority, as opposed to an Approved Housing Body, would acquire the property would impact on the capacity of local authorities to meet the ambitious targets around social housing supply.</p>  <p>  The Government has been actively exploring potential mechanisms that would facilitate investment in social housing, including the off-balance sheet potential of private institutional investment.  A number of private equity firms have expressed an interest in purchasing mortgage debt portfolios from commercial banks with a view to exploring the potential for them to access the MTR scheme model for the borrowers in occupation of the mortgaged property.  They are seeking an alternative arrangement that would see the mortgaged property staying in the funding firm's ownership and the property itself leased back to the local authority in circumstances where the borrower is eligible for MTR and the borrower would therefore remain in their own home.</p>  <p>  One of the outcomes of the Review is that in order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities who have come forward with an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of pilot alternative lease arrangements. In advance of these pilots, a targeted market testing exercise has been undertaken by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), on behalf of my Department, to test the suitability of the proposed enhanced leasing arrangements to ascertain if they would be viable for a mortgage to rent cohort.  The objective is to explore what is available within the current market and to determine if this alternative model will benefit a greater number of households. </p>  <p>  A detailed financial assessment of the structure of the funding of the MTR scheme will be undertaken in advance of the budgetary process for 2018.  The assessment will be informed by the early impact of the other actions proposed by the review, as well as the outcome of the experience with the pilot lease arrangements, and the availability of financial resources overall.</p></reply>

Funding is recouped to local authorities on eligible expenditure incurred and, where it is likely that an allocation to a local authority may be unspent or under-spent, my Department engages with local authorities to reallocate the funding to another scheme in order to ensure that drawdown is maximised before year-end.  I am anxious that local authorities make full use of the increased levels of capital funding available for traveller accommodation in 2017 and my Department will continue to engage proactively with local authorities in that regard. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to establishing a special working group to audit the current delivery and implementation of local authorities' TAPs and consult with stakeholders on key areas of concern.  This commitment has been underpinned in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, which provides for the commissioning by the Housing Agency of an expert, independent review of expenditure on, and delivery of, Traveller accommodation to underpin the work of the special working group.  </p>  <p>  The review, which has regard to the targets in the local authorities' TAPs, is due to be completed very shortly.  It will provide factual information and this will provide a key platform for the special working group to progress its work effectively.  The working group will be established by the statutorily appointed National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (NTACC) immediately after completion of the review.  I expect the working group to complete its work in an expeditious manner and, as provided for in the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, the NTACC may then advise me in relation to any appropriate measures for improving the provision and management of accommodation at local level.  </p></reply>

The long-term solution to the current homeless issue is to increase the supply of homes; accordingly, Rebuilding Ireland is designed to accelerate all types of housing supply.  During the lifetime of the Plan some 47,000 new social houses will be provided. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the long-term housing needs of homeless households, including those families currently accommodated in hotels, will be met through housing supports such as the enhanced Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme and general social housing allocations.  Significant outputs are being achieved in this regard; housing authorities achieved over 3,000 sustainable exits from homeless accommodation into independent tenancies during 2016, a record level of delivery in a calendar year. </p>  <p>  Housing authorities, working with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, are also pursuing a range of supported temporary accommodation initiatives to provide accommodation for homeless families with a greater level of stability than is possible in hotels, while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Such arrangements will facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support, including on-site access to required services, such as welfare, health, housing services and appropriate family supports.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the relevant local authority to comply with all legislative requirements in relation to building works, including the provision of accommodation for homeless families and individuals and related services. Planning permission is required for certain alterations and material changes of use of existing buildings. However, the Chief Executive of a local authority may exercise emergency planning powers under Section 179 (6)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. </p>  <p>  Building Regulations apply to a wide range of works to existing buildings, including material alterations, changes of use etc.  A Building Control Authority may, if it considers it reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case, grant a dispensation from, or a relaxation of, any requirement of building regulations in respect of buildings or works which are situated within the authority's functional area.</p>  <p>  A Fire Certificate is required for certain works to existing buildings to which the requirements of Part B of the Building Regulations apply.  This triggers the provisions set out in the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 (SI 9/2014) for certificates of compliance and an assigned certifier.    </p></reply>

A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose, all selected on the basis of their knowledge of the criminal justice system.  Recommendations were returned in all of the 320 complaints referred to the Panel and the process of issuing decision letters to the complainants largely concluded in February 2016. </p>  <p>  I have repeatedly emphasised that the IRM was not established to act as a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation.  Nor was it designed to make findings.  The purpose of the review was to triage the various complaints to establish whether there was any action which I, as Minister, could take to further a resolution of that complaint.  The Review did not therefore involve interviews or meetings with complainants or any other form of investigation.  Counsel were required to consider the matters raised by the complainants and any corroboration offered by them and to take into account any actions already undertaken in relation to the complaint.  Counsel were then required to use their knowledge and experience of criminal law to recommend whether further action was either possible or appropriate and if so to recommend to me, as Minister, the relevant action to take.  It was open to the panel to make whatever recommendation they considered appropriate. </p>  <p>  It is correct to say that the majority of the recommendations were that I should take no further action insofar as I had no role or function in relation to the matter under complaint.  The reasons for this include cases where the complaints fell outside the remit of the review and ongoing matters either before the Courts or by way of investigations by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC).  </p>  <p>  I appreciate that some complainants were disappointed with the outcome of the review but it is important to note that the review mechanism was fully independent and came to its own conclusions in all cases.</p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's review process for improving summons service is broken down into three goal types: </p>  <p>The short-term goals   included immediately raising the profile of summons service within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I am informed by the Garda authorities that, in June 2014, a new process was put in place, focussed on improving the rate of summons service achieved by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The process was over seen by an Assistant Commissioner at national level and an Inspector was given responsibility to put processes in place to improve service rates at Divisional Level. A standard structure was developed across each division of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, pending the delivery of the ICT facility required. In 2014, the rate of service of summonses in each Garda Region was placed on the agenda for meetings held by the Divisional Officer and District Officer as part of the Accountability Framework in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In addition, each Regional Assistant Commissioner directed that every effort is made to serve all summonses received in each Garda Division, Garda members are made accountable for their service of summonses and also each member should be made aware of their responsibilities to record both service and non-service details on PULSE and the importance of accurate recording of this information. Guidance on summons service was made available on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's internal portal page. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has completed implementation of the short-term goals. </p>  <p>  The medium-term goals   involved the establishment of a standardised reporting structure with regard to monthly summons service rates. A template was introduced for reporting on the number of summonses on hand at the beginning and end of each calendar month. The number of summonses received, served and unserved is also recorded for each calendar month. These figures are used to calculate an approximate service rate and this rate is used as a base line to identify increases or decreases in summons service over time. This system allows for managers to assess the effectiveness of the summons service process in their respective Divisions and allows National summons service rates to be monitored.</p>  <p>  As a consequence of these initiatives, the service rate for summonses increased from an average of 57% in 2014 to 69% in the first half of 2016. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated at the most recent public meeting with the Policing Authority on 27 April 2017, which focussed on roads policing, that follow-up action is carried out when summonses are returned and that an average of 20% of those summonses not served on the first occasion are subsequently served.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that payments were received for 73% of Fixed Charge Notices issued in 2016, which constitutes a high payment rate and a high level of acceptance of penalty points, in the case of penalty point-offences. </p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have indicated that meetings take place with the Courts Service on a regular basis in relation to a wide range of service related issues, including summons service. While progress on the service rate has improved, the Garda Commissioner has directed every effort should be made to build on the increased service rate achieved to date while also examining other options in terms of the outsourcing of summons service. Challenges remain in relation to effecting service of summons in certain circumstances, relating to such matters as inaccurate address data, persons moving address, or living in multi-occupancy dwellings or other settings which make service difficult. In addition, certain persons will take steps to evade service. Similar difficulties are experienced by many other police forces. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (FCPS) Working Group has been monitoring the Garda review of summons service since its establishment and has included this review in the Working Group's Work Programme, which oversees a number of priority items for implementation in the context of the FCPS. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will make a presentation on its summons service review process at the next meeting of the Working Group, scheduled for 14 June 2017.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the intended commencement of the third payment option on 1 June 2017 will lead to a further increase in fixed charge amount payment rates, as a result of the provision of an additional / third opportunity to pay the fixed charge amount. As regards the impact of the third payment option on summons service, it is anticipated that the volume of road traffic offence cases proceeding to court will reduce, given that the new third payment option will be affixed to and issued with the summons itself. </p>  <p>With the completion of the medium-term goals relating to the review, the focus of the Garda authorities is now on the long-term goals  , which include reviewing the legislation to allow for different methods of service, such as reviewing the possibility of outsourcing summons service in conjunction with the postal codification of addresses which took place in 2015, and considering e-summons service as part of the future vision of summons service.</p></reply>

The scheme is open to both those who are purchasing new builds from a developer, and those who self-build. By restricting it to new builds and new self-build homes only, it is anticipated that the resulting increase in demand for affordable new build homes should encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties.</p><p>Broadly, the relief takes the form of a rebate of income tax, including DIRT, paid over the previous four tax years. The maximum possible rebate is 5% of the purchase price, or 5% of the valuation for a self-build. Although relevant properties valued at up to &euro;500,000 can qualify, the maximum relief is capped at &euro;20,000 per property, subject to the applicant having paid sufficient income tax and DIRT over the previous 4 years. Where more than one individual is involved in purchasing or building a new home, all of the individuals must be first-time buyers.</p><p>There are additional conditions of the scheme that must be met, including that the mortgage taken out to purchase or build the home must be a minimum of 70% of the purchase price or 70% of the value of the property in the case of a self-build.</p><p>The HTB scheme assists first-time buyers in making up the deposit to go towards their first home. The recent changes to the Central Bank's macro prudential rules means that such buyers must be in a position to fund a deposit of a minimum of 10% of the purchase price, or property value in the case of a self build. The HTB scheme can assist with the provision of up to half of this deposit, where the conditions of the scheme are met. I am firmly of the view that the scheme is of great value for those who may have difficulty in saving for such a deposit. Particular individuals who may be encountering such difficulties include those who are paying substantial rents, and those who incur significant childcare costs. I would also point out however, that first-time buyers must continue to meet the loan to income requirements of the macro prudential rules.</p><p>Given the level of interest and uptake of the scheme, data on which are updated regularly on the Revenue Commissioners website at <i></i>, I consider that the scheme is operating as intended.</p></reply>

In this regard, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the tax expenditure guidelines issued by my Department, which stipulate that &ldquo;the key rationale for Government intervention in a market...by way of a tax expenditure...should be the existence of a market failure" and that a tax-based incentive should be more efficient than a direct expenditure measure. A measure such as the one proposed by the deputy does not appear to address a clear market failure in circumstances where alternative taxation based measures are already available. Therefore, I have no plans to introduce a rebate along the lines proposed by the Deputy.</p></reply>

I have not yet made any decision to proceed with a sale of shares in AIB.  In order to proceed with an IPO I would need to be satisfied that the market is prepared to put a fair and reasonable value on the bank's equity, bearing in mind the bank's current performance, its future prospects and the outlook for the Irish economy. I will do so on the advice of my officials in my Department and our financial advisors. </p>  <p>  As I have outlined previously, the sale of financial assets, such as bank shares are transactions which do not result in a beneficial impact to the General Government Balance (GGB) under EUROSTAT rules. This is due to the fact that this type of disposal is classified as a financial transaction whereby it is essentially the exchange of one form of asset (such as shares, equities, loans) for another kind (cash). Consequently, the sale of any shareholding in AIB would not count as general government revenue. Therefore, there would not be increased capacity to spend on capital projects as a result of the sale of shares in AIB without affecting the general government balance.</p>  <p>  While not improving the deficit, cash proceeds arising from any sale of shares would result in a reduced requirement for Exchequer borrowing which ultimately results in lower debt. A lower debt level is not only beneficial in terms of the fiscal sustainability of the State but would also lead to reduced interest payments in future years.</p>  <p>  As public indebtedness rose partly due to the recapitalisation of the banks, the appropriate way of treating one-off revenue from divesting the State of its banking assets is to use these proceeds towards debt reduction. These disposals would also help contain contingent liabilities for the State. </p>  <p>  As a further comment, though unrelated to banking policy, I have previously acknowledged the need for increased public investment. The current Capital Plan sets a baseline from which this Government intends to increase investment in critical infrastructure, and in areas such as housing and health, as the Deputy has identified into the future. As outlined in the 2017 Estimates, gross voted capital expenditure will increase to &euro;4.5 billion in 2017. This represents an increase of almost &euro;400 million in comparison to the 2016 outturn. By 2021 it is envisaged that Gross Voted Capital Expenditure will reach &euro;7.3 billion, an increase of over 100 per cent in comparison to its level in 2014. Based on my Department&rsquo;s GNP forecasts, Ireland's Exchequer public investment will reach 2.7% of GNP by 2021. These increases in investment over the coming years will be allocated to identified priorities on the basis of the outcome of the review of the Capital Plan currently underway.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-25a.222.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052500053#WRD06200"><p>I am aware of reports of a recent incident involving the illegal dumping of sludge close to the border with Northern Ireland and recognise the serious threat that fuel fraud poses to legitimate business, consumers and the Exchequer.  I am advised by Revenue that tackling fuel fraud has been one of their priorities over recent years. </p>  <p>  While it is very disappointing that incidents such as this still occur, I am advised that the level of this illegal dumping is greatly reduced. I understand that a total of 40 illegal bulk containers of mineral oil waste were detected in County Louth to date in 2017, while 500 such containers were detected there in 2013.  This improvement reflects the success Revenue has in tackling this problem and the impact of legislative changes that I introduced over a number of Finance Acts to strengthen Revenue&rsquo;s powers in tackling fraud in the fuel sector. The measures implemented by Revenue to tackle the problem included the introduction of stringent new supply chain controls and reporting requirements for fuel transactions to minimise the scope for fraud.  It also included a rigorous programme of enforcement action by Revenue. In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to find a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels, which was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom from the beginning of April 2015.</p>  <p>  I understand that the industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in significantly curtailing fuel fraud in Ireland.  This view is supported by a significant increase in tax revenues from road diesel over the past three years.  I am also advised that Revenue conducted a National Random Sampling Programme in January 2016, with a view to obtaining an updated picture of the extent of the fuel laundering problem. The programme involved selecting a random sample comprising nearly one in every ten of the 2,500 holders of Auto Fuel Trader Licences (any trader that produces, sells, deals in, or keeps for sale or delivery road diesel is legally obliged to hold such a licence). Road diesel samples were taken from all traders in the programme and tested for the presence of the new marker.  No evidence of the new fiscal marker was found in any of the samples tested. The random sampling programme was repeated in January 2017 and again, no evidence of the fiscal marker was found.  This provides very persuasive evidence that the strategy undertaken in recent years has been successful in addressing and significantly curtailing the laundering problem. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue's work against fuel fraud has achieved a considerable level of success, and I am assured that action in this area will continue to be a high priority.  In addition, I assure the Deputy that I will fully consider any further proposals for legislative change that may be brought forward by Revenue which would enhance its capacity to deal effectively with fraud and criminality in this area.</p></reply>

Dr. Thornhill made a number of recommendations in his report on his review of the Local Property Tax. His central recommendation is for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield. This in turn would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue. Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%. This new system was recommended by Dr. Thornhill with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019.</p>  <p>  In my Budget 2016 statement, I said that I would be proposing to Government that the revaluation date for the LPT be postponed from 2016 to 2019. This postponement meant that home owners were not faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values.  The postponement also gives sufficient time for the other recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report to be considered fully by the Government and there are no proposals to change this. </p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 gave effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for LPT purposes, and also to two of the recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report, involving LPT relief for properties affected by pyrite and relief for properties occupied by persons with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  My Department will be considering issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Thornhill Report in due course in line with the 2019 timeline. I also note that in accordance with the Programme for a Partnership Government a series of reports is currently in preparation for Government and for the Oireachtas, on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability.</p></reply>

Therefore any additional spend on systems capacity will not only facilitate data matching and data analytics but will also ensure the performance across a range of systems. As such any extra spend cannot be directly attributable to individual functions.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that they have recruited over 100 Executive Officers to date in 2017, 65 of whom went into a comprehensive two-year audit training programme.  The balance went into an accelerated audit training programme, as they were already sufficiently qualified. It is anticipated that these staff will commence full time audit and compliance activities from mid-2017.  It is too early to say what the final yield will be from tackling offshore tax evasion, audit &amp;amp; investigations arising from additional resources in 2017.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that they projected that approximately 500 audit staff will retire over the next five years. They currently have c.400 at various stages of audit training.  It is noted that the investment in the training and development of a Revenue auditor or investigator can take up to three to four years, depending on previous relevant experience.  Revenue plans to recruit c. 150 Executive Officers per annum over the next five years with the majority of these going into audit training based on current resource provision.</p></reply>

This includes decisions in relation to products as determined by the banks.</p>  <p>  All viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy. As the Deputy will be aware, Chapter 3.5 (Ensuring Finance for Growth) of the Action Plan for Jobs 2017 (APJ) sets out a range of commitments to ensure viable SMEs can access appropriate finance at a reasonable cost from both bank and non-bank sources. </p>  <p>  In line with Action 62 of the APJ 2017, officials from my Department collate and examine data from AIB and Bank of Ireland on a monthly basis, including data pertaining to the various sectors. Furthermore, my officials meet the banks on a quarterly basis to ensure an informed understanding of the wider SME bank lending environment which assists the development and implementation of policies aimed at ensuring SME access to finance and increased competition in the SME lending sector.</p>  <p>  I note that the data published by the Central Bank of Ireland in its Quarterly Trends in Business Credit and Deposits series shows that new lending to Property Investment/Development enterprises for 2016 totalled &euro;1.3 billion in drawdowns, a growth of &euro;589 million when compared to 2015. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that in the social housing market, in line with the commitment contained in "Rebuilding Ireland", the NTMA and key Government Departments are examining the feasibility of establishing a funding vehicle in conjunction with the private sector, which could facilitate investment in social housing. </p>  <p>  Separately, ISIF is making a very substantial contribution to new private housing supply which is critical in terms of meeting the pent up demand for housing across all sectors of the market. In line with its double bottom line mandate, ISIF has already invested in a number of significant financing platforms and projects in the construction sector, and is actively examining other investment opportunities.  </p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector, including those involved in Property Investment/Development, and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.</p></reply>

All of these models were developed following extensive collaboration and consultation with schools and the education partners. The full range of new and revised inspection models came into effect on 1 September 2016. A key issue that was addressed in the development of these inspections was to ensure that a greater focus is placed on classroom observation and less attention paid to the examination of documentation. In response to comments from the education partners, a single simplified guide to inspections was published for primary schools and a similar guide prepared for post-primary schools. These guides provide full details of the range of inspections used in schools, and they contain a list of the small number of documents that are required of schools during inspections. The majority of the documents required should be readily available in schools as they are part of the normal planning that would be expected in schools.</p>  <p>  The range of inspection models in use includes the following:</p>  <p>Short, unannounced &ldquo;incidental&rdquo; inspections   are carried out in a large number of primary and post-primary schools each year. They focus on the quality of classroom work and provide an opportunity to offer advice and feedback to individual teachers and to the school principal. These inspections are also used to collect information about the school, and the Inspectorate uses this information to plan a proportion of its other inspections. </p>  <p>Subject inspections/curriculum evaluations   evaluate the quality of teaching and learning of a curriculum area in primary schools or a subject in post-primary schools. </p>  <p>DEIS evaluations   evaluate the quality of action planning for improvement in both primary and post-primary schools included in the DEIS scheme, and the impact that this has on the learning of students. </p>  <p>Inspections of Special Educational Needs (SEN) Provision   are conducted in primary and post-primary schools. Specialised inspections are also conducted in schools attached to High Support Units, Special Care Units and Children detention Centres.  </p>  <p>Programme evaluations   examine the quality of programmes such as Transition Year, the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme and the Junior Certificate School Programme in post-primary schools. </p>  <p>Whole-School Evaluations evaluate   the quality of teaching and learning, and the quality of the leadership and management in primary and post-primary schools. </p>  <p>Evaluations of Centres for Education   are conducted mainly in Youthreach centres that provide &ldquo;second-chance&rdquo; educational opportunities for young people who have dropped out of mainstream schooling.</p>  <p>Follow-Through inspections   take place in a proportion of schools in which inspections have occurred previously. These inspections, introduced in 2012, seek to establish the extent to which earlier recommendations have been implemented and act as an encouragement to boards and teachers to advance improvement in schools. </p>  <p>  The current suite of inspection models means that short inspections occur more frequently in schools; schools in which there is a greater risk to the learning of students are identified more quickly; and a proportion of more intensive inspections can be conducted where the need for improvement is likely to be greatest. Follow-through inspections also provide added flexibility that helps to increase the impact of inspection for improvement. </p>  <p>  In addition to the inspection models listed above, inspectors currently carry out inspections of the work of conditionally registered teachers at primary level on behalf of the Teaching Council. These inspections help to inform the Council&rsquo;s decisions on teachers' registration. In the school year 2015/16, a total of 3 222 inspection visits were made to conditionally registered teachers for this purpose. </p>  <p>  There are currently 26 primary and 7 post-primary schools in the school improvement process.</p></reply>

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers. </p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. </p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  </p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.  </p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all.  It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.</p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system. Teachers are not paid equally. For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching. Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector. A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the recently published analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve. However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of public service pay talks.  My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, invited the Public Services Committee of ICTU to discussions on public service pay and a continued approach to the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation and these discussions are now underway.</p></reply>

One of the five pillars of the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness is focused specifically on addressing homelessness and sets out a range of integrated measures through which local authorities, other public bodies, approved housing bodies and other relevant organisations are responding to the homelessness challenge. Ultimately the solution rests in achieving a significant increase in housing supply, particularly in relation to social housing in respect of which 47,000 units of accommodation are to be provided over the period to 2021, supported by &euro;5.35 billion in funding.</p>  <p>  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services, including accommodation, rests with individual local authorities. The purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.  The funding needs of the various housing authorities are kept under review on an ongoing basis.  In Budget 2017, the Government approved funding of almost &euro;98 million for homelessness, compared to an initial provision of &euro;70 million last year, &euro;53 million in 2015 and &euro;45 million in 2014.  </p></reply>

This work is already well underway and we are increasingly seeing new social housing construction projects move onto site.  I recently published the latest update of the Status Report on Social Housing Construction Projects, which now includes over 600 social housing construction projects, delivering over 10,000 social housing units. This is available at the following link: <i>. </i></p><p>The construction projects listed in the Status Report are either on site, at different stages of planning and design or have recently been completed.  As would be expected, given housing need, the Dublin area local authorities and those adjacent to Dublin feature very strongly in this construction programme. The same is true in relation to the delivery in the greater Dublin area of social housing through other means, which are also being vigorously pursued through the resources available under Rebuilding Ireland. This includes the acquisition of houses and apartments, the long-term leasing of homes by local authorities and AHBs for social housing use, including via the National Treasury Management Agency&rsquo;s Special Purpose Vehicle and the Repair &amp;amp; Leasing Initiative, and the accelerated rollout of the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme.</p><p>Further new social housing projects are being added to the delivery pipeline on a continuous basis and I am keen that all local authorities advance these projects as speedily as possible. This delivery will continue to be weighted in line with housing need and this can be particularly seen in relation to the rapid delivery programme, where a number of build projects are on site in the greater Dublin area that will deliver 200 new social homes over the coming months, with work already underway on advancing a further round of projects.</p></reply>

A commitment was given in the Social Housing Strategy 2020 (published in 2014) to move to producing the SSHA on an annual basis from 2016 onwards. This commitment has been advanced, as it was felt that it was imperative that the SSHA be carried out every year because the provision of housing is a demand led service and it is vital to have regularly updated information on the scale and nature of demand.</p>  <p>  The undertaking of the SSHA on an annual basis will assist in providing a more strategic picture of the dynamic numbers applying for social housing support and emerging trends. This approach will ensure that vulnerable groups in particular are accurately reflected within the assessment process, particularly in light of their additional support requirements. It will also ensure the changing formulation of households, with the increasing number of older people and people with special needs living independently in our communities, is reflected in the SSHA.</p>  <p>  A key issue is to ensure that housing needs can be broken down into sub-groups, so that social housing delivered matches more closely the profile of those in need. Rebuilding Ireland has ambitious targets to deliver a range of housing across the public and private spectrum and the data obtained from the SSHA is of crucial importance in ensuring that the right type of housing is delivered in the right areas for the right people.</p></reply>

The high proportion of overall national house-building taking place in rural areas points to the degree to which indigenous communities in rural areas are being facilitated in meeting their housing needs in those rural areas, with a degree of overspill development from cities and towns as well.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing (2005) are designed to ensure that planning authorities strike a balance between managing the future of rural areas from a development perspective and at the same time enabling housing requirements of rural communities to be met. The Guidelines set out how planning authorities should frame their development plan policies for the different types of rural areas which may exist within the development plan area, which range from rural areas close to cities and towns at risk of overspill development and remoter areas with low levels of development pressure and consistent patterns of population decline.

This enables people to check what is the actual rent being paid for, say, a semi-detached house or a two-bed apartment in their neighbourhood, and in other parts of the country.</p><p>We have taken measures to improve transparency when rents are being determined.  In Rent Pressure Zones, when the rent is being set for a new tenancy, the landlord is obliged to inform the tenant of the previous rent paid for the property and the time at which it was set.  This allows the tenant concerned to see any rent increase being proposed and assess whether the rent being asked is in line with the legislation.</p><p>The suggestion being put forward for an individualised publicly available register of rent prices for all tenancies, would place significant personal information, of both landlords and tenants, in the public domain and would undoubtedly raise significant data protection concerns.</p><p>The RTB's Rent Index Report and the Average Monthly Rent Report are publicly available on the RTB website and, while the RTB is continuously seeking to strengthen its registration and data collection function, there are no plans at this time to introduce the type of register proposed.</p></reply>

I have seen first-hand myself, over recent months, the vital role such schemes are playing in local communities, including supporting social services, across the entire country. </p>  <p>  With this in mind I plan to implement a number of changes to the terms and conditions of participation on CE.  The main purpose of these changes is to broaden the availability of CE to a greater number of people on the live register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on the programme. </p>  <p>  It is also proposed that all CE places will be categorised into one of two strands, either activation, with a target progression rate set at 50%, or social inclusion, with a target progression rate set at 20%.  This categorisation will be based primarily on the work experience element of the place.  In considering the outcomes achieved by a particular scheme, consideration will be given to local labour market conditions and other factors impacting on progression opportunities. </p>  <p>  My Department keeps all aspects of its employment programmes under review to ensure the best outcomes for participants. As part of the implementation of these new measures, my Department is currently consulting with key stakeholders across the country.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The main purpose of these changes is to broaden the availability of CE to a greater number of people on the live register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on the programme. </p>  <p>  The changes I am planning to introduce will see the general qualifying age for CE for those on the live register reduced from 25 to 21 years.  It will also be easier for previous participants, who have exhausted their CE entitlement, to requalify as participation prior to the year 2007 will be disregarded.  While participants between 21 and 55 years on CE will be entitled to one year on the programme, this can be extended by up to 2 more years if they are engaged in a recognised training or education award that is helping them progress towards employment.  All CE participants age 55 and over will be able to avail of 3 consecutive years on a CE scheme.  There will be an overall limit of 6 years participation from 2007 (7 years if on a disability payment). </p>  <p>  In addition I have also agreed to review the current participation limits for older people on CE within the next three months.  As the Deputy will be aware, participation limits are necessary to allow for the utilisation of places amongst qualifying persons to ensure the benefits of CE are available to the widest possible number of jobseeker's. </p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the new measures, my Department is currently consulting with key stakeholders across the country.  If any scheme is experiencing particular difficulties, they should contact their local DSP Intreo office for assistance.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To this end I can confirm my intention to publish and commence the implementation of an Action Plan for the reform of pensions over the coming months.  </p>  <p>  In Ireland there is a significant retirement savings gap which sees just 35% of private sector workers with retirement savings to supplement the State pension. Therefore, and in addition to a range of other long term reform measures, this Action Plan will detail proposals for a transition from the current and purely voluntary supplementary pension system to one which will automatically enrol eligible employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  This reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out, will encourage long term saving and asset accumulation amongst those who may otherwise suffer a reduction in living standards at retirement and will increase the well-being, financial security, and independence of future retirees.</p>  <p>  Following the publication of this Action Plan and in order to guide future Government decisions, the detailed evidence building and consultation required to deliver automatic enrolment will be undertaken over an initial project planning phase.  To this end, and to develop an understanding of potential future expenditure requirements, this evidence building will provide a basis for fundamental choices regarding the preferred operational structure and organisational governance for the system.  Decisions around design parameters such as the required contributions, financial incentives and target membership will also impact on expenditure requirements.  Correctly positioning/designing each of these parameters will be fundamental to the success of any system.  </p>  <p>  Subject to any Government decision regarding the manner in which this project should be progressed, it is my objective that first members would be enrolled in the new system in 2021.

Where the administrator of a pension scheme or a life company is unable to trace a member using their own resources they can use my Department&rsquo;s host mailing service. Following discussions between my Department, the Pensions Authority and the Irish Association of Pension Funds, a revised protocol was put in place in October 2013.  The protocol sets out the Department&rsquo;s requirements for organisations using the host mailing service.  The pension provider must have made an unsuccessful attempt to contact the scheme member.  The Department will forward letters to the last known address of the member based on its records if this address differs from that which the pension provider has.</p>  <p>  From 2013 (relating to the 2012 tax year), P35 returns from employers are collecting the Pensions Authority reference number of any scheme operated by the employer to which the employees contribute.  The collection of this data will, in time, facilitate a linkage of an employee&rsquo;s PPSN with the reference number(s) of the scheme of which they were a member. </p>  <p>  There is currently no tracking service in Ireland that will allow deferred scheme members to trace their pension entitlements.  Such a system is likely to be costly to establish. My Department&rsquo;s meetings with industry have indicated that in many cases they can find owners of funds through their own searches or by utilising the Department&rsquo;s host mailing system.  As such, they may be reluctant to take on the costs of providing information and maintaining data in a tracking service at this stage.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The funding for the scheme was increased this year, as part of Budget 2017, by an additional &euro;5.7 million (almost 14% over the previous year&rsquo;s allocation) which will benefit over 50,000 children.  </p>  <p>  In recent years priority for new applications for funding had been given to schools which are part of the DEIS programme. From September 2016 additional funding is available to all DEIS schools to provide breakfast and lunch to the majority of pupils. Budget 2017 funding also provides for the inclusion in the scheme, from September 2017, of up to 245 new schools and 47,000 children.  This includes support to schools being brought into DEIS and the extension of the scheme to breakfast clubs in non-DEIS schools, which is the first time in many years that increased funding for school meals is available to non-DEIS schools. </p>  <p>  Based on the 2017 budgetary allocation of &euro;47.7 million, the additional annual costs of expanding the school meals programme by 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% are &euro;2.4 million, &euro;4.8 million, &euro;7.2 million and &euro;9.5 million respectively.

The Government is very committed to the RSS and this commitment was clearly demonstrated by the announcement of an additional 500 places in Budget 2017, the first increase in places since 2006.  This measure, allied with my reversal of the previous cuts to Farm Assist, is evident of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that my Department must ensure that only eligible customers benefit from its schemes.  This also applies to people who are participating on the RSS.  Eligibility for participation on the RSS remains limited to those in receipt of certain specified social welfare payments and all participants must be also actively engaged in farming or fishing whilst maintaining an underlying entitlement to Farm/Fish Assistance.  One of the conditions of these payments is the requirement to satisfy a means test.  Payments can be reviewed at any stage to ensure that participants continue to satisfy the underlying conditions. </p>  <p>  In the case referred to by the Deputy, a review of means was carried out by the Local Intreo Office and it has been determined that the weekly means of the person referred to is in excess of the statutory limit for receipt of Farm Assist. As there has been no additional information received to warrant a further review of the household means, this decision still stands.  Therefore, it is not possible to renew the RSS contract of the person concerned.  I have no plans at present to further revise the income threshold applicable for RSS participants.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

If a minor has two guardians but one guardian is unavailable or unwilling to provide consent, a court order is required dispensing with the consent of that guardian. In this particular case, the position is that the applicant has two guardians &ndash;the mother and father. Only the consent of the applicant&rsquo;s mother is given on the passport application form. The Passport Service cannot proceed with the application without either the father&rsquo;s consent or a court order dispensing with it.

The pricing of purchased benefits will be based on the actuarially calculated cost of paying out those benefits at retirement and will operate on a cost neutral basis to the Exchequer.  </p>  <p>  The draft scheme is currently subject to detailed legal and other considerations and the intention is to bring forward Regulations on the new scheme as soon as these considerations are complete.</p></reply>

Insurance Ireland members have committed to take into account all information provided by OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these protected areas. To date OPW has provided details to Insurance Ireland on 17 completed schemes nationally and Insurance Ireland has advised that flood insurance cover is included in 83% of policies in these defended areas. The OPW has recently provided details on a further completed scheme to Insurance Ireland. </p>  <p>  The decision on whether to offer insurance, level of premiums charged and the policy terms applied are matters for individual insurers. Insurance companies make commercial decisions on the provision of insurance cover based on their assessment of the risks they would be accepting on a case-by-case basis. </p>  <p>  The insurance industry has its own flood modelling tools for assessing the level of risk to individual properties and it has highlighted to the OPW that it does not use the OPW Flood Maps to inform its flood modelling. </p>  <p>  Any person with an insurance-related query or complaint can contact Insurance Ireland's Insurance Information Service (01 676 1914 or iis@insuranceireland.eu).  In addition, the Financial Services Ombudsman (1890 88 20 90) deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers.</p>  <p>  Following the severe flood events in Dublin of October 2011, the Camac catchment in the Eastern CFRAM, in which Kilmainham is situated, was accelerated through the process outlined above. While no overall cost-beneficial solution was found for the Camac catchment within the CFRAM study, OPW proposed to Dublin City Council (DCC) that DCC lead on a study to investigate whether viable options exist for more localised areas within the Camac catchment. This study is now being progressed by DCC and South Dublin County Council with assistance and funding provided by OPW. </p>  <p>  In addition to this study, significant remedial flood works were carried out by DCC in 2014 on the Camac in Kilmainham under the Minor Flood Relief Works and Coastal Protection Scheme. This work consisted of the construction of almost 100 metres of new reinforced flood defence walls and the strengthening of existing walls at the rear of properties in Kilmainham.  This work has provided a high level of protection against flooding to the properties in this area.</p></reply>

The terms and conditions of employees in the public service is generally a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. In this context an Interdepartmental Working Group on Fuller Working Lives, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was established in early 2016 to examine issues from prevailing retirement ages for workers in both the public and private sectors. </p>  <p>  The Report of this Group was agreed by Government in August 2016. The report identified a set of framework principles to underpin policy in the area and made a number of recommendations assigned to Government Departments and employer bodies for follow-up.  On foot of the recommendations in this report  the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been tasked with reviewing the current statutory and operational considerations giving rise to barriers to extended participation in the public service workforce up to and including the current and planned age of entitlement to the Contributory State Pensions. This work  is currently underway and expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017.  Any future proposals will be considered in the context of the outcome of the work of this group.</p></reply>

It would be inappropriate for me to comment on testing for Lyme borreliosis in other EU Member States who may use different standards for testing to those used in Ireland.  As testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland there is no requirement for people to travel to other EU Member States to access these services.</p></reply>

This particular provision is transposed from the EU Tobacco Products Directive (2014/40/EU) and was commenced on 20th May 2016. The legislation permitted non-compliant packages to be sold until 20 May 2017. Therefore, cigarette packs for retail sale since 20 May 2017 must be made from carton or soft material.   </p>  <p>  The remaining provisions of the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015 will commence in September, 2017.  From that time all retail packaging for tobacco products manufactured for retail sale must comply with the Act, for example, all packaging will have the same colour and the use of images, logos or text on packs, except health warnings and brand names, will be prohibited. </p>  <p>The Deputy raises the issue of the possible reuse of non-compliant tins by smokers to hide or disguise the standardised packaging and the newly increased sized health warnings.  Research has shown that where smokers displayed such behaviours in terms of efforts to hide the warnings using a case, these smokers were just as likely as others to subsequently attempt to quit smoking and report benefits from health warnings.  The study goes on the state that "  avoidance behaviour might be more reasonably interpreted as a  measure of effectiveness: if the warnings were ineffective in communicating the threatening consequences of smoking there would be no reason to avoid them".</p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to standardised packaging,  a study in Australia found that after the introduction of standardised or plain packaging, there was a slight increase in the use of external cigarette cases for a short period of time before returning to pre-standardised packaging levels.</p></reply>

Therefore, from the 1 October 2018 all tobacco products on sale in Ireland must be in standardised packaging as set out in the legislation.  Tobacco products in older, non-compliant packaging cannot be sold from 1 October 2018 regardless of any increased production of tobacco products which may take place prior to September, 2017.   </p>  <p>  In relation to tobacco manufacturers stocking up on tobacco products prior to the commencement of the standardised packaging legislation, the Department of Finance via the Revenue Commissioners has an overview of such activities and as such I have brought the Deputy's question to their attention.</p></reply>

In Ireland sugar-sweetened drinks alone contribute 5% of the total energy intake in the diet of children.  In high consumers, this can be as much as 13-14% of the energy intake.</p><p>In order to help halt and prevent obesity, last September<i></i>on behalf of the Government, Minister Harris and I launched <i>The Healthy Weight for Ireland: Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016-2025.  </i>This Policy sets a short-term target for a sustained downward trend in levels of excess weight in children and a reduction in the gap in obesity levels between the highest and lowest socio-economic groups by 10%.</p><p>The launch of the <i>Healthy Food For Life</i>programme in December was one of the early actions achieved in the Obesity Action Plan.  My Department uses the Food Pyramid as our nutrition education tool and this programme particularly addresses foods and drinks on the Top Shelf of the Food Pyramid. Sugar sweetened drinks are included with other foods high in fat, sugar and salt on the Top Shelf of the Food Pyramid.  The key message is that these foods and drinks are not needed for good health and we advise having smaller portion sizes and not having these everyday - only a maximum of once or twice a week.  The <i>Healthy Food For Life</i>programme has a suite of 23 resources to facilitate adults and children over 5 years make healthy food choices.</p><p>The European soft drinks sector has committed to reduce added sugars by a further 10% thereby tripling the pace of sugar reduction by 2020.  The commitment will be rolled out across Europe.  This initiative responds to changing consumer preferences regarding sugar and calorie intake and calls from the European Commission for a coordinated approach to reformulation and sugar reduction across the food industry. </p><p>The commitment supports the EU Roadmap for Action on Food Product Improvement and the Annex on Voluntary Reduction of Added Sugars with its 10% sugar reduction target agreed between Member States and the European Commission.  Ireland is playing a lead role in the EU discussions on the reduction of added sugars in sugar-sweetened drinks.</p><p>The industry will achieve its target through increasing its efforts on reformulation and new product innovation - including by using low and no calorie sweeteners - and increasing the availability of smaller pack sizes to allow portion control and moderation.  In addition, soft drinks producers will invest in the promotion of beverages with reduced or no sugar to actively encourage consumer choice towards low and no calorie products.  Independent third party research will monitor progress, which will be shared with stakeholders.</p><p>My Department is requesting that the industry broaden and deepen their efforts on reformulation, now, as time is of the essence in the fight against childhood obesity.  A National Reformulation Technical Working Group to agree Irish targets for reducing fat, sugar and salt is being established and will publish a roadmap for action at the end of the year.  Once targets are agreed, the industry will be invited to engage fully with the process.</p></reply>

The Act sets out the provisions for service providers to respond to decisions made by HIQA and to appeal decisions to the District Court if required. There is no provision in the Act for me as Minister to intervene in decisions made by HIQA or the District Court in these matters.</p>  <p>  HIQA is a fully independent authority charged with ensuring high-quality and safe care for people using our health and social care services in Ireland. I am assured that HIQA takes a proportionate and measured response to issues arising during the inspection and regulation process, and only takes escalated action where significant concerns are present.</p>  <p>  The safety and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the State is paramount. My Department will remain in close contact with the HSE to ensure that all necessary actions are now taken in respect of the facility in question to ensure that its residents are cared for appropriately.  </p>  <p>  The issue of any additional funding requirements in this regard is a service matter for the HSE.  Accordingly I have referred the Deputy&rsquo;s second question to the HSE and have asked that the Executive reply directly to the Deputy on the matter.</p></reply>

This licensed manufacturer is subject to regulatory oversight by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA). </p>  <p>  Should there be an issue in relation to the supply of anti-cancer medications, contingency plans can be implemented under the direction of the National Cancer Control Programme. Contingency measures include: the compounding of chemotherapy in the hospitals which have ACUs, inter-hospital cooperation within hospital groups, the ordering of medications from licensed manufacturers outside of the country, or the preparation of certain medications at ward level or in the pharmacy department in hospitals.</p>  <p>  The recent chemotherapy supply issues relate to manufacturing problems experienced by the Irish supplier of compounded chemotherapy preparations. Under the direction of the NCCP, hospitals implemented the above contingency measures in order to minimise the impact on patients. </p>  <p>  The production of chemotherapy products resumed on Monday 22 May. Contingency plans will remain in place in affected hospitals until full service is resumed. The NCCP will continue to monitor the situation closely over the coming days to ensure that any disruption to patients is minimised.</p>  <p>  The HSE has also indicated it intends to conduct a needs assessment for local compounding requirements at the hospitals providing chemotherapy services.

Competitiveness is one of the key themes of the Food Wise strategy, which includes detailed recommendations aimed at building on  Ireland's comparative advantages in terms of our sustainable, grass-fed production system, our positive business environment, our reputation in science-based innovation and product development and access to a young well-educated population.</p></reply>

The Division co-ordinates the ongoing analysis, consultation and engagement activities being undertaken by a large number of administrative, technical and veterinary staff, through an internal Brexit Response Committee comprised of 16 people drawn from the wide range of Divisions affected by Brexit (including, for example, Meat and Milk Policy, Animal Health and Welfare, Food Industry Development, Economics and Planning, and Seafood Policy and Development).  Of course, Brexit also occupies a considerable amount of my own time and that of Minister of State Doyle, as well as the Secretary General and other senior officials in the Department.  The Brexit Coordination Division also feeds into the whole-of-Government co-ordination being undertaken by the Department of the Taoiseach.  A dedicated Market Access Unit has also been established within the Meat and Milk Policy Division with 3 staff.  Staffing requirements for Brexit associated functions are constantly under review and my Department is currently in the process of recruiting/assigning additional resources to a number of areas including the Brexit Division, the fisheries area and to functions associated with product certification to support trade.  To date in 2017, my Department has hired 92 full time staff to work on a variety of issues including Brexit although, in the main Brexit issues are being dealt with by experienced DAFM staff.  </p>  <p>  Staff hires within State agencies under my Department's auspices are a matter for the State Bodies themselves once they remain within their budget set in their Delegated Sanction. </p></reply>

The working arrangements of the Committee are to meet as required rather than according to a pre-determined schedule.</p>  <p>  Building on more informal consultation arrangements that had been in place in the months leading up to the referendum, I convened the first formal meeting of the Brexit Consultative Committee of Stakeholders on 7 July 2016.  A comprehensive and very useful discussion on the sectorial impacts took place, and this was followed by a further meeting of the Committee on 20 October 2016.</p>  <p>  The next stage of the consultation process took place in the context of the All-Island Civic Dialogue, which commenced in November 2016.  Three sectorial meetings for the agrifood and fisheries sectors took place between December 2016 and February 2017.  The first, which comprehensively examined the potential impacts and potential solutions for the cattle and sheep, dairy, and pigs and poultry sectors, took place on 15 December 2016.  The second, dealing with issues in the fisheries sector, took place on 1 February 2017.  The third addressed the implications for the forestry, horticulture, prepared consumer foods and cereals/animal feed sectors, and took place on 8 February 2017.</p>  <p>  This first stage of the All-Island Civic Dialogue concluded with a plenary discussion in Dublin Castle on 17 February 2017 which addressed, among other things, the agrifood and fisheries issues that had been raised during the sectorial meetings. </p>  <p>  I then held a further meeting of the Stakeholder Consultative Committee on 11 April 2017.  </p>  <p>  A second phase of the All-Island Civic Dialogue has now commenced.  As part of this, I have hosted a further sectorial dialogue for the alcohol, beverage and distilling sector on 3 May 2017, and arrangements are currently being made for a similar gathering for the equine and greyhound sectors on  June.  </p>  <p>  All of these consultations are helping to further inform my approach and that of my Department to the challenges presented by Brexit for the agrifood and fisheries sectors, and the Brexit Consultative Committee of Stakeholders will continue to play a vital role in this regard.</p></reply>

We don't know yet what changes the UK may seek to the current arrangements. </p>  <p>  In theory, the UK could indeed restrict access to their waters and or seek to gain larger quota shares at the expense of others.   However, that could only happen if the UK were content to ignore the potential repercussions that would certainly arise from the EU side.  </p>  <p>  On average, 35% of Irish landings are currently taken from UK waters.  However, for some of our most important stocks the figures are even higher. </p>  <p>  Limitations on access and, more worryingly, any attempt by the UK to increase its current quota share at the expense of Ireland and others must, and will be, resisted strenuously.  These twin threats, could also lead to increased activity by other EU vessels in the waters around Ireland threatening the long term sustainability of our stocks. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I hosted a dedicated Civic Dialogue on the potential impacts of Brexit for the seafood sector as a whole.  This was very well attended by stakeholders from across the industry and gave a clear insight into the real dangers that a 'hard' Brexit presents for our fishing communities.  </p>  <p>  I will remain in close contact with fisheries stakeholders as the issues develop and work with them and my fellow fisheries Ministers in the EU to ensure that we are all fully prepared for what are likely to be extremely complex negotiations.   </p>  <p>  I am also continuing to work closely with all of my European colleagues to ensure that fisheries remain a top priority in the negotiations to come. </p>  <p>  As both I and An Taoiseach have stated before, we intend to ensure that fisheries remains high on the Brexit agenda in the EU and that Ireland obtains the best possible outcome from the negotiations. Last week (11 May), as part of Chief Brexit Negotiator, Mr Michel Barnier's visit  to Ireland, I met him and discussed the issues arising for the agrifood sector.  On fisheries, I explained Ireland's perspective and that it was shared by a number of EU partners.  I am satisfied that Mr Barnier understands the issues and significance of BREXIT for Ireland's fisheries sector.  He supports my view that fisheries negotiations must  be progressed in the context of trade and will fall into the second phase  of negotiations.  I also made clear that transitional arrangements are likely to be important for the seafood sector. </p>  <p>   In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that I will be unequivocal in opposing any dilution of our existing EU quota shares, including protecting the benefit to Ireland of the Hague Preferences, and any limitations on our existing rights of access.</p></reply>

The EU regulations governing these schemes prescribe that land being submitted for payment must be in an eligible state.</p>  <p>  All applicants under the Basic Payment Scheme and other area-based schemes who have submitted their 2017 applications to my Department should review their applications and identify if the application includes land which has been burned in the closed period and consider removing this land from their application.  The withdrawal of such land from their application can be undertaken by using the Department's On-line facility or by downloading an Amendment Form from the Department's website and posting it to the Department's Office in Portlaoise.</p>  <p>  The relevant European regulations allow for penalties not to be imposed where the applicant can demonstrate that he or she is not at fault for the non-compliance.  The regulations also provide for exceptions in relation to land eligibility requirements in the case of force majeure and exceptional circumstances.  However the Department is constrained by European law which requires these exceptions to be interpreted narrowly.  In the case of eligibility requirements it would be for the applicant to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department that such exceptional circumstances arise.  This may require, where appropriate, the applicant to demonstrate that all reasonable measures have been taken to prevent such damage.  My Department will examine every such case on an individual basis to determine if these exceptions are applicable.</p></reply>

There is a strong global demand for meat, including beef, and figures from the European Commission's most recent Short Term Outlook for meat markets show a projected growth of per capita beef consumption of 2.1% for 2016.  Whilst Ireland exported approximately 97% of our beef exports in 2016 to EU (including 50% to the UK), I am very conscious of the importance of growing third country markets as a valuable outlet for any increased Irish beef production, and indeed this is a crucial component of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  Significant progress has been made in this context in recent years and my Department is currently in the process of attempting to secure beef access to a range of Third Countries including China, South Korea, Ukraine, Thailand and Vietnam.  This builds upon the opening of some major markets in the last two years including the US, Canada and Japan.  This is a vital means of providing our beef sector with as many commercial opportunities as possible for Irish beef, in addition to our existing EU markets.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  </p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>In April, eir signed an agreement with me committing them to follow through on their commercial plans to provide broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas.  Eir has committed to doing this work over a 90 week period, with an average of 500 premises passed per day.  My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eir meets its obligations under the Agreement.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website .The decision by eir to invest in infrastructure to deploy high speed broadband services to an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland was taken purely on commercial grounds. Neither I nor the Department have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard. </p><p>I also published  in April an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at . which finalises the State Intervention area. The updated Map shows the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:</p><p>The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,</p><p>The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p><p>The map shows that the entire townland of Corkeragh in County Kildare is in the AMBER area and will require State Intervention. Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at </p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.The  three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second. </p><p>The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers. </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP once contracts are in place. </p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand and a prioritisation programme.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. </p><p>In this regard, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force in July 2016 together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and is  available at the following link:<i>.</i></p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders. The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers. </p><p>  The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p><p>In 2016, I signed regulations which allowed ComReg to proceed with an auction of the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band. This has resulted in the successful assignment earlier this week of all 350 MHz of spectrum to five winning bidders. This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services  .</p><p>I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE in my Department's Estimates for 2017 to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage. The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.  </p><p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

The securing of routes and negotiations with airlines for the provision of services are matters for the Board and management of the Airport.  In that regard, I am aware from Waterford Airport that commercial discussions with a potential new airline operator are currently at a very advanced stage.  It is hoped that positive news on scheduled air services will be forthcoming in the near future. </p>  <p>  Waterford Airport has received substantial Exchequer support under the Regional Airports Programme - almost &euro;20 million over the past 10 years. This Programme also supports the other three regional airports in Counties Donegal, Mayo and Kerry with funding to assist them with implementing necessary safety and security related projects and activities, including measures in these two areas that are requisite to comply with regulatory requirements.  We will not be in a position to consider further Exchequer support for Waterford until air services are resumed.</p>  <p>  In relation to the recent amendment to the EU General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER), this Regulation exempts certain categories of state aid from the requirement of prior notification to the Commission, if these are unlikely to distort competition in the Single Market.  This will have limited impact for our regional airports since Ireland has already received State-aid clearance from the EU Commission in 2015 for our current, five-year, Regional Airports Programme 2015-2019.</p>  <p>  There is one new concession (for airports that handle less than 200,000 passengers annually) in the revised GBER regime that would be relevant to Waterford, and that is that they would be eligible for aid towards operating losses, if incurred.  In practice, however, Waterford is already eligible for this kind of operational support under our current Regional Airports Programme.</p></reply>

There are a number of industry subsectors and major employers where exports to the UK make up in excess of 40% of total exports. The Construction Products, Construction Services, Engineering, Agriculture Machinery, Timber, Furniture and Food are all sectors that have a high level of sales to the UK and are very regionally dispersed sectors.</p>  <p>  The regional spread of the Enterprise Ireland cohort of companies is very much to the forefront of my strategic planning for Brexit. For the longer term, it is important that we intensify our supports to build the competitiveness of individual companies that have the ambition and the capability to compete on world markets.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Local Enterprises Offices are the main vehicles for channelling Government support to start ups and business expansion in the regions. Some 84% of LEO client jobs are outside of Dublin and Cork urban areas and 62% of EI client employment is located in the regions. In 2016, 65% of payments by Enterprise Ireland were to companies located outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  Both regional balance and Brexit are significant components of the 2017 Action Plan for Jobs, the Regional Action Plans and the Rural Development Action Plan.</p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plans for Jobs initiative is a concrete example of the targeted approach we are undertaking to boost regional employment and to support each region to achieve its economic potential. We are seeing progress. The most recent QNHS figures show that over 77% of the new jobs added in the year to Q1 2017 were outside Dublin, with the unemployment rate falling across all regions in the same period.</p>  <p>  As well as being a top priority at Government level, the implications of the Brexit vote on Irish enterprises are, and will continue to be, an important item on the agenda of meetings of the 9 Regional Implementation Committees that are charged with overseeing and monitoring the Regional Plans.</p>  <p>  On Monday 29 May, I will launch a &euro;60m Regional Enterprise Development Fund with Minister of State for Employment and Labour Pat Breen TD. The Fund will support major new collaborative and innovative initiatives that can make a significant impact on enterprise development and job creation in the region/across regions or nationally. The competitive process for funding will be managed by Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  Through this &euro;60m fund, the Government will be backing local stakeholders to drive their own futures by putting forward their own proposals to deliver sustainable employment.</p>  <p>  Investing in Regional Enterprise Infrastructure is a crucial response to building the resilience of our regions to cope with any external challenge. By strengthening the infrastructure at local, regional and national levels, we aim to stimulate a new generation of entrepreneurs, support and grow established enterprises and encourage their ambition, and scale more businesses with global potential.</p>  <p>  As the situation evolves, we will monitor the potential and real impacts of Brexit on each Region.</p></reply>

On 12 May last I hosted a major conference organised by my Department in Dublin Castle on the Future of Work involving government, employee representatives, employers and academia to address the challenges posed by the new world of work. Rapid technological advances have given rise to new ways of working. The conference had a particular focus on the impact of technology on the traditional employer/employee relationship. </p>  <p>  This new world presents opportunities and challenges. While the flexibility and competitive advantage offered by new technologies is to be welcomed,  a balance  must be struck with the need to ensure continued employment rights protections. One of the messages coming from the conference was that care needs to be taken in any desire to regulate so that genuine innovation is not stifled and, equally importantly, that what might ultimately be found by employment rights adjudication bodies both here and abroad to be simply rebranding of workers performing work does not drive the regulatory agenda.</p>  <p>  In most cases it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed. Where there is doubt in relation to the employment status of an individual the relevant Departments and Agencies will have regard to the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals. This Code was drawn up and agreed in 2007 by the relevant Government Departments with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) and the Irish Business and Employers&rsquo; Confederation (Ibec).</p>  <p>  Where an individual believes they are being deprived of employment rights applicable to employees they may refer a complaint to the WRC where the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication leading to a decision that is enforceable through the District Court. WRC inspectors can also be asked to investigate certain breaches. As indicated earlier a number of what are loosely termed gig economy arrangements are only recently finding their way into adjudicatory processes for adjudication across the EU. </p>  <p>It is important to remember than some working in the gig economy are correctly categorised as self-employed. However, the Deputy will also be aware that the Department of Finance and Department of Social Protection have conducted a joint public consultation on the Use of Intermediary-Type Structures and Self-Employment Arrangements  .  It is important that individuals are correctly designated as regards employment status, so that those who ought to be designated as employees are not deprived of employment rights.  This is particularly the case for vulnerable workers who may not feel in a position to object to certain arrangements.</p></reply>

Supporting research is a key pillar of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise policy given its role in driving productivity, competitiveness and thereby the creation and maintenance of jobs.  </p><p>It should be noted that, as indicated in the most recent European Innovation Scoreboard, Ireland leads Europe in economic success stemming from innovation in terms of employment, revenue and exports.

Year on year, Ireland has successfully built up research capacity, a significant reputation for research excellence and has an increasing base of enterprises engaging in R&amp;amp;D and innovation activity. </p><p>Continuing to build on this performance, Innovation 2020 (Ireland&rsquo;s cross-government strategy for research and development, science and technology) outlines a range of policy responses aimed at increasing the number of indigenous enterprises engaged in R&amp;amp;D activities as well as increasing their R&amp;amp;D expenditures. The following key actions are aligning the public effort to maximise R&amp;amp;D activity in SMEs: </p><p>- Support for knowledge transfer and commercialisation has been stepped up. </p><p>- The refresh of research prioritisation exercise is reviewing the priority areas for publicly funded research and will target new areas where enterprises could build a competitive advantage. </p><p>- New policy tools have been developed to encourage private participation in R&amp;amp;D both in their own right and in collaboration with publically funded research programmes.  </p><p>- The R&amp;amp;D tax credit was made more accessible and improvements to the credit have catalysed increased private investment in R&amp;amp;D.</p><p>- The Knowledge Development Box was introduced to act as a further incentive for companies engaged in R&amp;amp;D, allowing them to claim tax relief on profits arising from qualifying IP.</p><p>- A review of the current suite of RDI supports for enterprise is currently underway to ensure that supports use public resources efficiently, that they are readily accessible by enterprise and that they are aligned with enterprise needs. </p><p>Furthermore, Enterprise Ireland is proactively working with Irish SMEs to improve their R&amp;amp;D capacity and has developed an initiative to optimise their suite of RDI supports to enable them to respond to changes in the market.</p></reply>
