    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-17a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051700051#WRA00600"><p>I keep in regular contact with the Garda representative bodies.  As regards recent meetings, I met with the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI) on the 20 April last and have indicated that I am open to meeting them again shortly.  I met the Garda Representative Association (GRA) on 27 January and expect to meet them again within the next two weeks.  In addition, my officials engage with the Associations through various industrial relations fora and bilaterally.  Indeed, they have  met the GRA, AGSI and the Association of Garda Superintendents within the last few days and further discussions are planned, including with the Association of Chief Superintendents.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware both the GRA and AGSI have rejected the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  That is their right and I understand that there are a variety of reasons for their rejection of the Agreement.  The Programme for Government restates the Government's commitment to the Lansdowne Road Agreement as the <font color="#181818">framework for industrial relations and pay determination within the public service</font>until 2018.  Within this framework, the Programme commits to the establishment of a Commission for Public Sector Pay <font color="#2F2F2F">to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay, and to the gradual, negotiated repeal of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts.</font></p><p>I am very conscious of the frustration of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the pace of pay restoration; it is a frustration shared by all public servants who played a significant part in stabilising the public finances and bringing about the economic recovery.  The Commission, when established, will provide the forum for the consideration of matters relating to the pay of all public servants, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the coming years, and I am committed to doing everything in my power to assist the Associations in ensuring that their members - the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - are appropriately rewarded for the challenging and often dangerous work that they do on our behalf, day in day out.  In my view, this can best be achieved by their participation in the Commission within the framework of the Lansdowne Road Agreement.</p><p>My Department and I will continue to engage actively with the GRA and AGSI, in particular, over the coming weeks with the objective of creating a pathway to their re-engagement with the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  I see this process addressing, to the greatest extent possible, the main issues of concern to the Associations and their members, including the decision of the European Committee of Social Rights in EuroCop v Ireland and I can assure the Deputy that I will be approaching these discussions positively with the ambition of reaching a solution that works for the Associations, their members, and the public at large.</p></reply>

The consultation document sets out a number of policy options taking account of the views expressed in previous reports on the issue, Private Members' Bills introduced by Deputy McGrath, a Report by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service and the observations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the issue.</p>  <p>  A total of 6 submissions were received many of which had common proposals for introducing safeguards to prevent stolen items of jewellery being sold to businesses trading in precious metals and stones.  Proposals included some form of registration or licensing system; basic identity checks and recording of same when precious metal and/or stones are purchased by businesses; payments for relevant items purchased to be made by cheque or electronic means.</p>  <p>  On the basis of the submissions received, and having regard to proposals previously made in this connection, it is my intention to bring forward a proportionate legislative response which will include a system of registration, regulation regarding the purchase of precious metals and stones, powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and penalties for non-compliance.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the consultation document, as an initial step my Department will need to consult with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to obtain their views on how to best implement this recommended course of action.  Furthermore my Department is committed to liaising with other relevant Departments and agencies to further strengthen the regulation of the sale and purchase of scrap metal.  There will, of course, be further opportunity for the Deputy and other interested parties to contribute to the process.</p></reply>

This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles.</p>  <p>  Over &euro;34 million has been invested in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015.  This significant investment provides the Garda&iacute; with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles for high-visibility road policing.  Investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.</p>  <p>  The Government is also investing in Garda airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems.  In fact, the Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides an additional &euro;205 million for Garda ICT over the lifetime of the Plan which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime.  In addition, the Government will support investment in CCTV at key locations along the road network and in urban centres.</p>  <p>  In terms of existing technology, the Deputy will be aware that a considerable amount of new Garda ICT solutions has been delivered over the past number of years.  These include the deployment of a secure national digital radio system (NDRS), the deployment and support of Garda and Community CCTV systems, an automated number plate recognition (ANPR) system and the addition of many new functions to the PULSE system, which itself is further supported by a dedicated Garda data entry service in Castlebar.  These and other new technological solutions, as well as the investment in resources, will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to provide effective policing services in responding to the evolving challenges of modern day criminal activity.</p>  <p>  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing demonstrates this Government's commitment to investing in 21st Century policing and will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.</p>  <p>  I have assured An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that they have the full support of the Government in their efforts to disrupt gang-related crime and they will continue to access all resources necessary, including extensive overtime, to support them in delivering concentrated visible policing measures to tackle gang-related crime.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-17a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051700051#WRA01300"><p>At the outset, I would like to say that I am very conscious of the ongoing trauma and distress for the families and friends of persons who go missing and, in relation to the case referred to by the Deputy, I can assure the House that I am fully aware of the various concerns which have been raised about it.  I am also mindful of the sensitivity of the issues involved and, in this regard, I might add that I have previously met with the next of kin of the missing person, who is also the principal point of contact within the family for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>As I have outlined in responses to previous parliamentary questions in relation to this case, the disappearance of the person in question remains the subject of an ongoing Garda investigation.  In these circumstances, I am sure that everyone in this House will understand that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific aspects of this case<b><font color="#000080">.</font></b>I am also mindful of the need to ensure that nothing we say would add to the distress which the family in this case has already experienced. </p><p>However, I can confirm to the Deputy that I have given very close attention to correspondence received in my Department which raised issues in relation to the Garda investigation and also the question of holding an inquest.  In relation to the Garda investigation, I am advised that a Garda Review Team is endeavouring to advance the investigation and that all avenues of inquiry are being fully being pursued.  I also understand that two complaints in relation to the case have been investigated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC).  I am advised that no misbehaviour on the part of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was identified by GSOC and the complainant was notified of these findings.</p><p>In relation to the holding of an inquest, the Deputy may be aware that, under the Coroners Act 1962, as amended, a coroner is a statutory officer exercising quasi-judicial functions, in relation to which he or she is independent.  A Coroner is responsible for the scheduling and conducting of inquests in his or her district and neither I nor my Department has any role in the conduct of an inquest in individual cases.</p><p>In conclusion, I can inform the Deputy that I have recently issued responses to the correspondence which I received about certain aspects of this case and I have asked my officials and the Garda authorities to keep me updated on further developments in this matter.</p></reply>

I can, however, inform the Deputy that an information leaflet dealing specifically with vehicle crime prevention is available from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's website, and this details a range of practical steps that vehicle owners can take, including the use of vehicle tracking systems.</p><p>I will of course bring any particular suggestions the Deputy has in relation to further enhancing vehicle crime prevention to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

The development of the Garda projects under PPP involves collaboration between my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of Public Works and the National Development Finance Agency.</p><p>I am advised that an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently engaging with the Office of Public Works in relation to the allocation of a site in Sligo for this development.</p><p>The Refurbishment Programme provides for over &euro;60 million in direct Exchequer funding as part of the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 and a public private partnership.  The direct Exchequer funding includes &euro;18 million provided in the Garda vote under the Capital Plan which is additional to the funding allocated to the OPW vote.</p><p>The Programme was developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the OPW having regard to the strategic priorities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and includes:</p><p>- the development of new stations through a public private partnership project;</p><p>- major refurbishment of stations/facilities including facilities for meeting victims of crime;</p><p>- essential remedial works to existing stations;</p><p>- development of large scale property and exhibit management stores (PEMS);</p><p>- upgrade to cells and provision of improved custody management facilities.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts. Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review taking into account crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources. </p><p>I would point out, however, that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme for Government, &quot;<font color="#333333">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-17a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051700051#WRA01900"><p>I can inform the Deputy that I met recently yesterday with representatives of a number of community networks based in Dublin's North Inner City, at their request, and visited a youth project in the area.  We discussed a wide range of complex and serious issues that affect the community in the North Inner city including the recent murders which have caused such distress in the area. </p>  <p>  I outlined at the meeting, as I have in response to earlier questions today, that I remain committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the necessary resources to confront and oppose violent crime.  In this regard the Government has already moved decisively to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang related crime in the Dublin area, with a special allocation of &euro;5 million to support concentrated policing measures, including steps to establish a dedicated Armed Support Unit in the Dublin area.  The Garda response includes highly visible policing, the use of armed checkpoints, and targeted and intelligence based operations to disrupt and prevent incidents as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved.  There has been no diminution in these operations in recent weeks and the Garda authorities have assured me that the opposite is in fact the case.</p>  <p>  Tackling the drugs trade is central to the policing measures in place to tackle community safety concerns in the North Inner City, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a long term partner in a number of local consultative fora and engages extensively with the community in the area.  My Department also funds a number Youth Diversion and Probation Projects working in the area to address offending and divert those at risk.</p>  <p>  As I am sure the Deputy will agree, however, the broader health and social issues associated with drug misuse are not ones which the Justice sector can address on its own.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-17a.33.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051700051#WRA02300"><p>As the Deputy is aware, I published the report of the O'Higgins Commission of Investigation into certain matters relevant to the Cavan/Monaghan Division of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the 11th of May.  I want, again, to record my thanks to Mr Justice O'Higgins and his team for carrying out their task so expeditiously and for the thorough and thoughtful report.  It deserves the most careful consideration so that we can all do everything possible to avoid a repeat of the issues which gave rise to it in the first place. </p>  <p>  Using the wide range of statutory powers available to it, the Commission of Investigation has established, as definitively as it is possible to do, the facts surrounding the difficult matters it was asked to examine.  Inevitably, Mr Justice O'Higgins reaches a number of conclusions about the roles played by a number of persons in the events outlined in his report.  I hope all those affected can accept, as I do fully, that Mr Justice O'Higgins looked at the facts fairly and dispassionately and made every effort to do justice to the position of all.</p>  <p>  Whatever controversies might have surrounded some of the issues dealt with in the report we should not lose sight of one central and unpalatable fact: that victims were not best served by the Garda&iacute; in a number of these cases.  That is as unacceptable as it is disheartening and we must take all measures open to us to ensure that these shortcomings are not repeated.  It is victims who should be our central concern.</p>  <p>  Some of the events investigated by Mr Justice O&rsquo;Higgins go back almost a decade.  For my own part, I believe that it is abundantly clear that the system we had in place up to a couple of years ago to deal with reports of wrongdoing within the Garda&iacute; served no-one particularly well: not the people making the reports, not the people the subject of those reports, not the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, above all, not the public.  This situation has been significantly transformed in a number of respects. In particular, the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which was part of the previous Government's comprehensive approach to enhance the protection available to whistleblowers, provides a new mechanism for protected disclosures relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Now, a Garda member may make a protected disclosure to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, a statutorily independent body with a comprehensive range of powers available to it.  The Ombudsman Commission may, if it believes it is in the public interest to do so, investigate such a complaint.  The Act also provides Garda&iacute; who make protected disclosures with all the protections set out in the Act, including protection from dismissal and protection from penalisation.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, there has been an unprecedented programme of Garda reform which, having had the honour of being reappointed as Minister for Justice and Equality, I am determined to continue to progress.</p>  <p>  For all those changes which have taken place or are under way, it is important that we look specifically at what the report by Mr Justice O'Higgins has to say.  In this regard, I have asked the Garda Commissioner to examine the report and to indicate to me what further measures might be taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent a recurrence of the particular issues dealt with in the report.</p>  <p>  I have also forwarded a copy of the report to the Policing Authority in the context of its statutory role in relation to oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  I very much appreciate that the events outlined in the report have been traumatic for many people who have been affected by them.  It would be an injustice to those who brought events to light in the public interest and those who have lived under the shadow of these events for a long time, if we do not take on board the lessons from these events.  I hope they can take some reassurance from the fact that the examination of those events in this report will help serve to consolidate a programme of reform which will ensure we continue to have a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in which its members and the community it serves can take great pride.</p></reply>

Ireland's current Road Safety Strategy covers the period 2013-2020 and seeks to close the gap between Ireland and the safest countries in the European Union and beyond.  Progress in relation to the actions and outcomes set out in this strategy are monitored on an ongoing basis by the Road Safety Authority and the other agencies involved, and overseen at a Ministerial Committee on Road Safety. </p>  <p>  Insofar as road traffic enforcement is concerned, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Roads Policing Operations Plan 2016 incorporates a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies, and is being implemented by each Regional Traffic Superintendent.  The focus of the Roads Policing Operations Plan for 2016 is on the most vulnerable road user categories of motor cyclists, pedal cyclists, pedestrians and learner permit holders.  Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including speeding, driving while intoxicated, and use of a mobile phone.</p>  <p>  Insofar as the court case referred to by the Deputy is concerned, issues surrounding the application of Court-awarded penalty points to driving licences remains a priority for the Criminal Justice Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS) Working Group.  In this context, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is currently drafting tenders in relation to the detailed implementation of the &lsquo;master driver licence record&rsquo;.  This project will assist by better linking vehicle and driver databases, thereby facilitating the application of penalty points to driving licences.  Other issues arising from the case referred to are being studied at present, in consultation with the relevant agencies.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review taking into account crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.</p><p>The overall response to the problem of drug misuse is set out in the National Drugs Strategy for the period 2009-2016.  The Strategy provides a co-ordinated and comprehensive response to the issue of drug misuse and is very much founded on a partnership approach.</p><p>Further to the Strategy and in line with the Policing Plan, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to prioritise tackling drugs and organised crime as a core focus of its work.  In this regard multi-disciplinary approaches are utilised to ensure that those involved in illicit drugs activity are effectively targeted including through the use of drugs legislation, the Proceeds of Crime legislation, money laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p><p>The recently merged National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau continues to lead out the policing strategy for tackling drugs supply.  This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.</p><p>I am informed that Garda management is satisfied that a comprehensive policing service in the Cavan/Monaghan Division continues to be delivered and that current structures in place meet the requirement to deliver an effective and efficient policing service to the community.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme for Government, &quot;<font color="#333333">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware since the Garda College reopened in September 2014, a total of 700 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 450 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year.  So far 395 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that 10 newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to Cavan/Monaghan Division. </p><p>I have been informed that as of the 31 March 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 314 members assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Garda Division.</p><p>It is expected that a further 300 trainees will attest by the end of this year which, taking account of projected retirements, will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark.  We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I will be engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years. </p></reply>

A panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel was established for that purpose. </p>  <p>  The outcome of the review of this case issued to the individual in question last December.  The recommendation made by counsel was that I should take no further action in this case and the person was informed of the reasons for that outcome.  I appreciate that it may difficult for the person in question to accept that, as Minister for Justice and Equality, I do not have the authority to review Garda investigations or decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions nor do I have to authority to initiate criminal investigations or prosecutions.  There are good and sound reasons for that which the Deputy well appreciates.  I would remind the Deputy, nevertheless, that the case had been the subject of an earlier review by a senior counsel arising from which the then Minister decided against establishing any further inquiry.  Notwithstanding that, the case was considered by the Independent Review Mechanism and I have already indicated that it recommended that I take no further action in the case.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Independent Review Mechanism, I would like to emphasise that every case presented to the panel was reviewed by independent counsel, who made an objective recommendation.  It was open to counsel to make any recommendation that they saw fit.</p>  <p>  I want to stress the independence of this process.  The cases were all considered by independent counsel, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.</p>  <p>  Following their reviews of the papers in each case, counsel made recommendations to me as to whether or not further action should be carried out by me, and if so the nature of that action.  In many cases the outcome was there was no further action which should or indeed which could be taken by me as Minister.</p>  <p>  To ensure that all complainants received an accurate account of the process, I also appointed a retired judge, Mr Justice Roderick Murphy, to advise on the preparation of individual letters notifying each person of the outcome of the review in their particular case.  I was concerned that these letters should not only set out the recommendation of counsel, but also outline as far as possible the reasons for the recommendation, subject to any legal constraints there may be.  I made this appointment in order to provide complete reassurance on the probity and independence of this entire process, from start to finish. </p>  <p>  I have repeatedly emphasised that the Independent Review Mechanism was not established to act as a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation.  Nor was it designed to make findings.  Its purpose was to triage the allegations to see whether further action was needed and what that action would be.</p>  <p>  I have previously assured Deputies that where further investigation has been recommended by the review then that will occur.  However, I have also pointed out that in a large proportion of cases, counsel would be likely to recommend that no further action could reasonably be taken.  This has proven to be the case.</p>  <p>  As I have already stated, I appreciate that some complainants will be disappointed or unhappy with the outcome but the review was independent and came to its own conclusions in all cases.</p></reply>

The Bureau utilises the local knowledge supplied to it by the asset profilers which allows the Bureau to target the proceeds of crime in local communities.  They also assist the Bureau with preparatory groundwork in advance of a full investigation and have recourse to the expertise and advice of the Bureau.</p>  <p>  These profilers also assist in criminal investigations occurring within their own Divisions involving the targeting of persons suspected of being in possession of assets derived from criminal conduct. </p>  <p>  The Divisional Assets Profiling unit at Store Street liaises with the Criminal Asset Bureau and has received training and guidance in the area of asset profiling.  Members of the Unit are utilising this training, coupled with local knowledge and experience to target individuals who are dealing drugs in local communities.  An initial number of targets have been identified and investigations are ongoing into these individuals.  Files are being prepared for the Criminal Assets Bureau's attention where assessments will be considered.</p>  <p>  The operation of the Assets Profiler Programme and its complement of asset profilers is kept under ongoing review.

These Regulations provided for the appointment of an independent Confidential Recipient to whom Garda members, and civilian support staff, could report, in full confidence, instances where they believed there may have been corruption or malpractice within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  This system was replaced by the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which came into operation on 15 July 2014.  The Act was part of the then Government's comprehensive approach to enhancing the protections available to whistle blowers, including members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Under the Act, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) is prescribed as a body authorised to receive protected disclosures on Garda matters.  Accordingly, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or they may make a disclosure to GSOC, which is a statutorily independent body.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure.  It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda&iacute; who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the Act.  These protections include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from dismissal and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure.</p>  <p>  So the Deputy will see that there have been very significant changes in to the regime for making protected disclosures by member of the Garda&iacute;.  I am satisfied that the legislative provisions now in place under the 2014 Act, including the protections afforded for whistleblowers, will prove to be an effective remedy for Garda members who wish to report their concerns regarding potential wrongdoing. </p>  <p>  I am also satisfied that GSOC has the appropriate powers and experience to carry out its role in dealing with any protected disclosures made to them.</p></reply>

The conduct of any court case, including the determination of liability between the parties to an action concerning a personal injury is a matter entirely for the presiding judge and the Minister has no function in this matter.  However, I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to a number of initiatives in the general area of compensation for personal injury.  Legislation is currently being drafted to allow courts to make provision for periodic payment orders in circumstances where lump sums are currently awarded as a consequence of individuals suffering catastrophic injury because of the negligence of another.  I hope to be in a position to publish the draft Bill in the next session of the Oireachtas.</p><p>The Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 includes provisions relating to the making of regulations for Pre-Action Protocols in cases of clinical negligence actions.  Work has begun in my Department on framing these Regulations which are aimed at encouraging timely communications between parties and the early resolution of such actions.  The Deputy may also wish to note that this Act also contains a number of measures relating to legal costs including the establishment of a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator to replace the existing Taxing Masters Office; the introduction of new rules relating to the charging of types of fees by legal practitioners and advance notification of costs to their clients; and the introduction of a system of public complaints about all legal practitioners, including complaints as to costs, to be dealt with for the first time by an independent statutory authority, the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</p><p>The Mediation Bill, which is currently being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person intending to commence legal proceedings to give consideration to using mediation as an alternative means of resolving disputes.  It is intended that this will help to reduce recourse to the courts, as well as the costs and delays which may arise during court proceedings.  The Bill will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of any such proceedings, on its own initiative or at the request of a party to the proceedings, invite the parties to consider mediation as an alternative option and suspend the proceedings to facilitate that process.  I expect to be in a position to publish this long-awaited Bill early in the next session.</p><p>In addition, I understand that my colleague, Richard Bruton, then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, met with the Hon.

I want, again, to record my thanks to Mr Justice O'Higgins and his team for carrying out their task so expeditiously and for the thorough and thoughtful report.  It deserves the most careful consideration so that we can all do everything possible to avoid a repeat of the issues which gave rise to it in the first place. </p>  <p>  Using the wide range of statutory powers available to it, the Commission of Investigation has established, as definitively as it is possible to do, the facts surrounding the difficult matters it was asked to examine.  Inevitably, Mr Justice O'Higgins reaches a number of conclusions about the roles played by a number of persons in the events outlined in his report.  I hope all those affected can accept, as I do fully, that Mr Justice O'Higgins looked at the facts fairly and dispassionately and made every effort to do justice to the position of all. </p>  <p>  Whatever controversies might have surrounded some of the issues dealt with in the report we should not lose sight of one central and unpalatable fact: that victims were not best served by the Garda&iacute; in a number of these cases.  That is as unacceptable as it is disheartening and we must take all measures open to us to ensure that these shortcomings are not repeated.  It is victims who should be our central concern.</p>  <p>  Some of the events investigated by Mr Justice O&rsquo;Higgins go back almost a decade.  For my own part, I believe that it is abundantly clear that the system we had in place up to a couple of years ago to deal with reports of wrongdoing within the Garda&iacute; served no-one particularly well: not the people making the reports, not the people the subject of those reports, not the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, above all, not the public.  This situation has been significantly transformed in a number of respects.  In particular, the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which was part of the previous Government's comprehensive approach to enhance the protection available to whistleblowers, provides a new mechanism for protected disclosures relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Now, a Garda member may make a protected disclosure to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, a statutorily independent body with a comprehensive range of powers available to it.  The Ombudsman Commission may, if it believes it is in the public interest to do so, investigate such a complaint.  The Act also provides Garda&iacute; who make protected disclosures with all the protections set out in the Act, including protection from dismissal and protection from penalisation.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, there has been an unprecedented programme of Garda reform which, having had the honour of being reappointed as Minister for Justice and Equality, I am determined to continue to progress.</p>  <p>  For all those changes which have taken place or are underway, it is important that we look specifically at what the report by Mr Justice O'Higgins has to say.  In this regard, I have asked the Garda Commissioner to examine the report and to indicate to me what further measures might be taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent a recurrence of the particular issues dealt with in the report.</p>  <p>  I have also forwarded a copy of the report to the Policing Authority in the context of its statutory role in relation to oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  I very much appreciate that the events outlined in the report have been traumatic for many people who have been affected by them.  It would be an injustice to those who brought events to light in the public interest and those who have lived under the shadow of these events for a long time, if we do not take on board the lessons from these events.  I hope they can take some reassurance from the fact that the examination of those events in this report will help serve to consolidate a programme of reform which will ensure we continue to have a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in which its members and the community it serves can take great pride.</p></reply>

The Act provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection, which is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process.  The new procedure will significantly streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications and will reduce the length of time that persons spend in the Direct Provision system.  Preparations for commencement of the single procedure are progressing. </p>  <p>  At the end of April there were some 4,400 persons living in the direct provision system.  This is a reduction from the figure of approximately 5,100 at the end of 2014 notwithstanding that the number of persons seeking asylum last year more than doubled compared with 2014.  This reflects the significant progress made in processing cases on hand over this period, including in particular those over 5 years in the system, which is one of the key recommendations in the report.</p></reply>

The Committee was invited to examine and provide commentary on this preliminary analysis.  The Committee's response was provided by way of a presentation made by researchers associated with the Committee on 30 September 2015.

Under the programme, Ireland has agreed to accept 4,000 persons in total under resettlement and relocation programmes within a two-year period.</p><p>  The figure of 4,000 includes approximately 2,600 asylum seekers to be taken in from migration hotspots in Italy and Greece under the new EU programme and 520 programme refugees from Lebanon, which the Irish Government has committed to taking in by the end of 2016 under Ireland's Refugee Resettlement programme.  The mechanism by which the balance of the 4,000 will be admitted has yet to be decided by Government.</p><p>To date, a family of 10 Syrians has been relocated from Greece and very shortly another group of 31 Syrians will arrive in the State.  A further 40 people are provisionally scheduled to arrive next month.</p><p>In relation to the Resettlement Programme, 263 programme refugees have been admitted to Ireland thus far.  The balance of those being resettled in Ireland under this Programme were interviewed during a selection mission to the Lebanon in January 2016; they are currently being health-screened and are expected to arrive in Ireland between June and September 2016.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was consulted, as is customary in all cases being considered for resettlement in Ireland.  Unaccompanied minors are not a feature of the Resettlement Programme which focuses on families.</p><p>As regards unaccompanied minors, statutory responsibility for the care of unaccompanied minors rests with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.

While every effort is made to process these applications within a reasonable time frame, processing times generally will vary having regard to the volume of applications in each processing centre, their complexity and the resources available. </p>  <p>  I am further advised that there has been an exponential increase in such applications since the second quarter of 2015.  As proceedings in this regard are currently before the courts in a number of cases, the Deputy will appreciate that I am somewhat limited in what I can say on the matter.  However, I can say that there are increasing concerns around potential abuse of the EU Directive in relation to such cases and the State has an obligation to take into account the overall integrity of its immigration system in dealing with applications.

We consider the UPR process, by which the international community holds each UN Member State to account in relation to its individual human rights record, as a real and practical expression of the fact that human rights are not solely of domestic concern, but rather a legitimate concern of the international community.  It is an important and complementary process to the other country-specific examinations and mechanisms of the United Nations, including within the Human Rights Council and the treaty bodies.  Ireland has a domestic record of protecting and promoting human rights as well as our contribution to advancing human rights at an international level.  We recognise that all of us can learn and benefit from dialogue with other States and indeed &ndash; at treaty level &ndash; with the Expert Committees of the UN system.</p>  <p>  In this constructive spirit, Ireland engages actively in the UPR of other States and were pleased that 93 other States took the opportunity to intervene in the UPR of Ireland.  I and the members of the delegation that I led listened carefully and with an open mind to all 262 recommendations made during the review of Ireland.  We were able to confirm immediately that 152 recommendations have been accepted, 13 recommendations are not accepted and that we will constructively examine the remaining 97 recommendations and provide our responses for the 33rd Human Rights Council session in September 2016. </p></reply>

I am also mindful of the sensitivity of the issues involved and, in this regard, I might add that I have previously met with the next of kin of the missing person, who is also the principal point of contact within the family for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that the investigation of a missing persons case is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the first instance.  The disappearance of the person in question remains the subject of an ongoing Garda investigation.  In these circumstances, I am sure that everyone in this House will understand that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific aspects of this case<b><font color="#000080">.</font></b></p><p>I am also mindful of the need to ensure that nothing is said which would add to the distress which the family in this case has already experienced. </p><p>However, I can confirm to the Deputy that I have given very close attention to correspondence received in my Department which raised issues in relation to the Garda investigation and also the question of holding an inquest.</p><p>In relation to the holding of an inquest, the Deputy may be aware that, under the Coroners Act 1962, as amended, a coroner is a statutory officer exercising quasi-judicial functions, in relation to which he or she is independent.  A Coroner is responsible for the scheduling and conducting of inquests in his or her district and neither I nor my Department has any role in the conduct of an inquest in individual cases.</p><p>In relation to the Garda investigation, I am advised that a Garda Review Team is endeavouring to advance the investigation and that all avenues of inquiry are being fully being pursued.  I also understand that two complaints in relation to the case have been investigated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC).  I am advised that no misbehaviour on the part of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was identified by GSOC and the complainant was notified of these findings.</p><p>In conclusion, I can inform the Deputy that I have recently issued responses to correspondence which I received about certain aspects of this case and I have asked my officials and the Garda authorities to keep me updated on further developments in this matter.</p></reply>

If the monies collected by the Bureau were to be diverted to community projects, there would inevitably be implications for any other monies those projects received from the Exchequer.

This is recognised in the Programme for Government which includes commitments to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures.  In this regard I understand that the Garda Commissioner intends to launch  a fresh recruitment drive for Garda Reserves this year.  The Programme also includes a commitment to increase further civilianisation to free up Garda&iacute; to front-line policing duties.  The civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na make up approximately 14% of the organisation and fulfil a huge range of critical support roles.  Further opportunities to increase the use of suitably qualified civilians and release Garda&iacute; to front-line roles will be explored in the context of the on-going consideration of the Report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate  <i>&quot;Changing Policing in Ireland - Delivering a Visible, Accessible and Responsive Service&quot; </i>which makes a range of recommendations on this matter.</p></reply>

I am also mindful of the sensitivity of the issues involved and, in this regard, I might add that I have previously met with the next of kin of the missing person, who is also the principal point of contact within the family for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>As I have outlined in responses to previous parliamentary questions in relation to this case, the disappearance of the person in question remains the subject of an ongoing Garda investigation.  In these circumstances, I am sure that everyone in this House will understand that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific aspects of this case<b><font color="#000080">.</font></b></p><p>I am also conscious of the need to ensure that nothing we say would add to the distress which the family in this case has already experienced. </p><p>However, I can confirm to the Deputy that I have given very close attention to correspondence received in my Department which raised issues in relation to the Garda investigation and also the question of holding an inquest.  In relation to the Garda investigation, I am advised that a Garda Review Team is endeavouring to advance the investigation and that all avenues of inquiry are being fully being pursued.  I also understand that two complaints in relation to the case have been investigated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC).  I am advised that no misbehaviour on the part of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was identified by GSOC and the complainant was notified of these findings.</p><p>In relation to the holding of an inquest, the Deputy may be aware that, under the Coroners Act 1962, as amended, a coroner is a statutory officer exercising quasi-judicial functions, in relation to which he or she is independent.  A Coroner is responsible for the scheduling and conducting of inquests in his or her district and neither I nor my Department has any role in the conduct of an inquest in individual cases.</p><p>In conclusion, I can inform the Deputy that I have recently issued responses to the correspondence which I received about certain aspects of this case and I have asked my officials and the Garda authorities to keep me updated on further developments in this matter.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that as these appalling crimes are the subject of ongoing Garda investigations it would not be appropriate for me to make any more detailed comment at this time. </p>  <p>  Similarly it would not be appropriate to engage in detailed discussion on the composition of particular criminal networks.  However, I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carefully monitor the activities of the criminal groups referred to and those associated with them and are implementing strong policing measures to disrupt and dismantle their networks.</p>  <p>  However, we should not lose sight of the fact that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has in the past successfully faced-down criminal gangs who believed they were above the law.  I can assure the Deputy that I remain committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the necessary resources to confront and oppose the violent thugs who seek to perpetrate such heinous crimes in our State. </p>  <p>  At the request of the Commissioner earlier this year, the Government moved decisively to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang related crime in the Dublin area, with a special allocation of &euro;5 million to support concentrated policing measures, including steps to establish a dedicated Armed Support Unit (ASU) in the Dublin area.  The Dublin ASU is in the process of being set up and trained.  However, it must be clearly understood that pending the full establishment of the new unit arrangements have been put in place so that the necessary armed support is being provided on an overtime basis.  I am being kept up to date on this work and I can assure the Deputy that the establishment of the Unit, including all of the necessary training and preparatory arrangements, is being progressed as a matter of priority.  The Garda response includes highly visible policing, the use of armed checkpoints and targeted and intelligence based operations, to disrupt and prevent incidents as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved.  I should add that, contrary to suggestions made in some quarters, there has been no diminution in these operations in recent weeks and the Garda authorities have assured me that the opposite is in fact the case.  The Garda response includes highly  visible policing, the use of armed checkpoints, and targeted and intelligence based operations, with a view to disrupting and preventing incidents as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that under the new Programme for Government we are pressing forward with an accelerated programme of Garda recruitment with a view to achieving a Force of 15,000 members.  This is a central element of the Government's anti-crime strategy and we have already made provision for the recruitment of 1,150 new Gardai since we reopened the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014.  I might add that the Programme for Government also commits to ensuring that Garda specialist units, such as the armed units which respond to gang-related violence, are enabled to operate at full strength.</p>  <p>  The question of providing for an offence of membership of a criminal gang,  in a manner similar to the approach taken in the Offences Against the State Acts with regard to membership of a proscribed organisation, has arisen from time to time.  In this regard, it is important to understand the issues which arise in seeking to simply outlaw membership of a criminal gang in such a manner. Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation or other more fixed group would have.  I am advised that relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid with shifting memberships, alliances and a membership which may depend on circumstance.</p>  <p>  We already have in place a wide range of strong legislation to deal with gangland activities, including the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  I can, however, assure the Deputy that all legislation in this area is kept under review and I am in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner to ensure that our laws and policing strategies respond as effectively as possible to evolving crime trends. </p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the Taoiseach and I recently met with senior Garda management and were briefed on the significant progress being made in investigations into recent gang-related murders in the Dublin region.  I can assure the Deputy that I, and the Government, remain committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the necessary resources, both legislative and financial, to confront and oppose violent criminal gangs. </p>  <p>  We already have in place a wide range of strong legislation to deal with gangland activities, including the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  In addition we have seen the introduction of landmark legislation in recent years in the field of forensic investigation.  The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014 facilitated the establishment of a new DNA database which has the capacity to link suspects to unsolved crimes and will greatly assist the Garda&iacute; in the investigation of a range of serious offences.  The Deputy may also be aware that a new Bail Bill is being drafted at present on a priority basis, with a view to strengthening the operation of the bail system so as to make the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail.</p>  <p>  In addition, the new Programme for Government includes a commitment to review the existing Proceeds of Crime legislation and to continue to support the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau in tackling money laundering and to target the proceeds of crime. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that all legislation in this area is kept under review and I am in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner to ensure that our laws and policing strategies respond as effectively as we can to evolving crime trends. </p></reply>

I would again make the point that all of us in this House must be very careful in discussing individual cases of whistleblowing.  Protection for whistleblowers rightly prioritises the confidentiality of the process, which is central to the efficacy of the process so I do not propose to discuss individual cases.</p>  <p>  Prior to the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 coming into operation, whistleblowing by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was provided for under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Confidential Reporting of Corruption or Malpractice) Regulations 2007, which provided for the appointment of an independent Confidential Recipient to whom Garda members, and civilian support staff, could report, in full confidence, instances where they believed there may have been corruption or malpractice within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  This system was replaced by the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which came into operation on 15 July 2014 as part of this Government's comprehensive approach to enhance the protection available to whistle blowers, including Garda whistleblowers.  GSOC was prescribed under the Act as a body to receive protected disclosures on Garda matters.  Under the Act, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may now communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer, or to GSOC as a prescribed body, and are entitled to the protections provided by the Act. </p>  <p>  The protections available to whistleblowers under the 2007 Regulations continue to be afforded to whistleblowers under the 2014 Act.  The confidentiality provisions also apply and so the identity of whistleblowers is not made known to me or my Department by GSOC. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the legislative provisions now in place under the 2014 Act, including the protections afforded for whistleblowers, will prove to be an effective remedy for Garda members who wish to report their concerns regarding potential wrongdoing. </p>  <p>  As I have previously advised the House in relation to these particular cases, I have no function in relation to criminal investigations and the submission of files to the DPP, or in relation to the investigation of complaints by GSOC.  Those bodies are independent in carrying out their statutory functions and I know that neither the Deputy nor anyone in this House would suggest that I should have any power to interfere with that independence.</p></reply>

In the case of refugee resettlement some of those included are not of Syrian nationality but were persons in Syria and displaced on account of the ongoing conflict there and have been included on that basis.  </p>  <p>  Under the EU resettlement initiative, in 2015 a total of 176 refugees displaced by the Syrian conflict were admitted from Jordan and from Lebanon.  The nationalities were Syrian, Iraqis that were refugees in Syria, Syrian Iraqis and Syrian Palestinians.  This year a further 100 Syrians have been admitted from Lebanon with 10 more due to arrive on Tuesday 17th May and additional numbers are expected later this year.  These numbers are part of the overall commitment of the Government to take a total of 520 refugees under this EU initiative.   In addition, under the National Resettlement Programme, in 2013 a total of 36 refugees were admitted of which 31 Afghan refugees were admitted from Damascus and 5 Palestinians were admitted from Syria as a medical case. The Afghans were refugees in Syria and were displaced once again by the Syrian conflict  and were admitted under an EU funded project.  In 2014 a further 89 refugees, displaced by the Syrian conflict, were admitted from Jordan.</p>  <p>  Under the EU Relocation Programme, Ireland is committed to taking over 2,500 persons seeking asylum in Greece and Italy to have their applications for asylum processed in Ireland.  It is expected that many of the overall total will be Syrian nationals.  A total of 10 Syrians have arrived to-date from Greece with a further 31 Syrians expected to arrive in the coming weeks.  A pledge for a further 40 has been submitted to Greece and is being progressed.   A pledge of 20 was also made to Italy by Ireland, however, some procedural issues require to be resolved before these can proceed.   </p>  <p>  Overall, the position is that Ireland remains committed to the pledges it has made.  While the initial pace of implementation has been slow due to operational issues in Greece and Italy, numbers are expected to increase significantly in the coming months as these issues are resolved.  </p>  <p>  The Syrian Humanitarian Admissions Programme (SHAP) was introduced in March 2014 and closed April 2014.  This programme allowed naturalised Irish citizens of Syrian birth and Syrian nationals already lawfully residing in the State, to apply for vulnerable close family members, present in Syria or who have fled from Syria to surrounding countries since the outbreak of the conflict in March 2011 to join them here on a temporary basis for up to two years.  Those admitted under the Programme are entitled to work, establish a business, or invest in the State.  A key condition of the SHAP is that these persons should not become a burden on the state.  A total of 44 applications involving 119 beneficiaries were approved . </p>  <p>  Overall, there were a total of 446 Syrian nationals registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau at the end of 2015.  The number legally resident here would be higher as persons under the age of 16 are not required to register.  This figure would also exclude persons who have applied for asylum or subsidiary protection.</p></reply>

During its term in office, it responded to all nine of the Convention&rsquo;s Reports, as follows:</p>  <p> - to the First Report, on Reducing the Voting Age and the Presidential Term, on 18 July 2013,</p>  <p> - to the Second Report, on the Role of Women and Women in Politics, on 10 October 2013,</p>  <p> - to the Third Report, on Same Sex Marriage, on 17 December 2013,</p>  <p> - to the Fourth Report, on Electoral Reform, on 18 December 2014,</p>  <p> - to the Sixth Report, on Blasphemy, on 2 October 2014, and</p>  <p> - to the Fifth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Reports, on amending the Constitution to give citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in Presidential elections; D&aacute;il Reform; Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; and Conclusions and Final Recommendations, respectively, on 14 January 2016.</p>  <p>  The Reports contained 38 recommendations, at least 18 of which would involve change in the text of the Constitution.</p>  <p>  In responding to the Convention&rsquo;s Reports, the Government accepted six recommendations for Constitutional change: on marriage equality, reducing the voting age to 16, reducing the age threshold for candidacy for Presidential elections, removing the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution, enhancing the reference in the Constitution to the office of Ceann Comhairle to give it more status, and including a reference to Oireachtas Committees in the Constitution.</p>  <p>  Referendums were held on two of these issues in May 2015, on reducing the age threshold for candidacy in Presidential elections and on marriage equality.   The Programme for a Partnership Government proposes that referenda be held on a further two of these issues - the question of amending Article 40.6.1(i) of the Constitution to remove the offence of blasphemy and giving the office of Ceann Comhairle constitutional standing. It also proposes that a referendum be held on Article 41.2.1&deg; regarding a &ldquo;woman&rsquo;s life within the home&rdquo;, an issue considered by the Convention in its Second Report.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government also states that the Eighth Report of the Convention on the Constitution, on economic, social and cultural rights, will be referred to the new Oireachtas Committee on Housing for consideration of the substantial questions it raises on the balance of rights, proper governance and resources.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Fifth Report on amending the Constitution to give citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in Presidential elections, the last Government had indicated that it was necessary to analyse the full range of practical and policy issues that would arise in any significant extension of the franchise, before a decision could be made on the holding of a referendum.  </p>  <p>  That analysis is ongoing and will be considered by Government in due course.</p>  <p>  As regards the recommendations relating to D&aacute;il Reform contained in the Convention's Seventh Report, Standing Orders were amended in January to provide for election of the Ceann Comhairle by secret ballot. This occurred on the first sitting day of the new D&aacute;il on 10 March. Standing Orders were also amended to introduce a system whereby the Taoiseach will appear before the Working Group of Committee Chairs twice a year.  Provision has also been made by Standing Orders for the proportionate allocation of Committee chairs using the d&rsquo;Hondt system.</p>  <p>  As all of the Convention&rsquo;s Reports have been responded to and actions taken as summarised above, it is not proposed that the Reports be brought before the new D&aacute;il or a new Convention.

Multi-disciplinary approaches are also utilised to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted, including through the use of the proceeds of crimes legislation, money-laundering legislation, and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also liaise closely with their international partners in identifying emerging crime trends and in encouraging international police cooperation in the fight against organised crime. An Garda S&iacute;&oacute;ch&aacute;na also participate in training through the international law enforcement agencies including  CEPOL, Interpol and Europol.</p>  <p>  While we should not underestimate the difficulties which the Garda authorities face in tackling organised crime activity, we continue to see the significant results of their efforts in the arrests made and persons being brought before the Courts, as well as the ongoing drugs and firearms seizures made.  </p>  <p>  I have assured An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that they have the full support of the Government in their efforts to disrupt gang-related crime. As I have outlined to the House today the Programme for a Partnership Government prioritises a significant programme of investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the question of providing for an offence of membership of a criminal gang,  in a manner similar to the approach taken in the Offences Against the State Acts with regard to membership of a proscribed organisation, it is important to understand the issues which arise in seeking to simply outlaw membership of a criminal gang in such a manner. Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation or other more fixed group would have.  </p>  <p>  As I have indicated previously, criminal legislation has been updated in recent years, most notably by way of Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006,  with a view to  ensuring that it provides a comprehensive range of provisions for the prosecution and punishment of organised crime, taking due account of the international agreements to which Ireland is a party.</p></reply>

A necessary first step is the appointment of the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority after which the Authority will appoint its own Chief Executive. I can confirm that nominations to the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority have been received from the relevant nominating bodies as set out in the Legal Services Regulation Act. The appointment of the relevant nominees and Chair under the various criteria set out in the Act will then be subject to approval by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas. At the same time, preparations are also being made in support of the public recruitment,  by the new Regulatory Authority, of its Chief Executive whose terms and functions are similarly set out in the 2015 Act. A start-up support team is being established and efforts are already underway to find a suitable premises from which the new Authority can operate. </p>  <p>  These various measures represent the initial steps that will enable the members and Chief Executive of the new Regulatory Authority to spearhead the coming into operation of the new legal services regulatory regime. This phase will also include, at the appropriate time, the commencement of other Parts of the Act such as those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the Roll of Practising Barristers and Pre-Action Protocols. </p>  <p>  Following establishment of the Regulatory Authority, its recruitment of a Chief Executive and such commencements of the Act as take place between now and September, the key remaining Parts of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will then be introduced. These will apply to both solicitors and barristers as legal practitioners. The managed commencement of these critical functions is planned for the Autumn in order to allow adequate time to ensure their effectiveness and success as crucial components of the new regulatory framework. It should be noted that, under the relevant transitional provisions, complaints already made to the Law Society under the Solicitors Acts will be brought to completion under that framework and existing law. </p>  <p>  In support of the planned and managed commencement of the relevant Parts of the 2015 Act proposed, as I have outlined, between now and the end of this year, an allocation of &euro;1 million has been made under the Justice Vote for 2016 as set-up support for the new Regulatory Authority which will be provided on a recoupable basis.</p></reply>

The Authority currently has some 23 staff, however with provision of an increased budget in 2016 this number will increase to 36 in the coming months.  The key areas of work of the Regulator include registration and award of charitable status, annual reporting, compliance and investigations, charity services (formerly under the Office of the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests) and providing a public register and statistical information on the charity sector.</p>  <p>  The deadline for organisations to apply for charitable status was 16 April 2016 and a significant spike in applications were received. The Regulator is currently processing over 4,500 applications of which 3,600 are from schools through a bulk registration system.  Applications are currently being processed by a team of 7 staff of which 3 are case officers who are responsible for making decisions to award charitable status.  Additional staffing will, however, provide for a doubling of case officers dealing with registration.  Processing times for charitable status is currently 6 to 9 months.  This is partly due to the fact that since many organisations are engaging in the registration process for the first time, a significant number of applications are incomplete and must be queried for additional information.  However the Regulator assures me that this processing time will reduce quickly.  The immediate priority will be to process new organisation applications (i.e. applications in respect of new charities established after 16 October 2014) as such organisations are significantly constrained in their operations prior to any decision by the Regulator to award charitable status.</p></reply>

Details in respect of each category are outlined below. </p><p><b>Criminal Legal Aid</b></p><p>Under the current legislation, the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  The courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  As the judiciary are independent in the exercise of their functions,  I have no role in these matters.</p><p>It must established to the satisfaction of the court that an individual's means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  </p><p>New Criminal Legal Aid legislation is currently being prepared to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid, including transferring responsibility for its administration to the Legal Aid Board.  The proposed measures include provisions to enable the Board to investigate the means of a person to whom legal aid was granted and, where it is determined that the person can afford to pay the costs or a portion of the costs, to direct that person to pay the amount calculated as being owed.  Other measures include powers to revoke the criminal legal aid certificate and sanctions for providing false or misleading information for the purpose of obtaining legal aid.</p><p><b>Civil Legal Aid</b></p><p>The Legal Aid Board administers the civil legal aid scheme on foot of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 (as amended) and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations (1996 &ndash; 2013). The criteria for obtaining legal advice are set out in section 26 of the Act while the criteria for obtaining legal aid are set out in section 28. Both sections require that an applicant satisfy certain financial eligibility conditions, and the detail of these conditions is set out in the aforementioned Regulations. The Board has a policy role in relation to the provision of civil legal aid and periodically it brings proposals to my Department. As an example, at the moment I am looking at amending the Regulations in order to enable persons at risk of losing their homes on account of mortgage arrears to get access to a solicitor on a legally aided basis at no cost and without reference to the normal financial eligibility criteria that apply.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

Reserve members who work a minimum of 208 hours in a 12 month period receive an allowance of &euro;1,000 per annum as a contribution towards their expenses. </p>  <p>  There are currently in the region of 900 reserves making a real and tangible contribution to the policing of communities right across the country. This is recognised by the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to double their number so that they can act in a supportive role to full-time members, undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures.  </p>  <p>  In addition, in recent years the Garda Commissioner has conferred further powers on reserve members under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and has also decided that they should carry out more duties including the serving of summonses, and the issuing of Fixed Charge Penalty Notices where offences are detected.  I very much welcome this expanded role for the Garda Reserve and also the inclusion of a special stream for eligible reserve members in the 2016 recruitment campaign for full-time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  Section 18 of the 2005 Act provides for the establishment, in accordance with regulations, of Garda representative associations for the purpose of representing members in all matters affecting their welfare and efficiency including pay, pension and conditions of service. There are currently four Associations, representing ranks up to that of Chief Superintendent, provided for by regulations.  It is my view that the voluntary ethos underpinning the Garda Reserve does not fit with the purpose of representative associations as provided for in the 2005 Act and I have no plans to make provision for such a body. </p></reply>

The table below sets out the detailed distribution of these Garda&iacute;.  These members are supported by 29 Reserve members and 27 civilians.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation (GBFI), and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). </p><p>Since the Garda College was reopened in September 2014 there have been seven intakes of Garda Trainees giving a total intake of 700.  A further 450 will be taken in this year.  So far 395 of the new Garda Trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties in communities nationwide.

Kildare, and are implementing strong policing measures to disrupt and dismantle their networks.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the deployment of Garda resources to specific areas, but I am assured that Garda management constantly monitor the distribution of resources in the light of crimes trends and overall policing needs in a given area. </p>  <p>  Mobile gangs engaged in burglary and related crimes are targeted through Operation Thor.  This Operation represents a carefully considered strategy which was developed after I initiated a broad review of our approach to burglary crime in the early part of last year and is now supporting a concerted drive against those involved in burglary crime, including the highly mobile criminal gangs who have targeted communities in Kildare and many other areas.  The concentrated Garda activity under Operation Thor has included more than 19,000 anti-crime patrols and in the order of 23,000 targeted checkpoints nationwide.  There have also been in the region of 1,300 arrests covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.  During the last three months of 2015 the burglary rate fell by 26.6% nationally compared to the same period in 2014, coinciding with the launch of Operation Thor in November 2015. </p>  <p>  Operation Thor delivers on increased investment in policing by this Government and marks a significant step-up in the Garda response to burglaries and related crime.  In excess of &euro;5 million is being specifically committed to support Operation Thor and includes funding for Garda overtime which will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.  Furthermore, investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.  The Government is also investing in Garda airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems.  In fact, the Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides an additional &euro;205 million for Garda ICT over the lifetime of the Plan underlining the ongoing commitment in the Programme for Government to resource and equip An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide enhanced policing and support local communities in all areas of the country.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that under the new Programme for Government we are pressing forward with an accelerated programme of Garda recruitment with a view to achieving a Force of 15,000 members.  This is a central element of the Government's anti-crime strategy and we have already made provision for the recruitment of 1,150 new Gardai since we reopened the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014.</p></reply>

People with disabilities are only half as likely to be in employment as others of working age.  The reasons for this are complex, and include level of education and skills, fears around loss of benefits, employer know-how, low expectations, and limited re-entry to work following onset of a disability, as well as a higher incidence of ill-health.</p><p>  The Strategy is a cross-government approach that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.  In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment.</p><p> The Strategy's six strategic priorities are to:</p><p>- Build skills, capacity and independence;</p><p>- Provide bridges and supports into work;</p><p>- Make work pay;</p><p>- Promote job retention and re-entry to work;</p><p>- Provide coordinated and seamless support;</p><p>- Engage employers.</p><p>Implementing the Strategy will require continuing interdepartmental cooperation and a joined-up approach to supports and services for jobseekers and workers with disabilities.  The implementation of the Strategy will be subject to regular monitoring, and there will be a review and renewal every three years.  It is the Government's intention to implement the Strategy in full. The key implementation issues relate to coordinating Departmental efforts in this area, rather than to additional funds.  </p><p>  Responsibility for the fund referred to rests with the Department of Social Protection.  The Strategy provides for the incorporation of learning from relevant Disability Activation (DACT) projects that operated under the previous European Social Fund Operational Programme, to be used to inform policy development.  I am informed by that Department that an interdepartmental working group was established in October 2015 to examine the findings of the evaluation of the DACT project report and to identify the next steps.  Further details of the progress of the working group are available from the Department of Social Protection.</p></reply>

The objective of this review was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation.  The review concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation&rsquo;s resource base would best meet public demand.  As a result, the Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme was implemented in 2012 and 2013.  This was reflected in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Policing Plans for 2012 and 2013 which set out the details of the closure of 39 Garda stations in 2012 and 100 Garda stations in 2013.</p><p>The closures have allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.</p><p>As part of this programme, 12 Garda stations were closed during the period 2012 and 2013 in the Sligo Leitrim Division, as outlined.</p><p>Garda stations closed in the Sligo Leitrim Division in 2012:<table><tr><th><div>Division</div></th><th><div>District</div></th><th><div>Station</div></th></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>Ballymote</td><td>Bunnanadden </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>Leitrim*</td><td>Drumkeeran  </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>Leitrim*</td><td>Kiltyclogher  </td></tr></table></p><p>Garda stations closed in the Sligo Leitrim Division in 2013:<table><tr><th><div>Division</div></th><th><div>District</div></th><th><div>Station</div></th></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>Ballymote</td><td>Aclare</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>Ballymote</td><td>Easkey</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>Ballymote</td><td>Ballyfarnon</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>Sligo</td><td>Cliffoney</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>Carrick on Shannon</td><td>Cloone</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>Carrick on Shannon</td><td>Keshcarrigan</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>Carrick on Shannon</td><td>Dromod</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>Leitrim*</td><td>Dromahair</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>Leitrim*</td><td>Glenfarne</td></tr></table></p><p>*Manorhamilton District was amalgamated with Carrick On Shannon District on 22<sup>nd</sup>April 2013.

Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his or her means are insufficient to enable the applicant to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the "gravity of the charge" or "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  The Minister has no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary which is independent in the exercise of its functions.  Subject to the statutory requirements, the law does not exclude any person or category of persons from consideration in the context of the grant by a court of criminal legal aid. </p>  <p>  Proposals for new Criminal Legal Aid legislation are currently being prepared to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for its administration to the Legal Aid Board.  The proposed measures would include provisions to enable the Board to investigate the means of a person to whom legal aid was granted and, where it is determined that the person can afford to pay the costs or a portion of the costs, to direct that person to pay the amount calculated as being owed.  Other proposed measures would include powers to revoke the criminal legal aid certificate and sanctions for providing false or misleading information for the purpose of obtaining legal aid.  In saying this, it should not be construed as having any connection to any case or cases currently before the Courts. </p></reply>

In excess of &euro;5 million is being specifically committed to support Operation Thor and includes funding for Garda overtime which is supporting a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.  Furthermore, investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.  The Government is also investing in Garda airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems.  In fact, the Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides an additional &euro;205 million for Garda ICT over the lifetime of the Plan, underlining the ongoing commitment in the Programme for Government to resource and equip An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide enhanced policing and to support local communities in all areas of the country.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that under the new Programme for Government we are pressing forward with an accelerated programme of Garda recruitment with a view to achieving a Force of 15,000 members.  This is a central element of the Government's anti-crime strategy and it builds on the recruitment of 1,150 new Gardai since we reopened the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014.  The ongoing recruitment process will support all policing operations, including Operation Thor.</p></reply>

The Bill includes wide ranging provisions to enhance the protection of children from sexual abuse and exploitation including through more effective targeting of acts of child sexual grooming.  When enacted, the Bill will facilitate full compliance with the criminal law provisions of a number of international legal instruments and implement the recommendations of a number of Oireachtas committees.</p>  <p>  The Bill also provides for two new offences of purchasing sexual services, in the context of prostitution.  The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.  The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, in the context of prostitution, and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not commit an offence. </p>  <p>  These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012.  The new offences also implement the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.  Both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have recognised the effectiveness of the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services as a tool in the fight against human trafficking.</p>  <p>  The Bill completed all stages in Seanad &Eacute;ireann in January 2016.  Enactment of this important piece of legislation is a priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  I would also draw the Deputies' attention to the existing legislative provisions addressing the trafficking of persons for the purpose of exploitation (including sexual exploitation) which can attract significant penalties.  Under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, any person found guilty of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation shall be liable to imprisonment for a period up to life.  It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years.</p></reply>

However, I trust the Deputy will appreciate that the investigation of possible criminal offences in any particular case is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I do not have a direct role in this regard.  I would of course encourage anyone who is subject to any form of harassment or anti-social behaviour to provide all relevant information to their local Garda&iacute;.  To be of assistance I have brought the Deputy's concerns, and a copy of the correspondence in question, to the attention of the Garda authorities and asked that these matters be given appropriate consideration and attention.  </p>  <p>  Addressing local community concerns in relation to public order and anti-social behaviour is a key focus in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's National Model of Community Policing.  In this regard there are strong legislative provisions available to an An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including provisions under the Criminal Damage Act 1991, Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003, and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.</p>  <p>  As part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's commitment to a Community Policing approach Garda&iacute; engage with a wide range of local groups, including residents groups and Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert groups, as well as participating in more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees.  These provide additional mechanisms for people to relay their concerns to Garda&iacute; and also assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in disseminating crime prevention advice to local communities.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that under the new Programme for Government we are pressing forward with an accelerated programme of Garda recruitment with a view to achieving a Force of 15,000 members.  This is a central element of the Government's anti-crime strategy and it builds on the recruitment of 1,150 new Gardai since we reopened the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014.  The ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will undoubtedly enhance the provision of effective Community Policing in local communities throughout the country.</p></reply>

Whether a person is resident in their own private home, or in a residential centre, it is up to each individual to decide with whom they wish to engage and on the level and extent of that engagement.</p>  <p>  No restrictions have been placed on any organisation with regard to engagement with their congregation wherever they are resident, be it in their own homes or in the residential centres.  However, religious organisations are not permitted to preach, teach or organise cultural or religious events in the residential centres.  The Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres are "home" to persons of various religious beliefs and none.  Religious organisations are free to invite residents to any religious or cultural events outside of their place of residence in the same way as if they were resident in their private homes.  </p>  <p>  With regard to visiting residents in the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres, I am sure that you will agree, that the health, safety and privacy of the residents must be of primary concern.  It is required under law to protect the identity of refugees.  Therefore, it is imperative that persons visiting the centre, regardless of their background or religion, must be Garda vetted.  To facilitate visitors, special arrangements have been put in place with Kildare Volunteer Services to organise Garda vetting for any person that wishes to visit the centre.  Visiting must also be curtailed during special periods e.g. during mealtimes, or when children are sleeping and visiting is restricted to public areas to protect the privacy of the residents. </p>  <p>  When visiting the centre, the visitor must be invited by a resident and the visitor is limited to meeting with that resident and must not disturb other residents.  I am sure that you will agree that this is standard practice in any residential centre.</p>  <p>  Donations to support the residents in Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres are coordinated by local voluntary bodies.  Kildare Volunteer Service accept donations for the Hazel Hotel,  and the Centre Management accept donations in Dungarvan.  If a person wishes to make a donation they can do so through those avenues.  This guarantees an even distribution of gifts and donations to the residents in accordance with the residents' needs.</p></reply>

As these appalling crimes are the subject of ongoing Garda investigations it would not be appropriate for me to make any more detailed comment at this time.  There are very real challenges in counteracting those who are determined to perpetuate a cycle of mindless violence without any regard to human life or public safety.  However, we should not lose sight of the fact that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has in the past successfully faced-down criminal gangs who believed they were above the law.  I can assure the Deputy that I remain committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the necessary resources to confront and oppose the violent thugs who seek to perpetrate such heinous crimes in our State. </p>  <p>  At the request of the Commissioner earlier this year, the Government moved decisively to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang related crime in the Dublin area, with a special allocation of &euro;5 million to support concentrated policing measures, including steps to establish a dedicated Armed Support Unit (ASU) in the Dublin area.  The Dublin ASU is in the process of being set up and trained.  However, it must be clearly understood that pending the full establishment of the new unit, arrangements have been put in place so that the necessary armed support is being provided on an overtime basis.  I am being kept up to date on this work and I can assure the Deputy that the establishment of the Unit, including all of the necessary training and preparatory arrangements, is being progressed as a matter of priority.  The Garda response includes highly visible policing, the use of armed checkpoints and targeted and intelligence based operations, to disrupt and prevent incidents as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved.  I should add that, contrary to suggestions made in some quarters, there has been no diminution in these operations in recent weeks and the Garda authorities have assured me that the opposite is in fact the case.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that under the new Programme for Government we are pressing forward with an accelerated programme of Garda recruitment with a view to achieving a Force of 15,000 members.  This is a central element of the Government's anti-crime strategy and we have already made provision for the recruitment of 1,150 new Gardai since we reopened the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014.  I might add that the Programme for Government also commits to ensuring that Garda specialist units, such as the armed units which respond to gang-related violence, are enabled to operate at full strength.</p>  <p>  I remain in close contact with the Commissioner and will respond promptly if she feels there are further measures, including in relation to Garda resources, that could be taken to oppose and dismantle these criminal networks, and the evil drugs trade which is at the heart of much of their activities.</p></reply>

However, I am advised that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Under this model there is a community policing team in each District, headed up by a Sergeant.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.</p><p>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>on the 31 March 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 785 Community Garda&iacute; throughout the State.  It is also worth noting that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in Community Policing in carrying out their duties.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network. </p><p>As part of the Community Policing approach Garda&iacute; engage with a wide range of local groups, including informal community groups as well participating in more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees.  In addition Garda&iacute; support the operation of in excess of 3,700 Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert groups established countrywide.  These are run as a partnership with local Garda&iacute; and help to promote responsible community involvement and assist in promoting good practice in crime prevention.  To further support the establishment of such local initiatives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published Community Crime Prevention Guidelines as well as guidelines for local Text Alert Groups.  The Garda Text Alert Scheme is a particularly successful example of Community Policing in action with over 700 local groups in operation, involving in excess of 130,000 subscribers and with an estimated 200,000 text messages sent each month under the scheme.  I am informed that every Garda Division, rural and urban, now offers the Text Alert service.</p><p>Finally, Deputies will also be aware that under the new Programme for Government we are pressing forward with an accelerated programme of Garda recruitment with a view to achieving a Force of 15,000 members.  This is a central element of the Government's anti-crime strategy and it builds on the recruitment of 1,150 new Gardai since we reopened the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014.  The ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will undoubtedly enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country.</p></reply>

My Department and its agencies continue to progress the actions assigned to the criminal justice sector under the Strategy and to actively participate in all of the structures in place including for example, the Oversight Forum, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol and the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drugs and Alcohol Task Forces.</p>  <p>  Drug policy development under the current Strategy was further aligned with wider social policy development at Government level through the reporting on to the appropriate Cabinet sub-committee which dealt with all aspects of social inclusion. </p>  <p>  In terms of the development of the new National Drugs Strategy the Department of Health is leading on the formulation of our overall approach for the period after 2016 to meet the challenges into the future.  The intention over the coming months is to lay the groundwork for a concise and focused Strategy, placing a clear emphasis on the practical implementation of actions.  An examination of the approach to drugs policy and practice in other jurisdictions will help to identify any additional evidence based approaches which might be considered in an Irish context.  The development of the new Strategy will provide an opportunity to have a constructive and wide-ranging public dialogue on our current drug policies and our approaches to the issue. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has established a Steering Group, which includes officials from my own Department, to oversee a review of the current Strategy and develop proposals for a new Strategy.  This will involve a comprehensive consultation process which is expected to be announced shortly.</p></reply>

The courts will also be given the power to impose a condition prohibiting an accused person from driving in a case where the person has been charged with a serious road traffic offence and the court considers that such a condition is necessary to prevent the commission of a further serious road traffic offence.

To date, some 90 of the recommendations have been fully implemented and a further 26 are in the process of being implemented.  Work on implementing a further number of the recommendations is continuing.  The International Protection Act 2015 responds to 26 of the Report's recommendations.  The Act provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection which is a key recommendation of the Report.  The single procedure is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process.  The new procedure will significantly streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications and will reduce the length of time that persons spend in the Direct Provision system.  Preparations for commencement of the single procedure are progressing.</p>  <p>  At the end of April there were some 4,400 persons living in the direct provision system.  This is a reduction from the figure of approximately 5,100 at the end of 2014 notwithstanding that the number of persons seeking asylum last year more than doubled compared with 2014.  This reflects the significant progress made in processing cases on hand over this period, including in particular those over 5 years in the system, which is another key recommendation in the report.</p></reply>

At that time I referred to the work of the Law Reform Commission (LRC) which is currently carrying out a project on <i>Cybercrime affecting personal safety, privacy and reputation, including cyberbullying.</i>In November 2014 the LRC published an Issues Paper and sought the views of interested parties on the key issues it had identified.  In April 2015 it held a seminar  to discuss these issues.  After the Seanad debate I forwarded a copy of the Bill to the LRC in the context of the issues under examination.  I believe that it would be premature for the Harmful and Malicious Electronic Communications Bill 2015 to be considered further in advance of the publication of the LRC Report and consideration of its recommendations.

These include the appointment of a receiver, an examinership process, and liquidation in those cases in which the company is beyond rescue.  The Act includes detailed provisions which regulate the appointment and the powers of receivers, examiners and liquidators respectively.  However, the 2014 Act does not specify any regulatory standards for the appointment of a receiver. </p>  <p>  The Company Law Review Group is a statutory body which advises the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the review and development of company law in this jurisdiction.  As part of its Work Programme 2014 &ndash; 2016, the Review Group is examining whether it is desirable or necessary to further amend company law arising from case law developments and any submissions received on matters which have not been addressed in the 2014 Act.</p>  <p>  In regard to the appointment of a receiver, the position is that such an appointment may be made under company law or land and conveyancing law (the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 for mortgages created after 1 December 2009 and the Conveyancing Act 1881 for mortgages created prior to that date).  Courts may also exercise discretionary powers to appoint a receiver on application from a secured creditor.  Apart from these sources, the instrument creating the charge may also contain broader contractual terms in relation to appointment of a receiver and additional powers which he or she may exercise on appointment.  The Sheriff (or County Registrar acting as Sheriff) is responsible to the Court for the Enforcement of the Court Orders and the law and procedures governing the execution of Court Orders is contained in the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts, 1926 to 1940 and the Rules of Court made thereunder, and I wish to inform the Deputy that I have no operational function in this matter.</p></reply>

This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles.  </p>  <p>  Over &euro;34 million has been invested in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015.  This significant investment provides the Garda&iacute; with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles for high-visibility road policing.  Investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.</p>  <p>  The Government is also investing in Garda airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems.  In fact, the Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides an additional &euro;205 million for Garda ICT over the lifetime of the Plan which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime.  In addition, the Government will support investment in CCTV at key locations along the road network and in urban centres.</p>  <p>  In terms of existing technology, the Deputy will be aware that a considerable amount of new Garda ICT solutions has been delivered over the past number of years.  These include the deployment of a secure national digital radio system (NDRS), the deployment and support of Garda and Community CCTV systems, an automated number plate recognition (ANPR) system and the addition of many new functions to the PULSE system, which itself is further supported by a dedicated Garda data entry service in Castlebar.  These and other new technological solutions, as well as the investment in resources, will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to provide effective policing services in responding to the evolving challenges of modern day criminal activity.</p>  <p>  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing demonstrates this Government's commitment to investing in 21st Century policing and will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.</p>  <p>  I have assured An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that they have the full support of the Government in their efforts to disrupt gang-related crime and they will continue to access all resources necessary, including extensive overtime, to support them in delivering concentrated visible policing measures to tackle such crime.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution under continuing review taking into account crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. </p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of the 31 March 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 12,862 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The strength of the Force at its peak on the 30 September 2009 was 14,716 members.</p><p>This  Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

So far 395 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties and are on the ground in communities nationwide.  It is expected that a further 300 trainees will attest by the end of this year which, taking account of projected retirements, will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year.  We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I will be engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years.</p></reply>

This will be initiated within two months and I intend to consult with Commissioner and the Policing Authority to agree the process through which the Commissioner will identify the 6 stations that will be reopened under the pilot.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that some 139 Garda stations were closed on foot of the implementation of the Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme, which was implemented in 2012 and 2013, following the completion by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of a comprehensive review of its district and station network.</p>  <p>  As the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources at her disposal, the review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation.  It concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation&rsquo;s resource base would best meet public demand. </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the closures have allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  </p>  <p>  While I welcome the beneficial outcomes that have accrued to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na arising from the Station Rationalisation Programme, the Programme for Government recognises that there is a need for a review along the lines that I have outlined above. </p>  <p>  My officials will shortly be in contact with the Policing Authority with a view to putting in place the necessary arrangements for the review and I will ensure that the outcome of the review is put before the House.</p></reply>

The process leading to deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to Deportation Orders.</p>  <p>  In determining whether to make a Deportation Order, the Minister must have regard to the factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended. </p>  <p>  This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a Deportation Order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.  The length of time in the State is also one of the criteria that has to be specifically considered in all decisions to deport.</p>  <p>  In the period April 2015 - April 2016 there were a total of 224 persons deported from the State.</p>  <p>  In addition to those figures, over the course of 2015 a total of 3,451 persons were refused permission to land.  The figures quoted are provisional and subject to change.  For example, persons may be refused permission to land in the State and subsequently permitted to enter the State having made an application pursuant to the Immigration Acts or the Refugee Act 1996.</p></reply>

This means firstly overseeing continued reform of the accountability and oversight of policing in Ireland; and secondly delivering on a programme of reform, modernisation and investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na particularly focussing on organisation, processes and systems. </p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to continue to support the  Policing Authority in its oversight role.  The establishment of the Authority on 1 January this year was undoubtedly a very important milestone in the policing reform agenda.  The Programme also commits to enhancing the role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in providing an independent complaints mechanism.</p><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate &quot;Changing Policing in Ireland - <i>Delivering a Visible, Accessible and Responsive Service&quot;,</i>which I published last December will make an important contribution to the on-going modernisation agenda in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The role of the Inspectorate is to promote efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and how it conducts its work through undertaking comprehensive analysis of policies and procedures in the organisation and benchmarking them against the best practices and standards of comparable police services.  The report identifies scope for broad-ranging reforms in the administration and operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and requires a considered response.  Some of the recommendations are far-reaching and, if implemented, would involve a fundamental restructuring of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across the country.  It is, therefore, important that the full implications of the recommendations and the analysis underpinning them are considered in detail before any decisions are taken. </p><p>With these considerations in mind, I put in place a process to seek the views of the Garda Commissioner and other bodies to whom recommendations are directed.  Those responses are now under consideration in my Department with a view to the preparation of proposals for implementation for consideration by Government in due course. </p><p>In addition, of course, the Garda Commissioner has developed a 5 year modernisation and renewal programme for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a response to the findings of various internal and external reports, including previous reports of the Inspectorate.  I understand that the programme addresses many of the themes covered by the most recent Inspectorate report and will also be sufficiently flexible to take on board any other agreed reforms. </p><p>Finally I very much welcome the fact that the Capital Programme 2016-2021 makes significant commitments to investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including some &euro;205 million in additional ICT capital investment.  This investment will address many of the recommendations in various Inspectorate Reports and will address the under-investment in technology over many years.</p></reply>

In fact, the Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides an additional &euro;205 million for Garda ICT over the lifetime of the Plan underlining the ongoing commitment in the Programme for Government to resource and equip An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide enhanced policing and support local communities in all areas of the country.</p></reply>

These programmes offer purposeful activity to those in custody while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead law abiding lives on release.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all persons in custody are eligible to use the services.  </p>  <p>  On committal, including committal for first time offences, all persons in custody are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  Persons in custody may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date. </p>  <p>  The development of persons in custody rehabilitative programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service.  There is a clear commitment to enhance sentence planning through the Integrated Sentence Management system which involves an emphasis on individuals taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with both specialist and non-specialist services in the prisons.  The end result is a person-centred multi-disciplinary approach to working with persons in custody with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole time teacher equivalents in partnership with the Irish Prison Service through the Education and Training Boards (ETB).  The focus is on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and facilitates lifelong learning through helping those in custody to cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release.  A broad and flexible curriculum is provided which ranges from basic literacy classes and peer led tutoring to Open University.  There is an increasing focus on QQI (formerly FETAC) accreditation as the modular structure is suitable to the needs of students in prison.</p>  <p>  A top priority for the Irish Prison Service is ensuring help for those with reading and writing problems and to ensure that peer mentoring programmes are currently active in all of our prisons.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years.  Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled the Irish Prison Service to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification. </p>  <p>  The guiding principles which underpin the prisons' work and training service are to make available work, work-training and other purposeful activities to those in custody.  Training activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical accredited skills which will help them secure employment on release.</p></reply>

Not least of these in the case of driving offences are the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts.</p>  <p>  The 7 year period takes account of the mandatory driving bans now imposed for certain motoring offences.  These bans can be for up to 6 years in length for some offences that are eligible to become spent, including some drink driving offences.  Road traffic legislation already provides persons with penalty points on their driving licence arising from minor road traffic infringements and penalised drivers have to wait 3 years before the penalty points are removed. </p>  <p>  A 7 year waiting period before any conviction, including road traffic convictions, can become spent is deemed appropriate and proportionate.</p></reply>

In this regard solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels.  As a result they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important they are taxed.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioners that solid fuel traders who make taxable supplies of solid fuel are obliged to register with them for tax purposes and SFCT is subject to the full range of compliance interventions and enforcement provisions for self-assessed taxes.  In circumstances where there are grounds to believe that tax due has not been paid, Revenue investigates the suspect person's tax liabilities and collects any unpaid tax, including unpaid income tax, SFCT and VAT, together with any interest or penalties due. </p>  <p>  As part of its work against the shadow economy, Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group (HEMG) to facilitate the reporting of information by traders through their representative associations.  Solid fuel traders who suspect, or have evidence, that illegal and/or untaxed solid fuel is being sold in their area should report any information to their local authority and Revenue.  Revenue has held a number of meetings with suppliers on matters relating to untaxed supplies of solid fuel and, in common with all such reports, the information received is treated confidentially and is investigated fully for evidence of unpaid tax liabilities.   </p>  <p>  Greenhouse gases are contributing to climate change and as a signatory to the UNCOP 21 Paris Agreement Ireland has committed to play its part in reducing emissions.  The carbon tax is deemed to be the most cost effective way of reducing overall emissions and therefore plays an important role of providing incentives for emission reduction activities in this regard, and it is important the tax is levied on all fossil fuels fairly to encourage less environmentally harmful behaviours.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I do not intend to reduce the rate of carbon tax on peat products.</p></reply>

However, the provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks. </p>  <p>  In my role as Minister for Finance, I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses. </p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems, with a view to addressing the increased availability of flood insurance.  To achieve this aim, there is a focus on prioritising spending on flood relief measures, development and implementation of plans by the Office of Public Works (OPW) to implement flood relief schemes. </p>  <p>  This strategy is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland which provides for the transfer by the OPW of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes to the insurance industry, which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed.  </p>  <p>  The OPW informed me that they have they have not carried out any flood defence works in the area mentioned and they have no plans to do so.  The area is not included in the 300 areas most at risk from flooding under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management Programme (CFRAM). </p>  <p>  However, the OPW operates a scheme called the Minor Flood Mitigation and Coastal Protection Works Scheme under which funding can be made available to Local Authorities to carry out works or studies on flood mitigation and coastal protection.  The scheme applies to relatively straightforward cases of flooding where a solution can be readily identified by a local authority and achieved in a short time frame.  Applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost up to &euro;500,000.  </p>  <p>  In 2012, OPW paid a sum of &euro;333,000 under this scheme to South Dublin County Council for flood mitigation works in the Jobstown/Killinarden/Knockmore areas of Tallaght.  The works were designed to resolve issues which had given rise to a number of flood incidents in the area. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that remedial works carried out under this scheme are not covered by the Memorandum of Understanding between Insurance Ireland and OPW, as they are not built to the 1 in 100 years standard that large scale flood protection works carried out by the OPW are. </p>  <p>  My officials are undertaking further research in the area of flood insurance which will include a comparative analysis of the different approaches to flood insurance taken in other countries.  This will then feed into a report to Government from the Inter-Departmental Flood Policy Co-Ordination Group.</p></reply>

There are no circumstances in which the supply of equipment or house adaptations, even for a person with a disability, is exempt from VAT.  There is, however, provision for the refund of VAT incurred on qualifying goods for the use of disabled persons.  The provision is contained in the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No 15) Order 1981.  The order specifies the degree of disability and defines the qualifying goods as goods which are aids or appliances, including parts and accessories, specially constructed or adapted for use by a disabled person and includes goods which, although not so specially constructed or adapted, are of such a kind as might reasonably be treated as so constructed or adapted having regard to a particular disablement of that person.  The Refund Order extends to works carried out on homes, including the installation of walk-in-showers, to adapt them to make them more accessible for disabled persons. While the Refund Order does not apply to the actual construction of a home it would apply, for example, to certain alterations or adaptations that would be necessary to meet the particular needs of the disabled person.   </p>  <p>  Any application under the Refund Order should be made on Form VAT 61A and submitted to the Revenue Commissioners  Central Repayments Office in Monaghan.   Further information is available on the Revenue website www.revenue.ie.  </p></reply>

This arises due to the limitation on allowable contributions imposed by the age-related percentage limits and overall income cap provided for in subsection 774(7)(c) and section 790A of the Act.  Where a person is unable to claim the relief for all of their pension contributions in the year of contribution due to the aforementioned limitation, any unclaimed amount may be carried forward to a subsequent year or years.</p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that given the scope of the first question, they are not in a position to provide the information in the time available.  They will however ascertain if the information requested exists or can be compiled and, on receipt of their reply, I will write separately to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I am also informed by Revenue that in accordance with the self assessment principle, any relief carried forward is claimed in an annual tax return rather than being the subject of a  formal approval by Revenue.</p>  <p>  As is the case with tax reliefs generally, where Revenue, through its risk focused compliance management approach, becomes aware that the carry forward of relief in respect of pension contributions has been claimed in circumstances where it is not due, for example on the basis of information provided by a taxpayer or agent or as a result of a Revenue intervention, the appropriate arrangements are put in place to deny the relief.</p>  <p>  The information requested on tax returns, in addition to being used to compute the taxpayer's liability, is also aimed at obtaining appropriate data in respect of tax reliefs to inform public policy making.  As I advised in my reply to Parliamentary Question Number 7 of 27 April 2016, the cost of the carry forward of relief for pension contributions under subsection 774(7)(d) is contained in the overall figure for relief in respect of pension contributions in each year.  I am advised by Revenue that, in considering the information taxpayers must provide on their annual tax returns, it is necessary to strike a balance between obtaining an appropriate level of information, having regard to the purpose of such information, and ensuring that the return does not become too complicated or give rise to unnecessary compliance costs for taxpayers. </p></reply>

Thereafter relief is restricted to ceilings of &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000 respectively. </p>  <p>  The system of mortgage interest relief is designed and targeted in such a way that the relief is of greater value in the early years of a qualifying loan where the interest represents a greater proportion of the repayment.  Mortgage interest relief is of lesser value to individuals whose repayments are made up of a higher proportion of principal than interest, as would generally be the case for those who move in to the eighth and subsequent years of their loans. It is worth noting that the application of the ceilings already work to reduce the relief available in a gradual manner. In addition, as the amount of interest payable reduces as a mortgage is paid down, the level of mortgage interest relief also reduces in tandem. </p>  <p>  The Deputies will be aware that, in the Programme for Partnership Government, there is a commitment to retain mortgage interest relief beyond the current end date of December 2017 on a tapered basis. Deputies will also note that the current scheduled end date for mortgage interest relief is December 2017 and options for the tapering envisaged in the programme for government will be considered in due course.</p></reply>

It should be noted that in practice this is made up of a first year cost of c. &euro;300 million with a carryover effect of c. &euro;100 million.  This is a technical assumption based on the medium-term projected increase in non-agriculture wages.</p><p>In addition, as I stated in the House during the Stability Programme Update debate recently, net fiscal space is currently estimated to be around &euro;900 million in 2017.  I want to stress that this is a work in progress figure and is subject to revision.  Esimates will be refined for 2017 to 2021 in the coming weeks by my Department.  However, the &euro;900 million of fiscal space assumes a decision will be taken not to index the income tax system in 2017.  </p><p>Therefore, if indexation of the income tax system proceeds as reflected in the tax revenue forecasts, then the fiscal space would be reduced by c. &euro;300 million in 2017 to c.&euro;600 million.  It should be noted that income tax payers would benefit from such a course of action.</p><p>However, if the Government decides not to index the income tax system then the fiscal space would remain unchanged at c. &euro;900 million for 2017.</p><p>Tables 1, 2 and 3 set out the responses to the Deputy's questions if indexation were based on earnings growth and inflation in 2017 as forecast by my Department and set out in the macro-economic forecasts contained in the 2016 Stability Programme Update.  The macroeconomic forecasts were endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  The forecast vales were:</p><p>- Non-agriculture Pay per Capita: 2.5%</p><p>- Consumer Price Index: 1.6%</p><p><b>Table 1: the estimated cost in 2017 of indexing income tax credits, bands and Universal Social Charge based on estimated earnings growth and inflation growth in 2017:</b><table><tr><th></th><th>2017 earnings growth</th><th>2017 inflation</th></tr><tr><td>PAYE and Personal Credits, with income tax rate bands and exemption limits and USC thresholds </td><td>Of the order of &euro;280 million in the first year <br /><br />Of the order of &euro;380 million in a full year </td><td>Of the order of &euro;180 million in the first year<br /><br />Of the order of &euro;245 million in a full year</td></tr></table><b>Table 2: the estimated monetary value of the PAYE and Personal tax credit in 2017 if they were indexed in line with estimated earnings growth and inflation in 2017 </b><table><tr><th></th><th>2017 earnings growth </th><th>2017 inflation</th></tr><tr><td>PAYE Tax Credit</td><td>&euro;1,690 per annum</td><td>&euro;1,675 per annum</td></tr><tr><td>Single and Married Personal Tax credits </td><td>&euro;1,690/&euro;3,380 per annum</td><td>&euro;1,675/&euro;3,350 per annum</td></tr></table><b>Table 3: change in the income tax standard rate band for a single person, currently at &euro;33,800 per annum, if it were indexed in line with: estimated earnings growth and inflation in 2017</b><table><tr><th></th><th>2017 earnings growth</th><th>2017 inflation</th></tr><tr><td>Single person income tax standard rate band </td><td>&euro;34,640 per annum</td><td>&euro;34,340 per annum</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The cornerstone of this fiscal framework is the achievement of the country-specific Medium Term Budgetary Objective (MTO). These budget balance targets are set in structural terms and calculated to ensure the long-term sustainability of the public finances.  </p>  <p>  EU Regulation 1466/97 provides (article 2a) for an update of the country-specific MTOs every three years. In terms of process, the European Commission is tasked with producing minimum MTOs for each Member State, and they then set their country-specific MTOs respecting the Commission 'minimum'. Recently the Commission updated the minimum levels at which Member States can set their MTO to cover the 2017 - 2019 period.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, Ireland's minimum MTO for this period has been lowered to a structural deficit of -0.5% of GDP (from 0.0% of GDP) primarily reflecting lower forecast costs associated with ageing. The regulation further provides (article 3.2(a)) that Member States must outline their MTOs in the annual Stability Programme Updates that are submitted to the Commission each April. In the recently published Stability Programme Update, the Government has defined Ireland's MTO as a structural deficit of -0.5% of GDP. It should be noted that the incoming Government may choose to over achieve the MTO.</p></reply>

In terms of tax policy generally, Ireland's corporate tax rate of 12.5% on trading income is akin to a brand and is an important part of the Government's strategy of creating an enterprise friendly environment to attract jobs and investment to Ireland, countrywide.  One of the main features of the rate is its simplicity and the fact that it applies to a broad base. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to be aware of a number of incentives which while not of course restricted to the counties he mentions would be nonetheless applicable there. For instance, in Budget 2016 and Finance Act 2015, I introduced a revised CGT entrepreneur relief under which a reduced CGT rate of 20% applies to gains on the disposal of business assets up to a lifetime limit of &euro;1m. The purpose of the relief is to improve the environment for entrepreneurs and business people setting up or carrying on productive business activities in the State. It is also intended to maintain the three-year tax relief for certain start-up companies until the end of 2018 , this is an important support for entrepreneurs and local job creation. Other relevant incentives include:</p>  <p>  (i) the Start-Up Relief for Entrepreneurs (or SURE) which provides an income tax refund to individuals who invest capital in a new business,</p>  <p>  (ii) the Start Your Own Business scheme which provides for relief from Income Tax for long term unemployed individuals who start a new business, and</p>  <p>  (iii) the Employment Investment Incentive (EII) which is a tax relief incentive scheme that provides tax relief for investment in certain corporate trades.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will have noted that the issues he raises have been identified in "A Programme for a Partnership Government", published last week, where measures suggested include further favourable CGT treatment for those starting new businesses.  Any new or amended tax policies would be matters for consideration as part of the Budgetary process. On the wider issue of the Atlantic Economic Corridor, the Deputy may wish to address my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

This 30% rate will continue to be applicable to these first-time buyers for the remaining years that mortgage interest relief continues to be available i.e. up to the end of 2017. In the absence of this change the mortgage interest relief available would have gradually reduced to a rate of 15%.</p>  <p>  Single individuals, married couples and civil partners that are first-time buyers, qualify for mortgage interest relief for the first seven years of their mortgage up to a maximum ceiling of &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 respectively. Thereafter relief is restricted to ceilings of &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000 respectively. </p>  <p>  The system of mortgage interest relief is designed and targeted in such a way that the relief is of greater value in the early years of a qualifying loan where the interest represents a greater proportion of the repayment.  Mortgage interest relief is of lesser value to individuals whose repayments are made up of a higher proportion of principal than interest, as would generally be the case for those who move in to the eighth and subsequent years of their loans. It is worth noting that the application of the ceilings already work to reduce the relief available in a gradual manner. In addition, as the amount of interest payable reduces as a mortgage is paid down, the level of mortgage interest relief also reduces in tandem. </p>  <p>  In the Programme for Partnership Government there is a commitment to retain mortgage interest relief beyond the current end date of December 2017 on a tapered basis. You will note that the current end date is December 2017 and the future of mortgage interest relief will be considered in due course. </p></reply>

Furthermore, over the remainder of the forecast horizon out to 2021, potential growth rates are forecast to average around 3.5 per cent per annum.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the expansion in economic activity, initially led by the exporting sectors, has broadened with growth now increasingly driven by domestic factors. This is crucial as domestic sectors are both jobs-rich and tax-rich.</p>  <p>  Meanwhile, the external sector remains strong with exports increasing by 13.8 per cent in 2015. The competitiveness gains achieved since 2008 have been the result of productivity improvements and wage and price moderation. It is important that these gains are maintained, to support continued growth through both foreign direct and indigenous investment.</p>  <p>  The recovery is most clearly evident in the labour market where we have now seen thirteen successive quarters of employment growth. In 2015, employment increased by 2.6% - representing an additional 50,000 jobs. As a result, the latest data show the unemployment rate has fallen to 8.4 per cent at the end of April, the lowest level since 2008.  </p>  <p>  The SPU recognises that there are nevertheless several sources of uncertainty at present. In particular, there is uncertainty surrounding the continuing economic slowdown of several Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) and the effect this will have on the global economy. Additionally with the forthcoming referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union on the horizon, Ireland is potentially more exposed than most to a UK exit.</p>  <p>  This uncertainty highlights the importance of prudent management of the public finances and of competitiveness-oriented policies that would help the Irish economy to weather any global economic downturn that may emerge.</p>  <p>  In summary, I am confident that significant economic progress can continue to be made in the years ahead. However, this is contingent upon implementing appropriate polices. That is what the Government intends to do. </p></reply>

In this regard, Government Departments, including my own, have been working on this matter for some time.  Under the Department of Finance/Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) research programme agreement, my Department commissioned research to be undertaken on scoping the potential economic implications on Ireland of a change in the EU/UK relationship. The research was published on 5 November 2015 and is an important contribution to understanding the potential issues arising. </p>  <p>  My Department, and other Government Departments, are continuing our assessment of all the issues involved in protecting Ireland's interests and we are continuing to explore the potential risks and to plan accordingly in the period up to 23 June 2016.</p></reply>

Basically, GFCF is smoothed over four years under the expenditure benchmark.</p>  <p>  GFCF of general government consists of annual government investments, deducting disposals, in fixed assets retained for its own use.  Fixed assets are tangible or intangible assets as defined by and in accordance with the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010).  The annual general government GFCF outturn is produced by the CSO and is published as part of the Government Finance statistics.</p>  <p>  In the Stability Programme Update submitted to the European Commission at the end of April, the Government adopted a revised medium-term budgetary objective (MTO) of -0.5% of GDP.  This is expected to mean that Ireland will reach its MTO a year earlier, thereby increasing the level of fiscal space over the perion to 2021 by c.&euro;1.5 billion.  This development, combined with the favourable treatment of GFCF, means that there is scope within the fiscal space to allow for cumulative additional Exchequer capital investment of &euro;4 billion over the period, as noted in the programme for Government. </p>  <p>  Ending the housing shortage and homelessness is a priority for this Government and the delivery of the committed &euro;3.8 billion Social Housing Strategy, funded through the existing Capital Programme, will be accelerated.  As noted in the programme for Government there will be a mid-term review of the Capital Programme in mid-2017.  It is in this context that the allocation of additional Exchequer capital investment to priorities will be determined.</p></reply>

My Department expects the economy to grow by 4.9 per cent this year and by 3.9 per cent next year.  Over the medium term, the economy can probably grow by around 3&frac14; per cent per annum on a sustainable basis.</p>  <p>  Of course, as a small open economy, Ireland is disproportionately vulnerable to adverse developments in the international economy.  This is especially true of the US which remains one of Ireland's major trading partners.</p>  <p>  The SPU also notes that, while the outlook for the next 18 months is relatively benign, internationally the level of uncertainty is higher than at any stage since the height of the financial crisis. A more disruptive international environment could generate significant headwinds for the Irish economy.  This underlines the need to maintain prudent fiscal policies, keep expenditure under control, remain competitive and it is why I have consistently reiterated my commitment to Ireland's corporate tax regime.  Indeed various research reports by my Department and by the ESRI in recent years have shown the critical role of a competitive tax regime in attracting FDI and the key role played by the FDI sector in our overall economic story.</p></reply>

These commitments will ensure that progress continues to be made and that this issue will be addressed in an effective and fair manner.  </p><p>In relation to SME loans, as part of on-going supervision, the Central Bank, working in conjunction with the European Central Bank (ECB) as part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), continues to challenge the banks on their strategies, management, measurement and reporting of the resolution and restructuring of all non-performing loans (NPLs) including SME NPLs.  Relevant actions taken by the Central Bank in recent years have been extensive and include, inter alia, capital assessment reviews, stress tests, distressed credit operation reviews, balance sheet assessment exercises, SME loan resolution bank specific targets, on-site inspections and on-going, intensive supervisory engagement with the banks regarding distressed debt.</p><p>In 2013 non-public institution-specific SME distressed loan resolution targets were set for a number of banks.  The targets required the banks to develop strategies, at borrower level, to resolve their non-performing loans.  The targets ended in Q1 2015 with lenders reporting that they satisfied the requirements set out.  Progress has been made by the relevant institutions in resolving SME NPLs in recent years and NPL trends continue to move in a positive trajectory. </p><p>Recognising these developments, alongside changes in the supervision of the banks following the introduction of the SSM, the Central Bank's approach to commercial NPL resolution utilises a bank specific approach taking into consideration a number of factors including, inter alia, the institution's NPL resolution strategy and operational capability.  The sustainable resolution of distressed SME loans remains a significant priority for the Central Bank and will therefore continue to be central to their supervisory focus throughout 2016 and beyond.  Supervision will continue to be intrusive, supplemented by targeted inspections and enhanced monitoring of performance of the banks in delivery of supervisory objectives.</p><p>In relation to homeowners in financial difficulties, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) is a key part of the Central Bank's mortgage arrears framework.  It is designed to provide appropriate and effective consumer protection measures and to ensure that borrowers are treated in a fair and transparent manner.</p><p>The CCMA is a statutory code and can be found at: .</p><p>The CCMA sets out requirements for all mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears.  It provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent way by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  It sets out a process, called  the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).  The MARP is a four-step process which lenders must follow:</p><p>Step 1:  Communicate with the borrower</p><p>Step 2:  Gather financial information</p><p>Step 3:  Assess the borrower's circumstances</p><p>Step 4:  Propose a resolution</p><p>The CCMA also requires lenders to have an appeals process in place to enable a borrower appeal a decision by a lender, including where the borrower is not willing to enter into an alternative repayment arrangement or where the lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement.  The appeals procedure must inform the borrower of his/her right to refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The CCMA also provides that, at the borrower's request and with the borrower's written consent, the lender must liai se with a third party to act on his/her behalf in relation to his/her arrears situation.  </p><p>On 18 December 2015, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48)(Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 were published.  These regulations come into effect and apply to regulated entities, except credit unions, from 1 July 2016.  Until then, the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises 2012 will continue to apply. </p></reply>

However, the report concluded that income-related waivers are an inefficient and costly method of targeting relief as they run the risk of creating inequities between property owners in broadly comparable financial situations.  As noted in the group's report, there would also be substantial administrative difficulties in determining exactly which categories of property owners should qualify for an income based exemption or waiver.</p>  <p>  Instead it was decided to implement a system of deferral of LPT for persons below a certain income threshold.  There are number of criteria that must be met to qualify for such a deferral but in the main the income of the individual must be below &euro;15,000 for a full deferral and below &euro;25,000 for a partial deferral (&euro;25,000 and &euro;35,000 thresholds apply for couples).  It should be noted that the deferral option attaches as a charge on the property until paid and also carries an annual interest charge of 4%.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that approximately 29,000 property owners availed of this deferral in respect of 2015 liabilities.</p>  <p>  The thresholds applicable for the income deferral were recommended by the Thornhill interdepartmental group report based on analysis by the ESRI.  These were considered appropriate, having regard to potential impacts on households and to the need for balance and equity in terms of the burden thereby imposed on those with higher (but still average or below average) incomes and the levels of social welfare payments.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible at present to accurately estimate the cost of replacing the deferral with an exemption for all property owners with income below &euro;14,000.  This is due to the wide ranging nature of property owners with low incomes.  Some will be in employment or self-employment (and paying Income Tax), others will be individuals or businesses with no net liability to tax (and therefore not filing detailed tax returns with Revenue) and there will be a significant cohort of individuals, about whom Revenue data are very limited, for example property owners in receipt of only social welfare payments.  There may also be foreign owners of Irish property for which income data are not available.  Because complete information on the incomes of certain groups of property owners is not available to Revenue, the cost of an exemption for owners with incomes below &euro;14,000 cannot be estimated at present.</p></reply>

This table displays the estimated cost, in terms of revenue foregone, as well as the numbers who availed of the main tax credits and reliefs, including tax relief on medical insurance premiums.  The table contains information from 2004 to 2013, the latest year for which full information is currently available.  Provisional data indicate an estimated cost for tax relief on medical insurance premiums of &euro;354 million and &euro;325 million in 2014 and 2015 respectively.Forecasts for 2016 and 2017 are not currently available.</p><p>It should be noted that the medical insurance tax relief costs in the Tax Expenditures Table include, where relevant, the cost to the Exchequer of age-related relief at source, which was established by the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  The cost of the age related tax credit for years 2009 to 2012 inclusive is offset by a stamp duty on health insurance policies.</p><p>The age related tax credit and stamp duty were part of an interim scheme of risk equalisation, which was introduced in order to provide direct support to community rating in the private health insurance market and is intended to be revenue neutral over its duration.  This interim scheme expired on 31 December 2012 and was replaced from 1 January 2013 by a permanent risk equalisation scheme, provided for in the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012. Risk equalisation credits are not given through the tax system effective from 1 January 2013.</p><p>Since 16 October 2013, tax relief for medical insurance premiums has been restricted to the first &euro;1,000 per adult and the first &euro;500 per child insured.  Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings no longer qualifies for tax relief.Prior to this, income tax relief for medical insurance premiums was provided at source, at the standard rate of income tax, on the entire premium amount regardless of cost.  Therefore, the State was paying 20% of the cost of all private medical insurance premiums. </p><p>The cost of Income Tax relief in respect of medical insurance increased significantly in the years leading up to the introduction of the caps in Budget 2014, estimated at &euro;404 million in 2011 and &euro;448 million in 2012 (excluding the age related tax credit).  Despite the increasing cost of the relief, the numbers insured were estimated to have reduced by approximately 150,000 over the same period, while at the same time the level of medical cover decreased on some policies.  Against this background the increase in costs was unsustainable.  If the relief had remained unchanged and the trend was to continue, it was estimated that the cost of the uncapped relief would have increased to approximately &euro;1 billion per annum by 2020.</p><p>In my view, taking into account the increasing costs and reducing coverage outlined above, it was unfair and unsustainable to allow unrestricted tax relief on private medical insurance premiums, particularly at a time when the general population had contributed so much to repairing the public finances.  The ceilings ensure a level of continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.</p><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the returns filed with Revenue do not include information that would allow an income distribution of the beneficiaries of this tax relief to be provided.  Accordingly, the specific information requested as to the income brackets of individuals claiming tax relief on private health insurance premiums is not available.</p></reply>

This levy will be one of a number of key public health interventions that this Government will make, as well as serving to provide additional revenue to the Exchequer. </p><p>While the details of the proposed levy, including structure, rate and application, have not been finalised, it is worth noting that similar proposals have been examined by my Department in the context of the 2015 and 2016 Budget process.  They were initially considered through the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) General Excise Paper in September 2014 and again in September 2015.  The 2014 and 2015 Tax Strategy Group papers are available on my Department's website.</p><p>These papers highlighted a number of challenges that need to be overcome when introducing such a tax.  These included the potential impact on retailers and domestic soft drinks producers, the difficulties in applying an excise on a product which is not defined as a product under the EU general excise directive, the challenge in differentiating between sugar sweetened and artificially sweetened products and the challenge of collecting an excise on a product which has free movement between Member States and is not subject to the controls of a bonded warehouse like other excisable products such as alcohol, tobacco and mineral oils. </p><p>The tax strategy group paper for 2015 described a potential structure for a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks (SSD), which applied the tax to all drinks encompassed by CN code 2202 (includes soft drinks with added sugar and 'diet' products which contain artificial sweeteners).  The outlined effects of various rates of SSD tax per hectolitre on CN Code 2202, the associated VAT-inclusive increase in the price of a 330ml can of soda, and associated VAT-inclusive yield on a no-change basis are provided in the table following.<table><tr><th></th><th>&euro;</th><th>&euro;</th><th>&euro;</th><th>&euro;</th><th>&euro;</th><th>&euro;</th><th>&euro;</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Rate per hl</td><td>&euro;2.46</td><td>&euro;4.93</td><td>&euro;7.39</td><td>&euro;9.85</td><td>&euro;12.32</td><td>&euro;24.64</td><td>&euro;36.96</td><td>&euro;49.27</td></tr><tr><td>Increase </td><td>1c</td><td>2c</td><td>3c</td><td>4c</td><td>5c</td><td>10c</td><td>15c</td><td>20c</td></tr><tr><td>Yield</td><td>&euro;12.1m</td><td>&euro;24.3m</td><td>&euro;36.5m</td><td>&euro;48.7m</td><td>&euro;60.8m</td><td>&euro;121.7m</td><td>&euro;182.5m</td><td>&euro;243.4m</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In that respect, there are two rate-related schemes by which such expenses may be reimbursed by the employer.   The first scheme provides for the reimbursement of subsistence expenses up to the level of the prevailing Civil Service rates while the second scheme provides for the reimbursement of subsistence expenses on a schedule of rates and related conditions which do no more than reimburse for actual expenditure incurred.  Revenue approval is required for any such schedule.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that a review of travel and subsistence rates applying in the Civil Service was carried out in 2015 in consultation with the civil service unions.  Revised rates became effective in July 2015 and there are no plans for a further review.  The subsistence allowance payable is not intended to meet the whole cost of subsistence when absent from home and headquarters and is not intended to be a source of emolument or profit.</p></reply>

This commitment is evidenced by the range of commitments contained in the Programme for A Partnership Government which will provide renewed impetus for dealing with the issue particularly for those borrowers in longterm arrears.  </p><p>The Central Bank is also working to deal with mortgage arrears.  Relevant actions taken by the Central Bank since 2010 include capital assessment reviews, stress tests, distressed credit operation reviews, balance sheet assessment exercises and on-going, intensive supervisory engagement with the banks regarding distressed debt.  The Central Bank's approach from 2011 has required banks to fix their operational capability and ensure that they execute appropriate strategies to address mortgage arrears.  From March 2013 to December 2014, the Central Bank required the banks as a prudential measure to meet mortgage arrears targets to propose and conclude sustainable arrangements for the resolution residential mortgages in arrears ().  All of this was done in the context of the protections for borrowers under the consumer protection framework, including, in particular, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.</p><p>The Central Bank, in its capacity of independent regulator of credit institutions has determined that relying on common quarterly solution mortgage arrears targets across all banks is no longer appropriate and announced this in April 2015.  As a new approach, the Central Bank has written to each bank setting out new requirements that:</p><p>- concluded sustainable solutions are put in place for the vast majority of distressed borrowers;</p><p>- they meet the 'terms being met' target of 75 per cent of concluded solutions to the end of 2015 and beyond;</p><p>- they continue to comply with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears;</p><p>- where they initiate legal action that may result in loss of ownership for a borrower, they should be prepared to re-engage with the borrower and explore alternative solutions if the borrower re-engages; and</p><p>- they engage fully and appropriately in the process set out in the Personal Insolvency Act,  2012.</p><p>The banks have also been required to submit enhanced information to the Central Bank on the resolution of non-performing loans, including their strategies for delivering the outcomes outlined above.  Further, the banks will be subject to enhanced and more granular monitoring of specific cohorts of distressed borrowers where progress has been slower. </p><p>The Central Bank, including in its role as part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, remains focused on ensuring that the banks continue to improve issues identified in relation to their individual systems and procedures to ensure that they resolve arrears cases by implementing sustainable solutions for distressed borrowers in a fair manner.  </p><p>As indicated, the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) were introduced as a prudential policy measure for credit institutions.  As such, the MART process did not apply to non credit institutions such as retail credit firms.  However, the same consumer protection framework including the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) applies to retail credit firms as well as to credit institutions and like credit institutions retail credit firms are also required to fully comply with the full provisions of the CCMA when dealing with a mortgage in arrears or pre-arrears which is secured on a primary home.</p></reply>

The full text of this review was included in the Report on Taxation Expenditures, published on Budget day, which can be accessed online at:</p><p>.</p><p>The review undertaken comprised of:</p><p>- A review of the rationale for the replacement of the One-Parent Family Tax Credit with the Single Person Child Carer Credit.</p><p>- An outline of proposals relating to the transfer of any unused part of the SPCCC to the non-principal carer parent.</p><p>- Consideration of relevant legal issues.</p><p>- Consideration of relevant administrative, operational and data protection issues, and,</p><p>- Consideration of relevant budgetary implications.</p><p>This review identified that a transferable credit could only be effectively administered by Revenue with the full co-operation of the primary claimant, as it would require the primary claimant to file a tax return, provide information on the other parent (or secondary claimant) and consent to the release of personal information to the other parent (or secondary claimant).</p><p>I would point out that tax credits and bands are designed to be set against the taxable income of an individual in order to reduce his or her income tax liability.  This does not necessarily mean that any given tax credit or rate band will be utilised in full, as the maximum relief available is that which would reduce the income tax liability to nil or the rate of tax chargeable to 20% in the case of standard rate bands.  For example, an individual could be in receipt of the PAYE tax credit and have a level of income not sufficient to fully utilise this credit.  As the SPCCC can currently be transferred in full to a qualifying secondary claimant in certain cases, I am satisfied that there is an appropriate level of transferability to secondary claimants, taking into account the various issues identified in the published review.</p></reply>

ReBo was established to facilitate and oversee the restructuring of credit unions on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis.  The objectives of the restructuring process are to underpin the stability and long-term viability of credit unions and the sector at large and to provide an opportunity for stronger credit unions to develop a more sustainable business model. </p>  <p>  In October 2015 a detailed review of the work of ReBo was carried out under section 43 of the 2012 Act to examine whether or not ReBo had completed the performance of its functions.  This review recommended that the final date for a credit union to receive a letter of offer from ReBo should be extended from 31 December 2015 to 31 March 2016.  This extension provided additional time for credit unions considering entering the restructuring process to make an application in good time. </p>  <p>  Section 43(2)(b) of the 2012 Act provides that a further review must be carried out within twelve months of the first review to establish whether or not ReBo has completed its work.  In accordance with the 2012 Act, when I am satisfied that ReBo's work is done I will, by order, dissolve ReBo. </p>  <p>  As at the end of April 2016, ReBo has engaged with 219 different credit unions in 117 merger projects.  This represents in excess of 50% of total sector assets. 41 of these projects, involving 91 credit unions, have completed mergers with a further 9 projects involving 22 credit unions set to complete shortly.  ReBo's focus for the rest of the year is to assist the remaining 106 credit unions in completing their mergers. </p>  <p>  ReBo expects to have fully completed this work by the end of the year using circa &euro;20 million of the &euro;250 million set aside into the Credit Union Fund for the purposes of restructuring.  Over the course of its lifetime ReBo expects the number of credit unions in Ireland to have consolidated from 403 to circa 260.</p>  <p>  As stated previously, I am pleased that credit unions are engaging with ReBo as a business strategy to achieve the scale necessary to move to a more efficient and effective business model and as a means of strengthening the sector.</p></reply>

In each of these cases the Commission found that the Member States granted an illegal State Aid to the companies in question.</p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise that, while the Commission has opened a formal investigation in relation to one particular case involving Ireland, it has not made a final determination in the matter.  There is no formal timeline for a when the final decision will be made in our case.</p>  <p>  This a priority matter and Ireland has co-operated fully with the process to date and will continue to do so.  Detailed and comprehensive responses have been provided to the Commission demonstrating that the appropriate amount of Irish tax was charged in accordance with the relevant legislation, that no selective advantage was given and that there was no State Aid.</p>  <p>  I remain of the view that there was no breach of State Aid rules in this case and that the legislative provisions were correctly applied.  In the event that the Commission forms the view that there was state aid, Ireland is entitled to challenge this decision in the European Courts.  As the Government have already indicated, we will take that course of action, if necessary, to continue to vigorously defend the Irish position.</p>  <p>  As I have said previously, there is simply no question that the Irish authorities sought to give the company in question any kind of special tax deal.</p></reply>

The Central Bank has indicated that, while the general framework of mortgage rules is intended to be a permanent feature, arising from this forthcoming review the calibration of these rules can be tightened, loosened or left unchanged in response to its analysis of the operation of these rules from inception through summer 2016. However, it has cautioned that, given the value of a stable rules-based system, any changes to the existing measures will require a high evidence threshold.  As part of the review process, the Central Bank has indicated that it will invite written public submissions that provide evidence-based analyses of the impact of the rules and that details on this process will be provided in advance of the submission period.  The macro prudential regulations were put in place under the provisions of section 48 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 and that Act requires the Central Bank to formally consult with me, as Minister for Finance, on any new regulation it proposes to put in place under that section including in relation to the mortgage lending macro prudential measures.</p></reply>

His central recommendation is for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield.  This in turn would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue.  Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.  This new system was recommended by Dr Thornhill with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019.  In my Budget 2016 statement, I announced that I would be proposing to Government that the revaluation date for the LPT be postponed from 2016 to 2019.  This postponement means that home owners will not be faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values.  The postponement also gave sufficient time for the other recommendations in Dr Thornhill's report to be considered fully by the next Government.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 gives effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for LPT purposes, and also to two of the recommendations in Dr Thornhill's report, involving LPT relief for properties affected by pyrite and relief for properties occupied by persons with disabilities (recommendations numbers 11 and 12 respectively).  My Department will be considering issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Report in due course in line with the 2019 timeline.  I also note that the Programme for a Partnership Government provides for the preparation of a report by mid-2017 for Government and for the Oireachtas, on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability.</p></reply>

This is evidenced by the fact, for example, that in 2015 timely payment and return compliance ranged from 85% for the smallest cases to 98% for the largest cases.  Timely compliance for Local Property Tax was 97%.</p>  <p>  I know that Revenue has a strong focus on service as a very important underpinning in helping taxpayers and businesses to be timely and voluntarily compliant.  The recently published Revenue Annual Report, 2015 set out the range of actions undertaken by them in that regard and I commend that approach by Revenue.</p>  <p>  In an ideal world everyone would be timely compliant but of course the reality is a little different.  Despite the high timely compliance rates, I know that Revenue has a keen focus on tackling non-compliance in all its guises and in ensuring that the efforts of those who are timely compliant are not undermined by those who choose to be non-complaint and engage in tax evasion.  I am aware that Revenue has a particular risk focus to its compliance intervention programmes.  Risk-assessment techniques and systems identify and rank suspect or risky cases and this information is presented to caseworkers and auditors so that the appropriate intervention is actioned.  Compliance interventions range from a simple phone contact to audit to criminal prosecution.</p>  <p>  In relation to the impact of its non-compliance focus, I am advised by Revenue that, for example, its audit and compliance interventions in 2015 yielded &euro;642.5m. 28 criminal convictions for serious tax and duty evasion were also secured in 2015. 160 tax avoidance cases were settled during the year netting &euro;42m for the Exchequer.  Drugs and tobacco seizures valued at &euro;23.1m and &euro;34.4m respectively were realised.</p>  <p>  Opportunities to increase tax revenue were identified by Revenue in their Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 20014, published on their website. As part of the 2016 Estimates process Revenue sought to increase its staff resource to confront non-compliance by 50 whole time equivalents in order to increase the tax and duty yield from compliance interventions.  This followed on from a net increase in the 2015 Estimate process of 126.  Following the 2016 Estimates process, I am very pleased to be able to say that Revenue's multi-annual budget was increased to provide for an average annual whole time staff equivalent of 5,924, an increase of 50 on the 2015 provision.  An additional &euro;75m yield from compliance interventions was included in Budget 2016 calculations based on the recruitment of additional staff and investment in the development of a new debt analysis tool.</p>  <p>  Revenue's objective of making taxes and duties easy to pay and hard to avoid is a very important one.  It is an objective in which it is succeeding.  An appropriately resourced tax and customs administration is essential in ensuring that we continue to experience high timely compliance and that non-compliance and tax evasion is appropriately sanctioned.</p>  <p>  Over the last two year's Estimates process I have supported the business case by Revenue to increase its staffing levels by a total of 176 staff.  This follows on from the overall reduction in Revenue and Civil Service numbers since 2008.</p>  <p>  I am also informed by Revenue that ongoing investment in Information Communications Technology (ICT) is critical to ensure that Revenue provides a modern service to the compliant but also better targets non-compliance in all its forms.  Revenue's policy throughout the economic crisis was to maintain investment in ICT to the greatest extent possible given the difficult budgetary circumstances.</p>  <p>  In the context of the 2017 Estimates process I will carefully consider any proposals that Revenue make in relation to resources.</p></reply>

During the period between June 2012, when the agreement was reached regarding retrospective recapitalisation, and December 2014, when the DRI tool became operational, the Irish economy recovered significantly and the options available for the State to recover its money invested in the banks expanded.  This remains the case, with investors now willing to support Irish banks, the institutions have begun to repay capital to the State and the market value of our investments has improved accordingly.</p>  <p>  The terms and conditions attaching to the use of the DRI instrument are extremely onerous as the instrument is designed to be used almost as a last resort after the creditor waterfall has been applied and other options are exhausted.  Moreover the likely mechanics behind a potential retroactive application of the instrument, if such a decision could be agreed, are likely to be equally if not more onerous in my view, and would not be in the best interests of the State.</p>  <p>  As you will be aware the operational framework of the ESM DRI includes stringent conditionality and any application would need to be unanimous amongst the other eighteen ESM Governors.  Achieving such an outcome for a deal which valued our investments at a level significantly above what we might achieve in the market today is extremely unlikely, particularly given the strength of our economic recovery since 2012 and the other concessions won by Ireland in recent years.</p>  <p>  The disposal of our bank assets is a process that will likely take place over a number of years and this is incorporated in the Programme for Government.  I have said before that my interest is in recovering the maximum amount of money for the Irish taxpayer from these assets over time and current market conditions are not conducive to achieving this objective.  Fortunately given that our public finances are once again on the right path, we are not under pressure to dispose of these assets in the short-term.</p>  <p>  With regard to AIB in particular, I have indicated in the past that an IPO is likely to be the optimal route to recouping value from our investment.  At the beginning of this year officials in my Department appointed an Independent Financial Advisor to assist with analysis and planning related to our shareholding in AIB, and much of this initial preparation has now been completed.  However, given the complex nature of an IPO process, the need to access certain IPO 'windows' and the recent volatility seen in stock markets, I would now deem it more likely that a market event involving AIB would occur in 2017, rather than 2016.</p></reply>

This is a generous relief intended to encourage pension saving.  The growth of pension funds is also exempt from tax.  Upon retirement a person is generally entitled to a potentially quite sizable tax-free lump sum, with the remainder of pension benefits taxed at their marginal rate of income tax.  Having regard to the above it does not seem to me that the taxation of pension savings in the country could fairly be described as &quot;penal&quot;.</p><p>With regard to deposit savings, the Government decided to increase the rate of Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) (previously 33%) to 41% in Budget 2014.

Previous DIRT rates were below the higher rate of income tax, and this, in effect, incentivised saving.  The decision to raise the rate of DIRT was taken to encourage spending in the economy with a view to stimulating growth and employment and to raise additional revenues.</p><p>Exemptions from DIRT may apply for the following persons in certain circumstances:</p><p>- Individuals aged over 65 (subject to income limits)</p><p>- Permanently Incapacitated Individuals</p><p>- Companies, Pension Funds and Charities (Irish resident companies pay tax on investment income at 25%)</p><p>- Non-Resident Account Holders</p><p>There are alternative savings products available which are tax free (Savings Bonds, Saving Certificates, Instalment Savings and the National Solidarity Bonds).</p></reply>

Credit unions are currently not subject to the dormant accounts legislation.  Accordingly, accounts in credit unions that have not been reclaimed by the owners for at least 15 years are not transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund.</p>  <p>  The Credit Union Act, 1997 (as amended) does not make reference to Dormant Accounts.  Dormant accounts in credit unions, and the practices surrounding them, are governed by Rule 22 of the Standard Rules for Credit Unions published by the Irish League of Credit Unions.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by DECLG that an analysis of the benefit of adding dormant credit union accounts to the Dormant Accounts Fund has not been carried out.  In practical terms, increasing the amount available in the Fund does not necessarily allow for the introduction of new dormant accounts measures or programmes, which is the focus of DECLG in respect of the Fund.  While applying the provisions of the dormant accounts legislation to credit union accounts could increase the size of the Fund, Government Departments must source monies for dormant accounts programmes and measures from their Exchequer allocation in the same way as with any other funding programme.  When the monies expended on dormant accounts measures and programmes are reimbursed from the Dormant Accounts Fund, the refund is to the Exchequer rather than to the spending Department.  For this reason, dormant accounts expenditure is subject to the same constraints within Departments as any other spending programme.</p>  <p>  In addition, expenditure on new dormant accounts measures or programmes would serve to increase Government debt levels, as monies disbursed from the Dormant Accounts Fund belong to the account holder, who can reclaim it at any time, and not to the State.  Consequently, every euro spent from the Fund is regarded in accounting terms as a potential Government liability.</p>  <p>  It would be a matter for Government on the advice of the Department of Finance or DCELG to decide on any extension to the Dormant Account legislation to include credit unions.  However, there are no plans at present to introduce such a change.</p></reply>

They are mainly statutory schemes, set up by or under Acts of the Oireachtas.  Teachers in the Community School sector are members of The Secondary, Community and Comprehensive School Teachers Pension Scheme (S.I. No. 435 of 2009) while teachers in the Education and Training Boards are members of Education and Training Board Teachers Superannuation Scheme 2015 (S.I. No. 292 of 2015).  Therefore the pension provision a teacher may be entitled to upon retirement depends not on the course they have undertaken but rather the rules of the pension scheme of which they are a member.  In this regard the pension entitlements of teachers in community schools differs from Educational Training Boards because they have different pension schemes.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct in stating there is no provision for the award of added years under the rules of Secondary, Community and Comprehensive School Teachers Pension Scheme.  The added years' scheme referred to by the Deputy provides for the award of added years, on retirement, where the minimum age limit specified for appointment and/or the minimum qualifications and experience specified for appointment to a professional, technical or specialist post in an Education and Training Board would not allow a person to be appointed by age 25 and thereby acquire maximum reckonable service (40 years) by age 65.  This was not seen as a requirement in the Voluntary and Community School Sector, where in general the issue did not arise.</p></reply>

In the same period the number of children accessing SNA support has grown from approximately 22,000 to some 30,000 by the end of 2015.  The increase in SNA numbers has been supported by a very significant increase in the Budget for SNAs, rising from &euro;332 million in 2011 to &euro;402 million by the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  This is a higher level of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support than ever before, which will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school.  Where children have significant care needs whereby they may need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.</p>  <p>  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that each school's allocation of SNA support can change from year to year and may be increased or decreased as students who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school.  New students with care needs may, or may not enrol to replace students who have left, for example, or SNA allocations may be decreased where students develop more independent living skills and their care needs diminish over time.</p>  <p>  I understand that the NCSE carried out a care needs review for this school in January 2016. On foot of this review the SNA allocation was adjusted as a student had left the school to attend a special class.  No formal appeal of the SNA allocation was received from the school.</p>  <p>  All schools were asked to apply for SNA support for the 2016/17 school year by 29th February 2016. The NCSE continues to accept applications in recognition that enrolments may not have been completed or where assessments were not completed.  The NCSE will consider these applications and make further allocations to schools in respect of valid applications which have been received to September.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will advise all schools of their allocations for SNA support for 2016/17 before the end of the current school year.</p>  <p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, while Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  Details of the manner in which a school, or parent, may appeal an SNA allocation decision is also available at www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The Circular explains that, while professional reports provide valuable assistance to education providers to education providers in identifying a diagnosis or identifying appropriate interventions, responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports and resources to be allocated to schools to support pupils with special educational needs resides with the NCSE through the SENO.</p>  <p>  All schools were asked to apply for SNA support for the 2016/17 school year by 29th February 2016. The NCSE continues to accept applications in recognition that enrolments may not have been completed or where assessments were not completed. The NCSE will consider these applications and make further allocations to schools in respect of valid applications which have been received to September.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will advise all schools of their allocations for SNA support for 2016/17 before the end of the current school year.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that SNA allocations are not made to individual children, but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs.</p>  <p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, while Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available the NCSE website.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question relates to the allocation of SNA support by the NCSE to an individual child, I have referred this question to the NCSE for their consideration and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.</p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. Overall, the removal of qualification allowances had the effect of further reducing the pay of new entrant teachers by between 5 and 7 percent.</p>  <p>  The measures above &ndash; which applied to new entrants only and which were in addition to the pay reductions imposed on public servants generally - were implemented at a time of extraordinarily difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State. It is estimated that some 6,700 teachers who entered the profession since 2011 have been affected by the measures.</p>  <p>  The Haddington Road Agreement re-aligned the pay scale for teachers who entered teaching between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 with that of pre-2011 entrants. An improved pay scale for post-1 February 2012 entrants was also agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement. The Lansdowne Road Agreement will begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years. The flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement are proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has committed to establishing a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.</p></reply>

These arrangements are mainly focused at post-primary level. However, it is fair to say that before the moratorium, notwithstanding the fact that one out of every two teachers held a management allowance the workload issue and the pressures on Principals and Deputy Principals existed.</p>  <p>  Simply lifting the moratorium as extra funding becomes available in future years is not the best way of improving how school leadership is distributed in our schools. School leaders have a key role to play in determining the shape of our schools and student outcomes. Leading on curricular change and change management are key challenges for every school leader. The challenge for schools and the Department is therefore to build a leadership partnership that is fit for 21st century Ireland and school context.</p>  <p>  Economic constraints and the moratorium on recruitment, albeit alleviated to some extent for schools, have presented challenges within the education sector. They also provide an opportunity to review the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession.</p>  <p>  The Department, in consultation with the representative management bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support and thereby advance our understanding of the needs of school leaders and how they might be addressed.</p>  <p>  As part of the 2,260 additional teaching posts announced in Budget 2016, 250 of these posts are being provided to second level schools to enable Deputy Principals to be freed up from teaching time and be more fully available to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school. Up to now only schools with at least with over 500 students received an allocation to free up the Deputy Principal.</p>  <p>  With effect from 01 September 2016, second level schools with over 400 students will receive an allocation that will bring those schools in line with the schools that have over 500 pupils where the Deputy Principal is fully freed up. A pro rata allocation of additional hours to support school leadership will also be provided to the schools with 400 or fewer students enrolled. At primary level Budget 2016 provides for additional release days for teaching principals to range between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school and effective from the start of the 2016/17 school year.</p></reply>

This includes a commitment to aim to increase the number of non-denominational and multi-denominational schools to 400 by 2030.</p><p>The Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the primary school sector, which issued its report in 2012, recommended steps that could be taken to ensure that the education system can provide a sufficiently diverse number and range of primary schools to cater for children of all religions and none.</p><p>The Report's recommendations covered a number of different areas including those dealing with the creation of more inclusive schools. While this is a particular issue in areas where the population is such that there is only one school (often under denominational patronage) catering for the entire population, the Forum made recommendations with regard to all schools in relation to including pupils of different religions, beliefs and traditions in the school.</p><p>A public consultation on inclusiveness in primary schools was held in Autumn 2013. Views of parents, in particular, were sought on issues such as how best to accommodate students of various belief systems and traditions within existing schools, and having school policies on the conduct of religious celebrations and the display of religious symbols.</p><p>A paper, entitled &quot;Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector: Progress to Date and Future Directions&quot;, which took account of the public consultation, was published in 2014.

All current providers and other interested parties were invited to a briefing session on Monday 21st March at which SOLAS briefed the attendees on the upcoming changes.  All current providers were also invited to provide feedback on the draft proposal for the operation of the framework by the end of April.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.</p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that the formal diagnosis of Dyspraxia falls within the province of local HSE clinical services with NEPS psychologists providing advice to parents and school authorities as to the appropriate referral path.</p>  <p>  I would advise that where there are concerns in relation to the educational development of pupils including those referred to in Deputy's question these should be raised by their parents/guardians, in the first instance, with the Principal of the relevant school(s), with a view to the Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist.</p></reply>

My Department also provides July Provision for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability.  Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided.</p>  <p>  As the home based provision takes place outside the usual school structure it is important that home tutors are qualified to provide an educational programme.  It is appropriate therefore that the qualification standard in the Home Based July Provision generally reflects that required in a school environment.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, it is a condition of the scheme that parents must recruit a teacher who is qualified in the sector in which the tuition is being provided and registered with the Teaching Council of Ireland.  Where all efforts have failed to secure the services of a teacher qualified to teach in the sector concerned, Parents may consider the engagement of a person who is registered with the Teaching Council and has a primary degree (minimum Level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications) in a relevant area.</p>  <p>  My predecessor recently received the NCSE's policy advice on supporting students with ASD.

The most recent published information relates to the 2014/15 school year. </p>  <p>  The overall number of wholetime equivalent teaching posts at primary level has increased by 6%, a total of 1,904 teaching posts from the 2009/10 school year to the 2014/15 school year.

This group was chaired by Mr. Peter Ward SC, who consulted extensively with all the stakeholders and interested parties. The report was published in September 2014 and can be found on my Department's website at the following link &ndash; <i></i>-for-Education-and-Skills-of-the-Chairperson-of-the-Expert-Group-on-Fixed-Term-and-Part-Time-Employment-in-Primary-and-Second-Level-Education-in-Ireland.pdf.</p><p>The report recommended a suite of measures which will lead to more job security for fixed-term and part-time teachers.  It recommended seven changes for implementation from the commencement of the 2015/16 school which my Department implemented. Circulars 23/2015 and 24/2015 detailing the arrangements and procedures for the implementation of the recommendations of the report were published on March 27th 2015 and are available on my Department's website at the following link - <i> Terms-and-Con</i><i><i>ditions/Fixed-Term-Contracts.html.</i></i></p><p>One of the key features of the new procedures is that the qualification period for the granting of an initial Contract of Indefinite Duration (CID) is reduced from a period of continuous employment in excess of three years with the same employer to a period of continuous employment in excess of two years.</p><p>In their deliberations the expert group considered the issue of the exclusion from qualification for a CID of a teacher who is covering for another teacher absent on an approved scheme of leave of absence.  The report recommended that a teacher covering for another teacher on career break or secondment should not be disqualified from entitlement to a CID on that ground. However the group having considered the issue of teachers covering for teachers who are job-sharing concluded that these teachers should not be included in this arrangement.</p><p>Individual teachers who wish to appeal the decision not to award them a CID or the terms of the CID awarded to them may submit an appeal to the independent Fixed-Term Adjudicator.  The adjudication process is outlined in Circular 0050/2006 and is available on my Department's website at the following link &ndash; <i>.</i></p></reply>

Circular 0007/2016 lists the GAM/EAL allocation for all schools. </p><p>Schools have autonomy on how to deploy the resource between language support and learning support depending on their specific needs.</p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that some &euro;1.37 billion will be spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs this year, which represents approximately 15% of my Department's budget.</p><p>This provides for a range of supports and services including additional learning and resource teaching support, Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support, special transport arrangements, building adaptations, enhanced capitation, funding for the purchase of specialised equipment, services of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), enhanced levels of capitation in Special schools and Special Classes and additional teacher training. </p><p>We now have a higher level of Resource Teaching and SNA support than ever before. </p><p>In July last, it was announced that an additional 610 Special Needs Assistant posts are being provided for in the current school year. There are currently 11,820 whole time equivalent SNA posts available in Primary, Post Primary and Special schools to support children with special educational needs with assessed care needs. This is the highest level of SNA allocation that we have ever had.  These extra posts will ensure that the Government's policy of ensuring that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support.</p><p>In addition, the NCSE has established over 150 new Special Classes in the 2015/16 school year, which means there are now over 1,000 special classes attached to mainstream schools catering for children with special educational needs. </p><p>There is an extra 480 Resource Teachers in our schools in the current school year which takes into account increased demand and demographic growth and ensures that children continue to have access to additional supports in school. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory role under the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act to provide me with policy advice in relation to matters concerning the education of persons with special educational needs.</p><p>The NCSE published policy advice in 2013 which identified that the current model for allocating resource teachers to schools is potentially inequitable and recommended the development of a new allocation model. </p><p>In developing its policy advice the NCSE consulted widely with education partners, representatives from the school sector, parents, and disability representative bodies.</p><p>The NCSE recommended that a new model be developed based on the profiled needs of each school, including consideration of Standardised Test performances in schools, and a school's social context, rather than primarily on school size and the diagnosed disability of individual children. It is intended that this new model will reduce the inequities in the current system, and also ensure that we are not unnecessarily labelling children from a young age in order to access resources. </p><p>Although there was widespread support for the implementation of the new model, there was not time to address all of the issues in relation to the proposed new model in time to allow for it to be implemented this year. A pilot of the new model, which is currently underway in 47 schools, will run for the duration of the current school year. This pilot has been developed in order to test the model in a number of schools and to allow for the practical effect of the application of the new model in pilot schools to be gauged.  It will also allow us to take into account the learning experiences of schools, principals, pupils and the views of parents over the course of the pilot, prior to the full implementation of the proposed new allocation model.</p></reply>

As part of this review the SEC is considering the recent High Court Judicial Review findings referred to by the Deputy. Following the review the SEC will develop proposals and plans for any changes to the RACE Scheme it considers necessary.</p>  <p>  Currently the SEC operates a Scheme of Reasonable Accommodations at the Leaving and Junior Certificate examinations for candidates with special needs in the examinations. The Scheme applies to candidates who have a physical or medical disability, including visual and hearing impairments, or a specific learning difficulty. All applications for reasonable accommodations are considered within a published Framework of Principles established by an Expert Advisory Group. </p>  <p>  Reasonable accommodations are not intended to compensate for a possible lack of achievement arising from a disability or to compensate for difficulties arising from a candidate's general intellectual functioning.  Reasonable accommodations are intended to:</p>  <p>  (a) to remove, as far as possible, the impact of the disability on the candidate's performance and thus enable the candidate to demonstrate his or her level of attainment and</p>  <p>  (b) to ensure that, whilst giving candidates every opportunity to demonstrate their level of attainment, the special arrangements will not give the candidate an unfair advantage over other candidates in the same examination. The range of accommodations includes, inter alia, provision of modified, brailled and enlarged papers for visually impaired students; access to readers, scribes, word-processor, tape or voice recorder for student with physical conditions or dyslexia or other types of SLD; exemptions from components of the examinations such as the oral or aural or the waiver from spelling and grammar in language subjects. Some students may apply for and be granted more than one type of accommodation.</p>  <p>  In cases where a school/parent or student is dissatisfied with any aspect of the SEC's decision, they have access to an Independent Appeals Committee. All members of the Appeals Committee are drawn from outside the SEC. The remit of the Appeals Committee covers appeals against all elements of a decision taken by the SEC. Appeals must be lodged in writing and all appeals are considered in light of the Framework of Principles established by the Expert Advisory Group.</p></reply>

However, unlike other subject areas, the content of the religious curriculum provided by schools is not set by my Department. The Education Act recognises the rights of the different church authorities to design curricula in religious education and to supervise their teaching and implementation. This means that the content of the religious education programme in a particular primary school is determined by the patron of the school.</p>  <p>  This is similar to post primary level, where a programme of religious instruction approved by the school patron may be offered. However, post primary schools also have the option of using the Religious Education curriculum which has been designed as an examinable subject at Junior and Leaving Certificate by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). The NCCA syllabuses are academic in nature. They are concerned with understanding religion as a phenomenon in the world and are designed to be studied by students of all religious faiths and of none. A new specification for Junior Cycle Religious Education will be introduced for first year students from September 2019 and assessed in 2022 for the first time.</p>  <p>  Under the Constitution and in accordance with the Education Act 1998, parents have a right to have their children opt out of religion classes if they wish.  The practical arrangements to accommodate children whose parents have chosen this option is a matter for each individual school to arrange locally. As part of the programme for government is a commitment to publish a new school Admissions and Excellence legislation taking account current draft proposals, which included a provision for schools to indicate in their enrolment policies how they would facilitate requests to opt out of religious instruction.</p>  <p>  You should also note that in January of this year Rule 68 of the Rules for National Schools was rescinded. The Rule, which dates from 1965 refers to religious instruction as by far the most important part of the school curriculum and provides that a religious spirit should "inform and vivify the whole work of the school."  </p>  <p>  In relation to the reference to Community National Schools (CNS), I can advise that CNS are multi-denominational schools which welcome children of all faiths and none. A multi-belief Religious Education programme entitled Goodness Me! Goodness You! (GMGY) provides for the delivery of religious education and faith nurturing in the CNSs. GMGY caters for children of all faith and belief perspectives, with content appropriate for both theist and non-theist perspectives.  The GMGY core programme is taught to all children in one group irrespective of their belief. For three to four weeks each year, during the two and a half hours per week allocated for religious education, faith and belief-specific teaching is provided to children whose parents have opted for them to receive such teaching.</p></reply>

Since 2011, the arrangements for the establishment of new schools in areas of growing population result in the majority of these having a multi-denominational ethos.  In this regard, 39 of the 42 new schools (24 primary schools and 18 post-primary schools) have a multi-denominational ethos.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government reflects the Government's objective of strengthening parental choice and further expanding diversity in our school system, specifically by increasing the number of non-denominational and multi-denominational schools with a view to reaching 400 by 2030.</p>  <p>  In addition to the phased transfer of Catholic schools to new patrons already under way, this will require considering new ideas and new approaches to substantially accelerate the changes in school provision in order to achieve greater diversity.  The Government is committed to working with all stakeholders to facilitate this process and I will be progressing these matters as a priority. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-17a.930.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051700062#WRM05000"><p>I propose to take questions 328, 330, 331 and 343 together.</p>  <p>  The National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030, published in 2011, provides a framework for the development of the higher education sector to 2030.  With regard to the institute of technology sector, the Strategy recommended significant reforms to position the sector to meet national strategic objectives. In particular, the Strategy recommended consolidation within the sector and a pathway of evolution for those consolidated institutes of technology, to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria and to apply to become technological universities.</p>  <p>  Mission of Technological Universities: These institutions will be distinctly different from traditional universities and institutes of technology by virtue of their mission. This differentiated mission includes -</p>  <p>   &ndash; a systematic focus on the preparation of graduates for complex professional roles in a changing technological world, </p>  <p>  - the advancement of knowledge through applied research and scholarship and the dissemination of this knowledge to meet the needs of society and enterprise, and</p>  <p>  - the particular contribution the university will make to the needs of the region in which it is located.</p>  <p>  The development of technological universities has the potential to deliver greater opportunity to students in these regions, to staff working in the institutions, and to the broader local economy and society. </p>  <p>  I would also like to underline that this is much more than a rebranding exercise &ndash; the institutions concerned are required to achieve high standards across a range of areas before being designated as technological universities. These include standards relating to the qualifications of staff, the quality of research output, the proportion of students engaged in lifelong learning, and other relevant issues.</p>  <p>  The mission and vision for each proposed technological university is developed by the consortia, in consultation with stakeholders including staff and students, and is contained in the implementation plans subsequently developed.</p>  <p>  Consortiums who have applied:As part of the implementation of the Strategy, the Higher Education Authority in 2012 published a four-stage process and criteria for applicant groups of institutes of technology wishing to apply to become technological universities. </p>  <p>  The designation process consists of four stages as follows &ndash; </p>  <p>  - an expression of interest, </p>  <p>  - the preparation of a plan to meet the criteria, </p>  <p>  - an evaluation of the plan, and </p>  <p>  - an application for designation.</p>  <p>  There are currently four consortia engaged with the process to become designated as TUs.  These are TU4Dublin (Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Tallaght, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown), Technological University for the South-East (TUSE &ndash; consisting of Waterford Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Carlow), Munster Technological University (MTU &ndash; consisting of Cork Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Tralee) and the Connacht Ulster Alliance (CUA &ndash; consisting of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology). </p>  <p>  Status of Consortia:At the end of 2014, two consortia successfully passed stage 3 of the four-stage process. These are the TU4Dublin consortium and the Munster Technological University consortium.</p>  <p>  In early 2015 the Connacht-Ulster Alliance also expressed an interest in merging and in applying to become a technological university. This application was approved to proceed to the next stage.  In line with the process for designation as a Technological University, Stage 2 of this process involves the preparation of a plan by the Connacht-Ulster Alliance, to meet the criteria for designation as a Technological University.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Technological University for the South-East, consisting of Institute of Technology, Carlow (ITC) and Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT), following the publication of the Kelly report, a preliminary facilitation process which was underway since September 2015, has recently been completed and a Report of the process was received by my Department on 13 May 2016.  There was strong engagement in the process by both parties.  This facilitation process has been an important building block in terms of building trust between the parties and in developing a strong working relationship between the Presidents and Chairs of both institutions.    As part of this process, the Presidents of the two institutions, have jointly developed an initial work-plan to support the development of a joint TU proposal.</p>  <p>  In addition to this both Institutions made a joint presentation and submission to the Higher Education Authority last week, seeking funding to underpin the next phase of engagement.  This was part of the latest call issued by the Higher Education Authority regarding the restructuring of the higher education landscape.  The call sought submissions for funding support in respect of the costs arising from mergers as part of the implementation of the National Strategy for Higher Education.</p></reply>

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.</p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. Overall, the removal of qualification allowances had the effect of further reducing the pay of new entrant teachers by between 5 and 7 percent. </p>  <p>  The measures above &ndash; which applied to new entrants only and which were in addition to the pay reductions imposed on public servants generally - were implemented at a time of extraordinarily difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State. It is estimated that some 6,700 teachers who entered the profession since 2011 have been affected by the measures.</p>  <p>  The Haddington Road Agreement re-aligned the pay scale for teachers who entered teaching between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 with that of pre-2011 entrants. An improved pay scale for post-1 February 2012 entrants was also agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement. The Lansdowne Road Agreement will begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years. The flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement are proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has committed to establishing a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.</p></reply>

JCT records indicate that in 2013/14, 4,814 teachers attended CPD for teachers of Junior Cycle English, representing 89% approximately of such teachers registered with JCT as of June 2014. The Deputy should note that in 2013/14 teachers of English from all post primary school sectors (ETB, community and comprehensive, and voluntary secondary) registered for and attended CPD. Figures for subject specific CPD for the current school year are in the attached table.</p><p>For non-subject specific CPD (e.g. whole school, short courses etc) schools rather than individual teachers register with JCT. Accordingly, in 2014/15, CPD for Level 2 Learning programmes was provided for 80 schools. In the current school year non-subject CPD was provided as follows: whole school 179 schools; short courses 22 schools; level 2 learning programmes 55 schools; Subject Learning and Assessment Reviews (SLARs) 175 schools (one teacher nominated by each school). </p><p>In addition, CPD was provided for 1,240 school leaders in 2013/14 and for 369 school leaders in 2015/16.</p><p>Significant resources are available both on the NCCA and on the JCT websites for teachers and others, including students, to access.</p><p>Currently students in second year who may not have completed their first classroom-based assessment will, as agreed with both of the teacher unions in 2015, have the opportunity to complete this early in the autumn term of the 2016/ 2017 school year. </p><p>My Department remains willing to provide the ASTI with any further clarifications to the agreement their leaders signed last May so as to ensure that all students can complete all aspects of the new Junior Cycle programme.<b>Junior Cycle Subject Specific CPD (2015/16)</b><table><tr><th>Subject</th><th>No. of teachers </th><th>No of teachers registered with JCT for subject</th><th>% of registered teacher attending</th></tr><tr><td>English </td><td>1286</td><td>5612</td><td>23%</td></tr><tr><td>Science</td><td>945</td><td>3413</td><td>28%</td></tr><tr><td>Business</td><td>625</td><td>1486</td><td>42%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

There is a particular focus on supporting communities that are vulnerable, disadvantaged or under threat, and an adherence to the values of local participation. </p>  <p>  The Government currently provides substantial funding to social enterprises through a range of programmes and schemes, many of which are implemented through the nationwide network of Local Development Companies, including the Community Services Programme, Community Employment Schemes, the Wage Subsidy Scheme for the employment of people with disabilities, public sector contracts through the HSE, and the Social Finance Foundation.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department funds a number of programmes operating within communities, including the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP), which is one of my Department&rsquo;s key priorities.  Some &euro;28 million was available for the 9 month period April to December 2015 for the SICAP programme and &euro;37.3 million is available for 2016. </p>  <p>  The focus of Goal 3 of SICAP is to engage with marginalised target groups/individuals and residents of disadvantaged communities who are unemployed but who do not fall within mainstream employment service provision or who are referred to SICAP to move them closer to the labour market and improve work readiness.  In doing so, the aim is to support individuals in accessing employment and self-employment and creating social enterprise opportunities.   </p>  <p>  The programme aims to promote the development of social enterprises as a means of employment generation for those most distant from the labour market as well as trying to improve on services to disadvantaged communities and groups.  SICAP-supported enterprise start-up grants can be made available to assist a social enterprise at any stage of its development.  The Local SICAP Programme Implementer in each Local Authority area is responsible for managing the delivery of SICAP and the enterprise/social enterprise element in collaboration with other relevant stakeholders.   </p></reply>

The sizes for 1, 2 and 3 bedroom apartments are not new standards but a restatement of the minimum apartment sizes for such apartments set out in previous statutory guidelines published in 2007 after extensive public consultation and the engagement of independent professional architectural and design expertise.  In addition and more importantly to ensure their consistent application, including in the many local authority areas with no minimum standards, the 2015 guidelines were drafted in a manner that avails of amendments to the Ministerial powers under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to issue guidelines to planning authorities, which amendments were inserted by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2015. </p><p><i></i>The 2015 Act enables statutory guidelines to expressly state &ldquo;Specific Planning Policy Requirements&rdquo; to be applied by planning authorities, or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as appropriate, in the exercise of their planning functions and where any conflict arises between such guidelines and local authority development plans, the requirements of the guidelines take precedence.</p><p>Whilst not all aspects of the 2015 Apartment Guidelines are mandatory, they identify a number of specific planning policy requirements that must be applied by local authorities.  These include minimum apartment unit floor areas. </p><p>The 2015 guidelines therefore updated previous 2007 guidelines, which, in practice, had little if any real effect in terms of actual development, due to the post 2008 economic downturn and after which, despite challenging economic conditions, a number of local authorities set differing and higher minimum floor area standards. </p><p>The confusion of different standards and inconsistencies between local authorities, even within Dublin, and the cost implications of associated lift, access and parking requirements were considered by my Department to raise wider concerns about adverse impacts on the viability of new housing development generally and apartment development specifically, both in relation to public and private housing.</p><p>Housing, or more specifically tackling the lack of its provision, is the single biggest issue facing this Government and had my Department not acted in addressing the consistency issue, the plethora of ever escalating minimum floor area requirements and resultant uncertainty would have persisted, adversely impacting not only on supply, but supply at affordable prices.</p><p>My Department did engage in focused analysis of the apartment standards issue, which was published, building on its previous work and consultation on the 2007 guidelines.

Following the necessary preparatory work the new Scheme came into operation on 1 January 2016.  The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having been in receipt of social housing support for a minimum period of one year and having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum. </p><p>The terms of the Scheme involve discounts of 40%, 50% or 60% off the purchase price of the house, linked to tenant income.  On the sale of a house under the Scheme, the housing authority will place an incremental purchase charge on the house equivalent to the discount granted to the tenant.  Generally, the charge withers away over a period of 20, 25 or 30 years depending on the level of discount involved. </p><p>The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the Scheme is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, housing authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.</p><p>In determining reckonable income, the income of the tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, can be included, as can the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them. </p><p>A number of income sources, including carer&rsquo;s allowance and certain other social welfare payments, are disregarded for the purposes of determining reckonable income.  In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant&rsquo;s income is of a long-term and sustainable nature.  This is necessary to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership and responsibility of the house from the local authority to the tenant. </p><p>The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  In order to participate in the scheme, the tenant must, in the first instance, meet the eligibility criteria as set out in the relevant legislation, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination of, own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan. </p><p>Section 48 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015, which commenced on 1 January 2016, inserts a new section 3A into the Water Services Act 2014, subsection (9) of which provides that a housing authority shall not complete the sale of a dwelling under a tenant purchase scheme until the tenant provides to the authority a certificate from Irish Water confirming that any charge under section 21 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 in respect of that dwelling payable by the tenant has been paid.  Therefore, tenants of local authority houses who wish to participate in the scheme must provide the relevant certificate from Irish Water, in order for the sale of the house to be completed. </p><p>The consideration of individual applications and the determination of eligibility under the new Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a matter for the local authority concerned, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 2014 Act and the Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015.</p><p>The new scheme is in the very early stages of implementation and my Department is monitoring its operation in consultation with housing authorities.  In line with the commitment in the new Programme for a Partnership Government<i></i>to make the scheme more attractive for social housing tenants and to raise new funds for housing development, I intend to undertake a review of the scheme following the first 12 months of operation and to bring forward any changes to the terms and conditions of the scheme which are considered necessary based on the evidence gathered at that stage. </p></reply>

The Strategy has targeted the provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households, mainly through the Housing Assistance Payment.  Social housing targets have previously been set for each local authority out to 2017 and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, along with the associated provisional funding allocations, at the following link:<i></i><i> </i></p><p>A key objective under the Social Housing Strategy and in the Programme for a Partnership Government is to increase social housing output in the immediate, medium and longer term.  To meet this objective, it is necessary to avail of a mixture of delivery mechanisms.  In the immediate term, the acquisition of homes and the refurbishment of vacant local authority dwellings offer quick solutions to accommodate households on the waiting list.  Leasing and renting also offer much needed immediate supply. </p><p>Over 13,000 social housing units were delivered in 2015, the first full year of implementation of the Social Housing Strategy.  This represents an 86% increase in unit delivery above 2014, which was achieved in a very difficult operating environment and represents a good start to the Strategy&rsquo;s implementation.  The targets for 2016 are again ambitious and I expect that over 17,000 social housing units will be provided this year, 1,500 of which are targeted to be delivered through the main capital supply programmes for the construction and acquisition of houses/apartments by both local authorities and approved housing bodies (AHBs).</p><p>Following from the substantial announcements of new social housing projects made in May 2015, in July 2015 and in January 2016, we now have a strong pipeline of new social housing construction, acquisition and turnkey approvals in place.  Between these three announcements, almost &euro;680 million has been allocated for over 3,900 social housing new builds, turnkey developments and acquisitions.  Details of these approvals are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:</p><p><i></i><i></i></p><p><i></i><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p>It is these projects that will form the majority of the social housing units to be constructed between now and 2018.  I am keen that local authorities advance these as soon as possible, but I recognise that all projects must proceed through the planning process and this and other factors have a direct impact on the timing for the advancement and the delivery of the approved construction projects.</p><p>While construction activity is ramping up, local authorities are using other approaches to deliver new social housing units in the more immediate term, including acquiring properties, with over 1,000 new social housing units secured through that approach in 2015 alone, and working with developers to build and acquire new &lsquo;turnkey developments&rsquo;.</p><p>The ongoing rapid-delivery housing programme will provide 500 units for homeless families across Dublin who are currently residing in commercial hotels.  22 units have been completed in Ballymun and another 131 units will be completed in the Dublin City area by end-2016.  A further 350 units will be provided across the four Dublin authorities, with commencement on sites in quarters 3 and 4 of 2016 - these units are to be procured through a national procurement framework overseen by the Office for Government Procurement, which will be available by end-Summer and will also be available to all local authorities nationally for procurement of rapid-delivery units. </p><p>An enhanced role for AHBs in the provision of new supply is also central to the Government&rsquo;s vision for the provision of social housing supports under the Social Housing Strategy.  The Strategy will see the continuation and improvement of the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF), with amendments made to accelerate delivery and assist AHBs in accessing private or Housing Finance Agency (HFA) finance for the purchase, construction or refurbishment of social housing units. The changes recognise the shift in investment required by AHBs towards construction and acquisition of new builds.  Under this mechanism of local authority and AHB collaboration, a strong pipeline of new units was developed in 2015, with approval provided for 600 units to be built or purchased by AHBs in the period 2016-2017.</p></reply>

The aim of the Scheme is to improve the living and working environment in small rural town and village communities and enhance their potential to support increased economic activity into the future.  The Scheme will be delivered by Local Authorities in conjunction with local communities and development organisations as part of a concerted effort to support the sustainable and coordinated development of rural towns and villages.  While the precise mechanisms for the selection of projects and the approval of funding have yet to be finalised, I can assure the Deputy that the selection process will be open and transparent and in that context it is not possible, at this time, to say what towns will be awarded funding under the<b></b>Town and Village Renewal Scheme. </p><p>It should be noted that my Department is also contributing to the work of the Retail and Town Centre Revival Working Group, which is overseen by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, as part of the Retail Consultation Forum.  This Working Group is developing a framework for town centre revival, which can be used by towns and villages to support business growth and job creation. </p></reply>

The position of these tenants is significantly improved by the change, which commenced on 7 April 2016, as they now benefit from the following: </p><p>-Increased security of tenure; </p><p>-  Access to Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) dispute resolution procedures, including free mediation; </p><p>-  Binding obligations on AHBs as landlords to, inter alia, register all tenancies, keep dwellings in good repair and allow peaceful occupation. </p><p>AHB tenants will automatically gain these rights under Part IV of the Act 6 months after registration of their tenancy with the RTB. </p><p>The Act provides that tenancies may only be terminated in cases where: </p><p>-  A tenant is non-compliant with their obligations; </p><p>-  A landlord wishes to sell the property or requires the property for their own use of use by a family member; </p><p>-  A landlord wishes to refurbish the property; </p><p>-  A landlord wishes to change the use of the dwelling.</p><p>AHB tenants also benefit from amendments introduced under the 2015 Act to significantly strengthen the protections around tenancy terminations by placing strict controls on the process by which a tenancy can be terminated.  These measures involve, inter alia: </p><p>-  A landlord having to explain in a written statement to the tenant why a property might no longer be suitable to their accommodation needs having regard to the number of bed-spaces and the size and composition of the household; and, </p><p>-  A landlord having to make a statutory declaration as to their intention to sell a property. </p><p>Moreover, tenancies may be terminated only by means of a formal notice<b></b>of termination, regardless of why the termination is happening.  The 2015 Act also increased the notice period for termination so that a landlord will now have to give a tenant up to a maximum of 224 days notice for tenancies of 8 years or more. </p></reply>

These Plans set out the broad objective for the regeneration of these areas, following from the publication of the Fitzgerald Report in April 2007.  The publication of the Limerick Regeneration Masterplan - A Vision for Moyross, Southill/Ballinacurra Weston and St. Mary's Park - followed in October 2008.  The strategies and actions developed in this Master plan built on the Vision Plans and were shaped to respond to the extensive and complex problems of the estates.   </p>  <p>  The Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan was launched in September 2013 and following from the Masterplan, it provides the roadmap for the physical, social and economic regeneration of the areas over the coming years.

The most recent review of local electoral areas was carried out from November 2012 to May 2013 by a Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee established under the Local Government Act 1991.  There is no constitutional or legislative requirement for the revision of local electoral areas.  I am not in a position to indicate, at this stage, when a review of local electoral areas might next be undertaken.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s decision to replace town authorities with a new model of municipal governance was designed to strengthen local government within counties and to address widely acknowledged and long-standing weaknesses and anomalies in the previous system, including divided administration between town and county authorities, for example, in relation to matters such as planning, rating and charges.</p><p>Municipal districts and borough districts, where they arise, now cover the entire territory of each county, reflecting European norms, removing outdated boundaries and ending the anomaly of small towns having municipal status and dual representation, while some larger centres and rural areas lacked any sub-county governance.  As well as creating a more rational and comprehensive structural arrangement, the new system will over time result in more effective and community-focused decision making and implementation.  Moreover, under the new arrangements, there is full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms.  In 2015, after one full year of the operation of municipal districts, a broadly based Advisory Group was convened to carry out a review of their operation, in conjunction with a Local Government Forum for engagement with the Association of Irish Local Government.  Feedback from these deliberations and from surveys of local authority members and chief executives suggests that the revised structures are generally operating well but will need more time to bed down fully. </p><p><b></b>The Programme for a Partnership Government includes the preparation of a report for Government and the Oireachtas by mid-2017 on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability and to ensure that local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy.</p></reply>

The WSSP outlines the strategic direction for Irish Water over the short, medium and long-term time frames up to 2040. It identifies and prioritises the key objectives required to ensure that smaller towns and villages are appropriately supported by water services infrastructure.  Irish Water published the WSSP in October 2015 and this is available online at: <i></i>.</p><p>Irish Water's Capital Investment Plan (CIP) 2014-2016 outlines a number of priorities to be delivered including improving water quality, tackling leakage, improving capacity and investing for economic development and it identifies where Irish Water considers investment in infrastructure is necessary for the effective performance of its functions.  This plan is available online at: <i> </i></p><p>A successor CIP has been prepared by Irish Water and the Commission for Energy Regulation is expected to issue a consultation paper on this plan later this year. </p><p>During 2015, my Department established a working group involving key stakeholders in the rural water sector to address the development of the sector within the overall water reform programme to ensure that the programme responds effectively to current and future needs.  Local authorities, the Water Services Transition Office, Irish Water, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and my Department are represented on the working group.  One of the tasks of the group is to ensure that there is appropriate integration of the Department's Rural Water Programme and Irish Water's Capital Investment Programme so as to fully support rural development and address any environmental issues that may arise.</p><p>The working group is also considering a number of areas where there are potential boundary issues with Irish Water or legacy issues which need to be addressed and new approaches in this area will be informed by a number of demonstration projects or pilot schemes, including in relation to the provision of new group sewerage schemes by communities. </p><p>In January 2016, my Department wrote to local authorities advising them of the new approach to the funding of group water and sewerage schemes for 2016 and beyond under the rural water programme.  This will ultimately lead to the development of appropriate prioritised lists of schemes for funding and a series of demonstration projects which will assist in further evolving the programme of investment.

The Strategy set out a broad framework for use in spatial planning by regional and local authorities as well as the planning of investment by the public and private sectors in providing infrastructure such as roads, public transport, energy and communications links.  The NSS has influenced two National Development Plans and continues to be a key reference document in planning legislation.

Compliance with the building regulations is first and foremost the responsibility of the owners, designers and builders of the building concerned.  As Minister, I have no function in assessing, checking or testing compliance, or otherwise, of specific works or developments.</p>  <p>  Remediation of defects is a matter between the parties concerned, the current owners and the builder/developer, their agents and their insurers.  This applies also where the owner is a Local Authority or an Approved Housing Body, both of which are relevant in the context of a number of properties at Ceol na Mara.  If a satisfactory resolution cannot be achieved through dialogue and negotiation, the option of seeking civil legal remedy may be considered. It is understood that the builder/developer in this instance is in receivership and it is therefore important that the receiver is notified of all liabilities at the earliest possible opportunity. </p>  <p>  The Local Authority&rsquo;s overriding concern in these matters is one of public safety and its statutory functions (under Planning, Building Control, Fire Safety and Housing legislation) relate to the enforcement of compliance with statutory obligations.  The Local Authority is not responsible for undertaking remedial works in private dwellings.  Nevertheless, its advice and support can be helpful in such situations and, as Minister, I expect Waterford City and County Council to continue to do whatever is reasonable and appropriate to support the residents at Ceol na Mara.

All discharges to the aquatic environment from sewerage systems owned, managed and operated by Irish Water require a waste water discharge licence or certificate of authorisation from the Environ mental Protection Agency (EPA) and the authorisation process provides for the EPA to place stringent conditions on the operation of such discharges to ensure that potential effects on the receiving water bodies are strictly limited and controlled.</p><p>In relation to the pollution of water courses, the primary responsibility for ensuring prevention of pollution rests with the local authorities, which are in turn supervised by the EPA for this purpose.

Any persons causing or permitting polluting matter to enter waters is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding &euro;15,000,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or both. </p><p>The EPA is the statutory body for investigating complaints of pollution and for the enforcement , both directly and through oversight of local authorities, of environmental legislation in Ireland.

A scheme exists whereby a local authority (LA) can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (LA- mortgage-to-rent).  The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB-mortgage-to-rent). Both schemes assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.</p><p>Identical maximum house value limits apply under both MTR schemes.  Specifically, properties should be of a value no more than &euro;350,000 for a house and &euro;300,000 for an apartment or townhouse in the areas of Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Louth, Cork and Galway; and &euro;250,000 for a house and &euro;190,000 for an apartment or townhouse in the rest of the country.  Priorities must adhere to the most up-to-date acquisition cost guidelines set by my Department.</p><p>In addition, for both types of MTR the property must be in negative equity. However, a property that may have marginal positive equity may be considered for inclusion in either schemes where that equity is no more than 10% of the Open Market Value to a maximum of &euro;20,000 in Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Louth, Cork and Galway and &euro;15,000 in the rest of the country.</p><p>Information in relation to local authority mortgage arrears, the local authority mortgage arrears resolution process (MARP) and the help available to borrowers is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website: <i></i><i></i></p><p>I can confirm that the MARP and the MTR for local authority borrowers are available on an identical basis for both full annuity local authority mortgage holders and Shared Ownershipborrowers in mortgage arrears. </p></reply>

The Programme further provides that we will investigate with all stakeholders how credit unions can support the delivery of social housing.  The Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) has set out a proposed means by which funding could be provided to Approved Housing Bodies, by credit unions, for the development of social housing.  My Department has met with the ILCU on a number of occasions to address technical aspects of its proposal.  The most recent meeting was on 13 April 2016.</p><p>The Central Bank commenced a number of new regulations for credit unions on 1 January 2016.  Prior to their commencement, following careful consideration, the Central Bank made a number of modifications including to Regulation 25(2) which makes reference to the fact that the Central Bank may prescribe, in accordance with section 43 of the Credit Union Act 1997, further classes of investments for credit unions which may include investments in projects of a public nature.  The effect of these modifications is that regulation 25(2) now provides that investment in projects of a public nature can include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.</p><p>I acknowledge the modifications made by the Central Bank and the willingness of credit unions to actively seek a role in financing the delivery of social housing.</p><p>Conscious of the independence of the Central Bank in its regulatory role in respect of credit unions, bilateral engagement has taken place between my Department and the Department of Finance to consider the potential regulatory and legislative implications of credit union involvement in the social housing sector.</p><p>My Department and the Department of Finance met with the Central Bank on 21 April 2016 to provide information of a technical nature in relation to social housing funding arrangements.  This was with a view to assisting the Central Bank in understanding how these arrangements operate, as it deals with issues arising from proposals put forward for credit union investment in social housing.</p><p>Ultimately, the funding mechanisms will have to be put in place in the first instance by the ILCU with the support of its members , and with the agreement of the Central Bank.  I and my Department are happy to continue to contribute to this process by providing necessary technical advice and support. </p></reply>

The project was delivered by the Walkinstown Association for People with an Intellectual Disability (WALK).</p>  <p>  The objective of the DACT programme was to explore a variety of routes towards ensuring that people with disabilities were enabled to avail of progression, education and development opportunities within the world of work.  A key criterion applied when selecting projects was that the learning from this activity should be capable, where appropriate, of being mainstreamed in the future.  Therefore, it is important to note that the projects were never intended to become ongoing service delivery organisations in their own right, no matter how successful the projects might have been. </p>  <p>  It was on this basis that each of the DACT projects was awarded funding with a specified end date of 30 April 2015.  However, in the closure phase of the programme, it was recognised by the Department that there would be a number of people still actively participating on some of the DACT projects, so a decision was made to provide funding to seven of the projects, which included the WALK PEER project, for a short period to the end of July 2015.  This funding was provided so as to allow projects to ensure that their participants finished their involvement in an orderly manner. </p>  <p>  I understand that the WALK PEER project was subsequently successful in obtaining additional funding from a private sector organisation and I believe that it is this source of support that will terminate in July. </p>  <p>  Given the circumstances set out above, there is no provision in the Department's estimates to provide further funding to this project.</p></reply>

The person concerned was eligible to participate under the part time job (PTJ) option within CE, which allows persons over 55 years of age to participate on CE for a lifetime maximum of 6 years.</p>  <p>  In addition to these 6 years, the CE Procedures Manual also provides that "Eligible persons in receipt of a qualifying disability-linked Social Welfare payment will be eligible for one additional year on CE over the standard maximum participation caps, i.e. 7 years maximum time for those between 55 years of age and State Pension age (PTJ Option only)."</p>  <p>  As the person concerned was in receipt of a Disability Allowance prior to commencing on CE they are eligible to participate on CE for a lifetime maximum of 7 years and will have completed 7 years on Community Employment on 03 June 2016.  Therefore they are not eligible to participate on CE beyond that date.</p>  <p>  While the Service Support Stream was introduced to CE, on a pilot basis, for persons over 62 years of age, the person concerned will not reach 62 years of age until 01 May 2017.  Therefore, they will not be eligible to avail of a Service Support Stream employment post on any CE Scheme, until June 2017 at the earliest, as they will be required to be in receipt of a qualifying DSP Payment for a minimum period of 12 months before they can be again eligible to apply for such a job. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits, as appropriate.  This targeted approach has assisted over 8,000 rent supplement households nationwide to retain or acquire rented accommodation through increased rent payments, of which 69 households are in Kerry.

Only one allowance is paid per household.  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance as part of the household benefits package to approximately 419,000 customers, at an estimated cost of &euro;228 million in 2016.  Increasing the spending on any of these schemes would have budgetary consequences requiring additional funds, and I am not in a position to do this at the present time. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources &ndash; this may include exceptional heating costs.  </p>  <p>  The best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling.  My Department works closely with the new Department of Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources on these issues and in moving forward the actions agreed in the Energy Affordability Strategy.  In that regard, the Better Energy Homes scheme provides support towards the installation of attic and wall insulation, and heating system upgrades.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It also provides for balance between the paying members, deferred members and drawing members (pensioners) of a pension scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Pensions Act, the Minister for Social Protection must make Regulations specifying the percentage which will determine the amount by which a preserved pension benefit is to be increased or decreased in the revaluation year.  Making these Regulations is a legislative requirement and an obligation on the Minister and there is no discretion not to set the percentage where there has been a change in the level of consumer prices during the year.  Under these provisions, the Occupational Pension Schemes (Revaluation) Regulations, 2016 were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the 8th of April 2016.  </p>  <p>  A person who leaves employment, and who has been a member of their former employer&rsquo;s defined benefit pension scheme, may choose to either leave their accrued pension rights in the scheme of their former employer or transfer their rights to another vehicle which can accrue pension rights.  Where the person chooses to leave their pension rights in the scheme of their former employer, and thereby becomes a deferred member of the scheme, legislation safeguards their rights in the scheme.  Part of this protection is ensuring that their pension value is preserved and revalued annually to keep pace with changes in the annual rate of Consumer Price Inflation.  This maintains the spending power of these pension entitlements to a reasonable level.  </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012 provided for a change to amend the imbalanced situation where static or decreasing wage rates impacted on employees&rsquo; potential pension benefits but not on the value of deferred members&rsquo; pensions.  The anomaly had arisen because the annual revaluation for deferred scheme members was limited to a lower floor of 0%. This floor was removed, and the revaluation of deferred members&rsquo; benefits now tracks both negative and positive changes in the annual rate of the Consumer Price Index.  2015 is the first time the revaluation percentage has been negative, resulting in an adjustment of -0.3% to deferred member&rsquo;s prospective pension benefits.  However, it is worth noting that since 2009, the overall change in the revaluation percentage for deferred members has been positive at 4.5%.</p>  <p>  It may be noted that the regulations cater for minimum standards.  Scheme trustees, should the scheme rules allow it, are not precluded from applying revaluation rates that would be more beneficial to members where the scheme has the capacity to do so.  For example, trustees may decide not to apply the negative revaluation for 2015.  It should also be noted that these measures will not have any impact on former scheme members where the scheme has already wound up.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The original debt amounted to &euro;21,931.11 and the balance as at 10 May 2016 is &euro;18,555.11.  At the time the debt was assessed, the person in question availed of her right to appeal the revised decision which gave rise to the overpayment.  Following consideration of all aspects of the case, an appeals officer (AO) disallowed the appeal and the person in question was informed of this outcome and the reason(s) for it.  The decision of an AO is final and conclusive in the absence of fresh facts or evidence.</p>  <p>  The department is obliged to recoup any debt owing to it in an appropriate and timely manner.  The method of recovery of an overpayment and negotiations regarding the amount recoverable are dealt with under the department&rsquo;s code of practice for overpayments.  A person who is repaying a debt may request the department to review their repayment schedule, however repayment schedules are not appealable to the SWAO.</p>  <p>  The person concerned has been in contact with my department requesting a review of the schedule of recovery of her debt.  The repayment of her debt was temporarily suspended pending receipt of further information.  Following a discussion with the person in question, the department has agreed to reduce the weekly repayment of the debt from &euro;28.20 per week to &euro;7.70 per week with effect from 11 May 2016.  Of course, reducing the weekly rate of repayment will extend the period over which full recovery of the debt will be achieved.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-17a.1360.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051700068#WRS03700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 482, 497 and 523 together.</p><p>The Government recognises the importance of increasing participation in employment for persons with a disability.  To this end, the Department of Social Protection provides a wide range of work related supports, which in 2015 cost an estimated &euro;37 million solely for persons with a disability.</p><p>Any young person with a disability is at all times free to avail of the INTREO service on a voluntary basis and a complete range of activation supports for people with disabilities is available at Intreo Centres.</p><p>Under the Youth Guarantee the main innovation in dealing with young people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments relates to earlier engagement with this group than is normal under the general activation arrangements for unemployed people through INTREO.  This means that young people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments are referred to a caseworker, and are engaged with more systematically in terms of their rights and responsibilities, at an earlier date than older unemployed people.  For such young jobseekers, engagement with activation measures through the Intreo service is a mandatory condition for continued receipt of welfare payments.</p><p>It was already the situation in respect of young people with disabilities who present at a DSP office needing activation/intervention type supports that they were referred immediately to a caseworker within Intreo or at the Local Employment Service (LES).  There was thus no need to apply the new engagement arrangements to young people with disabilities as they were already in place.  For such young persons in receipt of disability/illness support payments, engagement with the Intreo service is, however, on a voluntary basis, and is not a condition of receipt of such payments.</p><p>A caseworker working with a young person with a disability can arrange access for that young client to the full range of services and programmes that are available to young people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments.  This includes access to programmes such as JobBridge, the Back to Education Allowance, and Solas training for unemployed people.  The Department is also currently considering how people with disabilities might best be included in any future iteration of the Momentum programme.</p><p>Over and above these general programmes, a caseworker dealing with a young person with a disability can arrange access to a range of additional services and supports that are specific to people with disabilities and are not available to other young jobseekers.  These are described in detail below.</p><p>In the light of the enhanced existing arrangements already in place, I am satisfied that young people with disabilities already have access to a full range of supports and services.</p><p>Specific employability supports for people with disabilities</p><p>EmployAbility</p><p>EmployAbility is an open labour market initiative providing disabled people with supports to help them access the open labour market.  It is implemented by sponsor organisations (EmployAbility) on behalf of DSP who employ Job Coaches to provide a range of supports tailored to the individual needs of a jobseeker.  The ultimate objective is that the employee becomes independent of Job Coach support.</p><p>The Supported Employment Service under EmployAbility is an employment and recruitment service to assist people with a disability to secure and maintain a job in the open labour market.  This Supported Employment Service provides a range of supports to employers and people with a disability, through Job Coaches.  The range of supports includes: </p><p>-  Individual Needs Assessment</p><p>-  Vocational Profiling and Career Planning</p><p>-  Individual Employment Plan</p><p>-  Job Sourcing and Job Matching</p><p>-  On-the-Job Support and Coaching</p><p>-  Advice and Support to Employers</p><p>-  Follow-up Support and Mentoring to both Employers &amp;amp; Employees.</p><p>The Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS)</p><p>The purpose of this demand - led programme is to increase the numbers of people with disabilities participating in the open labour market.  WSS provides financial incentives to employers, outside the public sector, to employ disabled people who work more than 20 hours per week.  The Scheme is structured in three strands.  The employer can benefit from one or all, simultaneously.</p><p>Strand I subsidy - is a general subsidy for any perceived productivity shortfall in excess of 20% for a disabled person, in comparison to a non-disabled peer.  An employee must work a minimum of 21 hours per week up to a maximum of 39 hours per week.  The rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour and is based on the number of hours worked, giving a total annual subsidy available of &euro;10,748 per annum based on 39 hour week.</p><p>Strand II - is based on the total number of disabled employees in a company, an employer can apply for a grant to cover additional costs ranging from an additional 10% for 3-6 employees to a maximum of 50% of the wage subsidy for 23+ disabled employees.</p><p>Strand III - is where 30 or more disabled people are employed, employers can avail of a grant of &euro;30,000 per annum to assist with the cost of employing an Employment Assistance Officer.</p><p>Unlike other recruitment subsidies such as JobsPlus, WSS is payable indefinitely as long as the disabled person remains in the employment concerned.  New Applicants for WSS who are currently on Disability Allowance may apply for DA Disregard in conjunction with the WSS provided the minimum 21 working hours per week WSS threshold is maintained.</p><p>Disability Support/Awareness</p><p>A number of different employment supports for people with disabilities are provided for under this heading.</p><p>A. Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant</p><p>B. Job Interview\Personal Reader Grant</p><p>C. Employee Retention Grant Scheme.</p><p>D. Disability Awareness Support Scheme</p><p>Community Employment</p><p>The CE eligibility requirements for people with disabilities are not as demanding as for other Job seeker groups so as to encourage participation.  Those on job-seekers&rsquo; payments generally must be aged over 25 and on a payment for a year or more.  Effectively a person in receipt of DA who is aged 18 or over can be in receipt of their payment for 1 week and be eligible for CE.</p><p>Specialist Training Providers</p><p>Apart from having access to the full range of training programmes for unemployed people provided through Solas, people with disabilities also have access to Specialist Training Programme provision specific to their needs.  Key additional features of specialist vocational training, as compared with programmes for the generality of unemployed job-seekers, include:</p><p>- additional training duration</p><p>- adapted equipment</p><p>- transport arrangements</p><p>- enhanced programme content</p><p>- trainer-learner ratio</p><p>- qualifications of staff</p><p>- additional opportunities for assessment</p><p>- individualised approach.</p></reply>

To date, JobBridge has attracted the voluntary participation of over 46,500 interns, with almost 4,000 people currently on internships.</p><p>There are strict terms and conditions which host organisations must comply with in order to participate in the scheme.  Failure to comply with these terms and conditions can result in imposition of sanctions against the organisation &ndash; typically suspension from participation in the scheme for an appropriate duration having regard to the nature of the breach.</p><p>To date random on-site inspections by Department staff found that the overwhelming majority of internships offered under JobBridge comply with the terms and conditions of the scheme with just 86<b></b>(less than 0.5%)<b></b>of host organisations being suspended<b></b>from participation for varying durations.  This represents a tiny fraction of the almost 19,000 organisations who have participated in the scheme.  There are no organisations currently suspended from participation in the JobBridge scheme.</p><p>The number of interns in organisations that were subsequently disqualified (by year and employment sector) since the scheme was established is set out in Table 1.</p><p>As at 1 April, 2016, 42,619 people had completed internships.  15,211 progressed <i>immediately</i>into employment on conclusion of the internship - 9,525 with the host organisation and 5,686 with a different organisation.  This represents a progression rate of 36%.  An annual breakdown of this is set out in Table 2.</p><p>Analysis of progression rates at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post completion is not available; however, an independent evaluation conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants (Report 2013) indicated that progression to employment rate increased to 61% within 5 months or more of completion of an internship.  This compares very favourably to similar schemes across the EU, where the average progression rate is 34%.</p><p>The number of persons who have participated in the JobBridge National Internship Scheme and the number who dropped out before completion, by county and by year, can be found in Tables 3, 4 and 5.</p><p>JobBridge internships last for 6 or 9 months.  Just under half (46%) of all internships finish early - for a variety of reasons.  Almost half (49%) of early-finishers say it is to take up employment and a further 7% go on to further education, training or another internship.  About 30% leave for a variety of personal, domestic or health reasons.  14% leave early because they did not find the internship suitable, which is not surprising given that, for many, JobBridge is a first-chance opportunity and sometimes participants find that the particular career direction is not for them.  The Department continues to work with them to support them with a range of alternative pathways to work.</p><p><b>Table 1. &ndash; The number of recipients which were participating on schemes in companies that were subsequently disqualified, by year and by employment sector since the scheme was established. </b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Sector</th><th>No of interns</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>CHEMICALS MANUFACTURING</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLOTHING &amp;amp;

However, if the person concerned commenced employment and was working a minimum of 19 hours per week (or 38 hours per fortnight), they may qualify for FIS.  If the person was working the required hours and receiving the minimum wage of &euro;9.15, this would equate to &euro;173.85 per week.  They may also be entitled to 60 per cent of the difference between the weekly family income and a weekly income limit for the family size.  In this example, the person would be entitled to an additional payment of &euro;202.29, bringing the weekly income to &euro;376.14. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, it is more beneficial for the person concerned to be employed and claiming FIS rather than staying on JST.</p></reply>

My Department is committed to ensuring that a customer service ethos is embedded in everything it does and is embraced by everyone in the organisation.  Significant effort is made to ensure that the highest levels of customer service standards are achieved by both individual staff members and as an organisation.  There is a strong focus on customer service training which is included in a range of course made available to staff across the Department.</p>  <p>  The Department employs a variety of mechanisms aimed at ensuring it delivers the highest levels of service to its customers.  These mechanisms include customer surveys, consultation with customer representative groups, as well as seeking feedback from customers on ways in which service provision and delivery can be improved through the Department&rsquo;s Comments and Complaints system.</p>  <p>  If a customer is dissatisfied with the standard of service they have received from the Department, they can make a complaint to the Quality Customer Service Team.  Their complaint will be dealt with promptly, fairly and impartially.  If the complaint remains unresolved, the customer has the right of further appeal to the Office of the Ombudsman.   </p>  <p>  The Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour sets out the standards required of all civil servants in the discharge of their duties.  These standards of behaviour and values support a high quality public service, based on high levels of personal performance and responsibility.</p>  <p>  Where a member of staff of my Department is found to have breached the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour, Departmental policies, or engaged in inappropriate behaviour, the matter is dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Service Disciplinary Code.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Given this I have no plans to request additional funding under the European Social Fund funding for the Community Employment scheme.</p></reply>

These supports play an important role in supporting increased participation in the labour force by people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  Work-related supports include:</p>  <p>  -  the EmployAbility service (formerly the Supported Employment Programme) which facilitates the integration of people with disabilities into paid employment in the open labour market; and </p>  <p>  -  a number of other supports specifically for employers; (the Wage Subsidy Scheme - which pays an employer a subsidy for employing a person with a disability; the Work Equipment Adaptation Grant, the Employee Retention Grant, and the Disability Awareness Scheme). </p>  <p>  For those who are in receipt of invalidity pension or illness benefit (for at least six months) and who feel they now have some capacity for work, the partial capacity benefit (PCB) scheme allows them to work and retain a portion of their social welfare payment. </p>  <p>  In line with its commitments in Pathways to Work 2016-2020, the Department has extended full activation support to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service and has trained in excess of 60 employment support officers in the Intreo service in the  provision of employment supports to people with disabilities.  Any person with a disability is at all times free to contact the Intreo service. </p>  <p>  Unlike job-seekers where participation in activation measures through the Intreo service is mandatory, in the case of persons in receipt of disability/illness support payments, engagement with the Intreo service is on a voluntary basis.</p>  <p>  In terms of mainstream provision, people with a disability can access activation programmes - for example, SOLAS training courses, Community Employment schemes and JobBridge.  For those previously receiving a social welfare payment, they will either retain that payment or move to a training allowance or temporary employment payment, depending on their individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Department also funds the WAM (Willing Able Mentoring) project, the objective of which is to bring graduates and employers together to promote access to the labour market for graduates with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  In addition to access to its mainstream provision, Solas also funds customised training for people with disabilities provided by a range of Specialist Training Providers.</p>  <p>  In short, the Government is committed to supporting as many people as possible to participate more fully in employment and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers they may encounter in finding and sustaining work employment</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-17a.1478.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051700069#WRT04500"><p>The rate of payment under the State pension (contributory) scheme is related to contributions paid over the years into the Social Insurance Fund, and credited contributions where applicable.  As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid at a higher rate under that scheme, than those with more intermittent contributions made during their working life.</p><p>There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory, whether at full or reduced level.  These include that the person must be aged 66 or over, and that they have at least 520 paid contributions, i.e., a <i>minimum</i>of 10 years.  Provided a person satisfies <i>all</i>the relevant conditions, they may qualify for a State pension contributory, the minimum personal rate of which is &euro;93.20, and the maximum personal rate of which is &euro;233.30.</p><p>The Deputy should note that there is no fixed amount of paid and/or credited contributions required which will qualify a person for a full-rate State pension (contributory).  The total amount of contributions a person will require also depends upon the duration over which they made these contributions, as both of these figures are used to calculate a person&rsquo;s &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions, upon which their rate of entitlement is based.  The payment of 520 contributions in itself does not, therefore, qualify someone for a 100% pension - rather it is the case that failure to have at least that many contributions paid will mean they will not qualify for a State pension (contributory) at any rate.</p><p>Since the contributory pension was introduced in 1961, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age).</p><p>Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a lower yearly average of 40 will qualify for a pension at the 98% rate.  Someone with a yearly average of only 10 may qualify for the minimum rate of &euro;93.20.  Averages are rounded up, e.g. where someone has a yearly average of 47.5, it is rounded up to 48.</p><p>It should also be noted that, where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p><p>It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the yearly average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes.  I believe that it is important that the changes be announced well in advance of introduction, to enable those affected to include the new factors into their retirement planning.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-17a.1512.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051700070#WRU01500"><p>The aim of the scheme is to help unemployed people break the cycle whereby they cannot get a job without experience, but cannot get experience without a job.  It caters for a wide variety of jobseekers - those with no previous work experience and unemployed workers who might want, or indeed need, to change career direction to avail of the job opportunities emerging in post-recession Ireland.</p>  <p>  Since the scheme was introduced almost 19,000 Host Organisations have provided internship opportunities to over 46,500 unemployed jobseekers.  There are at present c 4,000 jobseekers engaged in JobBridge internships.  Independent research indicates that circa 60% of these went on to get paid employment within a short period (5 months) of completing an internship.  This compares very favourably with similar schemes across the EU where the average rate is 34%.  The independent research also indicated that just 10% of participants rated the scheme negatively and that over two thirds of participants would recommend the scheme to a friend or family member.  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that JobBridge is entirely voluntary.  In order to attract potential interns, Host Organisations must provide opportunities that appeal to jobseekers, if they don&rsquo;t jobseekers simply won&rsquo;t apply.  Jobseekers are not under any obligation to participate in JobBridge and those who commence an internship can finish their internship at any time with no penalty of any type. </p>  <p>  There are a number of measures in place to minimise abuse of the scheme.  First, potential Host Organisations must meet strict terms and conditions in order to participate in the scheme.  All applications are screened on receipt and those that fail to meet the requirements are rejected.  </p>  <p>  Second, a Standard Agreement outlining the key duties and hours of the internship placement along with the associated skills, knowledge and learning development to be acquired by the intern.  This must be agreed and signed by both the Host Organisation and intern at the outset of the internship. </p>  <p>  Third, compliance reports/checks must be completed by the Host Organisation and submitted to the Department.  </p>  <p>  Fourth, to ensure that Host Organisations are abiding by the terms of the scheme, the Department operates a monitoring regime.  This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and random monitoring inspection visits. </p>  <p>  Over 12,500 monitoring visits have been conducted and 98% of these have been satisfactory. In a small number of cases (86) the Department was of the view that non-compliance by certain organisations warranted a decision to debar them from further participation in the scheme, or to suspend them participation for varying durations depending on the nature of the transgression.  This represents less than 0.5% of Host Organisations participating in the scheme.</p>  <p>  A second independent evaluation of JobBridge is currently underway to examine the effectiveness of scheme to date and to inform if and how it should be modified to improve outcomes and/or address any issues which are identified in the evaluation.  The evaluation comprises a detailed econometric study and comprehensive surveys of host organisation and intern experience.  The Department expects the full evaluation to be completed and report published in September 2016.</p></reply>

Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.976 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approx. 35% of overall expenditure.  Because of demographic changes, the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p>  <p>  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was estimated to provide annual savings of &euro;48 million.  These savings meant that the Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.  The Department will spend approximately &euro;227 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 418,000 customers. </p>  <p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen each year with the number of eligible customers also increasing significantly. In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum.  Each year almost 10,000 extra customers became eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients.</p>  <p>  In relation to estimating the cost of restoring the allowance for 2017, and approximating the average number of claimants in the region of 421,000, it is estimated that the cost would be in the region of &euro;48m for &euro;9.50 per month, and &euro;114m if &euro;22.50 per month.</p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years was given.  This has increased the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  I believe that, taken together with other changes, such as increasing the Christmas Bonus to 75% of weekly rate, the impact of the last Budget has been very positive for older people.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  State pensions account for the single largest block of social welfare expenditure, and while expenditure on pensions is increasing by approximately &euro;1 billion every five years because of demographic pressures, this is being successfully managed within the overall welfare budget.  In 2016, &euro;6.976 billion will be spent on pensions, which represents approx. 35% of the Department&rsquo;s total current expenditure.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p>  <p>  As provided for in Budget 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced.  These additional bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions. Those with a yearly average of 48 or more contributions receive a 100% pension, whereas, for example, those with only a yearly average of 20 contributions may qualify for a pension at 85% of the maximum rate.</p>  <p>  The net savings from this change would not be the same thing as the gross reduction in State pension (contributory) payments, as in some cases the person would instead qualify for a State pension (non-contributory), the maximum rate of which is 95% that of the contributory pension.  </p>  <p>  At the time this measure was introduced, the net exchequer savings arising were estimated to be in the region of &euro;2.8 million in 2013, &euro;5m in 2014 and &euro;8m in 2015.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. </p>  <p>  To qualify for a state pension (contributory) a person must have at least 520 paid contributions and satisfy a yearly average condition (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate State pension (contributory), and reduced rates of  payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages).  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. </p>  <p>  There is no single Pro Rata Contributory Pension.  However there are arrangements which operate on such a basis.  A mixed insurance pro-rata State pension is one of a number of alternative qualifying methods introduced to ensure that as many people as possible qualify for a State pension contributory.  This was introduced in 1991 and was designed to ensure that people who have contributed to the social insurance system at different rates receive a pension which reflects the proportion of full rate contributions which exists in their overall insurance record.  This pension is calculated by taking the total number of contributions (modified and full rate) a person has paid over their working life and applying the average contributions test to arrive at the rate which would be paid if all contributions were at the full rate.  The actual rate to be paid is determined by the proportion of full rate contributions in the overall record.  There are also pro-rata arrangements which may apply when calculating pensions due under international social security agreements.  The requirements to qualify for such pensions may depend upon the circumstances of the person and their insurance record in Ireland and abroad. </p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;222.</p></reply>

In addition, the decision maker must be satisfied that the residence is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant and that the rent payable is reasonable having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence. </p>  <p>  Where the children&rsquo;s housing and other basic needs are being met by the primary carer and the payment of a qualified child allowance is also being made to that individual, rent supplement would normally be payable at a single person&rsquo;s rate to the other parent.  However, in exceptional circumstances a supplement payable to the non-primary carer at a higher family rate may be considered, having regard to the particular circumstances of the family using statutory discretionary powers. </p>  <p>  In making a decision, Department officials are advised to consider any documentary evidence supporting the extent of the parent&rsquo;s involvement with the children, and consider the extent of the claimant&rsquo;s accommodation need, having regard to the custody arrangements and whether the children are dependent on the claimant for financial or material support.</p>  <p>  The Department engaged an external consultant to undertake a technical review of the rent supplement scheme in regards to its policy regarding separated parents.  The policy implications of the resultant report are under consideration by the Department.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The average waiting time for new carer's allowance (CA) applications at the end of March was 19 weeks.  The time take to process CA claims is  a consequence of continued strong claim intake and the delays in processing are frequently caused by the customer failing to fully complete the claim form or failing to attach the supporting documentation that is requested on the application form.  </p>  <p>  An in-depth Business Process Improvement (BPI) review has recently been completed for the CA scheme.  This project focused on optimising output, improving customer service and the elimination of backlogs. </p>  <p>  The outcome of this review is a detailed plan outlining the process required to manage both the continuous weekly intake and reduce the average waiting time.  The Department has introduced a number of measures to address the efficiency of claim processing for CA in light of the current waiting times, including the assignment of temporary and full-time staff and the facility to assign overtime working where appropriate.</p>  <p>  These measures will, lead to a reduction in the average waiting time.

The overall number of appeals received increased from an average of 15,000 per year up to 2009, to a peak of 35,500 in 2012, reducing annually thereafter to just below 25,000 in 2015.</p><p>Significant effort and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeals process in recent years:</p><p>-  Additional appeals officers were appointed to the office</p><p>-  An overhaul of the operating model was undertaken</p><p>-  New technology to support appeals officers was introduced</p><p>-  Work was undertaken with the Department to reduce delays in responding to requests from the appeals office for appeal submissions. </p><p>This resulted in a marked improvement in overall appeal processing times. The average time taken to determine an appeal requiring an oral hearing reduced from 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 25.5 weeks in 2015 and the average time taken to finalise an appeal decided by way of a summary decision dropped from 25.1 weeks in 2011 to 18.1 weeks in 2015.  This downward trend in overall appeal processing times has continued to date in 2016 to 24.3 weeks for an oral hearing and 17.3 weeks for a summary decision.  </p><p>The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved.  The system is designed to be flexible and fair and allows for review and submission of further information up to and including the oral hearing.  The time taken is proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal, which require a high level of judgement and often involve complex legal questions.</p><p>A number of elements within the process are time-consuming including the need to ensure due process, natural justice and compliance with the statutory obligation to obtain the Department&rsquo;s appeal submission.  If an oral hearing is requested by the appellant or is required to resolve conflicts, the processing time is prolonged.</p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer assures me that appeals processing times are continuously monitored and that, although significant progress has been made in reducing appeal processing times in recent years, continued improvement in this area remains a priority. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeals processing times by scheme 01/01/2015 &ndash;

The Short Term Enterprise Allowance provides immediate support to those who qualify for jobseekers benefit wishing to set up a business.  Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to jobseekers benefit.  The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are on social welfare payments to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment over two years - 100% in year 1 and 75% in year 2.  The BTWEA is generally available to persons who are on a qualifying social welfare payment for 12 months or longer.</p>  <p>  At the end of December 2015 there were 396 people availing of the Short Term Enterprise Allowance and 11,881 people availing of the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance, 6,543 of these were awarded in 2015.  To date in 2016 there are 395 availing of the Short Term Enterprise Allowance and 11,601 people availing of the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance, 2,022 of these were awarded in 2016.</p>  <p>  Before an application is approved business proposals must be recommended by a local development company or enterprise office.

I also want to condemn the continuing, deliberate denial of humanitarian relief to Daraya by the Assad regime in recent days. The targeting of a civilian population is a war crime.  I refer to UN Under-Secretary General Stephen O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s statement of 4 May 2016 in which he stated that all parties must finally and unequivocally live up to their obligations under international humanitarian law and the demands of this Council&rsquo;s resolutions, and asked the Security Council &ldquo;how much more suffering can we tolerate before there is a collective push towards an end to this senseless and shameful crisis&rdquo;.  I share the view that the United Nations, and in particular the UN Security Council, has the authority to act to protect the Syrian people from violence, in particular from the Assad regime and designated terrorist groups.  I call on the Security Council to act to end this violence and to protect the Syrian people.</p>  <p>  I have welcomed efforts by the UN and UN Security Council resolutions, including resolution 2254 of December 2015, to promote a political solution to the Syrian conflict, ensure humanitarian access for those in need and end the violence. It is clear that the Assad regime has failed to uphold its obligations and does so with impunity.</p>  <p>  I repeat Ireland&rsquo;s support for referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court by the UN Security Council.  This is the only means to ensure accountability for these crimes.  I deeply regret that the 2014 resolution calling for referral of the Syrian situation to the International Criminal Court was vetoed by Russia and China. </p></reply>

Governments and citizens across Europe continue to hold broadly positive views on the European Union.</p>  <p>  The EU, and Ireland as a Member State, engages with the big issues of the day, whether they relate to stability, jobs and growth, or to challenges external and internal, such as migration and international terrorism.  It is important to continue to engage with these issues at the EU-level if we are serious about addressing them.  Equally, our Union&rsquo;s positive image depends to a large degree on its ability to respond to these challenges in a way that commands public confidence. </p>  <p>  We must work both to ensure that the EU does its own work better and that it is better communicated to the public.  The Government has worked closely with the EU Institutions and our fellow Member States to put the citizen at the heart of the EU agenda for sustainable investment, growth and job creation.  The Juncker Commission has strengthened engagement with the public and is making good on its commitment to develop a Commission which is &lsquo;&rsquo;more ambitious on big things and more modest on little things&rsquo;&rsquo;, thus ensuring a focus on the areas where the EU can deliver value and allowing other matters to be regulated at the national level.  </p></reply>

Almost 60 million people are now displaced globally, the great majority of them fleeing from situations of conflict.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian response focuses on the most severe crises, in particular those that are protracted over many years and often forgotten.  The core objective of our assistance is to save and protect lives, alleviate suffering and maintain human dignity, before, during and in the aftermath of these crises.  We focus on where needs are greatest, with a strong commitment to the humanitarian principles of independence, neutrality, impartiality and respect for fundamental human rights.</p>  <p>  We are committed to working with a range of partners including non-governmental and UN organisations, and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.  These partners have the experience and capacity to deliver assistance to the most vulnerable communities in times of conflict. </p>  <p>  At a global level, Ireland is a major supporter of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which is often the best placed to provide assistance in conflict situations and gain access to areas where other organisations cannot operate, such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and South Sudan.  Last year, Ireland provided almost &euro;11 million to the ICRC to support its global operations in conflict contexts and we intend to continue this support in 2016. </p>  <p>  Through Irish Aid, the Government will provide over &euro;100 million in humanitarian assistance globally in 2016.  We are allocating resources across crisis-affected countries to support programmes which save lives, provide protection for people fleeing from conflict and support them to find livelihood opportunities in the communities and countries where they are currently hosted.</p></reply>

A programme of measures is in place in the Department&rsquo;s Consular Division and the Embassy in Paris, including additional staff resources and specialised training for relevant staff, in order to enhance our consular assistance capacity.  Officials from the reinforced Embassy team will be on the ground in Paris, Bordeaux and Lille in order to provide advice and emergency consular assistance to Irish citizens as required. </p><p>It is also very important to communicate key information and messages to the travelling fans so that they can better inform themselves and minimise any risks of inconvenience or distress.  To this end, on 18 April, I announced our &lsquo;First Eleven&rsquo; Travel Tips for Irish supporters, including advice about passports, security and safety, and local laws and conditions.  The full text can be found at .I encourage all citizens travelling to France to read these tips, check their passports are in date and arrange comprehensive travel insurance before they depart.  Also, I would urge all travelling fans to register their details on our Citizens&rsquo; Registration facility, also available through our website - - and to pay close attention to updates to the travel advice on the website. </p></reply>

We place a strong emphasis on aid transparency in the Government&rsquo;s development programme, which is managed by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Publishing data on aid activities allows the Irish public and the partners we work with in developing countries to know and understand the details and impact of our aid programmes, and it promotes better planning and greater accountability.</p>  <p>  In line with our policy commitment to aid transparency, we prepare a comprehensive Irish Aid annual report which is available to the public, and expenditure and budget data related to all programme activities are published on the Irish Aid website. </p>  <p>  The International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), which brings together aid donors and recipient countries, was launched in 2008.  Ireland has been actively involved from the outset.  An Aid Transparency Index is published annually, based on IATI standards.  The reasons behind Ireland&rsquo;s relatively low score in the Index are essentially technical, related to the frequency of our reporting.  Irish Aid aims to increase the frequency of its reporting over the coming period, which should result in an improved rating. </p>  <p>  Irish Aid also provides detailed statistical reports to the OECD. In the most recent review of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas aid programme by the OECD in 2014, it was noted that &ldquo;Ireland is one of the best performing donors when it comes to directing its development aid to the world&rsquo;s neediest countries&rdquo;.  It highlighted in particular Ireland&rsquo;s work on hunger in the poorest and most vulnerable countries and our commitment to high quality development aid that is seen to have a real impact.  Progress made in statistical reporting, and in publishing all evaluation and audit reports on our website was also acknowledged and praised by the OECD. </p></reply>

The policy is designed to take account of the complex variations in assignment duration and type, as well as the frequent changes of location between Ireland and posts abroad made by officers and their families.   Clearly it is important that officers and their families have access to adequate healthcare while serving the State abroad, often in difficult locations.</p>  <p>  Following the introduction of Lifetime Community Rating last year, late entry loadings now apply for people aged 35 and over when taking out domestic health insurance for the first time.

It has already been subject to demolition on number of occasions over many years, including destruction of caves and tents used by residents after their houses were destroyed.  The intention is clearly to drive the residents off the land and into the city of Hebron, so that their land can be used for expansion of nearby Israeli settlements.  We have discussed this case on a number of occasions in the D&aacute;il, and it is indeed a textbook example of the injustice which is an inherent element of the settlement project, and a powerful argument for the need to end the occupation.</p>  <p>  Ireland and our EU partners, together and nationally, have on many occasions made clear to the Israeli authorities our objections to this illegal and unacceptable behaviour.  This has included representations to the Ambassador and other Israeli officials here in Dublin, directly to the Israeli authorities in Jerusalem, and physical presence by Irish and EU diplomats at the village at times of particular threat. It is unfortunately not possible to ensure protection of all threatened communities all of the time. EU missions endeavour to keep alert to the situation in the village, but the threat of demolition is ever present.  The local community and concerned organisations are unaware of any specific heightened threat at this time.</p>  <p>  The other case raised by the Deputy is of a different nature.  This village is one of a number of unapproved settlements of Israeli Bedouins in the Negev area of southern Israel, particularly in the vicinity of the growing city of Beer Sheva.  Israeli authorities have been trying for some years to move some of these communities to new approved villages, as part of the planning for the expansion of Beer Sheva. </p>  <p>  This is a complex issue, and has been the subject of extensive political debate, legal processes and variations of planning within Israel.  There are indeed concerns about social disadvantage and unequal treatment experienced by Bedouin communities in Israel.  But there are similar concerns about the position of Bedouin in many Arab countries in the region, and indeed of marginalised communities in many countries, including in Europe.  The basis and scope for international action is accordingly less evident. </p></reply>

The Government therefore remains concerned about all reported cases of political imprisonment, including those in China.  My Department is however unaware of the case of the individual in question.</p>  <p>  Ireland and its partners in the EU have conveyed concern at the restrictions on expressions of Tibetan identity, which appear to be giving rise to a surge of discontent in the region.  While respecting China&rsquo;s territorial integrity, the EU has called upon the Chinese authorities to address the deep-rooted causes of the frustration of the Tibetan people to ensure that their civil, political, economic and social and cultural rights are respected, including their right to enjoy their own culture, to practise their own religion and to use their own language.</p>  <p>  The promotion of human rights is an important dimension of the EU&rsquo;s foreign policy, as enshrined in the Treaty of the European Union. Constructive dialogue remains the EU&rsquo;s preferred channel for working to improve the human rights situation in China.  Human rights are discussed as part of regular political dialogue as well as during specific human rights dialogues with China which have taken place since 1995.  The EU raised its concerns about the treatment of members of the Tibetan community at the most recent EU-China Summit in June 2015, and at the 34th EU-China Dialogue on Human Rights in November 2015 which Ireland attended.  On this occasion, individual Tibetan human rights cases were raised, and a list of Tibetan human rights defenders was presented to the Chinese side.  Individual cases were also raised with the Chinese authorities during the visit to China by the EU Special Representative for Human Rights Lambrinidis in November 2015.  Bilaterally, Ireland continues to convey its concerns about the human rights situation in China directly to the Chinese authorities through regular contacts in both Dublin and Beijing. </p>  <p>  Ireland together with our EU partners believes that constructive dialogue between the Chinese Government and the representatives of the Dalai Lama is the best way to address differences and tensions in Tibet and to reach a solution that respects Tibetan culture, language, religion and identity.  It is important for the long-term peace and stability of the region that the two sides come to an agreement on the future of Tibet.  To this end, we continue to encourage a resumption of meaningful dialogue. </p></reply>

Some of these had a noticeable political impact in Israel, but I have continued to argue at EU level that this has nonetheless clearly been insufficient to change Israeli policy on settlements, and that therefore the international community, including but not only the EU, needs to do more.</p>  <p>  Discussion at EU level on what further actions might be taken is a virtually continuous exercise, at official or Ministerial level, in Brussels, in capitals and in EU Missions in the region.  It would clearly be counterproductive to speculate publicly on what such actions might be, and would reduce the chances of achieving agreement on them.</p>  <p>  It is no secret, however, that these discussions are difficult.  Some partners are resistant to stronger actions, partly because of the many other crises in the region at this time including the horrific conflict in Syria and the threat posed by Da&rsquo;esh.</p>  <p>  Nationally, Ireland will continue to voice our own strong criticisms of the continuing occupation of Palestinian land and in particular of many of the policies on the ground which implement this.

The key points are to:</p><p>- check the validity of passports before booking a holiday, </p><p>- to remind that children&rsquo;s passports vary in length of validity</p><p>- apply at least six weeks before the intended date of travel</p><p>- choose the most appropriate application channel depending on the date of travel</p><p>- if travelling in three weeks or more (15 working days) the Passport Express channel is the cheapest and most convenient option. </p><p>- if travelling in three weeks or less an appointment for the Passport Office in Dublin or Cork should be made online at www.passportappointments.ie.</p><p>I strongly recommend that citizens check their passport validity before booking holidays or business travel and apply for the service which will ensure passports arrive in good time.  Allowing six weeks turnaround time is considered best practice.</p></reply>

The purpose of the new guidelines and procedures are to ensure that engaging with government procurement is easy and low cost. In line with the objectives of Circular 10/14, the lots were designed to facilitate the participation of SMEs.  The National Framework Agreement was structured into 10 sectoral lots, including 5 regional lots for the HSE and each lot was for commonly used products. This lotting structure was designed to deliver efficiency, value for money, reduce duplication and mitigate any undue risks on the State, whilst still supporting SME participation.   </p>  <p>  Collaborative consortia bids were encouraged by the OGP thereby further facilitating SMEs' participation.</p>  <p>  As previously advised five companies were appointed to the National Framework Agreement and four of the companies are SMEs based in Dublin, Cork, Monaghan and Galway.

The CSO contends that due to the reasons outlined below that the officer's previous work experience as Clerical Officer is not relevant to the grade of Temporary Census Field Supervisor.</p>  <p>  The CSO considers the post of Temporary Census Field Supervisor to be a specialised post unique to the CSO.  Every 5 years the CSO runs its own open recruitment competition specifically to select persons for this role as none of the Public Appointment Service General Service panels are appropriate for the requirements of this role.</p>  <p>  Successful applicants are contracted to work as Temporary Census Field Supervisor on a 20 week fixed purpose contract basis. In addition, the remuneration package reflects the uniqueness of the post of Temporary Census Field Supervisor, comprising a weekly rate of pay equating to the first point of the modified Clerical Officer pay scale, plus the following additional payments comprising a weekly supervisory allowance, an atypical working allowance plus an end of contract performance-related allowance. This payment package is unique to the post of the Census Field Supervisor and is in recognition of the specialised nature of the work. In addition, all appointees to the post have to undergo comprehensive in-house CSO training to meet the requirements of the role.</p></reply>

The group is chaired by Mr. Paul Quinn, Chief Procurement Officer, and is focused on monitoring the delivery of the procurement commitments under the Action Plan for Jobs and to develop further strategies to improve SME access to procurement.  In addition, the OGP Policy Director chairs the SME Working Group which brings together the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland, the Competition Authority and InterTrade Ireland with industry representative bodies including IBEC, the Small Firms Association, CIF, Chambers Ireland and ISME. </p>  <p>  Circular 10/14: "Initiatives to assist SME's in Public Procurement" (April 2014) issued new guidance and procedures to public procurers regarding SME access to procurement opportunities. The purpose of the new guidelines and procedures are to ensure that engaging with government procurement is easy and low cost. In line with the objectives of Circular 10/14, the lots were designed to facilitate the participation of SMEs.  The National Framework Agreement was structured into 9 geographic lots - this lotting structure was designed to deliver efficiency, value for money, reduce duplication and mitigate any undue risks on the State, whilst still supporting SME participation.  The Lotting structure was very much informed by engagement with the Irish Pest Control Association and a number of service providers.  The OGP utilised the IPCA website to determine the location of service provides to ensure there were sufficient places on the Lots to allow SMEs to be successful.  For instance in the case of the Dublin Lot (Lot 8), 8 places were available due to the large presence of SMEs. Five companies were appointed to the National Framework Agreement and, four of the companies are SMEs based in Dublin and Limerick.</p>  <p>  Collaborative consortia bids were encouraged by the OGP thereby further facilitating SMEs' participation.  SMEs that believe that the scope of a competition is beyond their technical or business capacity are encouraged to explore the possibility of forming relationships with other SMEs or large enterprises.  Through such relationships, SMEs can participate and contribute to the successful implementation of any contracts, agreements or arrangements that result from procurement competitions and therefore increase their social and economic benefits.  Intertrade Ireland have a specific training programme available to support businesses interested in putting consortia together.  In addition, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission published a guide for SMEs, 'How to comply with competition law when tendering as part of a consortium', in December 2014.  The published RFT permitted both the use of subcontractors and the establishment of consortia.  Unfortunately neither of these options were presented in the responses received by the OGP to its published RFT.  </p>  <p>  It may be worth noting that of the 35 members of the IPCA, our eTenders records show that only 9 members downloaded the tender document 7 of whom tendered, 4 of whom were appointed to the Framework.</p>  <p>  Under Circular 10/14 buyers are encouraged not to set turnover thresholds at more than twice the estimated contract value.  I wish to confirm that no multiplier was used in the establishment of the turnover figures for any Lots advertised under this competition.  As was noted in the tender documentation, an annual value was approximated therein, these were the turnover levels set out in the RFT.</p>  <p>  The OGP also wishes to confirm that no queries or clarifications were raised by tenderers during the tender process in relation to the matters raised.  Furthermore it is noted that the Tender Advisory Service (TAS) was not availed of in relation to any concerns which the market may have had.</p>  <p>  The OGP is satisfied that its tender process was robust and not only did the OGP act in the spirit of Circular 10/14, it actively applied its principles by making every effort to allow participation by all potential tenderers, whilst being mindful of the Office's core business of delivering value for the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  The OGP is now meeting the demands of its customers, and have achieved significant value for money in relation to this exercise.  This outcome has demonstrated SME ability to compete and be successful in public procurement processes.</p></reply>

For each of the policy challenges contained in the Government's Programme a clear unambiguous high-level ambition is also identified, for example:</p><p>- meet the target of building 25,000 new homes needed every year by 2020;</p><p>- create 200,000 jobs by 2020, including 135,000 outside Dublin;</p><p>- reducing waiting times in the health sector; and</p><p>- spend at least &euro;6.75 billion more on public services by 2021 compared to 2016.</p><p>As stated in the Programme for every policy challenge, the new Government will ensure that a balance is struck between addressing urgent priorities - utilising the action plan framework set out in the Programme document - and engaging in long-term planning and thinking, so that lasting solutions with broad based support are implemented.</p><p>In order to adopt this approach in practice, a key action for the Government's first hundred days is securing agreement with the Oireachtas on putting in place a reformed budget process.  This is intended to secure a significantly more participatory approach  underpinned by a substantially enhanced D&aacute;il input into and feedback on the development of budgetary priorities.</p><p>It is envisaged that an important element of this new model will be to facilitate appropriate consultation and engagement on the costings of specific measures intended to respond to particular Programme for Government priorities, as well as examining how these measures align with overall fiscal parameters.</p><p>This new approach will have a central role to play in guiding and informing deliberation by the Oireachtas on budgetary options and in shaping the Government's budgetary proposals in due course.</p></reply>

My Department itself operates a Structures at Risk Fund to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, that are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund, which has an allocation of &euro;624,000 in 2016, is administered through the local authorities and seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  Applications for this scheme have now closed for 2016, and recommended projects are currently being finalised.</p>  <p>  I launched a new &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme - for the repair and conservation of protected structures on 21 October 2015.  This scheme will operate in 2016, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  It is expected to support a significant number of projects across the country and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  The scheme for this year is now fully allocated.</p>  <p>  The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  For 2016, the Council is administering a community based heritage grants scheme available for projects that contributed to particular heritage themes.  The Council would be able to advise if the particular structure referred to by the Deputy would be eligible for funding, now or in the future.</p>  <p>  The remainder of my Department&rsquo;s built heritage capital budget for 2016 will be focused on the conservation and presentation of the State's heritage portfolio, which is managed by the Office of Public Works.</p></reply>

Where issues of particular importance arise regarding any of these important natural heritage assets, I am kept apprised, on an on-going basis, by my officials.  Given the nature of the wildfires which took place in the southeast of the location, and given the necessity of evaluating the damage caused on an on-going basis, I received a number of oral reports from my officials on the effects of the fires.  At the time of the fires themselves, I was kept apprised of the efforts of the local authority&rsquo;s Fire &amp;amp; Rescue Service, the Air Corps of the Defence Forces, the Coast Guard, and my own officials in my Department&rsquo;s National Parks and Wildlife Service in combating the fires. Most of the damage caused at the location in question occurred in the upland areas where the fires originated, with heather, gorse and mollinia (grass) burned across a large area southeast of the location.</p>  <p>  These upland areas are very important habitats for a number of flora and fauna, including ground-nesting birds, invertebrates, small mammals and many species of insects.  Shortly after the fires abated, my officials informed me that over 1,000 hectares within the location were affected by the fires and that, while the woodlands escaped serious damage, a number of trees, including oak, birch, holly, and arbutus, were scorched by the fires.  I was also advised that a number of deer fences and a part of the board-walks on a long-distance walking trail, which runs through the location were damaged, but that, from an ecological perspective, the damage to uplands habitats was more serious.</p>  <p>  Section 40 of the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2012 currently prohibits the cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction of vegetation, with certain strict exemptions, from 1 March to 31 August.  Section 40(1)(a) specifically provides that it is an offence to cut, grub, burn, or otherwise destroy any vegetation on any land not then cultivated.  In addition, it should also be noted that section 39 of the Acts prohibits burning, in any season, within one mile of a statutory Nature Reserve or a wood which is not the property of the person burning, unless notice has been given.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, at the time the fires occurred at the location in question, my officials indicated that they would work closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as appropriate, to investigate the cause, or causes, of the wildfires which affected the location and, where evidence is forthcoming, to pursue appropriate enforcement under the Wildlife Acts or other legislation.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that at the time the fires occurred, I appealed to all members of the public to be conscious of the danger posed by fire, particularly on open ground where it can very quickly become an uncontrolled fire.  As we now enter into the summer, this is a message I would re-iterate, and I believe that the fires which took place at the location, and the resultant damage to upland habitats and risk to our oak woodlands, will have given members of the public a greater appreciation of the value of our National Parks and Nature Reserves, and the importance of protecting our natural heritage.</p></reply>

I am acutely aware of the challenges facing the National Library, and indeed other national cultural institutions, following the significant reduction of resources available to the Exchequer as a result of the economic crisis.  These are significant challenges which will not be fixed overnight, and will most likely take a number of years to address.  Thanks to improvements in the economy, I was in a position to secure an additional &euro;2 million in current funding for our national cultural institutions as part of the 2015 Revised Estimates.

I was pleased to have been in a position to maintain those increased budgets in 2016.</p><p>In addition, I provided the National Archives with a special allocation of &euro;150,000 for 2016 to assist in work currently being undertaken by it, in association with the Office of Government Chief Information Officer, in regard to digital records and public sector records management policy.</p><p>I will continue to support the National Library and National Archives to the greatest extent possible and hope to be in a position to provide additional funding as the Exchequer position improves.</p><p>In relation to capital funding, I was delighted in late 2015 to announce a major new capital investment plan for the National Library's historic Kildare Street premises, as part of the Government's Public Capital Programme <i>Building on Recovery 2016-2021. </i>I have earmarked an allocation of &euro;10 million in funding for the first phase of the works.</p><p>In addition, as part of the Decade of Commemorations programme, &euro;8 million in funding has been earmarked for the first phase in a capital development plan at the National Archives.  The OPW has recently appointed a design team to the project and I expect it to go to tender shortly.</p><p>These two significant capital investments will address many of the long-standing to infrastructural issues that face both the National Library and the National Archives in terms of their building and storage requirements.</p></reply>

The National Coordinating Committee has the following terms of reference:</p>  <p>  - to drive implementation of the National Drugs Strategy (NDS) at local and regional level;</p>  <p>  - to oversee, monitor and support the work of the Drug and Alcohol Task Forces to ensure that policy on drugs is informed by their work and that their work is informed by the NDS;</p>  <p>  - to promote effective coordination between statutory bodies and the community &amp;amp; voluntary sectors in delivering on the objectives of the Strategy at local and regional level;</p>  <p>  - to monitor implementation of NDS actions specific to Drug and Alcohol Task Forces; and</p>  <p>  - to make recommendations to the Minister in relation to the implementation of the NDS and effective coordination of service delivery at local and regional level.</p>  <p>  The committee is chaired by a senior official in the Department of Health and includes representatives from the networks representing the Local Drugs and Alcohol Task Forces and the Regional Drugs and Alcohol Task Forces, as well as the key Departments and agencies involved in the implementation of the Strategy and the Community and Voluntary Sectors.</p>  <p>  The committee, which meets up to six times a year, has developed a work programme to assist it in meeting its terms of reference. Among its priorities in 2016 is the development of a common approach across all Task Forces to addressing drug litter issues.  The Department of Health has commissioned external consultants to assist the committee in measuring the effectiveness of the Drugs and Alcohol Task Forces, having regard to best practice internationally.  It is also intended that the performance management framework under development by the consultant will provide a mechanism to target funding allocations on the basis of objective criteria, having regard to the drugs situation in the Task Forces catchment areas and other demographic factors.  The study is due to be completed by September 2016 and will inform Task Force policy considerations going forward.</p></reply>

This represents a massive milestone for Irish children, young people and families.  The children&rsquo;s hospitals at Temple Street, Crumlin and Tallaght have always provided superb care to children, but their infrastructure is not fit for purpose for modern 21st century children&rsquo;s hospitals.  The new facilities at the St. James&rsquo;s Hospital campus will allow doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals to deliver safe, quality care in a purpose-built facility, to be delivered by 2020.  Enabling works are to begin this summer.  The planning decision also allows construction to begin on satellite urgent care and outpatient centres at Connolly Hospital and at Tallaght Hospital, which are expected to open in 2018, enhancing access to these services.</p>  <p>  The previous Government's decision to locate the new children&rsquo;s hospital on the St. James&rsquo;s hospital campus was based on the over-riding priority of best clinical outcomes for our children, and in particular the sickest of these.  It is intended that the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital will also be built on the campus in time, achieving tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services.  Tri-location has benefits for children, adolescents, newborns and mothers. In all cases, the benefits of tri-location are maximised where the adult hospital provides the broadest possible range of clinical sub-specialties and expertise, which are readily accessible for paediatric and maternity patients on the shared campus.  Also, tri-location that delivers the most significant breadth and depth of clinical and academic research on site will enhance the potential of research to drive best clinical outcomes.  St James's Hospital has the widest range of sub-specialities and the highest level of clinical complexity of all the adult hospitals in the country, as well as a strong and well-developed research infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to be the adult co-location partner.  Tri-location of paediatric, adult and, in time, maternity services on the shared campus will create a centre of medical expertise to support research, innovation and education.</p>  <p>  In relation to meeting with a deputation, my Private Office has no record of having received a request for a meeting from this particular group.  If the group submits a meeting request to my Private Office, it will of course be considered in line with the usual procedures.</p></reply>

Firstly, the Act sets out the legislative framework within which persons with a mental disorder may be admitted, detained and treated involuntarily in approved centres.  Secondly, the Act provides for the promotion and maintenance of quality standards of care and treatment that are regularly inspected and properly regulated.</p>  <p>  The Garda Sioch&aacute;na have been given certain powers under the Act.  For example, the Garda&iacute; may sign an application to involuntarily admit a person to an approved centre.  In addition the Garda&iacute; have the power, in certain circumstances to enter a premises, to take a person into custody if they believe that person has a mental disorder and because of that mental disorder they may harm themselves or others.  The Garda&iacute; may also be asked to help staff transport a person to an approved centre for examination.</p>  <p>  While the Mental Health Commission has the power to prosecute summary offences (section 74 of the 2001 Act) and in doing so will issue the summonses, it is the Garda&iacute; and DPP who deal with all other offences set out in the 2001 Act.  The Commission is also obliged to report all possible criminal activity which may come to its attention to the Garda&iacute;, save for those matters which it is specifically provided that they can deal with under the 2001 Act.  Finally, the power to carry out investigations under Section 51 of the Act does not provide for investigations to be carried out by the Garda&iacute; but it is possible that such an investigation could uncover a criminal matter which would have to be reported to the Garda&iacute;.</p></reply>

Funding for mental health in 2016 will increase from the 2015 outturn of &euro;785m, to a projected budget of &euro;826m in the 2016 NSP, an increase of &euro;41m or 5.2% which includes &euro;35m ring-fenced for mental health in 2012.</p>  <p>  The &euro;35m allocation for mental health will fund new service developments.  The HSE National Service Plan 2016 identifies priorities for allocation of the &euro;35 million, including the continued development of counselling services across both primary and secondary care including the provision of three new Jigsaw mental health services in Cork, Dublin city centre and Limerick; the continued development of Community Mental Health teams; improved 24/7 response and Liaison Services; Psychiatry of Later Life; Perinatal Mental Health, and two new mental health clinical programmes, specifically ADHD in Adults and Children, and Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse.  The Department of Health is currently examining proposals from the HSE relating to the development of these specific enhanced priority services, as well as proposals for the ongoing development of a range of existing and new specialist mental health services.  It is expected that a decision on the release of the funding will be made shortly.</p>  <p>  Staff recruitment is a key element of these developments.  As staff recruitment takes time, however, the Service Plan provides that time-related savings of approximately &euro;12m from this and it will be used, on a once-off basis, to maintain services in home care and transitional care beds and for vaccine procurement.  As the initiatives planned for mental health and other areas identified in the Service Plan are approved, arrangements will be made for the release of funding, having regard to the overall Service Plan.</p></reply>

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.   Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m  from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18th November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with the full support of both Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people and disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8m is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school settings, as part of the roll out of the new inclusive preschools model.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the Health Services executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability services to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities. In some limited and specific cases at local level, disability services have in the past also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing additional supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such additional supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants, who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post primary school settings.</p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case he raised.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

A draft Action Plan, which incorporates the recommendations of both the HIQA and the Capacity Review, is currently being implemented.  The HSE/Dublin City Council review recommendations will be incorporated into the Action Plan once that report is completed.</p>  <p>  I intend to bring the Capacity Review to Government this week, after which I hope to be in a position to advise the HSE to proceed with publication.  While the overall funding requirement remains to be quantified, it is clear that a very significant programme of investment in our ambulance services is required.  In that context, a phased investment in a multi annual programme involving manpower, vehicles and technology is required.  The Deputy may wish to note that the Programme for Government commits to additional annual investment in terms of ambulance personnel and vehicles.</p></reply>

At present, that means an upper limit of &euro;177.60 per week.</p>  <p> - Secondly, the charges are structured to ensure that those paying them retain a reasonable income for personal use: at least &euro;33 per week for those paying Class 1 rates and at least &euro;64 per week for those paying Class 2 rates.</p>  <p> - Thirdly, the Act provides that the HSE may reduce or waive a charge imposed on a person if necessary to avoid undue financial hardship.</p>  <p>  To assist in the fair application of the provisions of the 2005 Act and Regulations, the HSE has developed national guidelines for the determination of long-stay charges for in-patient services.  These include the need to have regard to the individual circumstances of each service user and his or her dependants.  The guidelines ensure that the applicable charge is determined taking account of each person&rsquo;s income and necessary outgoings while receiving care, including reasonable regular financial commitments.  This avoids any unfair burden on the service user or his or her dependants.</p>  <p>  As the issue raised by the Deputy relates to an individual case, this is a service matter for the Health Service Executive.  I have asked the HSE to look into the particular matter raised and to reply directly to the Deputy.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

Under Lifetime Community Rating late entry loadings apply for people aged 35 and over when taking out health insurance for the first time.  This encourages people to take out health insurance at a younger age, and continue to retain it, thereby avoiding loadings and helping to spread the health costs of older and less healthy people across all insured persons.  The number of people who currently hold private health insurance is now 2.126 million, or 46% of the Irish population, (end Jan 2016).  This includes an increase of 104,667 from January 2015 to January 2016 which contributes positively to controlling premium inflation and thereby helps to keep health insurance affordable for those who wish to avail of it.</p>  <p>  The overall insured population increased by 6%.  The largest increases occurred for ages under 60, (80%) with the remaining increase being in ages over 60, (20%).  The Health Insurance Authority has noted that "the increases at the younger ages in 2015 may reflect the introduction of Lifetime Community Rating and Young Adult Rates.  The increase in older ages in 2015 mostly reflects the aging demographics of the insured and general population."   In addition, the improvement in the economy has facilitated this boost in membership and contributed to the positive effect on the number of people holding health insurance.</p>  <p>  In addition, a robust Risk Equalisation Scheme is also in place to support community rating by equalising risk across the market.  All insurers receive payments from the Risk Equalisation Fund in respect of their older and less healthy customers, and this is funded by stamp duties levied on all policies written.</p>  <p>  Insurers with less older members are net contributors and insurers with greater older people are net beneficiaries.  This market wide support to community rating ensures individuals continue to pay the same net amount for a given health insurance product, keeping health insurance affordable for older and less healthy members.</p></reply>

As announced in June 2016 by my predecessor, it is intended that the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital will relocate to the campus in time, achieving tri-location of paediatric, maternity and adult services on one campus.  Tri-location has benefits for children, adolescents, newborns and mothers.  In all cases, the benefits of tri-location are maximised where the adult hospital provides the broadest possible range of clinical sub-specialties and expertise, and which delivers the most significant breadth and depth of clinical and academic research on site.  St James's Hospital has the widest range of sub-specialties and highest level of clinical complexity of all hospitals in the country, as well as a strong and well-developed research infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to be the adult co-location partner.</p><p>In submitting its planning application for the children's hospital at the St James's campus, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board as a matter of good planning practice provided full information on all known future developments for the St James&rsquo;s campus, including the intention to develop a maternity hospital in due course.  The planning application was submitted in August 2015. Consideration of the planning application, and of submissions made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la relating to the application, were matters for An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which issued its decision on 28 April 2016.

A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.</p>  <p>  Medicines which have a high potential to be misused are subject to additional and stricter controls under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  These medicines include benzodiazepines and certain z-drugs, however zimovane is not controlled at present.  The Misuse of Drugs Acts and Regulations impose restrictions on the production, supply, importation and exportation of controlled drugs.  A person who has in his possession a prescription medicine containing a controlled drug for the purpose of selling or supplying it in contravention of the Misuse of Drugs legislation, is guilty of an offence under that legislation.</p>  <p>  Following a Court of Appeal decision on 10 March 2015 which declared unconstitutional the section of the Misuse of Drugs Act empowering the Government to declare substances to be controlled under the Act, the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015 was urgently enacted to recontrol all substances which had previously been declared controlled by Government order.  A further Bill to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act so as to allow the Government to declare substances to be controlled and to clarify the provisions under which Ministerial Orders and Regulations are made is currently being drafted.  The text will be finalised when judgement is received on a Supreme Court appeal on section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act &ndash; the case was heard on 12 April.  It is intended that the Bill will be published in coming months.  This will once again allow Regulations to be made and to bring under the scope of the Act new substances, including zimovane, and allow the introduction of stricter controls on substances such as benzodiazepines, which are already covered under the legislation.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the problem of abuse of benzodiazepine and z-drugs will not be solved by Regulations alone, and that prescribers need to ensure that these substances are only prescribed as appropriate.  The Health Product Regulatory Authority which is the competent authority for human medicines, Revenue&rsquo;s Customs service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely to prevent the unauthorised flow of illegal medicinal products into and out of the State.  The enforcement of the law relating to the sale of drugs, including prescription drugs, continues to be a priority in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the issue of drug misuse.</p></reply>

Funding for mental health in 2016 will increase from the 2015 outturn of &euro;785m, to a projected budget of &euro;826m in the 2016 NSP, an increase of &euro;41m<i></i>or 5.2% which includes the &euro;35m ring fenced for mental health.  In 2016, it is proposed to advance the NSP 2016 development priorities from additional funding, including:</p><p>- continued development of counselling services across both primary and secondary care including the provision of three new Jigsaw mental health services in Cork, Dublin city centre and Limerick;</p><p>- the continued development of Community Mental Health teams; improved 24/7 response and Liaison Services; Psychiatry of Later Life;</p><p>- Perinatal Mental Health, and two new mental health clinical programmes, specifically ADHD in Adults and Children, and Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse.</p><p>The Department of Health is currently examining proposals from the HSE relating to the development of these specific enhanced priority services, as well as proposals for the ongoing development of a range of existing and new specialist mental health services.  It is expected that a decision on the release of the funding will be made shortly.</p><p>In addition to new developments, the HSE is committed to the ongoing development of adult and child &amp;amp; adolescent services.  Up to 1,150 posts have already been filled up to end-2015 from the developmental funding provided since 2012, with 270 posts approved for the Child and Adolescent Services.</p><p>Staff recruitment is a key element of both existing and new developments.  As staff recruitment takes time, however, the Service Plan provides that time-related savings of approximately &euro;12m from this and will be used, on a once-off basis, to maintain services in home care and transitional care beds and for vaccine procurement.  As the initiatives planned for mental health and other areas identified in the Service Plan are approved, arrangements will be made for the release of funding, having regard to the overall Service Plan requirements.</p><p>In the area of mental health, it has proved challenging for the HSE to recruit to certain specialist, clinical and other posts.  A Psychology Eligibility Criteria Review Group was established to conduct and deliver a review of the eligibility criteria currently used by the HSE.  The Review Group consists of an Independent Chairperson, HSE Psychology Managers, representatives from the HSE National HR Service and Health Business Services.  The Terms of Reference of the Review Group are:</p><p>- To review the current recruitment care group delineations and make appropriate recommendations; and</p><p>- To review the eligibility requirements for each care group in the context of competencies for the posts and the PSI accreditation guidelines.</p><p>It is understood that this group will shortly conclude its work.</p><p>With regard to the Deputy's question on recruitment of graduates in specific areas of mental health, I am referring this to the HSE for direct reply as recruitment is a matter for the HSE.  If you have not received a response within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

The Assessor is not at liberty to hold the records, or to request that they be archived, for any other purpose.  The Data Protection Commissioner has confirmed that data may only be used for the purpose for which it was supplied and for no other purpose.  No documentation will be confidentially disposed of until the work of the Scheme has been completed and every effort will be made to contact women who have not yet replied to the Assessor to ensure their wishes regarding their personal records are respected.</p></reply>

Prior to reimbursing any item, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  They are not political or ministerial decisions.</p><p>Kuvan (sapropterin) was considered under the national pricing and reimbursement process in 2009.  At that time, insufficient evidence was available to support the pricing and reimbursement application submitted by the manufacturer.</p><p>The manufacturer recently submitted a new application for pricing and reimbursement of Kuvan; this application is now being considered, in line with criteria set out in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 and using the processes outlined in national pricing framework agreements.</p><p>As the application process is ongoing, it is not possible to discuss potential outcomes or comment further at this time.</p></reply>

Given that this is an operational matter, it is appropriate that it should be dealt with by the NMBI.  I have referred the Deputy's question to the NMBI for attention and direct reply.  If you have not received a reply from the NMBI within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office  and they will follow up the matter with them.</p>  <p>  However, I would like to advise the Deputy of a number of measures taken by the NMBI and to put the registration delays in context.</p>  <p>  A significant volume of applications has been received by the NMBI, particularly during 2015 and to date in 2016.  Many of the applications received are incomplete whereby documents remain outstanding and therefore the matter cannot be progressed to review/assessment stage until these are received.  In addition, many applicants do not complete their application form fully therefore leading to delays in progressing an application through the system. </p>  <p>  The NMBI have arrangements in place for applicants to follow up on the progress of their application.  In October 2015 a dedicated call centre was established to assist overseas applicants.  This call centre is open  Monday through to Friday, 9.00am to 5.30pm and provides regular updates to overseas applicants on the current status of their application.  In addition the NMBI has launched a new website which provides additional services for overseas applicants, including a facility to &ldquo;Track their Application&rdquo; on line.</p>  <p>  The NMBI is also working with its stakeholders, including the HSE, to provide options for nurses who are required to obtain additional competencies in order to meet the requirements for registration.  Such options include adaptation courses and an aptitude tests.</p></reply>

The intent is that both capacity and patient throughput are appropriately managed during periods of excess demand.  A core component of the approach is to avoid the need for escalation protocols where possible, by improving basic systems and processes and by better understanding variations in demand and in capacity.</p>  <p>  When necessary, escalated responses are delivered in a clearly defined three stage process.  It should be noted that Steps 1 and 2 of the Escalation Framework allow degrees of flexibility.  Stage 2 mandates the identification of non-urgent elective procedures for cancellation, in consultation with relevant consultants, and redeployment of staff to support demand for emergency care.</p>  <p>  It is only at Stage 3 of escalation where all admissions are to be carried out through the Emergency Department, that cancellation of all elective surgeries is considered, with redeployment of available elective medical and nursing staff to facilitate patient flow and discharge where possible. </p>  <p>  The HSE Special Delivery Unit has conducted reviews at 12 hospitals in order to ensure appropriate implementation of the Escalation Framework.  As part of further review visits, all elements of hospitals' responses and escalation preparedness has been examined. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific case raised, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

The need for regulatory action is not based on numbers of reports - which may be influenced by availability on the market, the extent of use and public awareness of an issue - but is considered in the context of this continuous safety monitoring and ongoing evaluation.  EU regulators continuously monitor the safety of the HPV vaccines and routine ongoing pharmacovigilance activities are in place to review any new safety signal, should they arise from the Eurovigilance database of adverse reactions, published literature, or from any other source of information.  Safety monitoring includes the review, follow up and onward reporting of individual suspected adverse reaction reports submitted to national competent authorities such as the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), as well as evaluation of data from the published literature, epidemiological studies and any additional clinical trial results.</p><p>I am aware of claims of an association between Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.</p><p>I want to make it quite clear that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The HSE  strives to provide the appropriate care for all patients no matter what their illness.  The girls and their families should seek medical advice from their family doctor in the normal manner and be referred to consultants familiar with these syndromes for diagnosis and management.  A number of non health supports are referred to in these questions.  As the Deputy is aware my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, has responsibility for Disability Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance Schemes.  </p><p>The HSE provides information for parents about diseases, the vaccines to prevent them and side effects to allow them to choose whether or not to give consent to vaccination.  All vaccination information provided to parents is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet.  The information booklets include information on the most common adverse events that can occur after each vaccination.  Seizures, muscle weakness, leg pain, joint pain and chronic fatigue are not mentioned as known side effects to Gardasil in the Patient Information Leaflet.  There are no known long term side effects to the vaccine Gardasil.  The information is presented in clear simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency so that it can be understood by all adults as the average reading age in Ireland is 12 years of age.  Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions. </p><p>Should parents require additional information about vaccines the immunisation leaflet refers to the HSE&rsquo;s national immunisation website ().  The national immunisation website has been accredited by the World Health Organisation for credibility, content and good information practices.  The website allows members of the public to contact the National Immunisation Office to ask a question if they require further information.  These questions, when possible, are answered by the staff of the National Immunisation Office within one working day.</p><p>The HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.  The Department is aware that representatives from REGRET have already met with the HSE and it would be more appropriate for them to meet with the HSE again when the care pathways and access to services has been clarified.</p></reply>

A targeted fissure sealant programme is provided for children aged 6 to 8 and 11 to 13 (usually 2nd and 6th class).  These are the optimum ages for the application of fissure sealants.  In addition, a screening programme is provided for these age groups with necessary interventions for permanent teeth including fillings and extractions. Referrals for orthodontic or other treatments as required are also made at this time.  This is a targeted public health programme for which waiting lists are not applicable. </p>  <p>  The HSE prioritises services within the available budget taking account of legislation, policy and key developmental stages for children's teeth.  Additional resources have been released in 2015 and into 2016 to improve dental services in areas where there have been difficulties.  The provision of dental services for 2nd class and 6th class is monitored by the HSE using performance indicators collated on a monthly basis.  This enables the HSE to target any additional resources appropriately.  Future service provision will be informed by the National Oral Health Policy, which the Department of Health is currently developing.  This three-year project commenced in 2014 and is being led by the Chief Dental Officer.  The project includes a needs assessment, a review of resources and involves consultation with stakeholders, including dental professionals and the public.</p></reply>

It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in the first year of secondary school. </p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil and Cervarix).  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and over 200,000 girls have received this vaccine since its introduction.</p>  <p>  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.</p>  <p>  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  </p>  <p>  I want to make it quite clear that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services.</p>  <p>  In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review, which the HPRA participated in, found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.</p>  <p>  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states. There are no plans to carry out  any further  reviews at this stage.</p></reply>

The decision means that enabling works can commence this summer.  It is expected that the satellite centres will open in 2018 with building work completed on the main site in 2020.</p>  <p>  During the design process, there has been extensive engagement and consultation with families, young people and children who are former or current users of the service, with staff from the existing three children&rsquo;s hospitals and with local residents.  This has led to the development of a world-class building which has been designed to enable staff to deliver the best possible clinical care for children and young people.  The planned accommodation will include facilities for inpatients, day care patients, outpatients, operating theatres and emergency care.  There will be 380 inpatient rooms, all of which will be single en-suite rooms with in-room parent accommodation, 93 day-care beds and 20 operating theatres.  The hospital will also include play areas, external gardens and courtyards. </p>  <p>  In relation to access, the campus at St. James&rsquo;s hospital benefits from a full suite of transport options including private car, national rail, Luas, bus, bicycle, pedestrian and taxi.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the public transport accessibility of the site, the need of most parents to access the hospital by car is recognised, and ample parking has been provided for families based on current and projected future demand.  1,000 car parking spaces are being provided, with a minimum of 675 of these intended to accommodate family parking.  This is based on an assessment of the level of parking demand, developed in consultation with the medical planning team.  The NPHDB has confirmed that this level of parking provision will facilitate 100% car parking provision for inpatient, day case and emergency attendances, and 65% car parking provision for outpatient attendances.  The car parking stock and appointment schedules will be actively managed to ensure that all patients wishing to avail of parking will be facilitated. In addition, a condition of the planning permission granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la is that a minimum of 20 spaces be marked and designated as &ldquo;parent and child&rdquo; spaces and reserved for parents of children with specific needs (equipment etc.). </p>  <p>  In regard to parking costs, these will be considered in due course having regard to the needs of patients and families, including families of long-stay patients.</p></reply>

Currently 9 of the 14 designated professions have registration boards and registers have been established for 7 of them.</p>  <p>  Psychotherapists and counsellors are not currently regulated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  However, the Act provides that the Minister for Health may, by regulation, designate a health and social care profession not already designated if he or she considers that it is appropriate and in the public interest to do so and if specified criteria have been met.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Act, the Health and Social Care Professionals Council has been consulted on the question of regulating counsellors and psychotherapists.  Its detailed report on the matter is being examined carefully in the Department of Health with a view to deciding the next steps in the coming months.  These steps will, I envisage,  include a wider round of consultation involving the various professional bodies and other interested parties.</p>  <p>  While the profession or professions of counsellor and psychotherapist are not specifically designated under the 2005 Act, there are various regulatory controls on many counsellors and psychotherapists operating in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The profession of psychologist, for example, is a designated profession under the 2005 Act which means that those psychologists who are counsellors and/or psychotherapists will begin to be regulated when the Psychologists Registration Board, which is due to be established later this year, opens its register. </p>  <p>  Psychiatrists, some of whom practice psychotherapy, are regulated under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  Also, counsellors/therapists working in the publicly funded health sector are required to have minimum qualifications set by the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need are provided with treatment by the HSE.  Following a national procurement process, a panel of independent practitioners is currently being contracted by the HSE to provide treatment for certain categories of misalignment.  The practitioners will be under contract over the next three years, with consideration of an extension to four years.  This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for four years or longer.  It is expected that this initiative will have a positive impact on waiting times. </p>  <p>  In addition, a pilot scheme in the Dublin North East area (DNE), which involves upskilling staff to work as orthodontic therapists is currently underway.  A dental hygienist and a dental nurse qualified as orthodontic therapists in September 2015 and are now working in the HSE under the supervision of specialist orthodontists.  The scheme is currently undergoing an evaluation, which includes consideration of how the scheme is affecting waiting lists.  Figures are currently being collated and early indications are positive.  It is planned to extend the scheme after the evaluation has been completed.  These initiatives are in line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to provide timely access to orthodontic care.</p></reply>

In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold.  Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs.</p>  <p>  The Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) payment is made by the Minister for Social Protection to carers in respect of a child at home under 16 years of age with a severe disability, where it has been determined that the child requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.  Eligibility for the DCA is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required.  As such it is not possible to say if a particular child or any particular medical condition or disability will qualify for a payment under the DCA scheme. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government states "We will extend the entitlement to a medical card for all children in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance in Budget 2017. Approximately 10,000 children would benefit from this initiative."  The HSE has published the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) Statistical Analysis of Claims and Payments 2014 in which it identifies that the average expenditure in 2014 per medical card was &euro;912.  Without knowing the individual circumstances and needs of each child, it is difficult to provide the actual cost of extending a medical card specifically to all children in receipt of DCA as it would depend on the variable nature of the individuals&rsquo; requirements as well as the number of individuals and the quantum and cost of health services that would be used.</p></reply>

All medical card holders are entitled to specific dental treatments under the DTSS, e.g., an annual dental examination, two fillings in each calendar year, and extractions as necessary.  More complex care such as root canal treatment, gum treatment and dentures may also be provided subject to prior approval by the HSE.  Additional treatments are available to persons with specific medical conditions, including persons in receipt of care or services for a disability, persons on a register of disability and more vulnerable clients.  The HSE prioritises for treatment patients with special needs, high risk patients and those who have greater clinical needs.  Expenditure on the DTSS amounted to &euro;67m in 2015.  The cost of restoring treatments which had been provided before 2010 to all medical card holders would depend on a number of factors, including the underlying oral health of the population and the likely level of take-up of such services.  The HSE continues to monitor the operation of the DTSS to ensure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of available resources. </p>  <p>  Future service provision will be informed by the National Oral Health Policy, which the Department of Health is currently developing.  This three-year project commenced in 2014 and is being led by the Chief Dental Officer.  The project includes a needs assessment, a review of resources and involves consultation with stakeholders, including dental professionals and the public.</p></reply>

The Framework is based on evidence and experience from around the world which clearly shows that to create positive changes in health and well-being takes the involvement of the whole of Government and all of society working in unison.  On that basis, it is not possible to identify in totality how much funding is currently spent on improving health and wellbeing across all Government Departments and agencies and in wider society. </p><p>Since Healthy Ireland was launched in March 2013, expenditure on its implementation from within the budget of the Department of Health has amounted to the following:</p><p>2013  -  &euro;89,315.07;</p><p>2014  -  &euro;586,470.90;</p><p>2015  -  &euro;607,706.83.02; and</p><p>2016  -  &euro;48,305.99 (to date)</p><p>In addition to the expenditure noted above, other expenditure arising within the Department could also be described as &quot;Healthy Ireland&quot; depending on classification. </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that expenditure arising in the HSE, particularly in the Health and Wellbeing Division, could also be described as implementation of Healthy Ireland.  However, it is not possible to disaggregate expenditure on promoting and improving health and well-being generally from overall HSE expenditure.  Again, for example, within overall HSE expenditure, and in addition to work which is an integral part of the Health and Wellbeing Division, a large component of health promotion and improvement work takes place across the acute and primary care services as part of normal day to day activity.  There is also expenditure arising in relation to communications campaigns by the HSE.</p></reply>

Under this initiative, GPs can refer directly to SCAN Nurses for assessment and advice on management of their patients who attend their surgeries with suicidal ideation.  In each of these settings, a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment is carried out together with an assessment of mental state and a risk assessment for suicide.  On the basis of this, a care plan is drawn up and the next steps depend on the psychosocial stresses identified together with the presence or absence of a mental illness such as depression.</p><p>At present there are 15 SCAN nurses providing service nationwide.  A number of new sites have expressed interest in developing SCAN and are being considered at present.</p></reply>

On a year-by-year basis, however, the HSE mental health budget has also been subject to restrictions which have applied to health expenditure generally, including downward adjustments for public service pay reductions and procurement savings similar to other HSE service areas.  In addition, unspent development funds due to recruitment restrictions in 2013 and 2014 were either returned to the Exchequer or used to meet unavoidable costs in other areas.  In total, taking account of the various movements, an additional &euro;115 million increase in the Mental Health budget is identified in the HSE Service Plans between 2012 and 2016 inclusive.  This is a very significant increase having regard to the constraints on general health spending over the period.</p><p>With the establishment of the Mental Health Division within the HSE in mid-2013, the Executive commenced a process of improving reporting budgets and costs on a Care Group basis similar to other HSE service areas.  In previous years, finances were reported by Integrated Service Area to support the integrated model of service delivery.

It is the intention of the newly formed Government to increase access to safe, timely care, as close to patients&rsquo; homes as possible.</p>  <p>  As well as progressing health reform, I am also determined to push ahead with key building blocks for universal healthcare, including:</p>  <p>  -  the establishment of Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations;</p>  <p>  -  the implementation of Activity-Based Funding, and improved ICT and financial systems;</p>  <p>  -  Healthy Ireland and the public health agenda;</p>  <p>  -  building sufficient health system capacity to satisfy unmet demand;</p>  <p>  -  the expansion and development of primary and social care;</p>  <p>  -  the improved management of chronic diseases; and</p>  <p>  -  the phased extension of GP care without fees.  </p>  <p>  Seven Hospital Groups have been established on a non-statutory administrative basis.  Pending the enactment of legislation, the Groups will continue to operate within existing legislative frameworks governing the health services and the policy and accountability frameworks of the Department of Health and the HSE.  Each Hospital Group will be required to develop such a plan to describe how it will provide more efficient and effective patient services; reorganise these services to provide optimal care to the populations they serve; and how they will achieve maximum integration and synergy with other groups and all other health services, particularly primary care and community care services.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to provide &euro;15m to the NTPF in 2017 to address waiting lists.  The Department will engage with the NTPF and the HSE regarding the development of this initiative.  In addition, the Department is currently engaging with the NTPF and the HSE in planning a dedicated waiting list initiative, which will be rolled out in 2016.  I will be meeting with both the NTPF and the HSE to look at options for developing initiatives to tackle waiting lists this year and beyond.</p>  <p>  Service delivery reform is also being advanced in all health services outside the acute hospitals.  Primary care, social care, mental health, and health and well-being health services have been restructured into nine Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs), with the aim of providing the maximum proportion of care to people in the most appropriate settings in the communities where they live.  The CHOs have been established and their development is being driven forward.</p>  <p>  The National Clinical Programmes and, in particular, the pilot Integrated Care Programmes will play an important role in reform as they work to achieve integrated care and integrated service delivery in the health sector by establishing models of person-centred, coordinated care.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently carrying out research into healthcare commissioning models with a view to informing the development of a commissioning framework for Ireland.  This process has included engaging with international experts in this area in order to learn from the experiences of other countries that have implemented commissioning systems.  The role of a future Health Commission will be examined in the context of considering a suitable commissioning model.</p>  <p>  It is also intended to request an Oireachtas All-Party committee to develop a single long term vision plan for healthcare over a 10 year period and I look forward to that Committee's work getting underway shortly.</p></reply>

We have provided &euro;160 million in additional ring-fenced funding up to the end of 2016 and approved approximately 1,500 new posts for mental health, to modernise services in line with <i>A Vision for Change</i>and Programme for Government 2011-2016 commitments.  This includes &euro;35 million provided for 2016, bringing the total budget available for the mental health this year to &euro;826.6 million.  A key focus has been additional posts to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children.  This funding is also being used to enhance specialist community mental health and forensic services, increase the access to counselling and psychotherapy and for suicide prevention initiatives.  Approximately 1,150 posts were filled by end-2015 with further recruitment planned.</p><p>In line with our Programme for Government, this Government is committed to meeting the recommendations of <i>&quot;A Vision for Change&quot;.  </i></p><p>In 2016, our priorities will include the continued development of counselling services across both primary and secondary care including the provision of three new Jigsaw mental health services in Cork, Dublin city centre and Limerick; the continued development of Community Mental Health Teams; improved 24/7 response and Liaison Services; Psychiatry of Later Life; Perinatal Mental Health, and two new mental health clinical programmes, specifically, ADHD in Adults and Children, and Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse.</p><p>A new National Forensic Mental Health Service (NFMHS) hospital is also being developed on the site of St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital, Portrane.</p></reply>

The Strategy provides a vision for an age-friendly society and includes four National Goals and underpinning Objectives to provide direction on the issues that need to be addressed to promote positive ageing. </p>  <p>  The Strategy sets out high level Objectives and broad Areas for Action under four National Goals and two Cross-Cutting Objectives.  The Objectives come under the remit of a diverse range of Government Departments and Agencies, and although the Department of Health has a central co-ordinating role, substantive responsibility for relevant areas remains with the Departments and agencies in whose remit relevant issues most directly fall.</p>  <p>  The Objectives included in the Strategy are quite broad, and can be viewed as a set of principles to which Government has committed, and which will inform policies that affect older people on an indefinite basis into the future, rather than objectives that can be delivered within a finite timeframe, after which the Strategy will be finished.</p>  <p>  My Department will shortly finalise proposals to consolidate the position of the National Positive Ageing Strategy within the decision-making process for Government Departments and Agencies generally.  These will include arrangements to ensure ongoing structured engagements between relevant Departments, Agencies and relevant stakeholders, and will seek to ensure that the Strategy makes a lasting change to the way in which decisions affecting older people are taken.</p>  <p>  A Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative (HaPAI) has also been established to implement the research objective of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  It is a joint initiative between the Department of Health, the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies and will run from October 2014 to December 2017, with a commitment to Department of Health funding for a further two years.  The Initiative will monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing linked to the Goals and Objectives of the Positive Ageing Strategy.  This will be done primarily through the development of positive ageing indicators to be published every two years.  A preliminary positive ageing report has been published and provides an overview of current evidence available on the lives of older people.  The HSE will also develop a physical activity communications campaign under the Initiative.</p></reply>

It also commits to expanding the role of community pharmacists, in managing the health of their patients and in medicine prescription.</p>  <p>  There are currently 14 GP Specialist (Vocational) Training Programmes in operation in Ireland and doctors who wish to pursue GP training in Ireland may apply for a general practice training post in one of these programmes.  At present, all GP training programmes are of 4 years duration and all trainees are required to complete 2 years in a hospital setting and 2 years in general practice with a GP trainer.  The number of GP training places increased from 120 prior to 2010 to the current level of 159 per annum.  The HSE is planning to further increase the GP trainee intake to 172 with effect from July 2016, which is an increase in capacity of over 40% since 2010. </p>  <p>  In addition to the salary costs of the GP trainees themselves, the overall cost of expanding GP training would depend on the cost of various training inputs required.  The Department does not hold that specific data.  However, it can be said that currently GP trainees are paid an average annual salary of &euro;76,000 for the two years they spend training in a GP practice, whilst the average training cost per trainee is &euro;33,000.  Based on these figures, the indicative cost of increasing the current intake from 159 to 200 would be approximately an additional &euro;5 million per annum.  </p>  <p>  As the HSE does not directly hire GPs, it is not possible to quantify the financial implications for the HSE of additional GPs being hired to provide services to the public health system under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme and other schemes.  GPs are remunerated for these services primarily on a capitation basis, with a range of additional support payments and fees for specific items of service, which include allowances for the hiring of practice nurses and secretarial support.  The amount payable in respect of certain supports is related to the doctor's panel size.  In addition, medical indemnity insurance premia are refunded to contract GPs, also based on the size of each doctor's GMS panel.</p>  <p>  As the training of GPs is currently a matter for the Health Service Executive, these questions have been referred to the HSE with a request that they respond directly to the Deputy.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with the Executive.</p></reply>

This has resulted in approximately 800,000 people now being eligible for GP care without fees, without having to undergo a means test.  The under 6s service includes age-based preventive checks focused on health and wellbeing and the prevention of disease, including asthma and diabetes care.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2016, the Government made financial provision for the extension of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 to 11 years.  It is envisaged that this third phase will bring the total number of those eligible for universal GP care, without having to be assessed by a means test, to approximately 1.2 million people.  The Programme for Government commits to extending in phases, and subject to negotiation with GPs, the introduction of free GP care to under 18s.</p>  <p>  The estimated additional cost of providing a universal general practitioner service to the entire population will depend on the future scope of the service, fees and payments to GPs, and eligibility rates.  Following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding by the Health Service Executive, the Department of Health and the Irish Medical Organisation in 2015, the parties have commenced talks on a new GP contract.  However, in the absence of the specific future changes to the scope and content of the GP service, and the relevant fee structure, it would not be possible to provide a precise estimate in respect of the remainder of the population at this point.</p></reply>

This Implementation Programme represents a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with the Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m and the HSE &euro;15.5m.</p><p>Key elements of the initiative include:</p><p>-  the roll-out of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Home Care Packages for people with dementia valued at &euro;22.1 million over a three year period;</p><p>-  the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, to include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points valued at &euro;1.2 million;</p><p>-  measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia valued at &euro;2.7 million.</p><p>A National Office for Dementia has been established within the HSE to coordinate the implementation of the Strategy.  Up to 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from Intensive Home Care Packages over the lifetime of the implementation programme.  Work on the design of a programme of education and training in dementia care for primary care teams and GPs has commenced and is being led from UCC in conjunction with DCU and the ICGP.  Work has also begun on a dementia awareness campaign called Dementia Friendly Ireland which is being led by the HSE's Health and Wellbeing Division.</p><p>A Monitoring Group, chaired by the Department of Health, is working to assist with and advise on implementation of the National Dementia Strategy.  This Group also includes health professionals, administrators, researchers and advocates.  It also includes a person living with dementia and a representative of those who care for people with dementia.</p></reply>

The Minister for Social Protection is responsible for the Dental Treatment Benefit Scheme (DTBS), which provides an annual dental examination to insured workers and retired people who have the required number of PRSI contributions.

Other services, including screening of children 6 to 8 years, are provided but may be deferred in clinics where there is pressure on resources.  Future service provision will be informed by the National Oral Health Policy, which the Department of Health is currently developing.  This three-year project commenced in 2014 and is being led by the Chief Dental Officer.  The project includes a needs assessment, a review of resources and involves consultation with stakeholders, including dental professionals and the public.</p></reply>

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders. </p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  Currently, 2725 people live in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under <i>&lsquo;Transforming Lives&rsquo;,</i>the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions.  I welcome the fact that the needs of people moving from congregated settings will be fully taken into account during this process as the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan. </p><p>In terms of housing, the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government are working in collaboration to support the transition of people with a disability from institutions to social housing in the community under the Government's<i>National Housing Strategy for People with Disability 2011 to 2016.</i></p><p>The HSE's 2016 National Service Plan has set a target of 165 people to move from institutions in 2016 into suitable accommodation.  This is being supported by &euro;20 million in capital funding from the Department of Health in respect of acquiring and renovating properties in priority institutions identified by the HSE. </p><p>In addition, I am pleased to note that the Department of the Environment will provide &euro;10 million under the Capital Assistance Scheme to provide suitable accommodation for people transitioning from institutions in 2016.  The HSE estimate that a further 100 people could benefit from this initiative.  &euro;1 million in ring-fenced leasing funding is also being made available by the Department of the Environment in 2016 to support people moving from institutions into suitable social housing in the community.  This demonstrates the joined up commitment of both Departments to support the de-congregation programme.  </p><p>The HSE has developed a three strand approach to accelerate transitions from institutions in the period 2016-2021, with a target of 900 people to move to more suitable accommodation in this period.</p><p>-  Strand 1- is focussed on large institutional settings at high risk of not meeting HIQA Standards;</p><p>-  Strand 2- is focussed on moving people into suitable social housing in the community through the Department of Environment schemes; and </p><p>-  Strand 3- is focussed on remaining service users in congregated settings who could move to suitable accommodation.</p></reply>

The objectives of the Strategy are to increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention and develop enhanced community based services.</p>  <p>  The Strategy distinguishes between those Actions that can be progressed within existing resources and others to be addressed as more resources become available.  Those identified for first implementation include:</p>  <p>  -  Clear responsibility for dementia to be assigned within the HSE.  A dedicated Office, has been established within the HSE to support implementation of the Strategy;</p>  <p>  -  Clear descriptions of care pathways, and better information and guidance on services to be made available to GPs and to people with dementia and their families and carers; </p>  <p>  -  A better understanding of dementia, including modifiable risk factors, to be promoted;</p>  <p>  -  The use of existing resources to be reviewed to ensure that they are used in the best way possible;</p>  <p>  -  Research to inform the design and delivery of dementia services in Ireland to be supported and given appropriate priority.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE also agreed a joint initiative with the Atlantic Philanthropies to implement significant elements of the Strategy over the period 2014-2017.  This National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme represents combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m, and the HSE contributing &euro;15.5m.</p>  <p>  This programme is promoting a greater focus on timely diagnosis of dementia and on the value of early intervention, along with the long-term objective of making people in Ireland generally more aware and understanding of the needs of people with dementia, and of the contribution that those with dementia continue to make to our society. </p>  <p>  Key elements of the initiative include:</p>  <p>  -  the rollout of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Homecare Packages for people with dementia;</p>  <p>  -  the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, who are the critical and initial point of contact with the health system for those with dementia.  The resource material will include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points, etc.</p>  <p>  -  measures to raise public awareness, address stigma, and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia.</p>  <p>  Progress has already been made on a number of fronts.  The HSE has established a central Dementia Office to drive and oversee implementation of the Strategy.  Work has commenced on the development of a Dementia Friendly Ireland programme to raise awareness and increase understanding of the condition.  Research into the educational needs of GPs and Primary Care Team members is underway, and a body of training will follow when this is complete.  Roll-out has commenced of intensive home care packages for people with dementia, and people with dementia have benefitted to date.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 1970, as amended, the assessment of full eligibility for health services (and the issuing of a medical card) is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  If an applicant&rsquo;s means are above the financial thresholds as set out in the national guidelines, the HSE routinely examines for indications of medical or social circumstances which might result in undue financial hardship in arranging medical services and, exercising discretion, may grant eligibility for a medical card on this basis.  There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for a person with a particular illness or medical condition and this is in accordance with the Health Act 1970.  </p>  <p>  An Expert Panel was established by the Health Service Executive in 2014 to examine and recommend a range of medical conditions that should be considered as a basis of eligibility for a medical card.  A key recommendation of the Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility was that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  It is important to note that the Panel concluded that it would not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order as a means of determining medical card eligibility. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the Government approved a range of actions to improve the performance of the medical card system as it is clear that there are people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.  Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE as evidenced by the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation, which has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 104,000 at the beginning of May 2016.   </p>  <p>  Following the Expert Panel report, a Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) was established by the Director General of the HSE to provide clinical oversight and guidance to the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system which can strive to ensure that the relatively small percentage of cases requiring the recognition of the burden of a medical condition(s), over and above financial hardship, can be accommodated.  The Group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions.</p></reply>

In 2015 the United Nations Children's Funds (UNICEF) estimated a worldwide shortage of 65 million doses of BCG.  The vaccine has not been available in Ireland since the end of April 2015.  Consequently, BCG vaccination clinics in HSE Clinics and Maternity hospitals have been postponed until new stock arrives.</p>  <p>  There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland and to other countries within the EU.  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG vaccine to ascertain when the vaccine might be available.  The HSE has also asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which licenses and regulates all human medicines in Ireland, to source an alternate supplier of the BCG vaccine.  Efforts have been made to find a company who can provide the vaccine for use in Ireland which satisfies all the HPRA requirements on safety and efficacy.  To date no suitable alternative BCG product has been found.  Therefore the HSE has been unable to procure the BCG vaccine from any other source and still awaits the product from the HPRA licensed supplier of the vaccine.</p>  <p>  The supplier has indicated that supplies of the vaccine are not expected to be delivered into Ireland until early 2017.  When the HSE receives the vaccine, they will arrange appointments for vaccination clinics ensuring that those at high risk are offered vaccination first.</p></reply>

The Bill is part of a suite of measures agreed on foot of the recommendations in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy.  The National Substance Misuse Strategy Steering Group included representatives from the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland and MEAS Ltd.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill was also subject to pre-legislative scrutiny from the Joint Committee on Health and Children.

The Health Products Regulatory Authority subsequently granted a marketing authorisation for the cannabis-based medicinal product Sativex to be marketed in this State.  It was then open to the holder of that authorisation to make the product available for prescribing in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the GMS and community drug schemes, under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  Decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  They are not political or ministerial decisions.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has received an application for the inclusion of Sativex on the High Tech Scheme.  However, an NCPE health technology assessment report on Sativex has not recommended reimbursement at the submitted price.  The NCPE report is an important input to assist the HSE in its decision-making process and will inform engagement between the HSE and the supplier in relation to potential pricing arrangements for this product.</p>  <p>  As the matter remains under consideration by the HSE, I am not in a position to comment any further at present.</p></reply>

Building on the recent upturn in the economy two initiatives were introduced from 1 May 2015.  Lifetime Community Rating and reduced premiums for Young Adults promote the sustainability of the insurance market as a whole.  Without these measures, there would be a continued deterioration in the age profile of the insured population, which in turn would contribute to claims inflation and result in higher insurance premiums.  The number of people who currently hold private health insurance is now 2.126 million, or 46% of the Irish population, (end Jan 2016).  This includes an increase of 104,667 from January 2015 to January 2016 which contributes positively to controlling premium inflation.</p>  <p>  We have a highly competitive insurance market.  While I welcome the recent reduction in the number of products  from 416 at end 2015 to 354 now, I agree that product proliferation is not in the interest of consumers.  I have asked my officials to examine what supports could further reduce products.  In the meantime many consumers can make savings on their health insurance premiums by taking advantage of promotional offers and by reviewing their level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  The Health Insurance Authority website offers a clear price comparison and can be accessed at www.hia.ie.  All of the health insurers provide a number of lower cost plans, making it possible for consumers to find the same level of cover for a cheaper price.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would remind the Deputy that Insurance companies operate as commercial providers and make their own commercial decisions including pricing policies.  The Minister for Health has no legal power to intervene in relation to any insurer&rsquo;s prices.  You may wish to note however, that in the 12 months to end December 2015, the average gross premium received by insurers was &euro;1,173, which represents a 2% decrease on the average premium received in 2014 (&euro;1,200). </p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; Parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.  This being the case, the Department of Health has not conducted specific research into the projected cost of adding Crohn's Disease to the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.

Funding for mental health in 2016 will increase from the 2015 outturn of &euro;785 million, to a projected budget of &euro;826 million in the 2016 NSP, an increase of &euro;41 million or 5.2% which includes the &euro;35 million ring fenced for mental health.  In 2016, it is proposed to advance the NSP 2016 development priorities from additional funding, including: continued development of counselling services across both primary and secondary care including the provision of three new Jigsaw mental health services in Cork, Dublin city centre and Limerick; the continued development of Community Mental Health teams; improved 24/7 response and Liaison Services; Psychiatry of Later Life; Perinatal Mental Health, and two new mental health clinical programmes, specifically ADHD in Adults and Children, and Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse. </p>  <p>  Some of the proposals for the &euro;35 million in 2016 involve the recruitment of extra staff for new service developments.  As staff recruitment takes time, the Service Plan provides that time-related savings of approximately &euro;12 million from this and would be used, on a once-off basis, to maintain services in home care and transitional care beds, and for vaccine procurement.  As the initiatives planned for mental health and the other areas identified in the Service Plan are approved, arrangements will be made for the release of funding, having regard to the overall Service Plan requirements.</p>  <p>  In line with the provisions of the Service Plan which was agreed and published last December, additional funding for specific initiatives in mental health will be allocated as specific implementation plans are agreed.

The Programme was funded through an EU allocation of approximately &euro;42 million and &euro;24 million in Exchequer funding, bringing total funds to approximately &euro;66 million.  The Programme ended in December 2015 and funding for the seafood sector is now provided through my Department&rsquo;s new &euro;240 million EMFF Seafood Development Operational Programme.  The accounts for the EFF Programme are not yet finalised and a closure process needs to be completed between my Department and the EU before a final figure is available, so I cannot provide the Deputy with a final figure on how much in EU or Exchequer funds were invested and how much was unused at the end of the Programme. Present estimates from my Department suggest that in the region of &euro;0.9 million in EU funds were unused, giving a drawdown rate of 98%.  This would be a very successful outcome for any EU funding programme and will compare very favourably with other Member States.  It is worth noting that all of the funds available were awarded to investment projects, but inevitably some do not proceed, while others do not avail of the full amount of funds offered to them.  When this happens in the final year of the Programme there is no scope to re-allocate funds to other projects. </p></reply>

That Plan proposes 24 actions to drive the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector and grow production in the sector by 45,000 tonnes by 2023.  The Plan targets a 30% increase in production derived from recirculating aquaculture systems.  Considerable international developmental effort is being put into determining the commercial viability of land based RAS systems for the large scale production of salmon.  There appears to be a market niche for such a product if the current technological challenges associated with an economically viable production system can be overcome.  On 14 January 2016, the new Aquaculture &lsquo;<i>Knowledge Gateway Scheme&rsquo;</i>was launched as part of my Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;<i>EMFF Seafood Development Operational Programme&rsquo;</i>.  I have provided BIM with a budget of &euro;8.2 million for that Scheme.  In close collaboration with aquaculture enterprises and researchers, the Scheme aims to develop knowledge, innovation and technology in the aquaculture sector to ensure its sustainable development.  An important part of the focus of the Scheme will be the applied research and development required into RAS, identified on page 66 of the National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development. </p></reply>

Evidence suggests that the sector can have a significant impact on local economies as businesses are typically owner managed and may be closely linked to local farms.  The emergence of Ireland&rsquo;s artisan food sector, supported by growing consumer demand for niche products and a strong entrepreneurial spirit, has generated many new small food companies. Most are owner managed, frequently have a farming basis, and produce diverse products, demonstrating high potential for innovation.  These &lsquo;artisan&rsquo; businesses are defined as micro-enterprises with a turnover of up to &euro;2 million, employing fewer than 10 people and producing food in limited quantities (weekly average under 1,000 kg or litres ) using skilled craftspeople, a traditional method, and characteristic ingredient(s) produced within 100 km ( FSAI Guidance Note 29 ).</p>  <p>  The FoodWise 2025 strategy recognises the value of this sector and its potential for development and employment.  A number of artisan businesses have to date participated in successful programmes such as Food Academy (developed by Bord Bia, Local Enterprise Offices and Musgraves/Supervalu) and Food Works ( developed by Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland) which have generated new business.  Several artisan businesses are full members of the Bord Bia Origin Green sustainability initiative and many have participated in Bloom, Marketplace and other fora which link producers up with buyers and support them in demonstrating their own capability and the quality of their food and drink products.</p>  <p>  Within the artisan sector, the farmhouse cheese sector includes over 50 cheese-makers producing more than 150 types of cheese valued at over &euro;12 million per annum at farm gate level.  My Department is supporting a three year programme managed by Bord Bia under the EU Promotion Scheme to promote and increase awareness of farmhouse cheese.  It is projected that with the overall increase in milk production following the abolition of milk quotas, farmhouse and specialty cheese output could increase to just over 4,500 tonnes per annum worth around &euro;33m without requiring significant additional capital expenditure.  Growth prospects for the sector are positive overall, driven by increased consumer interest in the provenance of food, environmental concerns, health and a desire to support the local economy.</p></reply>

Farmers have the option of lodging their application themselves or through an authorised agent.  Online application involves a range of advantages for farmers, which help to ensure the continued efficient and effective delivery of these vital payments.  An additional advantage for on-line applicants this year will be the implementation of preliminary checks. Under this provision on-line applicants will be informed, within a specified time frame, of a number of common land errors (over-claims, dual claims and overlaps) and be given the opportunity to avoid area penalties as would have been applied in previous years.  Since the introduction of on-line applications in 2007 my Department has worked closely with both farmers and authorised agents to make the on-line system more user friendly.  New features have been introduced including the on-line updating of maps.</p>  <p>  The position with regard to the receipt of BPS applications is subject to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 809/2014 which sets out specific requirements with regard to geo-spatial (online) aid applications for the Basic Payment Scheme.  The regulation sets out that Member States shall provide for geo-spatial (online) applications, and that 75% of beneficiaries in 2017 and all beneficiaries in 2018 must apply online.  My Department has already reached the 2017 target in 2016.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that these regulatory requirements are met, my Department has been moving certain categories of farmers to online application in 2015 and 2016.  This process will continue as we move towards the 2018 regulatory target.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises the challenges faced by certain applicants, including those who are not familiar with the use of the technology that is required, in using the on-line system to lodge BPS applications.  Accordingly, my Department has put in place a comprehensive system of support for online applicants via a dedicated helpdesk and one to one assistance for applicants lodging on-line applications at a number of regional locations in the spring of this year and at its offices in Portlaoise over recent weeks.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to providing more targeted supports to applicants as the process continues to ensure access to the Basic Payment Scheme is not impeded.</p></reply>

This scheme provides a payment to eligible young farmers for a maximum period of five years from the year the young farmer sets up a holding in their own name.  The Young Farmers Scheme payment is made on a maximum of 50 entitlements and is calculated as 25% of the national average payment per eligible hectare which gives a payment of approximately &euro;68 per entitlement held by the young farmer.  My Department received almost 9,000 applications under the Young Farmers&rsquo; Scheme in 2015. To date some 8,800 of these applications have been fully processed.

The Programme for Government reflects our commitment to helping this sector develop.  The sheep sector is the third largest farming sector in Ireland with over 34,000 producers and exports worth &euro;230 million in 2015.  It makes a vital contribution to our rural economy.  In relation to a further direct payment per ewe, the Programme for Government has made a clear commitment to providing &euro;25 million for a new sheep support scheme under the RDP.  My Department is currently examining the matter.  Consultation with farm bodies will commence shortly, with the intention of submitting an amendment to the RDP as soon as possible, so that a new scheme can be provided for in Budget 2017.</p>  <p>  Any such scheme must contribute to the long term development of the sector, and will be subject to parameters laid down in the Rural Development Regulation and to EU Commission approval.</p></reply>

Agri food exports account for 7% of GDP and continue to grow year on year.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation and new EU food information regulations which were adopted by the Council of Health Ministers in December 2011.  However, my Department plays an important role in the enforcement of this legislation under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  Currently my Department is assisting our colleagues in the Department of Health on the drafting of a new Statutory Instrument to bring the labelling of loose pigmeat and poultry into line with the origin labelling rules for packaged meat brought in on April the first 2015.  This will require businesses who sell meat loose in their premises to clearly identify the country of rearing and slaughter of the animal from which the meat is derived.  Once the SI has been finalised my Department will arrange for it to be put on the Technical Regulation Information System for notification to all EU Member States and following on from the obligatory three month stand still period I would be confident that the Minister for Health will be in a position to sign the SI, bringing it into force.</p><p>Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators.  The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement.  This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b></b>Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied.  In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have systems to identify any person who supplies the business with a food, and a system to identify other businesses to which their product has been supplied.  This is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.  There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.</p><p>My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants. Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment.  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating in EU Member States and third countries. Labelling and documentary checks are routinely conducted by the Department.</p><p>The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department. Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance.  Inspection finding reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

To help deal with this situation, a new control framework was introduced by the European Commission.  One of the important new tools was introduced under  Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy (the EU Fisheries &ldquo;Control&rdquo; Regulation), which requires Member States to inter alia have in place legal provisions to implement a Points system for serious infringements of the EU Common Fisheries Policy.  The number of points to be attributed for specific infringements is fixed at EU level.  The EU requirement is that every time a serious infringement is committed, the appropriate number of points will be attributed to the licence holder of the vessel concerned.  This EU Points system is applicable to all fishing vessels which fish in the Irish exclusive fisheries zone, whether they are Irish or Foreign flagged<i>.</i></p><p>Ireland had previously implemented the required EU Points system for serious infringements by fishing vessel licence holders by means of Statutory Instrument No. 3 of 2014 which gave effect to the EU requirement in Irish law.  This Statutory instrument was the subject of two recent High Court challenges and was struck down.  The two High Court Judgements are subject to appeal at the advice of the Attorney General.  There are a number of broad legal reasons for the appeal which go beyond fisheries.  From a fisheries perspective the concerns relate to<i></i>the potential implications the judgements may have on the efficient and effective implementation of the points system in Ireland in the future.</p><p>As Ireland is required to have in place a legal instrument implementing the EU Points system a new amended legal instrument was drafted, following the advice of the Attorney General, which took on board, to the extent possible, issues of concern in relation to procedures and process which had been highlighted in the High Court Cases<i>.</i></p><p>The previous Minister was faced with a difficult choice when the Court struck down the previous regulation implementing the EU points system.The approach he chose was taken to support the vast majority of law abiding fishermen depending on healthy fish stocks.  The alternative would have exposed law abiding Irish fishermen to the serious consequences of illegal overfishing by a small number of Foreign and Irish fishing vessels, thereby threatening the future of our industry.  The previous Minister, accordingly, signed the replacement legal instrument, with amended procedures and processes, (S.I. No. 125 of 2016 - European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2016) on 1 March 2016<i>.</i></p><p>The Deputy refers to the UK system under which, as I understand, points are applied to <i>inter alia </i>an English-registered fishing licence if the licence holder is convicted of a serious infringement in a UK court.  There have been proposals that the EU points system in Ireland should similarly be combined with a successful prosecution through the Courts.On the surface, this appears like a reasonable option and it was examined carefully.  However, the legal advice received was that this approach does not meet the legal requirements set down by the EU points system, in the context of the Irish legal system.</p><p>Firstly, in the majority of infringement cases, the Licence Holder is a different person or legal entity to the person on the vessel (the skipper) who commits an offence and who will be prosecuted.  Therefore, there is no connection between the assignment of points to the Licence holder and the prosecution by the Courts of offences under fishery law.  In addition, the EU regulations require that points be assigned from the date of the detection of the 'serious infringement' and will remain on a licence for three years from that date.  That requires that the procedures are sufficiently swift to be determined in as short a time as possible.Fishery prosecutions under the Irish legal system, taking account of the Constitutional provisions, may take some considerable time before they are finally determined and if the EU points are linked to the completion of the prosecution, they would have limited impact as the three year timeframe would be well advanced or indeed may well have expired.</p><p>The previous Minister considered all of the concerns raised by the Deputy, other Deputies and by the fishing industry in relation to the implementation of the EU points system for serious infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy.  He met with representatives of the fishing industry to discuss this and other matters as recently as last week and the issue was also discussed in this House in the context of Statements on Agriculture on 4th May 2016. </p><p>As outlined in those Statements, the previous Minister has asked in recent weeks the Attorney General, as a matter of urgency, to examine the Statutory Instrument which he signed into law at the beginning of March.  He asked her, in particular, to consider the issue of whether there is a way that the assignment of points for licence holders can await the completion of the prosecution process, while at the same time ensuring that Ireland is fully in compliance with its obligations under EU law.  I am following up on this request. </p><p>It is my intention to report back to An Oireachtas as soon as I have received the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice and I have examined a way forward in the context of that advice.  Subject to that advice together with an assurance that Ireland is fully in compliance with its obligations under EU law<i>, </i>and as outlined in the new Programme for a Partnership Government, I would be open to amending the current SI to move further to meet the concerns raised in particular in relation to the assignment of points following the completion of the prosecution process.</p><p>The current SI has been in force, however, since 1 March 2016 and this remains the position.  My understanding is that no points have been assigned or recorded to date there under.</p><p>Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that I plan to bring forward primary legislation to <i>inter alia</i>give a sound legal basis to a scheme that implements the EU points system for licence holders. This will enable An Oireachtas to examine options and arrangements that meet EU regulatory requirements.</p><p>Finally, the EU Control Regulation requires Member States to implement two points systems to be applied in cases of serious infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy, one for the Fishing Boat Licence Holder (as outlined above) and one for the Master of the Fishing Vessel.

In the case of fish or fishery products coming from a non EU country, excluding Norway, Iceland and Switzerland, these must go through an approved Border Inspection Post (BIP) at the first point of entry into the EU   where health checks are carried out by official veterinarians of the Department.  The identity and documentation of all products are checked at the first point of entry into the EU and some products are checked physically. </p>  <p>In order to import fish or fishery products into Ireland from a non EU country the person who wishes to import fish/fishery products is required to register with the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA).  The SFPA and the Border Inspection Posts operate an agreed sampling plan, which is reviewed annually, to ensure that they meet the EU criteria with respect to potential contaminants, and for the presence of any medical residues or where there is concern that the product may not be fit for human consumption.  In accordance with EU regulations, the plan is based upon the nature of the products and the risk they represent, taking into account all relevant monitoring parameters such as frequency and number of incoming consignments and results of previous monitoring.   </p>  <p>  The SFPA was set up by the Oireachtas under the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 as the independent Authority for the implementation of sea-fisheries and seafood law from boat up to but excluding retail level (on fishing vessels, in shellfish production areas, in establishments handling preparing and processing seafood).  The outcomes of the monitoring procedures are an operational matter for the SFPA in which the Department has no direct role.  I have asked the SFPA to provide import figures for live lobster directly to the Deputy. </p>  <p>  In terms of disease control for fish or aquaculture animals, EU certification requirements in relation to these animals apply as follows:</p>  <p>- Commission Regulation 1250/2008 &ndash; requirements for the import of fishery products, live bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods intended for human consumption or</p>  <p>- Commission Regulation 1251/2008 &ndash; conditions and certification requirements for placing on the market and the import into the Community of aquaculture animals and products thereof and laying down a list of vector species. </p>  <p>  In these circumstances any aquaculture animals coming in from the US for human consumption or for further farming would come with a certificate issued in line with the relevant regulation. If the relevant certificates were not in place, the animals would be rejected by staff at the BIP. There are presently no aquaculture farms for crustaceans in Ireland.</p>  <p>  With regard to labelling of fish, specific provisions concerning consumer information set down in Council Regulation 1379/2013 on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products which came into effect in December 2014 and are transposed by S.I. 121 of 2016 &ndash; European Union (Labelling of Fishery and Aquaculture Products) Regulations 2016 . Products to which the regulations apply must provide the specified information including the common and scientific names of the fish, the production method (whether the fish is caught or farmed), category of fishing gear for wild fish, whether the fish was defrosted and date of minimum durability where appropriate.  The Regulation also requires detailed catch area information for some catch areas (FAO fishing area 27 and FAO fishing area 37), i.e. the name in writing of the sub-area or division listed in the FAO fishing areas, as well as the name of such zone expressed in terms understandable to the consumer, or a map or pictogram showing that zone.  Additional information set out in the Regulation, including details of the flag State of the vessel that caught the products, can also be provided on a voluntary basis.  The provisions of the Regulation apply in addition to the Food Information Regulation 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to the consumer.</p></reply>

When finalised there will be some 6,000 successful applicants under the 2015 National Reserve.  Due to the high level of successful applicants under the scheme in 2015, all of the available National Reserve funding will, in all likelihood, have been utilised.    For 2016 the only source of funding available to the National Reserve will be from &lsquo;clawback&rsquo; on the sale of entitlements without land and indications are that the level of funds that will arise from &lsquo;clawback&rsquo; during the 2016 scheme year will be minimal.  The Regulations also provide that Member States may apply a linear cut to the value of all farmers&rsquo; entitlements in order to provide funding for the National Reserve.  My Department has recently been in consultation with the Direct Payments Advisory Committee, which includes members of the main farming bodies and advisory services, in relation to the 2016 National Reserve and a final decision is pending.</p>  <p>  From 2017 onwards the National Reserve will be replenished from unused entitlements, as EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that entitlements that are unused for two consecutive years are surrendered to the National Reserve.  Decisions in relation to a National Reserve for 2017 will be considered once the position on potential funding arising from unused entitlements and clawback has been established.</p></reply>

Under the terms and conditions of this Measure, emergency flood damage relief compensation is available to farmers under 3 categories;</p><p>a) loss of livestock, </p><p>b) damage to fixed agricultural structures and fittings, and </p><p>c) the necessity to move livestock to alternate housing (excluding the cost of feed).</p><p>During a verification check of the person&rsquo;s application, it was apparent that the damage/losses described did not fall within these categories.  Therefore, the application concerned could not be considered for aid under the Measure.

As part of this process a follow up ground check on the parcels in question, namely 13729301 and G13729302, was undertaken to clarify issues regarding the eligibility of the lands.  In January 2015 officers of my Department inspected these lands and identified that there was no agricultural activity being carried out resulting in the lands being ineligible for payment under the 2014 Direct Payment Schemes.</p>  <p>  In relation to the designation of lands, only part of one of the parcels (G13729302) is designated as a Special Area of Conservation.  Notwithstanding this designation, as officers of my Department had determined that there was no agricultural activity present on either parcel, the provisions relating to eligibility under the Direct Payment Schemes and the specific provisions attaching to designated lands cannot be considered in this case.</p></reply>

This review concluded that this policy is in the best interest of stakeholders and the bovine traceability system in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The single supplier policy is deemed to be the optimum mechanism for ensuring that ear tags are made available to Irish farmers at a competitive price on the grounds that a single supplier, selected on the basis of a competitive tender and benefitting from economies of scale, is likely to make bovine tags available to herd keepers at the most competitive price, while at the same time meeting the identification requirements of the bovine sector in Ireland for superior quality bovine tags.  This policy has been endorsed by the main farming organisations.</p>  <p>  I am currently considering this matter further and my Department will publish a Request for Tenders (RFT) shortly.</p></reply>

The overall framework for a new CFP was agreed by the European Commission, European Parliament and the Council of Ministers in 2013.  The Review of the Policy had commenced in 2009 and was the subject of active consultation and debate over the 2009 to 2013 period.  The Policy is thereby set and the arrangements for the setting of Quotas, the management of fisheries, the introduction of the phased implementation of the landing obligation and the responsibilities of Member States are all set out within the settled Framework of the new CFP.  The proposal suggested by the Deputy on behalf of one group of fishermen must be considered in this context.  </p>  <p>  The Demersal Discard Plan to apply for 2016 was unanimously agreed by all Member States of the North Western Waters Group and submitted to the EU Commission in May 2016.  It has since been evaluated by the Scientific, Technical, Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and approved by both the European Parliament and the full Council of Ministers.  The Member State Group worked in close consultation with the industry body, North Western Waters Advisory Council, representatives of which attended each meeting of the North Western Waters Group at Director and Technical level since January 2016.</p>  <p>  The Landing Obligation for demersal species is due to come into effect from 1 January 2016 and will apply to all TAC species by 2019.  This period of phasing in was a key plank in the negotiations of the new CFP Reform and was pushed strongly by Ireland to avoid a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; and to allow time to adjust behaviour.  The North Western Waters Advisory Council (NWWAC) advised that they also wanted to avoid a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; in 2016 or 2019.  In line with this, the Member States are committed to a progressive and incremental introduction of the landing obligation over the period 1 January 2016 to 1 January 2019.  The landing obligation will be phased-in for other fisheries in the years leading up to 2019, when it will apply to all stocks.</p>  <p>  Only certain demersal stocks will be subject to the landing obligation in 2016.  For Ireland the stocks affected this year are Nephrops (Prawns) in Area VII, Whiting in the Celtic Sea, and Haddock in the Irish Sea and West of Scotland.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the landing obligation is to gradually phase out the dumping of perfectly good fish at sea and to end the catching and discarding of juvenile fish.  If discarding can be gradually reduced and ended it will rapidly allow stocks to rebuild so that there will be higher quotas of commercial fish available to Irish fishermen, thereby underpinning their future.</p>  <p>  The proposal from the Deputy is not a matter of national policy choice for Ireland and would not be in keeping with the legal requirements set out in the Landing Obligation and the wider Common Fisheries Policy.  The new CFP continues to rely upon clear Quota outtake limits for Member States and imposes clear legal obligations for Member States to respect those quota limits.  National legislation continues to require vessel licence holders to respect the appropriate quota limitations applicable to their vessel.   </p>  <p>  I would like to also note that at the December Fisheries Council in Brussels, which determined the TACs for 2016, the values of whitefish and prawn quotas available in 2016 were increased for the third consecutive year.  Stocks which were coming under the Landing Obligation in 2016 were granted additional quota uplift for 2016, to reflect the changed policy in respect of those Stocks.  The overall 8% increase in quota for prawns, which would otherwise have been subject to a 2% decrease in line with the scientific advice, includes a 10% quota uplift to support the introduction of the discards ban.  Similarly the 26% increase in Celtic Sea whiting includes quota uplift as does the 40% increase in the Irish Sea Haddock Quota. </p>  <p>  Finally, earlier this year, we launched new funding schemes to support the implementation of the landing obligation.  Those schemes provide for a &euro;241 million investment in the seafood sector and are co-funded by the EU. Support for the implementation of the new CFP and the landing obligation is an important part of this investment programme.</p></reply>

It involves an assessment of the &lsquo;level&rsquo; of the award in terms of the comparable level on the National Framework of Qualifications and a review of the course content.</p>  <p>  I am advised that Teagasc reviewed the National Diploma in Land based Technology from the Reaseheath College on behalf of the individual concerned.  It was deemed comparable to a level 5 award on the National Framework of Qualifications.  The course content was found to be orientated towards agricultural mechanisation/engineering and not agricultural production as required for SD2B equivalence. </p>  <p>  As the Diploma is not of equivalent standard in terms of content and level of award, Teagasc advised the person in question that he is required to complete the Green Cert programme to meet the minimum education requirement.</p></reply>

I&rsquo;m committed to working with all players in the sector here to address these issues and ensure that we have a sustainable dairy sector going forward.  I was one of the proposers of the Dairy Forum and I will be ensuring that it continues to meet to discuss relevant issues of concern to farmers and others.  The Forum has come forward with some good initiatives for farmers already, including an initiative on improving cashflow planning at farm level, which will be rolled out shortly. </p>  <p>  The price of milk and dairy commodities is determined by a range of factors, including supply and demand at international level.  Food commodity markets including dairy markets have been characterised by significant levels of volatility for a number of years and this trend has continued throughout 2015 and into 2016.   Factors contributing to global price volatility in 2015 included the Russian Ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers, including the EU on the supply side.  The longer term demographic and demand perspectives remain positive, but there is no doubt that 2016 will be a challenging year.   </p>  <p>  Dealing with price volatility is a major challenge for the sector.  The Single Farm Payment provides some measure of income stability, and EU market support measures will have a role to play.  These measures are not enough on their own, however.  The sector needs to look at measures to reduce costs on farms, and at the development of new tools, including fixed price contracts, futures markets and more flexible financing arrangements for farmers.  I expect all of the stakeholders in the sector, including processors and banks, to play an active role in the development of such instruments.   </p>  <p>  Production decisions are made by producers, taking prevailing market conditions as well as their efficiency of production and price of inputs into account.  The challenge posed by price volatility has been highlighted by my Department and others over a number of years, and indeed my Department has, including through its agencies, invested significant resources in providing farmers with advice and technology designed to improve on farm efficiency, reduce production costs, and make farm businesses more resilient in times of downward price pressure.  The abolition of dairy quotas in April 2015 allows farmers the freedom to make these production decisions on a commercial basis.   </p>  <p>  That said, support must be offered to the sector in times of market difficulty . In this respect, I very much welcome the EU Presidency conclusions on a package of support measures to address challenges in the dairy and pigmeat sectors agreed in Brussels at Council in March.  This follows on from an earlier package of measures agreed in September of last year and takes account of the ongoing difficulties in the sector, where the duration of market downturn has gone well beyond previous expectations.   </p>  <p>  The package includes a number of proposals by Ireland to the Commission in advance of Council, in particular the doubling of the intervention ceiling for skimmed milk powder and butter. </p>  <p>  In terms of input costs at farm level, Ireland has called on the Commission to consider temporarily suspending EU import tariffs on fertilisers.  I understand that the Commission is examining this request at present.  At national level, I will continue to support the work of Teagasc, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation and Animal Health Ireland to increase on farm efficiency and reduce input costs.  The EU Presidency conclusions also refer to the possibility of advance payments under CAP, as was done in 2015.  In addition my Department recently paid   &euro;26.4m in direct aid to dairy farmers, co-funded by the exchequer and the EU, to assist with liquidity and cash-flow issues on dairy farms. </p>  <p>  I also welcome the proposal for the European Investment Bank (EIB) and member states to work together with the Commission on the feasibility of an EU export credit tool.  My Department will continue to engage with the Irish banking system to ensure there is a full appreciation of the temporary impact of downward price volatility on farm enterprises which are financially sound in the medium term. </p>  <p>  It remains clear that we need to deal urgently and effectively with this temporary problem.  We must ensure that EU farmers are protected from the worst impacts of low commodity prices in an appropriate way, but remain well placed to avail of emerging opportunities when markets recover.  Ireland is strongly positioned as a competitive producer of dairy, and while conditions are extremely difficult at present, Irish dairy farmers will be well placed to avail of the opportunity presented by market recovery in due course.</p></reply>

Among these was the making available of more flexible state aid support. </p><p>It will now be possible for farmers (SMEs) to access temporary finance up to a maximum amount of &euro;15,000 per farm per year in circumstances where they either:</p><p>(i) make a commitment to freeze or reduce production compared to a given reference period, or</p><p>(ii) use the funds to bridge a liquidity gap.</p><p>Aid as provisionally envisaged would be granted in the form of direct grants, loans or guarantees in the case of freezing/reducing production, and in the form of loans or guarantees in the case of liquidity assistance (remunerated in the form of an interest payment).  The latter could also be provided in grant form if accompanied by a commitment to freeze or reduce production.  Interaction and discussion with the Commission is ongoing in respect of finalising the details of such provisions.</p><p>The Department is continuing to monitor market developments very closely, and will continue to work with the Commission and with other Member States in developing appropriate responses. </p><p>Member States now have a suite of measures that have been made available since September 2015, and will respond in accordance with their domestic circumstances.  To date Ireland has used the targeted aid package of &euro;27.4m (&euro;13.7m EU and &euro;13.7m national funding) to support producers in the dairy and pigmeat sectors, and has pushed for appropriate changes in the operation of market support measures such as aids to private storage.</p><p>There are no plans to avail of the option to provide national funding to freeze or reduce milk supply compared to a given reference period.  On the question of liquidity, the Department is at present commissioning an ex ante appraisal to examine the merits of including a provision for financial  instruments in its Rural Development Programme, and is continuing to  engage with banks and with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland on the provision of flexible finance to farmers.</p></reply>

Farmers availing of the facility must pay at least one third of the bill in each of the first two years (2015 and 2016) with the balance to be paid in 2017.</p><p>The Department implemented the scheme nationally and 3,741 farmers (out of a total of 6,109 farmers who incurred the levy) deferred repayments of &euro;35.6m in superlevy liability, (out of a total national levy liability of &euro;71.2m). </p><p>The mechanism required the Exchequer to pay the superlevy liability to the EU in full in 2015, and to recover the levy from farmers over the three years from 2015 to 2017.  A wide process of consultation in the design of the scheme was undertaken with farm organisations and co-ops and it was agreed that once the initial farmer instalment was paid in 2015, the optimum repayment model for the balancing payments would involve ten equal instalments from the months of May-September in 2016 and 2017. </p><p>These amounts will be deducted by co-ops from a farmer&rsquo;s <font color="#1F497D"> </font>monthly milk cheques to coincide with the peak milk supply months of April to August.  The co-ops will then forward the money each month to the Department.  This approach was also agreed as part of the sanction given by the Minister for Public Expenditure Reform.</p><p>As part of the discussions in the run-up to the March Council of Agriculture Ministers, Ireland proposed a further deferral of the payment to 2017 and 2018, to ease the financial burden on liable farmers in 2016.  However the European Commission advised that the legal basis for the Regulations under-pinning the scheme are no longer in existence and therefore further amendments were not possible.  While Ireland suggested a possible alternative legal approach, it was clear that the proposal enjoyed very little support from other Member States and was therefore unlikely to succeed. </p><p>On that basis the focus turned to other measures in the package which can be of assistance to Irish dairy farmers to help them through current difficulties, including the doubling of intervention fixed price buying-in thresholds.  I did however raise the matter with Commissioner Phil Hogan in our bilateral meeting last week and encouraged him to reflect again on whether a legal basis could be found to facilitate a further deferral in superlevy repayments for farmers.</p></reply>

A letter issued to the persons named notifying them of this decision and giving the option of appeal to GLAS section.  This decision was unsuccessfully appealed to GLAS Section and the persons named have been informed in writing of the outcome and of their right to appeal this further to the Agriculture Appeals Office (AAO), Kilminchy Court, Portlaoise.

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  </p><p>It is expected that 70% of all premises in Ireland will receive high speed services from the commercial telecommunications market.  The remaining 30% (over 750,000 premise) are the focus of a major State procurement, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ( 'PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum.  </p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map 2020, which is available at <i><i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i></i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area.  </p><p>The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that all of the 1.6m premises, where commercial operators have committed to providing services will have access to High Speed Broadband of at least 30mbps.  The areas marked AMBER  represent the target areas for the State Intervention.  </p><p>Based on information provided by commercial operators, 100% of the townland of Kenmare, and 31% of the townland of Kenmare Old, County Kerry, will be covered by commercial operators.  The remaining 69% of the townland of Kenmare Old, County Kerry will be part of the State intervention. Members of the public can see whether their individual premise is in the BLUE or AMBER area by inserting their Eircode, and/ or address, or scrolling through the map.  </p><p>The Intervention Strategy sets out a detailed service specification including a requirement that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of at least 30mbps download and 6mbps upload.  It must also be capable of catering for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with consumer demand.  The intention is to build out the network in the AMBER area as quickly as possible.</p><p>In terms of the procurement, five responses have been received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March 2016.  The five responses are being assessed in line with the criteria set down by the Department with a view to shortlisted qualified bidders proceeding to the next stage of procurement.  </p><p>The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to shortlisted bidders.  I expect that my Department will move to this stage in the next month. The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process. Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the Intervention Strategy document.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s).  It is expected that a contract will be awarded by June 2017.</p><p>Rollout will commence once the contract is in place.  Based on the industry consultations, it is expected that 85% of all premises in Ireland will have access to high speed broadband within 2 years after the rollout commences, with 100% being connected within 5 years or sooner.</p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business need and / or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.</p><p>I am in discussion at present with Minister Heather Humphreys on the detailed arrangements to give effect to commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government regarding her Department&rsquo;s role in relation to the rollout phase of the National Broadband Plan.  It is envisaged that the role will include leading on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces and working with local authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

In pursuit of these objects RT&Eacute; and TG4 are charged, inter-alia, with ensuring that programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of Ireland and &ldquo;have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular the Irish language&rdquo;.  RT&Eacute; and TG4 publish detailed commitments on an annual basis setting out how they intend to meet their public service obligations and objects as set out in the Act.  The extent to which the commitments entered into by the two public service broadcasters have been met is reviewed annually by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI).</p>  <p>  Radio and television services, additional to those provided by the national public service broadcasters are matters for the BAI, which is an independent statutory body.  Matters in relation to broadcast content on commercial radio are the subject of contractual negotiations between the BAI and commercial radio operators.  In submitting their initial licensing applications to the BAI, such broadcasters put forward commitments in regard to how they will deal with a range of broadcast issues including public service commitments and, where appropriate, more specific commitments, for instance, in regard to the playing of Irish music.  If they are successful in their licence applications, these commitments form part of the terms and conditions of the relevant broadcaster's actual licence.</p>  <p>  This policy approach deals with the differing requirements of commercial and public service broadcasting.  While I fully support the promotion of Irish music in our broadcasting services, the policy approach taken to this issue must be consistent with EU and Irish regulatory structures.  It is also important that it takes account of the right of broadcasters to determine the type of programming and content they wish to broadcast, subject, of course, to meeting relevant licensing and legislative obligations.</p></reply>

It is subject to a requirement to secure access to the required radio spectrum by way of licence.  The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of ComReg under the Communications Regulation Act, 2002 as amended, and accordingly I have no function in this matter.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the independent role of ComReg, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the establishment within 100 days of a mobile phone and broadband Taskforce which will consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.  I am in discussion with my colleague the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht in this regard and arrangements are being made to put this in place as a matter of priority.</p>  <p>  I am advised in the meantime that licences issued by ComReg apply terms and conditions on Mobile Network Operators, such as quality of service and minimum population coverage obligations.  Responsibility for both monitoring compliance and addressing non-compliance with such obligations rests with ComReg.  The design of the individual networks is a matter for the operator concerned, although operators tend to exceed their minimum coverage requirements for commercial reasons.</p>  <p>  The provision of services to all customers can be affected by several factors given that mobile telephone services are a radio based technology and therefore services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets, the capacity of the network and proximity to mobile telephone antennas.</p>  <p>  Any customer, including those in Cavan and Monaghan, who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance.  If this fails to resolve matters, customers can refer a complaint to ComReg, who will investigate the service provider&rsquo;s compliance with its contractual obligations.  My Department understands that two mobile operators are in the process of upgrading their networks in the Monaghan and Cavan area.  Further significant investment, particularly in 4G technology, is planned throughout 2016.  Upgrades to mobile networks can cause temporary disruptions to coverage, as new equipment is installed and commissioned.  The positive outcome of such disruption is, however, a deployment of an improved service.</p>  <p>  Local Authorities also have an important role to play in terms of facilitating the siting of necessary infrastructure such as masts and antennae.  The Telecoms and Internet Federation, part of IBEC, has been proactive in seeking to meet with Local Authorities and public representatives to fully discuss the various issues around mobile coverage and the factors that can impact on the quality of service consumers&rsquo; experience.  I would encourage all Local Authorities and public representatives to engage with the Telecoms and Internet Federation on these important issues.</p></reply>

Both my Department and the Road Safety Authority (RSA) are engaged in promoting awareness of the Rules of the Road and safe practice on our roads for all road users.  This includes promoting awareness of cyclists and other vulnerable road users among motorists, as well as promoting safe cycling practice among cyclists.  Fixed charge notices were introduced for cyclists in July 2015.  The RSA, my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all publicised the introduction of these fixed charges for offences for cyclists and the RSA continue to publicise the fixed charges including through social media on an on-going basis.</p>  <p>  The current Road Safety Strategy, running from 2013 to 2020, contains a number of measures to ensure greater safety in cycling.  These include education to promote the use of personal protection equipment and high visibility clothing, the provision of which is heavily funded by the RSA, and developing a standardised road safety cycling proficiency training programme for schools.</p>  <p>  My Department is funding the development and roll-out of "Cycle Right" the new national cycling training standard, developed by Cycling Ireland with the involvement of stakeholders including the RSA, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, An Taisce (who operate the Green Schools Scheme), Coaching Ireland and Local Authorities.  "Cycle Right" training aims to give trainees the confidence, skill and road safety knowledge to use their bike to get places safely.  Over a series of stages, cyclists will increase their proficiency and safe journeying on the road network.  A key element to this training will be the rules of the road.  "Cycle Right" will roll out nationally in primary schools from September 2016.</p></reply>

Ireland, in common with the vast majority of Eurocontrol's 41 States, subscribes to this practice.</p><p>A breakdown by country of all exemptions from en-route charges is included in the latest Eurocontrol Report on the Operation of its Route Charges System in 2015, published in March 2016. This Report is available on Eurocontrol's website at the address indicated below.</p><p>In relation to the reply to Parliamentary Question 146 of 5 May 2016, the reference to the wider aviation safety and economic benefits was made in the broader context of the benefits accruing to civil aviation activity from the collaborative and cooperative approaches inherent in Ireland's membership of Eurocontrol.</p><p>Eurocontrol is an intergovernmental organisation currently comprising 41 European States and as such provides a key forum for cooperation and collaboration between States at a detailed technical level in the provision of air navigation services for almost 10 million flights per annum in European airspace. Aviation is inherently an international business, hence the overarching necessity for cooperation and collaboration between those States in organising the detailed arrangements to be applied to international flights. It is not a practical proposition for an individual State to contemplate instituting its own aviation safety or economic arrangements in isolation from the practices and procedures being developed and implemented on an ongoing basis at a multilateral level in an organisation such as Eurocontrol.</p><p>In terms of Ireland's role in the overall Eurocontrol context, we have a pivotal geographical position between North America and continental Europe. Irish controlled airspace acts as a gateway for aviation between these two continents and in 2015 the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA), on behalf of the State, safely and efficiently managed over 1 million flights. This equated to an average of 2,811 flights every day managed by the IAA at Irish State airports, through Irish controlled airspace and on the North Atlantic. This level of activity generated some &euro;183 million in turnover to the IAA in 2015, nearly all of which was collected by Eurocontrol and remitted to the IAA.</p><p>In this context, whilst there is a monetary cost arising from the exemption of military flights from en-route charges, it is considered that these costs are more than offset by the value of the benefits flowing from Ireland's position as a gateway for transatlantic aviation, as organised through our membership of Eurocontrol.</p><p>​Note: The Eurocontrol Report is available at:</p><p><i></i>.</p></reply>

As part of this additional funding, the Government also proposes to double the funding available for the Rural Walks Scheme from &euro;2 million to &euro;4 million to increase the number of walks covered from 40 to 80.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government recognises the achievement of the Wild Atlantic Way and other tourism initiatives in revitalising tourism and demonstrates the Government's commitment to achieving the tourism policy goals set for 2025.

Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded from these monies is a matter for each local authority.  In this context my Department does not have a recent application in relation to the completion of the northern relief road in Ennis.</p>  <p>  Given the cutbacks in State funding for regional and local roads since the financial crisis, it has been necessary to curtail the grant programme for major new regional and local road schemes and for major realignment schemes in order to protect the funding available for the maintenance of the existing network.  It has not, therefore, been possible to provide funding for a range of road improvement schemes.</p>  <p>  The Capital Plan published by the previous Government in September 2015 provides for the gradual build up in expenditure on the maintenance and improvement of the road network over 7 years.  The bulk of expenditure is scheduled to be spent on maintenance of the road network with some limited investment in new projects.  A Northern Relief road for Ennis is not one of the projects included in the Capital Plan.</p>  <p>  When allocating grant funding my Department has emphasised that the commitment of local authorities to contribute significantly from their own resources towards the cost of improving and maintaining the regional and local roads network is essential and that full consideration needs to be given to utilising the Local Property Tax to boost own resources expenditure on regional and local road maintenance and renewal.</p></reply>

The Strategy is fully in line with the Capital Plan and will be instrumental in the development of the new National Planning Framework which will promote higher urban densities in terms of housing design, particularly in public transport corridors.  Outcomes include reduced travel times on the strategic road network, an increase in sustainable travel modes from 44% to 55% for commutes and the facilitation of more efficient use of land within the GDA.</p>  <p>  Under the 2008  Act the NTA must review the transport strategy every six years following publication.  The Act also requires the NTA to now prepare an integrated implementation plan which must be submitted within 9 months.  That plan will set out how the NTA proposes to implement the Strategy over the next 6 years and will be subject to a full public consultation in advance of seeking my approval.</p></reply>

Under EU legislation, Ireland issues licences only to people whose 'normal residence' is in Ireland.  'Normal residence' is defined in EU law in the first instance by a person residing for more than 185 days of the year in a given EU Member State.  However, the EU definition allows that, where a person divides their time between two countries, with personal ties in one and work in another, they are deemed to be 'normally resident' in the country to which they have personal ties, provided that they return regularly to the country of normal residence.  Irish citizens normally resident in this jurisdiction but temporarily abroad for work purposes may renew their Irish driving licence  by post, without having to appear at an office of the National Driver Licensing Service.</p>  <p>   Ireland has an exchange arrangement for driving licences with Australia.  An Irish driving licence holder who takes up residence in Australia may therefore apply in Australia to exchange their Irish licence for an Australian one.  Were they to return to Ireland at some point in the future, they would be able to apply to exchange the Australian licence for an Irish one.</p></reply>

This followed on from the recommendations of a Value for Money Review of Exchequer support for the Regional Airports Programme, which took into account a number of factors including the performance of the services and the need to make best use of limited Exchequer resources.  Exchequer subvention for PSO air services on the Derry/Dublin* route from 2006 to 2011 is set out in the table:<table><tr><th>​PSO subvention&euro;'000</th><th>​2011</th><th>​2010</th><th>​2009</th><th>​2008</th><th>​2007</th><th>​2006</th></tr><tr><td>​Derry/Dublin</td><td>1,387**</td><td>​2,416</td><td>​2,376</td><td>​2,390</td><td>​2,589</td><td>​2,467</td></tr></table></p><p>*Note: For the years 2006-2011, the Derry/Dublin PSO route was operated together with the Knock/Dublin PSO route under a single contract. Contractual payments for services provided on both routes for the years in question were: 2006 - &euro;3,979,121 ; 2007 - &euro; 4,176,383 ; 2008 - &euro;3,895,500 ; 2009 - &euro; 4,242,970 ; 2010 - &euro; 4,314,996 ; and 2011 - &euro;  2,477,537.

The type approval system currently in place for trailers provides for the type approval certification of heavy trailers (over 3.5 tonnes) when first registered in the State; while light trailers (3.5 tonnes or less) must be type approved at the point of sale.  Light trailers cannot be sold without type approval certification.</p><p>Recognising a general absence of harmonised consumer protection-related market surveillance activities across the EU in relation to the sale of vehicles and their components, on 27 January 2016, the European Commission transmitted a proposal to the European Parliament and the Council (Com 2016/31) relating to the &quot;approval and market surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles&quot;.</p><p>In an effort to ensure effective operation of the internal market and fair competition, the proposal introduces, for the first time, market surveillance provisions into the type-approval framework for motor vehicles with four or more wheels and their trailers.</p><p>Once the proposal has been adopted and becomes an EU Regulation, Ireland will appoint a market surveillance inspectorate to carry out appropriate market surveillance activities for such vehicles and their trailers.</p><p>Currently, the timing for the adoption of the aforementioned proposal is unknown and a decision has not yet been taken as to the body who will be appointed to perform this role in Ireland.</p></reply>

A particular strength of the incubators in regional areas is that they provide a focal point for entrepreneurship.  They deliver significant job creation and add value to the local economy with 94% of incubated companies remaining in the local area post-incubation.  An independent impact review of the Programme undertaken in 2014 reported that the campus incubators have generated a return of &euro;3.61 in company turnover for every &euro;1 invested by the State. </p>  <p>  The campus incubators are now providing critical ecosystems and supports for start-up companies across the country.  However, many of the incubators have outgrown their initial space requirements, as the demand for campus incubator space for knowledge-based start-ups has continued to increase. </p>  <p>  In order to continue to meet the objectives of the Programme, Enterprise Ireland opened a Call for Proposals in June 2015 for the extension of incubation facilities in the Institutes of Technology.  The budget package available was sufficient to fund only three of the strongest incubator extension proposals received in the Call.  In light of the highly competitive nature of such a Call the Innovation Centre at the Institute of Technology Sligo was not successful on this occasion.  The funding available for future Incubator extension Calls will be reassessed when Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s 2017 budget allocation is made known.</p></reply>

Achieving this objective at regional level will require a renewed focus on building on the strengths and assets of each region to develop the attractive and competitive environments for business to start, grow and succeed on international markets and to attract inward investment.  We started the process of rebuilding the capacity of the regions with the roll out of eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs during the past year.</p>  <p>  The initiative builds on the success of the national Action Plan for Jobs, through encouraging regional stakeholders - including enterprise agencies, Local Authorities, higher education institutions, other public bodies and the private sector - to come forward with innovative ideas to boost job creation in their own region.  The contributions from Local Authorities, regionally based agencies and the private sector are significant and important components of the Regional APJs, reflecting a more &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; process than the national APJ.</p>  <p>  In this context, the Action Plan for the North East/North West identifies collaborative measures that will enable the region as a whole to realise its economic potential and create jobs.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan was launched on 30 November last and aims to deliver 28,000 extra jobs in the counties of Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Louth, Monaghan and Cavan by 2020.  Key targets in service of this overall goal are to achieve an increase of at least 25% in the number of start-ups in the region; a 25% improvement in the survival rate of new businesses; an increase in the number of IDA investments in the region by 30-40% up to 2019; and an increase of 300 to 500 in the numbers of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta supported jobs in the North West. </p>  <p>  A Regional Implementation Committee has been established, composed of key stakeholders in the region who will work in concert with Enterprise Champions - nominated senior private sector representatives - to oversee and monitor progress.  </p>  <p>  The first Progress Report on the implementation of the North East/North West Action Plan for Jobs will be completed in Q3 2016.</p>  <p>  The issue of the establishment of an Atlantic Economic Corridor is a much broader concept and not a matter, in the first instance, for my Department.</p></reply>

In 2015 alone, they were responsible for the creation of nearly 12,000 additional net new jobs in the country.  Total employment by overseas companies in Ireland now stands at over 187,000, meaning that more than one-in-five private sector jobs are now either directly or indirectly the result of foreign direct investment.    </p>  <p>  While this already represents a vital economic contribution, the Government is committed to growing the multinational sector even further.  That is why IDA Ireland has set ambitious targets of securing 80,000 new jobs, winning 900 further investments and increasing companies&rsquo; expenditure on research and development to &euro;3 billion by 2019.  The Government&rsquo;s view is that these goals can be best achieved if multinational companies in Ireland focus on what they do best: expanding their core business, creating jobs and opportunities and investing in the local economy. </p>  <p>  Solving the housing crisis will be a priority for the Government.  That is already evident in the appointment of a Minister for Housing.  Multinational companies will play their own part in this process by improving the State&rsquo;s economic position through contributing to the exchequer and creating employment across the country.  In 2014, IDA client companies paid a total of &euro;2.8bn in company taxation to the exchequer, which represents a very significant direct financial contribution to the national finances.</p></reply>

These include the launch of the JobsPlus and the Start Up Refund for Entrepreneurs (SURE) scheme and Budget 2016 in particular focused on incentivising innovative startups, rewarding successful entrepreneurs and sustaining investment and jobs in existing businesses.  Among the new pro-jobs taxation measures in Budget 2016 were:</p>  <p>- Reduced Capital Gains Tax rate of 20% for successful entrepreneurs</p>  <p>- Reductions in the USC affecting middle-income workers and creating jobs</p>  <p>- Income tax credit of &euro;550 for self-employed people, with improvements in future years</p>  <p>- Knowledge Development Box, which is globally &lsquo;best in class&rsquo; and the first OECD-compliant scheme with a competitive rate of 6.25% on qualifying income, benefitting large companies and SMEs</p>  <p>- Extension of tax relief for start-up companies</p>  <p>- Improvements to the Employment and Investment Incentive scheme to increase availability of investment finance for business. </p>  <p>  We have launched the Action Plans for Jobs Regionals, which together with a fund of &euro;250m will seek to ensure that all regions of the country benefits from the economic recovery underway.</p>  <p>  A Trade &amp;amp; investment mission and networking lunch will take place in Sligo on May 18, 2016.  The purpose of the event is for IDA clients to meet and network with Enterprise Ireland clients to encourage sales, opportunities and collaboration.  To date 18 Multinational Companies are attending, 12 of these are taking 1-1 meetings.  Some 43 Enterprise Ireland companies are registered with a total of 72 1-1 meetings scheduled to take place.</p>  <p>  To date in 2016, Enterprise Ireland has approved over &euro;1,867,162 and made payments of &euro;369,241 to its client companies in County Sligo and Leitrim.  In 2015 payments of &euro;1,326,846 were made to companies in Sligo and Leitrim.  This was primarily to support new business employment, R&amp;D, capital investment and staff training.</p>  <p>  A Competitive Start Fund which was announced for applications for start-ups based outside of County Dublin for those active in the Manufacturing &amp;amp; Internationally Traded Services sectors opened on Wednesday 3rd June 2015 and closed on Wednesday 17th June 2015.</p>  <p>  Competitive Feasibility Funding assists new start-up companies or entrepreneurs to investigate the viability of a new growth-orientated business proposition which has the potential to become a High Growth Potential Start-up (HPSU).  A Competitive Feasibility Fund for the North West was launched on February 9, 2015 with a closing date of March 3, 2015.  11 applications were received and 3 projects, 2 from Sligo and 1 from Donegal, worth a total of &euro;62,500 were put forward for approval at the May 8, 2015 Enterprise Ireland Investment Committee.</p>  <p>  The New Frontiers programme is being run in conjunction with IT Sligo and Letterkenny IT and is designed to provide ambitious entrepreneurs with the necessary business skills to establish a successful global business.  The overall objective is to incubate 10-12 export focused businesses across the Region each year.  Phase 2 of the 2015 programme finished in February 2016 with 16 participants each receiving &euro;15,000 to assist and develop their business over the six month duration.  There are four participants from Sligo and three from Leitrim on the programme.  Recruitment is currently underway for Phase 1 of the 2016 programme.</p>  <p>  IDA actively promotes Counties Sligo and Leitrim for mobile FDI investment.  However, the final decision on where to locate an investment does, and always will, ultimately reside with the client company.  Regular engagement and collaboration with stakeholders is also important in positioning any regional location to attract FDI.  IDA continues to do that as well as continues to work with existing clients in all regional locations to strengthen their base in the Region whilst looking to develop new mandates and generate additional jobs.  </p>  <p>  Currently there are 38 existing multinational companies based in the North West (Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal), employing 5,379 across the Region (Annual Employment Survey 2015) which is an increase of 291 jobs over the previous year which indicates a strong performance by the existing client base.  </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is committed to Regional Job Creation and in this respect is targeting a significant uplift in the number of investments for each region.  Specifically in the Region, IDA is constructing an advance facility in Sligo which is due for completion at the end of 2016 and which will enhance our value proposition for the Region.</p></reply>

The co-ordinated response across all of Government has made significant progress in helping to create jobs and to reduce unemployment across the economy.  There are now 1,929,500 people in employment, an increase of 41,300 people at work over the past year (CSO QNHS Q1 2016).  Our enterprise development agencies have each reported a record performance in 2015, with IDA Ireland supporting the creation of 18,983 direct new jobs (11,833 net), and Enterprise Ireland supporting the creation of 21,118 new jobs (10,169 net). </p>  <p>  The Knowledge Development Box (KDB), introduced in Budget 2016 forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s competitive offering to continue to attract FDI and to support Irish owned companies to innovate and to compete effectively on international markets. </p>  <p>  The continuing imperative to establish Ireland as the best place in which to succeed in business is reinforced in our national Enterprise and Innovation strategies.  Our aim is that Ireland will be recognised as the place where businesses are innovative, competitive and productive &ndash; leading to growth that is sustainable and results in employment opportunities and a higher standard of living for all.  These strategies set out the framework for investment over the coming decade to ensure that Ireland remains equally attractive to foreign direct investment and to Irish entrepreneurs and growth businesses in the context of an intensely competitive international environment.   </p>  <p>  The KDB complements the existing suite of initiatives and supports available to companies that undertake R&amp;D activities in Ireland across the lifecycle of research and development &ndash; including R&amp;D tax credits, RD&amp;I grant supports, support for technology acquisition (S291A), significant state investments in National Research Centres and knowledge transfer infrastructures, and advisory supports for accessing Horizon 2020 funding &ndash; providing a competitive proposition for business investment. </p>  <p>  Ireland is the first country world-wide to introduce an OECD compliant KDB offering. The certainty, predictability and clear signal that this sends to enterprise &ndash; including both Irish owned and foreign owned entities establishing and doing business from here - remains essential.  The OECD nexus approach sets out the principles and guidelines under which income arising from IP assets can qualify for a lower rate of tax under a KDB initiative.  Ireland&rsquo;s KDB rate is 6.25 percent (half of the corporation tax rate of 12.5 percent) and is internationally competitive. </p>  <p>  It is important to reinforce that Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to its 12.5 percent corporate tax rate is clear and that there are no changes to our 12.5 percent corporate tax rate.  As set out in the roadmap for Ireland&rsquo;s Tax competitiveness, Ireland will continue to structure its corporation tax system on the basis of:</p>  <p>- Rate: Ireland remains totally committed to the 12.5 percent corporation tax rate;</p>  <p>- Regime: A system that is open, transparent, predictable and built upon substance; and</p>  <p>- Reputation: a system that plays by the rules</p>  <p>  Our competitive offering in relation to corporate tax will be complemented by key non-tax related differentiators in terms of skills &amp;amp; talent, innovation and quality of place.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment (written or verbal), on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees, including entitlement to the national minimum wage.  The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 defines a contract of employment as a contract of service or apprenticeship, or any other contract whereby an individual agrees with another person to do or perform personally any work or service for that person.</p><p>All employers, including those in private homes, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law.  </p><p>Under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, certain reckonable components may be taken into account to determine an employee&rsquo;s average hourly rate.</p><p>In this context, if an employer provides an employee with full board and lodgings, or lodgings only or full board only, a monetary allowance can be included as reckonable pay.  (The term &lsquo;full board&rsquo; means an entitlement to meals during the day), as follows:</p><p>- &euro;54.13 for board and lodgings per week, or &euro;7.73 per day;</p><p>- &euro;32.14 for board only per week, or &euro;4.60 per day;</p><p>- &euro;21.85 for lodgings only per week, or &euro;3.14 per day.</p><p>The inclusion of this provision in the National Minimum Wage legislation was recommended by the Inter-Departmental Group on Implementation of a National Minimum Wage.  It was the view of the Inter-Departmental Group that the monetary value of the allowances for the purpose of the National Minimum Wage would not be set at market value but rather would be similar to the amount provided for in Employment Regulation Orders. </p><p>The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 (National Minimum Hourly Rate of Pay) Order 2000 (SI No. 95/2000) provided for the amounts specified.  </p><p>There are currently no plans to make changes to these provisions.</p></reply>

There were decreases in Furnishings, Household Equipment and Routine Household Maintenance (-0.5%) and Communications (-0.4%).  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is the statutory body responsible for the enforcement of competition and consumer protection law in the State as well as advocating on behalf of consumers, with particular functions in areas such as research, information, advocacy, awareness and information for consumers.

This includes the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, the Payment of Wages Act 1991, the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2001, the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001, the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 and the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012.  I understand the dispute at issue relates to proposed changes to employee contracts that set out their terms and conditions of employment.  I also understand that the parties have had some engagement with the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery and would like to assure the Deputy that the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court if required remain available, to assist in this dispute and I welcome the suspension of proposed industrial action to allow further talks to take place.</p>  <p>  Even what often appears to be the most intractable of disputes is capable of resolution where both sides engage constructively and in good faith in this voluntary process.  The principle of good faith implies that both sides in a dispute make every effort to reach an agreement and endeavour, through genuine and constructive negotiations, to resolve their differences.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, whether in redundancy or other collective disputes, rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement mechanisms to support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment (written or verbal), on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees, including entitlement to the national minimum wage.  The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 defines a contract of employment as a contract of service or apprenticeship, or any other contract whereby an individual agrees with another person to do or perform personally any work or service for that person.  All employers, including those in private homes, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law.  </p>  <p>  Under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, certain reckonable components may be taken into account for all workers to determine an employee&rsquo;s average hourly rate.</p>  <p>  In this context, if an employer provides an employee with full board and lodgings, or lodgings only or full board only, a monetary allowance can be included as reckonable pay.  (The term &lsquo;full board&rsquo; means an entitlement to meals during the day), as follows:</p>  <p>-  &euro;54.13 for board and lodgings per week, or &euro;7.73 per day;</p>  <p>-  &euro;32.14 for board only per week, or &euro;4.60 per day;</p>  <p>-  &euro;21.85 for lodgings only per week, or &euro;3.14 per day.</p>  <p>  The inclusion of this provision in the National Minimum Wage legislation was recommended by the Inter-Departmental Group on Implementation of a National Minimum Wage.  It was the view of the Inter-Departmental Group that the monetary value of the allowances for the purpose of the National Minimum Wage would not be set at market value but rather would be similar to the amount provided for in Employment Regulation Orders. </p>  <p>  The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 (National Minimum Hourly Rate of Pay) Order 2000 (SI No. 95/2000) provided for the amounts specified.  </p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to make changes to these provisions.  However, I am very conscious of the passage of time since these rates were set and I will keep this in mind in my consideration of this issue over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Since 2011, the Government has launched a range of measures to improve the competitiveness of the economy, to provide a range of supports for the start-up and growth of small business, to reduce red tape and other costs, and to get credit to good businesses to support the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new ones.</p><p>These measures, across a range of policy areas and agencies, are captured in the Annual Action Plan for Jobs, which ensures a consistent and comprehensive approach to supporting business development.</p><p>The newly launched Regional Action Plans will ensure that at local level, all of the necessary supports are available to encourage new business start-ups and development and that job creation is spread evenly across the country.</p><p>In one particularly acute area of policy &ndash; namely the ability of small businesses to access finance &ndash; we have introduced a number of measures in recent years notably the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme and Microfinance Ireland.</p><p>We will continue to listen to the needs of small business through the Small business Advisory Group, as well as the Retail Forum, both of which are chaired by my Department.</p><p>As a small open economy, sustainable long term economic growth is dependent on continued success in international markets.  Our policy focus is on export led growth in the first instance, driven by innovation, competitiveness and productivity. </p><p>We know from the progress achieved in restructuring the economy since 2011 that a competitive export-led enterprise base is at the heart of Ireland&rsquo;s longer term economic growth prospects.  The potential to reach 2.180 million in employment by 2020 is based on the premise of export-led growth and would see an additional 266,000 people at work from a 2014 base.  Our strategy is to build up all sectors in the economy and to ensure that progress is balanced across the country.  With limited financial resources, it is also important that our strategic interventions and supports have a particular focus on deriving the maximum impact and national economic value.  We must minimise the risks of investing in deadweight projects that would have happened in any event and in the displacement of one business with another.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s role is to create the right conditions needed for sustainable, rebalanced economic growth.  Markets can&rsquo;t function without impartial regulation and enforcement of contracts, effective competition policy and the rule of law. So our role is about providing leadership and setting direction, setting the right policy frameworks and investing selectively.  Government also provides direct supports to businesses that meet the necessary criteria but grants are only available to enterprises with the capacity to export.  This has always been an important policy principle which shall remain.</p><p>Since the 1990&rsquo;s it has been acknowledged that the attraction of foreign direct investment must be complimented by a clear national effort to develop and grow our own domestic base of exporting companies and to develop clear national advantage in key sectors of strength.  We will compete by increasing productivity, by developing higher-end products and services, and by being the first to tap into new niche markets.</p><p>Our indigenous enterprise policy is focused on supporting a greater number of start-ups with better survival rates, more Irish owned companies of scale, more companies increasing their investment in research, development and innovation to boost their competitiveness, and more enterprises exporting across a range of markets.  The challenge of the new Government is to prioritise where we will place further efforts to best effect over the coming years - so that we continue to achieve positive results and make a difference to our enterprise sector.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland is the body charged with developing the indigenous exporting company base.  With an annual budget of &euro;300m EI provides direct grants to business and takes equity in start-ups with potential.  It supports management capability and innovation in companies that want to grow, supports the provision of seed and venture capital to enable more high quality start-ups to expand and it invests in the R&amp;amp;D capability in third-level colleges and the commercialisation of research.</p><p>We have a narrow base of exporters and not enough Irish firms growing internationally.  We have endeavoured to align our policies and invest in those areas that will support longer term sustainable enterprise growth and stability.  These policies are working well.  Export intensity in Irish owned enterprises has increased from levels of 37% of total sales in 2003 to 51% in 2014, showing continued improvements in our indigenous firm capacity, capabilities and competitiveness.  Enterprise Ireland has in recent years established a Potential Exporters Division to help Irish companies to look outside the domestic market.</p><p>Another major policy initiative in recent years has been the creation of the Local Enterprise Offices as the &lsquo;first stop shop&rsquo; service for all entrepreneurs and micro- businesses. LEOs can offer information and advice on setting up or expanding a business, including the variety of supports available. They can offer &lsquo;soft supports&rsquo; in the form of training or mentoring and in certain circumstances can offer financial support or referral to Microfinance Ireland loans. </p><p>Finally, I should mention that the range of supports to budding entrepreneurs and small businesses are available via the online Supporting SMEs Toolkit which can be accessed at .</p></reply>

Seasonal workers are often engaged on a part-time basis, and the Protection of Employment (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 provides robust protections for such workers.  It provides that a part-time employee cannot be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time employee regarding conditions of employment, and that all employee protection legislation applies to a part-time employee in the same manner as it already applies to a full-time employee.  The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 which provides that fixed-term workers may not be treated less favourably than comparable permanent workers may also be of relevance in the context of seasonal workers.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the University of Limerick was appointed in February 2015, following a competitive tendering process, to carry out a study into the prevalence of zero hour contracts and low hour contracts in the Irish economy and their impact on employees.  The study, published in November, 2015, found that zero hour contracts as defined within current Irish employment rights legislation are not extensively used in Ireland. It found low working hours can arise in different forms in employment contracts, such as regular part-time contracts with fixed hours or a contract with &ldquo;If and when&rdquo; hours only or a hybrid of the two. If and when contracts are contracts where workers are not contractually required to make themselves available for work.</p>  <p>  The UL report made a range of recommendations relating to contracts, hours of work and notice, minimum hours, how contracted hours should be determined, collective agreements, data gathering and wider contextual issues.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that the UL study was an independent study and the conclusions drawn and the recommendations made in it are those of UL.  Therefore, it was essential that the various stakeholders who contributed to the study and indeed other interested parties who may not have had an opportunity to engage with UL, were given an opportunity to consider and respond to the report. </p>  <p>  To this end, my Department sought submissions from interested parties by way of a Public Consultation.  A large number of submissions were received by 4 January 2016, the closing date for receipt of such submissions.  The responses contain a variety of views both for and against the findings and recommendations as made by UL, which require, and are currently being given, careful consideration by my Department.  This will inform the policy response to be considered by Government arising from the study.</p></reply>

Under these EU rules, this is the only part of Meath where IDA Ireland can provide this type of support to such companies. In addition to this support, IDA Ireland can also provide grants for research, development and innovation, as well as for upskilling staff.  These grants can be provided to companies elsewhere in Meath as well as in Kells. SMEs can also be supported to set up and expand throughout Meath, facilitated by Enterprise Ireland and the Meath Local Enterprise Office.</p>  <p>  In 2015, there were 1,571 IDA Ireland-supported jobs in Meath, up from 1,552 in 2014.  There were 6,855 Enterprise Ireland&ndash;supported jobs in the county for the same year, which was a net increase of 387 from 2014.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland markets Meath as part of its Mid-East region, along with Kildare and Wicklow.  There were nine IDA Ireland-sponsored site visits to the county in the last two years.  For reasons of client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity IDA Ireland does not comment on site visits by individual companies or on site visits to specific locations.  As Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s core focus is supporting the internationalisation of indigenous companies, it does not arrange site visits of a type similar to IDA Ireland.</p>  <p>  Already this year, two large investments in Meath have been announced by client companies.  In April, Facebook announced the construction of the company&rsquo;s newest data centre in Clonee.  In the same month Shire plc announced plans to expand its global biotechnology manufacturing capacity with the creation of 400 jobs in Piercetown.</p>  <p>  In 2014, there were a number of smaller announcements for Kells, through the combined efforts of Connect Ireland and IDA Ireland, with the creation of 50 jobs.</p></reply>

Under the Regional Plan, Enterprise Ireland launched a competitive call, the Community Enterprise Initiatives Fund, with a budget of &euro;5 million over two years, which focused on community-driven enterprise initiatives and how all the local players, public and private, can work together to maximise job creation.  The Fund was open to organisations or groups of organisations with innovative ideas to create jobs, promote entrepreneurship, boost innovation or enhance exports.

I have no direct role in the setting of liquidators fees.  However, the procedure for fixing a liquidator&rsquo;s remuneration is on a statutory footing (section 646 of the Companies Act, 2014).  Accordingly, the terms upon which a liquidator has an entitlement to remuneration are set by the creditors or the committee of inspection (for court ordered windings-up or creditors&rsquo; voluntary windings-up) or by members (for members voluntary windings-up).  There is also a residual power for the court to set remuneration, or appoint a person to fix the amount of remuneration if it is not so set.  Liquidators must seek to have their entitlement to remuneration set as soon as possible after being appointed.  Provision has also been made regarding the terms upon which a liquidator&rsquo;s entitlement to remuneration may be varied and ensures that no variation may, without the consent of the liquidator, reduce the entitlement of the liquidator to remuneration for work that may already have been performed.</p>  <p>  The role of a liquidator is one requiring skill and knowledge of company law.  The purpose of a liquidator is to wind up a company in an efficient fashion and to ensure that the rights of shareholders and creditors (including employees) are met.  Furthermore, the functions and powers of a liquidator are potentially of a great importance in the detection of breaches of company law, the prosecution of such breaches and enforcement of company law generally.  The significance of the role of liquidators is reflected in the new requirement that a person standing for appointment as a liquidator must have specific qualifications and indemnity insurance.</p></reply>

Preliminary screening is aimed at establishing the appropriateness of the referral to Tusla services and, if necessary, is followed by an initial assessment of the concern to determine the best course of action for the child and their family.  Over half of all referrals received by Tusla are welfare concerns and Tusla's policy is to refer these to relevant family and community support services.  At any stage, if a determination is made that there is abuse, whether physical, emotional, sexual or neglect, from which there is an ongoing risk of harm, the child protection pathway is followed.  A social worker works with the parent/s to support them provide safe care for their child.  In a minority of cases this may lead to the child being placed on the Child Protection Notification System (CPNS) or the child being received into care.  I wish to assure the Deputy that Tusla deals immediately with emergency cases, including for instance, if a child has been abandoned or is in immediate physical danger or at immediate risk of sexual abuse. </p>  <p>  Figures for 2014 show that there were 24,954 child welfare concerns and 18,676 child protection concerns received by Tusla.  Information on the number of referrals is available for the first nine months of 2015, with a total of 18,873 child welfare concerns and 13,730 child protection concerns received in that period.  Referrals come from a number of sources so there are some duplicates in these totals, and some will be more appropriate for universal services, such as those provided in the community or health sectors.</p>  <p>  An open case is one which is assessed as needing a dedicated (allocated) social work service.  The priority or category of high, medium or low given to the case after a preliminary enquiry, is based on information received on the case.  At the end of February 2016, a total of 20,262 open cases had an allocated social worker while 5,694 were waiting to be allocated a social worker.  Of those awaiting allocation 902 were deemed to be High Priority.  It is important to note that "High Priority" should not simply be equated with risk.  These cases represent a mix of new referrals that need further assessment and social work input, as well as children known to Tusla who need a continuing social work service. The additional funding of &euro;38 million which the Government has allocated to Tusla for 2016, will give the Agency greater capacity to respond to identified demand and to alleviate pressures being faced in areas such as unallocated cases.  </p>  <p>  In addition to services provided by Tusla and its own complaints mechanism where specific issues may be raised, the child welfare and protection services are overseen, inspected and regulated by independent bodies, the Ombudsman for Children and the Health Information and Quality Authority.  CORU regulates health and social care professionals and deals with registration and complaints regarding social workers.  My Department also maintains regular contact with a range of non-governmental bodies to consult on any particular areas of interest or concern that may arise in the sector.</p></reply>

These services for children are currently provided by arrangement with the HSE.  The Agency and the HSE have in place both a Memorandum of Understanding and a Joint Protocol for inter-agency collaboration which underpins the provision of these services for children.  The purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding is to set out the partnership agreement between the HSE and the Agency to continue pre-establishment levels of service across both organisations.  The objective of the Joint Protocol is to specify a pathway and associated responsibilities for children and families whose needs cross between Health Service Divisions and the Agency.</p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that it intends to re-engage with the HSE with a view to developing a Service Level Agreement to assist the Agency in fulfilling its statutory obligations.  The Service Level Agreement will determine the quantum of services needed to meet the Agency's requirements.</p>  <p>  Children have access to publicly funded child and adolescent mental health teams and primary care psychology services provided by the HSE. Additionally there are a number of services commissioned by social work departments around psycho-therapeutic supports.</p>  <p>  Clinical psychology services are also directly provided by Tusla within multi-disciplinary teams deployed by the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS).  Services provided include assessment and focused interventions for children and young people with complex clinical needs and high risk behaviours.

Policy responsibility for children applying for asylum travelling with their parents, insofar as it extends to my Department, is in relation to providing care and protection for any children where their welfare and safety are identified as a concern. </p>  <p>  The Direct Provision system is also under the policy remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Children living in Direct Provision are in the care of their parent(s).  Concerns about the welfare, safety or well-being of a child in Direct Provision are reported to the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, in line with Children First guidelines.  Tusla has been working closely with the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of the Department of Justice and Equality, which has responsibility for direct provision.</p>  <p>  The needs of children in Direct Provision include education, preschool, medical and health issues.  Tusla provides a range of services that offer advice and support to families.  This includes the services of family support workers, social workers, youth workers, family resource centres, support groups and counselling services. </p>  <p>  The Child and Family Services Unit within RIA is headed up by a seconded member of Tusla and links are made to the HSE, GPs, Tusla and voluntary and community groups as necessary.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Working Group on the Protection Process including Direct Provision published in June 2015, includes a range of findings and recommendations concerning the development, welfare, protection and education of children.  One of the recommendations states that, &lsquo;Tusla and HSE should identify a named social worker on their respective child protection, mental health and primary care teams to be the identified lead social worker for a Direct Provision centre in their area.'  I am happy to say that Tusla has agreed to implement this recommendation to support an improved co-ordinated approach to concerns about the welfare and safety of children living in Direct Provision.</p>  <p>  Children, separated from their parents, who arrive in this jurisdiction and are seeking asylum, are placed in the care of the State.  The majority of separated children are placed with foster carers around the country.  Tusla has a dedicated Social Work Team which deals with separated children seeking asylum.  Separated children are a vulnerable group and the State is duty bound by international and domestic law to protect and provide for them in the same way as it does for children normally resident in the State. </p>  <p>  Under Tusla's 'Equity of Care Policy' regarding separated child in care, all children are allocated a social worker, who is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual statutory care plan for the child.  Tusla maintains the equity and equality of services to separated children vis a vis other children in state care and ensures that there is no differentiation of standard care provision, care practices, care priorities, standards or protocols.  All foster care organisations and residential centres are inspected against national standards.</p></reply>

Dublin, continue to deliver services focused on education and rehabilitation of all young people detained in order to address offending behaviour and to support their early re-integration into the community.  The development project recently completed in Oberstown includes a new purpose-built education, training and recreation unit.  This will ensure sufficient age and ability appropriate facilities to support the delivery, by Dublin and Dun Laoghaire Education and Training Board, of the necessary education and training services to young people in detention.</p>  <p>  The child care model of detention delivered in Oberstown provides for a range of rehabilitative supports for each child as part of an overall programme, with a strong ethos of school attendance, education and training and an emphasis on rehabilitation rather than on control and security.  An individual management plan is put in place for each child which includes an assessment to determine the need for more specialist intervention from the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS).  This is a national service that provides clinical services to children in detention and in special care, as well as short term interventions when the child returns to the community.  There are also a number of other therapeutic and education programmes delivered on the Oberstown campus which are aimed at addressing offending behaviour patterns by children.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that earlier community based interventions to divert young people from offending behaviour, such as the Garda Youth Diversions Projects and the Garda Diversion Programme are also in place in the community and come under the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I have also recently announced the award of a contract for a Bail Supervision Scheme for young people.

Applicants are generally provided with any non-identifying information that is available as soon as possible.  The person to whom the information relates must consent to the release of any identifying information.  However, consent is not required where this person is deceased.  I note that the woman seeking information is currently engaging with Tusla in this regard.  Tusla deals with a significant number of requests for information from birth parents and adoptees.  Since its establishment, Tusla has been working to bring local adoption services under the management of one national service in order to provide a more consistent and streamlined approach to adoption services.  An improvement plan was introduced to address the waiting list and as a result the waiting list and waiting times are reducing.  I also understand that Tusla gives priority to individual cases, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, including the age or health of the individual concerned.</p>  <p>  Work on drafting the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill is currently underway.  The Bill is intended to facilitate access to adoption information in so far as is legally and constitutionally possible.</p>  <p>  The Adoption Act 1952 provided a legal basis for adoption in Ireland and brought order to what had been the system of ad-hoc arrangements in lieu of formal adoption procedures up to this point.  However, before the introduction of the Adoption Act 1952 it is understood that there may have been informal arrangements in place.  Some people were placed in life long family care arrangements, where a child was in the custody of a person other than his or her parent or guardian and where no adoption order was effected.  These arrangements were never formalised. </p>  <p>  The Bill will provide that persons separated from their mothers at birth may apply to Tusla &ndash; the Child and Family Agency for information.  The Bill will provide that the Agency will seek to locate the person to whom the information relates to seek their consent to its release where there are records available.</p></reply>

The commitment shown by these organisations, their staff and volunteers in continuing to provide services is acknowledged and valued.</p>  <p>  Like all State agencies,  Tusla has reviewed the scope to make savings across various areas of expenditure and to ensure that services are developed where possible.  It has identified areas where resources need to be provided, and it has also identified areas where available funding can be used to better effect to support service delivery. The key focus has been on ensuring that services are streamlined and rationalised where necessary, with any overlap in service provision and duplication of costs eliminated while doing everything to protect front-line services to children including frontline rape crisis/sexual violence services.  </p>  <p>  Last year, Tusla maintained funding to all frontline rape crisis/sexual violence services at 2014 levels, and has made a similar commitment to maintain funding at 2015 levels for the current year.  Additionally, efforts to support service developments such as outreach services in the northern part of the country have been supported. </p>  <p>  Tusla is aware of the continued pressures and challenges for some funded organisations in maintaining service levels. However, Tusla has advised that it is not aware of any recent reductions in services to victims and survivors of sexual violence and is actively engaged with funded sexual violence services in supporting and enhancing service provision.</p></reply>

Since the economic downturn the limited funding available to this Department has been targeted to support the refurbishment and maintenance of childcare facilities in which there has already been considerable investment.  </p>  <p>  The Department announced earlier this year the introduction of an Early Years Capital Programme 2016 with total funding of &euro;4 million available.  This funding is targeted at early years pre-school providers that are making alterations to their services to accommodate the increased numbers of children eligible for the free pre-school provision following my decision to expand the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  The number of children availing of the programme will increase from approximately 67,000 per year to 127,000 per year following the full roll out of the expanded pre-school provision.  </p>  <p>  Last year, the Department established the Inter-Departmental Group to consider options for future investment in early years and after-school childcare and to set out a range of options for future investment which would enhance affordability, increase the accessibility and improve the quality of early years and after-school childcare.  </p>  <p>  Several recommendations of the Group, including a number which relate to after-school childcare, were considered as part of the Estimates process for the Budget and will also be funded in 2016.  These include a &euro;3 million capital fund, which will be provided to enable both community/not-for-profit and private providers to develop after-school childcare services using existing school and other accessible community facilities.  The terms and conditions for this &euro;3 million capital fund are currently being drafted.  </p>  <p>  A number of support programmes are implemented by this Department to support parents to access quality after-school childcare services.  These include:</p>  <p>  -  The After-School Childcare (ASCC) programme that provides after-school care for primary school children of eligible parents for a period of 52 weeks.  Eligibility for the programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  The programme contributes &euro;40 per week for an after-school place or &euro;80 per week in situations where the childcare service provides a pick-up service that collects the child from school.  The programme also provides a full day care rate of &euro;105 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  In all cases, the maximum fee payable by parents is &euro;15 per week per child.</p>  <p>  -  The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme, which is targeted specifically at participants in the Community Employment (CE) schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.  Under this programme, &euro;80 per week is provided for pre-school places for children up to the age of 5 and &euro;40 per week for after-school places for primary school children up to the age of 13, with a set charge of &euro;15 per week to the parent in either case.  The programme also provides a part time day care rate of &euro;80 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  Places are approved for 50 weeks.  Eligibility for the CEC programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  -  The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides childcare places, including part-time and after-school places, to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Boards (ETB) trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  Eligibility for the CETS programme is determined by the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  -  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare, including after-school care, at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.</p>  <p>  There is no funding available other than the programme funding outlined above, however, it should be noted that if a service is facing a crisis they should engage with this Department and their local County Childcare Committee (CCC) to see what assistance can be made available to them.  The Department will consider any subsequent future capital programmes subject to budget discussions.</p></reply>

The statutory duty of the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, is to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  There are many reasons for children coming into Tusla's care including abuse and neglect but disability alone, whether intellectual or physical, is not one.  </p>  <p>  Tusla provides child welfare and protection services to all children, including those with special needs.  I am advised by Tusla that children in care who have been diagnosed by a clinical specialist as having a moderate or severe disability avail of disability services operated by the HSE.  In some cases, this includes residential care provided by Disability Services.  </p>  <p>  It is Tusla&rsquo;s responsibility to respond to any concern or report of abuse or risk of abuse to any child, irrespective of a disability or whether they are at home, already in care or living in a HSE residential centre provided by Disability Services.  In such circumstances, Tusla will assess the child's situation.  Decisions by Tusla to apply for a care order with respect to a child with a moderate or severe disability are made at a multidisciplinary case conference where the views of professionals who have long established knowledge of the child and family are heard.  </p>  <p>  Placement is based on assessed need.  A child with a disability may be placed with a Tusla foster care family or residential unit and receive disability services.  Of the 6,398 children in care at the end of February 2016, 93% were in foster care.  Where a child is already attending a disability service it may be in the child's best interests to be placed in the disability service's residential care to allow for continuation of relationships, care planning and to avoid a disruption in placement when the child reaches the age of 18 and is discharged from Tusla's care.  Tusla and the HSE have a joint protocol for inter-agency collaboration which underpins service provision for children whose needs span health and child protection.  </p>  <p>When a child is adopted he/she is considered a child of the adopter(s) and may access the full range of services which are currently available to all Irish children.  These include specialist psychiatric and psychological services, health services and speech and language services.  Barnardos also provides professional supports to children adopted from abroad and their families who are living in the Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow area on a range of post adoption issues.  In other areas, Tusla Adoption services provide information on the availability of local services, access to the social work duty system and facilitate peer support groups for parents of adopted children.</p></reply>

Military vehicles undergo regular maintenance and overhauls to ensure that they are roadworthy.  It is not the practice to retain a vehicle in service if it is not considered roadworthy.  When, having regard to age, condition and mileage, vehicles are considered by military transport personnel to have reached the end of their economic life,<b></b>the vehicle is withdrawn from operational service and proposed for disposal<b>.  </b>Military vehicles are normally disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the &lsquo;End of life Vehicle Regulations&rsquo;.</p><p>I note that the organisation in question is seeking a vehicle to make regular road journeys.

However, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is to provide Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.</p>  <p>  In these circumstances a wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies and the Defence Forces hold regular coordination and liaison meetings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues.  </p>  <p>  In relation to non-security related emergencies, whilst the Defence Forces are not a Principal Response Agency as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) role.   </p>  <p>  At National level, representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, by both my Department and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency and that the command structure within the Defence Forces is compatible with the requirements in this area.  </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces are also represented on the eight Regional Working Groups that have been established under the Framework and, on an ongoing basis, designated members of the Defence Forces, based around the country, act as Liaison Officers to Local Authorities.  </p>  <p>  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is available for deployments in response to emergencies and natural disasters.  In this regard, the Defence Forces hold a wide range of engineering and transport plant and equipment for military purposes.  All such plant and equipment suitable for use in emergency situations is made available as the need arises.    </p>  <p>  In relation to the Naval Service, all vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that, in addition to their fishery protection role, they also undertake general surveillance, security, pollution monitoring, and Search and Rescue in support to the Irish Coast Guard, amongst other duties while on patrol.  These activities assist in detecting and preventing emergency situations throughout Ireland&rsquo;s maritime jurisdiction.  </p>  <p>  The role of the Air Corps includes the provision of an emergency inter-hospital Air Ambulance service in support of the HSE.  It is also supporting the HSE in an emergency aeromedical support service operating primarily in the West of Ireland.  The Air Corps also has a maritime surveillance function undertaken by its maritime patrol aircraft and both it and the Naval Service provide support to the Irish Coast Guard in maritime Search and Rescue operations.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces continue to be developed in line with requirements needed to fulfil all roles that are assigned to them by Government in any emergency situations that may arise.</p></reply>

The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services, the establishment of the Permanent Defence Force and available resources.  As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force targeted recruitment takes place so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels as set out above in accordance with available training capacity.  This approach is underlined by the recently announced General Service recruitment campaign, which was launched on 13 April 2016 with a closing date of 22 May 2016, and envisages an intake of 600 general services recruits in 2016 and a further 850 in 2017.  This recruitment will be phased over the 2016 and 2017 period in a manner designed to restore the established strength and plans are being put in place to this end.   Most of the new recruits this year will be drawn from the existing General Service panel.  A new panel will be established from the current competition.  Recruitment from this new panel is expected to commence towards the end of 2016 and will continue through 2017.  </p>  <p>  With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, it is intended to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</p></reply>

This was commonly known as &lsquo;pay parity&rsquo;.  Such pension increases normally required the prior approval of the Minister for Finance / Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p><p>Since then, there have been effectively no public service pay increases and, as a consequence, no pension increases either.  Rather, due to the fiscal crisis faced by the country, significant cuts to both public service pay and pensions were applied by way of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009-2013 (the FEMPI Acts).  </p><p>In respect of pensioners, including Defence Forces pensioners, the key FEMPI retrenchment measure has been the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR).  Introduced in January 2011, with deeper cuts to higher pensions applied from July 2013, the PSPR&rsquo;s progressive design provides that it has never applied to annual pensions below &euro;12,000, and at present no pension below &euro;18,700 is affected by PSPR.  By contrast, those employed as public servants all experienced pay cuts in 2010 regardless of salary level, together with a Pension Related Deduction (PRD &ndash; &lsquo;pension levy&rsquo;) applied since 2009 to earnings above &euro;15,000.</p><p>In tandem with gradual pay restoration under the &lsquo;Lansdowne Road Agreement&rsquo;, and as legislated in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015, a multi-stage part-restoration of the PSPR cuts to pensions is now in progress.  The initial focus is on the people in receipt of relatively low pensions who are impacted by PSPR.  This provides for a restoration of pension income affected by the PSPR on a phased basis over three years to most PSPR-impacted pensioners as follows:</p><p>-  From 1st January 2016 &ndash; return of &euro;400 per year</p><p>-  From 1st January 2017 &ndash; return of &euro;500 per year</p><p>-  From 1st January 2018 &ndash; return of &euro;780 per year.</p><p>It remains the position of Government that, in still-constrained fiscal conditions, pay and pension assistance measures for public servants and retired public servants should focus on the roll-back (part-reversal) of earlier FEMPI-delivered reductions (pay cuts, PRD, PSPR).</p><p>In the 2015 White Paper on Defence (Section 7.7) particular emphasis is given to a Veterans Policy.  This gives special acknowledgement to the service and contribution of our veterans and their continued active support of the Defence Forces.  It references the supports in place, and being developed, for former servicemen and servicewomen of the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

In this regard, the level of remuneration in the Defence sector has maintained relativity with the levels available in other related public sector employments.  The Deputy will be aware that the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009-2015 and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2018 (Lansdowne Road Agreement) define current pay policy.  A  scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for members of the PDF provides a formal mechanism for the PDF Representative Associations, RACO and PDFORRA, to engage with the Official side.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide a means for the determination of claims and proposals from the Associations relating to remuneration and conditions of service.  Since 1993, there have been significant developments and improvements in the pay and conditions of military personnel.  The Representative Associations have been to the fore in advancing the interests of their members in this regard, bringing them in line generally with the pay and conditions available in other public service employments.</p></reply>
