The group includes Local Enterprise Offices, IDA Ireland, Solas, Education and Training Boards, Department of Social Protection, MABS, Northside Partnership and the Citizens Information Bureau.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has been in contact with the company on a continuous basis regarding the assistance it could provide for restructuring to minimise job losses.  I have also had discussions with Mondelez at senior executive level and the company has committed clearly to me that it will invest in its operation here with the aim of achieving best in class production process.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland have met with representatives of the workers and provided information to help them formulate a counter proposal to the company.  Officials in Enterprise Ireland also met with Irish management and asked them to give serious consideration to the proposals being put forward by the workers.</p>  <p>  I also understand that management and employee representatives continue to discuss various aspects of restructuring at the plant and the Inter-Agency group and the Labour Relations Commission are available to assist in whatever way possible.</p>  <p>  I have already directed Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to step up their efforts to find alternative projects for the area affected.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland continues to work with the company to sustain its operations in Ireland and support any proposals that the company bring forward that would maintain or increase employment in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I continue to monitor this situation very closely.</p></reply>

While the national Unemployment Rate now stands at 9.7%, some areas - including the Border region &ndash; still have an Unemployment Rate above that level.  The Unemployment Rate for the Border region was 10.2% in the latest Quarterly National Household Survey published by the CSO.</p><p>To accelerate progress on the jobs agenda in the regions, last February, along with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, I announced details of the <i>Action Plans for Jobs: Regional</i>initiative which will build on the national Action Plan process and produce eight Regional Action Plans at NUTS III level.  </p><p>An EI or IDA Regional Manager has been designated in each region to lead a Project Delivery Team comprising the public sector bodies in the region.  The role of the Project Delivery Team is to help develop actions that can build on the strengths and opportunities of the region and to facilitate engagement with other regional stakeholders.</p><p>The Project Delivery Team for the Border region was established in March and two wider Stakeholder events were held in the region &ndash; one in Sligo on 26<sup>th</sup>March, and the second in Carrickmacross on 13<sup>th</sup>April.  In total, over 250 people from the enterprise sector and the public sector attended these two events.  Several hundred ideas for job creation emerged from these Stakeholder engagements.  My Department, along with the Regional Project Delivery Team, has been working through the proposals to identify those with the greatest potential for inclusion in the Action Plan for Jobs for the Border region.  Further follow-up engagement will be necessary with key regional stakeholders and with relevant Government Departments and agencies to finalise the actions and agree a timeline for their delivery. </p><p>The first two regional Action Plans for Jobs, covering the Midlands and the South West regions, were published in the last two weeks.  My initial objective was that the Action Plan for the Border region would be published by the end of this month.  However, as the Deputy is aware, the Border region has a number of unique characteristics which we are keen to ensure are properly addressed in finalising the actions in the Plan.  These include the wide geographical spread of the region, the distinct and different offerings of the North West and the North East of the region, and the trading relationship with the economy in Northern Ireland.</p><p>It is important that all of these factors are reflected in the Action Pan for Jobs for the Border region.  I now expect that the Plan for the Border region will be completed in September.</p></reply>

Because of our close trading links with the United States, Ireland would be a major beneficiary of such an agreement.  The independent  study commissioned by my Department carried out by Copenhagen Economics estimates that the benefits in Ireland would be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole, with a boost to GDP of 1.1%, which equates to about &euro;2.4 billion.  This would represent a benefit of more than &euro;1,200 per family.  The study points to particular opportunities in Pharmaceuticals, Medical devices, Food (especially dairy), Software and Public Procurement.</p><p>The EU Commission's mandate to negotiate with the United States provides that a mechanism for settling investor-state disputes could be included in a negotiated agreement, but that it would only be included if it met EU interests. </p><p>Investment protection agreements have not been a feature of Ireland's trade and investment policy because of the strong protection for investors under the Irish Constitution.  But all other EU Member States have them, and 9 Member States have them with the US.  The EU-US agreement would replace these.</p><p>The EU views this as an important opportunity to reform the system and to establish a model of arbitration for settling disputes under international investment agreements that would set new high standards, building on the significant reforms included in the EU-Canada agreement.  Some of the key principles of this reform include:</p><p>- Full protection for the right of Member States and their Parliaments to regulate in areas of public policy such as social, employment, environment, public health and safety issues;</p><p>- Cases could only be taken where there is denial of justice, a fundamental breach of process, targeted discrimination on manifestly wrong grounds, or manifest arbitrariness; </p><p>- Provision for the prior selection of the arbitrators by the EU and US sides from amongst persons qualified to be judges, with clear rules governing the arbitration process;</p><p>- An appeals mechanism; and</p><p>- Rules preventing investors from running cases both in the dispute settlement process and in the Courts. </p><p>The EU Commission has conducted widespread consultations to ensure that legitimate public concerns will be fully dealt with in any approach adopted. </p><p>These improvements are aimed at addressing the concerns with older investor dispute settlement agreements in order to create a new modern system of investment arbitration.</p><p>The inclusion of an acceptable model of ISDS would provide a common approach across the 28 Member States and at federal and state level in the US.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-15a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071500081#WRA01400"><p>I am not aware that there is a practice of trade union representative blacklisting by employers in Ireland.  I would consider blacklisting of workers for whatever reason as an unacceptable practice &ndash; particularly if it arose in relation to workers exercising their rights to take part in trade union activities.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that there are already legislative protections in place where workers are victimised by an employer for trade union activity. </p>  <p>  Section 6(1) of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 (as amended) provides that, in general, a dismissal shall be deemed to be unfair unless an employer can prove that there were substantial grounds justifying the dismissal.  In addition, Section 6 also deems certain dismissal situations to be unfair as well as outlining certain criteria on which dismissals may be adjudicated as fair.  One of the type of dismissal situations deemed to be unfair is referred to in Section 6(2)(a) of the Act which indicates that a dismissal is unfair where it can be shown that the dismissal resulted wholly or mainly from an employee's trade union membership or activities, either where those activities take place outside working hours or at those times during working hours when permitted by the employer.  While, in general, an employee must have been in the same employment for at least a year in order to bring a claim for unfair dismissal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, one of the exceptions to the one-year service requirement includes dismissals falling under section 6(2)(a) of the Act.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Victimisation) (Declaration) Order 2004 provides that where there is a dispute in an employment where collective bargaining fails to take place and where negotiating arrangements are not in place, no person, be they union representative, individual employee or manager, should be victimised or suffer disadvantage as a consequence of their legitimate actions or affiliation arising from that dispute.  A procedure for addressing complaints of victimisation in such cases is set out the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.  A complaint for breach of this legislation may be presented to a Rights Commissioner who can enforce rights breached.</p>  <p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015 which is expected to complete its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas tomorrow and be enacted shortly thereafter provides for enhanced protection for individuals who are victimised as a result of invoking the provisions of the 2001/2001 Industrial Relations Acts through a trade union or for acting as a witness or comparator for those provisions.   </p>  <p>  If there is evidence that this is a widespread practice &ndash; and to date I do not have such evidence on the matter &ndash; I will be happy to consider the matter further with both sides of industry. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy has any information regarding blacklisting of workers in Ireland, he might bring it either to my attention or to the Data Protection Commissioner.</p></reply>

In addition to this, the Group provides on-going assistance and advice to relevant Government Departments and Agencies on any issues affecting SMEs by identifying those issues that impact on the growth and development of SMEs, suggesting priorities and examining possible solutions.</p>  <p>  The AGSB was reconstituted late last year and now includes members from the farming community and the start-up community, in addition to the SME representative organisations. </p>  <p>  The issue of attachment orders has not been raised by any member of the AGSB.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-15a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071500081#WRA02000"><p>The Deputy will understand that I cannot provide legal advice in relation to the law applying to any particular situation, or the interpretation of legislation.  Independent legal advice should be sought if an individual has concerns about a specific employment situation.</p><p>The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) provides general information on employment, equality &amp;amp; industrial relations legislation, through the Workplace Relations Customer Service and Information Unit.  It can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or via its website . </p><p>The Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 lay down criteria by which the fairness or otherwise of dismissals are adjudicated upon.  While the Acts provide for some potentially-fair reasons for dismissal, the onus is generally on the employer to show that there were substantial grounds justifying the dismissal.  Under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, each case is adjudicated upon its merits and on the particular facts of the case.  Generally, there is a requirement to have at least one year's continuous service in order to take a case under the Acts.  The normal time limit of 6 months for submitting a claim for redress for unfair dismissal may be extended to 12 months in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>Dismissal in circumstances where a genuine redundancy situation exists is regarded as one of the fair reasons for dismissal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts although unfair selection for redundancy is regarded as an unfair dismissal under those Acts.  However, where an employee has been dismissed due to a genuine redundancy situation, an employee who has at least two years' continuous service will be entitled to a statutory redundancy payment under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2014.  The amount of the statutory redundancy payment is based on the employee's length of service, and is calculated at 2 weeks' pay per year of service plus a bonus week, subject to a wages cap of &euro;600 per week.  Where an employer disputes an employee's entitlement to a statutory redundancy payment, an employee may take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Redundancy Payments Acts, and the Tribunal will make a determination on the matter.  </p><p>Any arrangement for a redundancy payment over and above the statutory redundancy amount is a matter for negotiation and agreement between the parties which, where the parties so request, may be assisted by the industrial relations machinery of the State via the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court.  I would encourage any parties who are in dispute with regard to extra-statutory redundancy terms, and where it is not possible to resolve the matter locally, to avail fully of the services of these bodies. </p><p>I should mention that the relevant adjudicatory bodies for cases referred under the Unfair Dismissals Acts and the Redundancy Payments Acts after the commencement of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 will be an Adjudication Officer of the new Workplace Relations Commission and, on appeal, the Labour Court.</p></reply>

The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the Irish approval authority for this and related Directives.</p>  <p>  Since the beginning of the year NSAI received 3108 Individual Vehicle Approval (IVA) applications and has completed 2843.  As of 9 July 2015, 196 files are in the processing system.  The average number of weeks that these applications have been in process is 3.5 weeks. </p>  <p>  35 applications were received from the company in question since January 2015.  24 of these have now been approved and 11 are in the process of approval.  A number of applications are awaiting responses to queries which need to be addressed before approval can be completed.</p>  <p>  The processing time reflects the technical nature of the approvals process, the increased registration of new vehicles at the start of the year and at the mid-year registration cycle and, in that context, the requirement on industry to build in an adequate provision for the automotive approvals timescale.  Applications for certification are processed by the NSAI on a first come, first served basis.</p>  <p>  In response to the increasing workload, the NSAI tendered in 2014 for an Alternative Service Delivery (ASD) through the provision of external technical assessors, which commenced from January 2015. </p>  <p>  Due to the regulatory and technical nature of the assessment process, it was not possible to rapidly increase processing capacity as the sourcing, training and induction of engineers takes a period of approximately 6 months before they become competent in the approvals process. </p>  <p>  In recent weeks, NSAI have introduced a new IT system to help manage applications and workloads.  The new system will allow tracking of applications through all stages of the application phase to final completion of approval.  In addition, the NSAI is carrying out training of appointed test centres (or ATC's) &ndash; as agreed with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Roads Safety Authority - in order that they can work closely with applicants to clarify the test and inspection requirements which are leading to delays in processing approvals.</p>  <p>  By the end of October, the NSAI expects to operate consistently to the two weeks target that the NSAI has set for all vehicle categories and sustain it thereafter, with the possible exception of the January/February surge of new certification applications.</p>  <p>  It is important to remember that when incomplete application forms are queried by the NSAI, this can cause long delays in processing times. Another contributing factor is the delay in separate approvals processes for different types of commercial vehicles which is outside the NSAI's control.  It is therefore important that companies stay in regular contact and work closely with the NSAI regarding their applications and any queries arising.</p></reply>

This is evidenced by the difficulties which have been encountered in the UK in compiling official data on the prevalence of Zero Hours Contracts.  The 8 hour contracts specified in the Request for Tender appeared, from the limited literature available on the subject and from anecdotal evidence, to represent a typical low hours contract.  It is not being treated as a limit in the context of the study underway.</p>  <p>  In fact, the lack of a common understanding as to what constitutes Zero Hours and Low Hours Contracts was a key driver behind this Government's decision, set out in the July 2014 Statement of Priorities, to commission a study into the prevalence of such contracts and their impact on employees.    </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I commissioned the University of Limerick to undertake the Study following a competitive tendering process.  The study has a broad scope, covering both the public and private sectors, with a particular focus on the retail, hospitality, education and health sectors.  It will fill the gap in knowledge that currently exists in terms of the hard data and information that is available concerning the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts in the Irish economy.  The study will examine how such contracts operate in practice and assess the advantages and disadvantages from the perspective of employer and employee.  It will also assess the current employment rights legislation as it applies to employees on such contracts, and consider recent developments in other jurisdictions, including the UK in particular.  The findings will enable me to make any evidence-based policy recommendations to Government considered necessary on foot of the study.</p>  <p>  A key element of the study has been stakeholder involvement, as specified in the Request for Tender.  I was especially keen to ensure that a wide range of stakeholders would be canvassed to contribute to the study, so as to ensure that a full picture of what constitutes &ldquo;low hours&rdquo; in reality will emerge.  Without in any way pre-empting the outcome of the study, I am confident that this approach will ensure that the study will provide us with a meaningful picture of low hours contracts &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo; which will not be limited by the figure of eight hours specified in the Tender document.     </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot anticipate the outcome of the study, which I expect will be completed shortly, or the Government's consideration of same.</p></reply>

The protections enshrined in legislation are underpinned by the National Employment Rights Authority's (NERA) proactive labour inspectorate.  In addition, NERA's Information Unit has been restructured and expanded to form a new Workplace Relations Customer Service Section, which provides information in relation to employment, equality and industrial relations rights and obligations, and how to obtain redress where appropriate.  NERA information officers are available to meet staff, either individually or collectively, to discuss their employment rights, including matters related to redundancy.  The Workplace Relations Customer Service Section can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90. The website www.workplacerelations.ie also provides extensive information on employment rights.</p>  <p>  In addition to the protections provided to employees under employment rights legislation, company law provides that the matters to which directors must have regard in the performance of their functions include the interests of the company's employees in general, as well as the interests of its members.  </p>  <p>  In light of the suite of employment rights legislation already in place, I have no plans to amend the Companies Act 2014 to insert a provision in relation to social responsibility.</p>  <p>  Moreover, one of the key principles of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) which is shared at European level is that CSR is a voluntary approach by businesses and organisations which goes beyond compliance with regulatory requirements.  Increasingly, good CSR practices are distinguishing the best companies from their competitors.  CSR practices that are embedded as a genuine part of a company's values and operations can help enhance the company's profile and competitiveness.  </p>  <p>  I would encourage all companies to embrace the concept of CSR and integrate social and environmental concerns into their mainstream business operations.

The new figure represents an increase of 5 cent per hour over the 2014 rate.</p>  <p>  The Living Wage concept is grounded in the idea that a person's wage should be sufficient to maintain a safe, decent standard of living.  Of course, it is not isolated from a State's taxation and social support systems. </p>  <p>  So, at an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and thus the interaction of individual earnings with household income and State-provided supports such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement as well as those available in relation to housing, education and health. </p>  <p>  In the UK, it is a voluntary code with which some employers, who already pay in excess of the UK national minimum wage, have become associated.  The Living Wage concept there draws its strength from the fact that it is a grassroots civil society campaign.  At present, around 1,500 separate employers across the country have endorsed the approach.  In the UK the Living Wage Foundation has calculated the 2015 UK Living Wage as &pound;7.85 and &pound;9.15 for London.</p>  <p>  In its recent Budget the UK Government applied a concept of a National Living Wage by which companies will be required to pay a minimum of &pound;9 an hour by 2020, applying to workers over 25.</p>  <p>  The National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Bill 2015 is expected to be enacted shortly.  The Bill provides for the establishment of the Low Pay Commission whose main function will be, on an annual basis, to examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.  The Commission was established on an interim basis in February 2015 and I expect to receive its first recommendation on the minimum wage following the enactment of the legislation.</p>  <p>  While I am on record as endorsing the concept of a Living Wage I would differentiate between the application of a mandatory National Minimum Wage and a societal movement that would see employers volunteer to pay what might be considered to be a Living Wage.</p>  <p>  I intend to hold a Living Wage forum in the Autumn, to which civil society organisations, trade unions and, crucially, employers will be invited to discuss the concept of a Living Wage in Ireland and whether and how it can be applied here.</p></reply>

In this regard there is an increasing trend of foreign direct investment locating in larger urban areas. Dublin is an international-scale city and, as such, has a key role in attracting investment. </p><p>Finally, for anyone seeking information on Government supports to business, there are over 80 different Government supports for Irish start-ups and small businesses, which can now be accessed online.

This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU. A study commissioned by my Department estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  It suggests a boost to GDP of 1.1%, growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5% and increase in real wages of 1.5%.  It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs.</p><p>The EU Commission's mandate to negotiate with the United States on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) includes in the scope (paragraphs 22 and 23), investment protection and investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS).  The stated aim of negotiations on investment is to negotiate investment liberalisation and protection provisions on the basis of the highest levels of liberalisation and highest standards of protection that both sides have negotiated to date. </p><p>  The mandate makes it clear that the inclusion of investment protection and ISDS will depend on EU interests being met and on the final balance of the Agreement.  Importantly, the mandate states that the objectives of any investment protection provisions would be without prejudice to the right of EU and the member states to adopt and enforce measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as social, environmental, security, stability of the financial system, public health and safety in a non-discriminatory manner. </p><p>  This means that the type of investment arbitration system under TTIP will be a vast improvement on investment protection in existing Bilateral Investment Treaties, some of which date back to the 1950's.</p><p>  The Commission's Concept Paper, &ldquo;<i>Investment in TTIP and beyond &ndash; the path for reform</i>&rdquo;, published on 6 May, sets out the context for this reform and, building on the important progress that has been achieved in the investment agreements with Canada and Singapore, sets out four areas for further improvement: Governments' right to regulate, establishment and functioning of tribunals, relationship between national judicial systems and an ISDS system, and an appellate mechanism. </p><p>  These improvements are aimed at addressing the concerns with older investor dispute settlement agreements in order to create a new modern system of investment arbitration.  The inclusion of an acceptable model of ISDS would provide a common floor across the 28 Member States and at federal and state level in the US.</p><p>  There have been no negotiations between the EU and the US on this issue since the EU Commission decided early last year to conduct a formal public consultation on ISDS in TTIP.  I welcomed the decision in relation to the public consultation, and I have also welcomed the comprehensive work by the EU Commission in following up on the views expressed by stakeholders.  Together with other EU Ministers I welcomed the proposed further reform of the system of investor state arbitration set out in the Commission's concept paper which was presented by the Commission at the meeting of Trade Ministers in Brussels on 7 May last.</p></reply>

This work by the Agencies includes, where appropriate, pursuing relevant Research and Development opportunities; promoting training initiatives; provision of targeted grant aid in specific circumstances; and developing capacity building and transformational management systems.</p>  <p>   In addition, an early warning system is in place to flag unexpected job threats which may emerge at short notice.  In such instances, the Agencies, my Department and I myself, as Minister, work with the company to develop alternatives or mitigate the worst impact on workers.  It is nevertheless, important that, in the event that a company in serious financial difficulty down-sizes or closes, a range of interventions in Government policy areas can be brought to bear such as: the Redundancy Payments Scheme, Labour Activation/Training etc. which seek to ameliorate the impact of job losses. </p>  <p>  In particular, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973, requires employers to give notice of termination or to pay employees in lieu of notice, and outstanding wages, holiday pay, commission and bonuses are protected by the Payment of Wages Act 1991. </p>  <p>  In the event that an employer is insolvent, the employees are entitled to seek payment from the State through the Insolvency Payments Scheme, which is administered by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  Employees may also be entitled to payment from this Fund in respect of holiday pay, outstanding pay and minimum notice, amongst others.  My Department works with DSP and other Departments to ensure that Government services are made available to workers to clarify their entitlements and to develop other opportunities for those affected. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above services, the State's industrial relations machinery is always made available, to assist parties in a dispute situation.  It is very heartening that the work of the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission, which also come within the remit of my Department, has managed to resolve many apparently intractable disputes and has resulted in very positive outcomes in restructuring situations. </p>  <p>  This process, involving many State stakeholders works well. It is continuously learning and responding to the changing global environment. </p>  <p>  As the existing legislation provides robust protections for employees who find themselves in the type of situation outlined in the Deputy's Question, I do not consider that further legislation is required to ensure minimum notice for workers of companies in difficulty.</p></reply>

Job creation has been the stand-out impact of this improvement.  However, as the Council report makes clear, Ireland remains a high cost location for a range of key business inputs and there is a significant risk that recent competitiveness gains may be eroded. </p>  <p>  I share the Council's view that structural reform, improving productivity and investing in productive infrastructure as well as maintaining a competitive cost base are critical to further improving Ireland's international competitiveness position and delivering our goal of sustainable full employment by 2018.  Ireland's competitiveness position must remain a key economic priority for Government and as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, a range of initiatives are in train across Government Departments to support competitiveness. </p>  <p>  The National Competitiveness Council and my Department and its agencies are continually engaged with relevant stakeholders on the particular policy needs required to support cost competitiveness.  The stakeholders include other Government Departments, regulatory bodies and public and private bodies.  In this regard, there is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage their cost base and drive efficiency, thus creating a virtuous circle between the costs of living, wage expectations and cost competitiveness.  Measures that ensure open and competitive markets are also essential. In the longer term, productivity growth is the preferred mechanism to improve competitiveness as it can support cost competitiveness in tandem with increasing employment and living standards.</p>  <p>  The policy implications of the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2015 report's analysis, and associated structural reforms required to address Ireland's cost base, will be included in the Council's annual Competitiveness Challenge report which will be published later this year.</p>  <p>  The Council's report was considered by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Jobs and by Government and Departments have been asked to consider potential actions to improve competitiveness that might be undertaken through the Cabinet Committee structures.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, seasonal work is a particular feature of both the retail and the hospitality sector.  </p>  <p>  The Study will fill the gap in knowledge that currently exists in terms of the hard data and information that is available concerning the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts in the Irish economy.  It will examine how such contracts operate in practice and assess the advantages and disadvantages from the perspective of employer and employee.  It will also assess the current employment rights legislation as it applies to employees on such contracts.  The findings will enable me to make any evidence-based policy recommendations to Government considered necessary on foot of the study.</p>  <p>  A wide range of stakeholders have been canvassed to contribute to the study, which I expect to be completed shortly.  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot anticipate the outcome of the study, or the Government's consideration of the study's findings.</p>  <p>  Seasonal workers are often engaged on a part-time basis.  The Protection of Employment (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 provides robust protections for such workers.  It provides that a part-time employee cannot be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time employee regarding conditions of employment, and that all employee protection legislation applies to a part-time employee in the same manner as it already applies to a full-time employee.  The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 which provides that fixed-term workers may not be treated less favourably than comparable permanent workers may also be of relevance in the context of seasonal workers. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that since the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs in 2012 there are almost 105,000 more people at work.  In 2014 alone, employment increased by almost 30,000.  Within this figure part-time employment has shrunk by approximately 10,400 while full time employment has increased by 39,600.  It is clear that the Government is succeeding in its twin track approach of creating the conditions for job growth and helping people back to work, including young people in particular.  For example, the under-25 age group had an unemployment rate of 20.3% at the end of 2014, down from a peak of 33% in early 2012.  Based on current trends and projections, the youth unemployment rate should fall below 20% in 2015.</p>  <p>  These positive developments have taken place against the backdrop of the Government's agenda to make work pay, key elements of which include the restoration of the cut in the national minimum wage, the establishment of the Low Pay Commission and the reinstatement of the Joint Labour Committee system.  When enacted, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill will provide a new statutory framework to replace the former sectoral Registered Employment Agreements (REAs), and a mechanism for workers who seek to improve their terms and conditions in companies where collective bargaining is not recognised by their employer.</p></reply>

It reflects the Government's commitment to moving the country away from cycles of boom and bust.</p><p>Construction 2020 contains a detailed programme of work, including 75 time-bound actions across a range of issues including ensuring a highly skilled workforce and ensuring opportunities for construction jobseekers.  Progress is being made on securing new employment opportunities for those with the skills and interested in making a career in the construction sector. </p><p>The most recent data from the CSO indicates an increase in employment in construction of 19,600 over the year to the end of the first quarter of 2015. </p><p>We are working hard in a joined-up way across Government to ensure that the construction sector can continue its recovery and provide employment opportunities for those with the skills needed.  Since publication of the Government's Construction 2020 report, our commitment to delivery has been further underpinned by the appointment last July of Minister of State Paudie Coffey, with responsibility for coordinating and driving the important work forward.  We have also established a dedicated Cabinet Committee to ensure that focus is maintained at the highest level of Government. </p><p>A number of significant milestones have been achieved, and we are seeing welcome and positive signs of recovery in the sector.  The most recent Construction Purchasing Managers Index for May 2015 prepared by Ulster Bank indicates a continuing increase in confidence in the sector with a reading of 65.7, where a figure above 50 indicates growth.  This reading for May was the highest level since November 2004 and extends the construction sector's continuous expansion to 22 months as recorded by Ulster Bank.  </p><p>I understand that the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government has received a submission from the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) regarding amendments sought to planning law.  The Department is considering the submission and intends to meet with the CIF in the near future to discuss the issues. </p><p>In relation to the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI), the Government has signalled its commitment in the Construction 2020 Strategy to placing CIRI on a statutory footing.  CIRI is seen as an essential consumer protection measure giving consumers who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.  CIRI has been operated by the CIF as a voluntary register since May 2015.  Legislative proposals aimed at placing CIRI on a statutory footing are currently being finalised by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with a view to their being presented to Government for consideration in the near future.</p></reply>

The &euro;55 billion in Irish-US trade demonstrates the importance of our economic, investment and business ties.  The 135,000 jobs provided in the US by Irish companies and the 120,000 jobs provided by US companies in Ireland, demonstrates how interconnected our economies are.</p>  <p>  According to assessments made by the EU Commission, a comprehensive TTIP could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% bringing significant economic gains as a whole for the EU.  This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU.  An independent study commissioned by my Department, carried out by Copenhagen Economics, estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  It suggests a boost to GDP of 1.1%, growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5%, and an increase in real wages of 1.5%.  It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs. </p>  <p>  It also suggests that Irish small and medium enterprises (SMEs) will be particular beneficiaries.  Many of these are part of European supply chains where their exports to the UK, Germany or elsewhere to the EU, feed into Europe's exports to the U.S. </p>  <p>  Ireland's interests in the TTIP negotiations will be assisted by the indications from the Copenhagen Economic study. We will seek to have opportunities created in the agreement where we have clear strengths, and we will seek defend our interests where we have sensitivities.</p>  <p>  As an economy that lives and grows by the freedom to trade, we have first-hand experience of how trade liberalisation has continually shaped and reshaped our economy.  The Copenhagen Economics study should also inform our policy responses as a result of TTIP.  Some of these may arise from sector impacts that have been identified in the Copenhagen Economics study. </p>  <p>  We have used openness to trade in the past, and will continue to use it, as an instrument for structural reform, modernisation and development, creating new opportunities for innovation and stronger productivity growth with higher skilled jobs throughout the economy.</p></reply>

As of Q1 2015, there were an additional 104,000 at work in the economy since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs, which achieved and exceeded the Government's target of 100,000 extra at work by 2016.  The services sector made the largest contribution to the achievement of the Government's target of 100,000 more at work.  Following a number of years of decline in employment from 2007, I am pleased to report that the manufacturing sector has also recorded increases in job numbers since 2011.</p>  <p>  In relation to agency assisted firms, the net increase in fulltime employment since the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs to 2014 is 25,665, of which there a was a net increase of 8,051 in manufacturing employment and a net increase of 17,614 in internationally traded services employment.  This equates to just under one-third, or 31 per cent, of the net increase in full-time employment in agency assisted firms was in manufacturing and two-thirds of the net increase was in internationally traded services enterprises, since the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs. </p>  <p>  Arising from the strategy for the manufacturing sector 'Making it in Ireland: Manufacturing 2020', prepared by Forf&aacute;s and the report of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs Skills Report on the skills needs for the sector, both of which I launched in 2013, there are now a range of initiatives beg progressed by my Department and relevant Agencies to drive the Government's jobs targets. </p>  <p>  Manufacturing was a Disruptive Reform in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 and is a key focus in the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs and also in the regional Action Plans for Jobs, with a range of measures designed to support industry growth including encouraging entrepreneurship, further improving our skills base, improving access to finance by SMEs and supporting indigenous companies and foreign-owned manufacturing companies to transform their businesses as part of a National Step Change Initiative.  The Manufacturing Development Forum is helping to address the key issues arising from the Strategy recommendations.  My Department is also preparing a guide for manufacturing firms to state support available.  These initiatives are important to growing and sustaining the competitiveness of existing enterprises, to sustaining employment and to attracting new investment. </p>  <p>  For both manufacturing and services sectors, skills and talent development and attraction are critically important.  We have a good skills base on which to grow our manufacturing and services sectors and as the economy recovers there will be further opportunities for the unemployed.  My Department and its agencies has a Protocol in place with the Department of Social Protection to ensure that where new job openings are available, that there is an efficient and timely matching between those unemployed and skills required by enterprise and that appropriate training or development is available.  The Apprenticeship Council is also in the process of reviewing a range of proposals for new apprenticeships to meet the current and future skills needs of manufacturing and services sectors.  These new apprenticeships will also provide a range of opportunities for the long terms and youth unemployed.</p>  <p>  The development of the Competitiveness for manufacturing and services investment remains an ongoing area of focus and, as reminded recently by the National Competitiveness Council when they published the 2015 Cost of Doing Business Report, while we have made progress in improving our comparative position, there is still further progress required.  Costs in Ireland have fallen across a range of business inputs since 2009, making Ireland more competitive internationally.  This is reflected in our ongoing ability to successfully compete internationally for trade and investment and in our improving performance across a range of international competitiveness benchmarking reports &ndash; for example, we have moved from 24th to 16th in the IMD's World Competitiveness Yearbook.</p></reply>

This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU.  An independent study commissioned by my Department carried out by Copenhagen Economics estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  It suggests growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5% and increase in real wages of 1.5%.  It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs.</p><p>As regards impact on third countries, the independent study carried out by the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) for the European Commission indicates that TTIP could bring an overall estimated gain for third countries of between &euro;46.6 billion (an increase of 0.07 % of world GDP) and &euro;99.2 billion (0.14 % of world GDP), and an increase in exports from third countries of between 0.51 % and 1.04 %.  This is because more growth in the EU and US would increase demand for exports from other countries of raw materials, components and machinery, finished products, and business services like customer support or after-sales care.  The wider the scope of the Agreement, the more it would benefit the rest of the world. For example, if the EU and US harmonised technical standards<b></b>in some areas, other countries could adopt these too which would mean that instead of having to produce to two sets of standards, they could produce to one set.  That would in turn make trade easier and less costly.

This Policy Statement represents the first time a Government has published a comprehensive national plan for entrepreneurship in Ireland.  The key target contained in the plan is to double the jobs impact of start-ups in Ireland over the next five years.</p>  <p>  The National Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship is the Government's plan to deliver an ambitious but realistic increase in the numbers of start-ups in Ireland over the next five years.  The Government has set out a vision for Ireland to be among the most entrepreneurial nations in the world and to be acknowledged as a world-class environment to start and grow a business.  By driving implementation of the actions in the new National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement we will double the jobs impact of start-ups in Ireland over the next five years, from 93,000 currently. </p>  <p>  I have established and chair an Implementation Group to drive delivery, oversee implementation and monitor progress on the 94 actions set out in the Policy Statement.  This Group will also support my Department in seeking to identify and consider further initiatives to support the entrepreneurship agenda in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Membership of this group is drawn from the enterprise development agencies, key central government stakeholders such as the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Finance, and most importantly entrepreneurs themselves. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2015 details a number of the immediate key actions to support the Government's ambition and confirms the commitment to continue to identify new approaches that will enhance and strengthen Ireland's entrepreneurial ecosystem and ultimately create jobs.  Key actions are set out to expand reform measures to boost entrepreneurship across all areas of the economy and society.</p>  <p>  A number of the key objectives to support entrepreneurship delivered in 2015 include:</p>  <p>  - Launch of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs;</p>  <p>  - Ireland's Best Young Entrepreneur 2015 competition launched;</p>  <p>  - Launch of the Startup Refunds for Entrepreneurs (SURE) scheme;</p>  <p>  - Continue to promote LEOs as one stop shops for small business; and</p>  <p>  - Develop an action programme of support for pre-investment HPSUs.</p>  <p>  All actions related to entrepreneurship within the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 have been delivered on schedule under the quarter one update.  The quarter two update has not been finalised yet, but there are no indications to suggest that any related actions are delayed.  Considerable work has been undertaken in recent years to support entrepreneurs and startups and the actions identified in the National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement will strengthen existing supports.</p>  <p>  No one policy intervention will generate substantial impact on the entrepreneurship ecosystem, but various actions if taken together will combine to create greater synergies.  The overarching National Entrepreneurship Statement serves to co-ordinate all areas of Government policy in the area of entrepreneurship to drive these synergies and will deliver on the targets I referred to above.</p></reply>

Under Irish law, military export licences have to be sought in respect of the goods and technology, and any components thereof, listed in the Annex to the Control of Exports (Goods and Technology) Order, S.I.216 of 2012 which reflects the EU Common Military List.</p><p>The EU Common Military List includes military goods and technology, and components for such items that should be licensed for export from the Union.  Items which are classified as &ldquo;military goods&rdquo; from an export control perspective and which are exported from Ireland involve components rather than military equipment.</p><p>The Department consults with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in respect of all military export licence applications.  All military licence applications are subject to rigorous scrutiny, and are considered in the light of the spirit and objectives of the 1998 EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.  This Code, which was subsequently adopted in 2008 as an EU Common Position, seeks to safeguard, among other concerns, regional stability and human rights. </p><p>Criterion two of the Common Position is &ldquo;Respect for human rights in the country of final destination as well as respect by that country of international humanitarian law&rdquo;.  This criterion, along with the other criteria of the Common Position, is considered when reviewing any military export licence application. </p><p>All applications for military export licenses are very carefully assessed against well-established criteria.  Proposed exports of Military List products to Israel, as with all other destinations, are subject to a rigorous licence application process which centres on a careful assessment of the nature of the product in question and the  proposed end-user and end-use.</p><p>In view of security concerns and the relatively small number of export licence holders, it is the policy of my Department not to provide details as to whether or not a certain end-user was supplied controlled goods under an export licence.  Confirming this detail, or where such exports took place, providing the information requested by the Deputy, would potentially allow exporters to be identified.</p><p>Similarly, it is the policy of my Department to not identify the end-users or destinations associated with denied export licence applications.</p><p>The Information Commissioner has previously affirmed my Department's decision to not release confidential export licensing information that could identify export licence holders. </p><p>From the data currently to hand I have however provided below details of licences issued for the export of Military List items to all end-users in Israel from 2011 to date.</p><p><b>Licences issued for the export of Military List items to Israel, 2011 to date</b></p><p>Eleven licences for the export of Military List items to Israel have been issued from 2011 to date.  Details are provided below.</p><p>2011</p><p>Three licences for the export of Military List products to Israel were issued in 2011, to the total value of &euro;6.138 million.  Two licences were issued for Military List (ML) &ldquo;category 6&rdquo; items while one was issued for ML &ldquo;category 22&rdquo; items.  The ML &ldquo;category 6 &ldquo;refers to &ldquo;Ground Vehicles and Components&rdquo;, while ML &ldquo;category 22&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;Technology&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Technology&rdquo; is that which is &ldquo;required for the development, production or use of items or components specified in the EU Common Military List&rdquo;.</p><p>2012</p><p>One licence for the export of Military List products to Israel was issued in 2012.  The value of the licence was &euro;39,525 and it was issued for ML &ldquo;category 6&rdquo; items, i.e. &ldquo;Ground Vehicles and Components&rdquo;.</p><p>2013</p><p>Five licences for the export of Military List products to Israel were issued in 2013, to the total value of &euro;119,971.  Two licences were issued for ML &ldquo;category 6&rdquo; items while three were issued for ML &ldquo;category 10&rdquo; items.  The ML &ldquo;category 10&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;Aircraft, lighter-than-air vehicles, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles &ldquo;UAVs&rdquo;), aero-engines and aircraft equipment, related equipment, and components&rdquo;.</p><p>2014</p><p>Two licences for the export of Military List products to Israel were issued during the first quarter of 2014, to the total value of &euro;126,637.  Both licences were issued for ML &ldquo;category 6&rdquo; items.  I can confirm that no licences for the export of Military List products to Israel have been granted since the end of the first quarter of 2014.  No applications for the export of Military List products to Israel have been received during that period.</p><p>The figures provided above represent the maximum value which can be exported under the above export licences and not the value of the goods and technology actually exported under those licences.  It is important to recall that items which were classified as &ldquo;military goods&rdquo; from an export control perspective and which were exported from Ireland involved components for inclusion in, rather than finished military equipment.</p></reply>

The regional Action Plans for Jobs will identify measures that can be taken to enable each region to build on its competitive strengths and increase the number of people at work in the region.  Clearly, the benefits of increased employment throughout a region will have a positive impact on individual towns in that region.  </p><p>The first two regional Action Plans for Jobs, covering the Midlands and the South West regions, were published in the last two weeks.  The Plans include an analysis of the characteristics and strengths of each region, followed by a series of actions under thematic headings such as Driving Entrepreneurship, Attracting and Embedding Foreign Direct Investment, and Building Sectoral Opportunities.  My Department is continuing to work on the finalisation of a number of further regional Action Plans which will be launched shortly.  </p><p>In addition, the Government will provide up to &euro;250 million in funding over the next five years to support the <i>Action Plan for Jobs: Regional </i>initiative.  &euro;150 million of this funding will support an IDA property programme, while up to &euro;100 million will be made available through Enterprise Ireland for three separate competitive calls which will support innovative and collaborative approaches to job creation across the regions.  The first two of these calls were launched on 15<sup>th</sup>May, with a closing date of 10<sup>th</sup>July 2015.

The recovery in jobs and exports to date is in large part due to the considerable improvement in competitiveness that has taken place in recent years.</p>  <p>  Our improved competitiveness is reflected in our international rankings also.  Since 2011, Ireland's rankings in both the IMD and WEF competitiveness reports has improved - from 24th to 16th in the IMD's World Competitiveness Yearbook and in the World Bank's Doing Business 2015 report, Ireland is ranked 13th out of 189.</p>  <p>  As noted in the Government's Spring Economic Statement, the growth outlook for the economy is positive for the coming years, which will provide opportunities for all sectors of the economy and small businesses in particular spread throughout the country to share in the recovery.  This is a key objective of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs that my Department is currently developing and local authorities in every region are involved in seeking to identify how to improve the operating environment for business in their regions.  </p>  <p>  However, as we were reminded by the recent publication of the National Competitiveness Council's Cost of Doing Business report, we need to sustain the progress made over the last four years in improving our cost base.  This extends to all areas of the economy, including areas such as personal taxation and commercial rates. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure we have a cross-government and inter-departmental approach to the issues of costs for business and that we can sustain and grow employment, the Council's report was considered by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Jobs and by Government.  Departments have been asked to consider potential actions to improve competitiveness that might be undertaken through the Cabinet Committee structures. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance is reviewing on an ongoing basis the taxation issues for business and in this context launched a public consultation on Tax and Entrepreneurship on 2nd June last and I look forward to the outcome of that consultation process. </p>  <p>  In relation to commercial rates, local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.</p>  <p>  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is aware of the continued need to restrain the costs on businesses.  His Department has in recent years requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting, and where possible to reduce, ARVs and they have responded positively in this regard.  The national average ARV decreased each year from 2010 to 2014; 2015 is not directly comparable due to the local authority mergers and the necessity to harmonise rates across new local authority areas.  </p>  <p>  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under active review, and is determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector.</p></reply>

The control policy is reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that controls in place to prevent fraud and abuse continue to be effective and relevant.</p>  <p>  The Department undertook approximately 400,000 continuing eligibility reviews of child benefit customers in 2014.

These streams and the limitations on participation have been a feature of CE procedures from as far back as the 1990s.</p>  <p>  The first stream is called the Part-Time Job option and is for persons who are over 35 years of age and have spent 3 continuous years on the Live Register. Persons who participate on CE under this option can qualify for up to 3 years (which can increase to 6 years after the reaching the age of 55), subject to their extended participation being approved annually. </p>  <p>  The second stream is called the Part-Time Integration option and is for persons over the age of 25 who have spent less than 3 years on the Live Register. This option now accounts for most of the participants on CE.  Participants can qualify for up to 2 years; however their extended participation to a second year is subject to certain criteria as set out in the scheme guidelines. Participants who are granted a second year under this option cannot continue on that or any other scheme after the 2 year term has been reached. They are required to have spent a further period of 12 months on the Live Register before being eligible to participate on CE again.  </p>  <p>  There are currently 18 CE participants engaged by the project referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, 4 of whom qualified to participate under the Part-Time Job option; the remaining 14 participants qualified to participate under the Part-Time Integration option. Of those 14 participants, 4 have exceeded their maximum permitted time of 2 years on CE under the Part-Time Integration option. However 3 of them are exempt from the 2 year limit by virtue of the fact that they commenced CE prior to the announcement on 8th October 2012 regarding the Part-Time Integration option. The fourth participant, despite will in this instance be allowed to see out their current term on CE.  </p>  <p>  The Department has reviewed the eligibility of each participant and found that 1 participant was incorrectly categorised under the Part-Time Integration option. The participant in question will be re-categorised under the Part-Time Job option and will be eligible to apply for a third year on CE.</p></reply>

The proportion of participants over 60 years of age is currently 11.4% (June 2015).   </p>  <p>  Persons of 60 years of age or over can participate for a cumulative maximum of 6 years on CE, with one additional year being available for persons who were in receipt of a disability-linked social welfare payment. </p>  <p>  Participation on CE ranges from 1 year up to 6 years for participants depending on their eligibility and 7 years for people with a disability.

The 2015 Revised Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the farm assist scheme of &euro;88.7 million.</p>  <p>  Recent changes have brought farm assist into closer alignment with the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed persons but the headline rates of farm assist have been maintained.  This means that farm families with the lowest income have been the  least affected by these changes.</p>  <p>  The Farm Assist Scheme, including the impact of recent changes, is kept under ongoing review. My officials have regular discussions and meetings with the IFA in relation to the scheme. The most recent of these meetings took place in April 2015.  Policy and operational staff are in close contact and co-operate on an ongoing basis on issues arising at local level and discuss and follow up on individual cases when the need arises. In addition expenditure and data in relation to the number of recipients in various categories and rates of payment are analysed on a monthly basis.</p></reply>

Initially, decisions centre around the nature of the work involved and the duration of the work.  Other factors include the availability of existing resources to do the work, and the location where the work is to be undertaken.</p>  <p>  This Department has limited sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform to recruit temporary clerical officers (TCOs) to provide critical cover for long-term staff absences and to assist with additional projects the Department has had to take on.  TCOs can be recruited on a fixed term basis, i.e. where the end date for the absence being covered is known from the outset, e.g. cover for maternity leave.  Alternatively, where an end date is not known, the TCO is recruited on a &ldquo;fixed purpose&rdquo; contract basis, where the contract is related to a particular business purpose.</p>  <p>  The Department operates an extensive range of transfer lists which allow established permanent staff to request a transfer to another area/region.  These lists are stored in date of application order.  If a critical vacancy is approved for filling, staff who are reached on the transfer list are offered the opportunity to relocate to the area of their choice.</p>  <p>  Temporary contracts are regularly reviewed.  Where a decision is made to appoint a permanent member of staff to a post, transfer lists and existing panels for recruitment are consulted.</p></reply>

These include a weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pension based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child. A number of social welfare payments, including State pension and carer&rsquo;s allowance, continue in payment for six weeks following a death. Guardian payments are available where someone is looking after an orphaned child. A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. An application can be made under the ENP scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses. The assistance is toward the costs of the necessary basic requirements for a dignified funeral. However, there is no automatic entitlement to such a payment. An ENP is a means tested payment payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the individual applicant and that of the deceased person including any savings, property, insurance policies, etc. that would render the applicant or anybody else liable for the burial costs. The Department official will also consider if a bereavement grant is available from any other source including former employer, credit union or trade union.</p></reply>

This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused, in the first instance, on this cohort of unemployed people.  This group includes a significant number of formerly self-employed people.  The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, in examining issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people, found that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.</p><p>Many services are also available to the unemployed who are not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment, regardless of their previous employment/self-employment status.

Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.</p><p>The <i>Pathways to Work </i>2015 strategy includes a commitment to develop and evaluate actions to extend services to people not on the Live Register and improve the promotion/communication of existing activation options.  This will be considered in the light of the developing labour market and budgetary context.</p><p>In short, the Government is committed to supporting as many people as possible to participate more fully in employment and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers they may encounter in finding and sustaining employment.</p></reply>

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 8.5%).</p>  <p>  Self-employed workers who become unemployed or ill may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p>  <p>  Self-employed people in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available through the State.  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.</p>  <p>  Some employment services, such as assistance with job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.  Unemployed persons, including the previously self-employed, not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  Springboard courses are open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.</p>  <p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.</p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p>  <p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.</p>  <p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  The Actuarial Review found that the effective annual rate of contribution needed to provide the full rate State pension (contributory), currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.</p>  <p>  My colleagues in Government and I will continue to reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue, in the context that any changes will need to be funded through an appropriate level of contribution.</p></reply>

I am satisfied that Revenue continues to identify such arrangements and challenges them, or recommends strengthening legislation where appropriate.</p><p>The analysis which the Deputy requested is as follows:</p><p>In 2015 to date, 12 tax avoidance cases yielded &euro;3.2million (including interest and penalties).  In addition, 137 cases applied under the Qualifying Avoidance Disclosure provisions of section 811A (2A) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The yield in respect of the 137 cases is &euro;43.7 million (including tax and interest).  This is a provisional figure subject to the Revenue Commissioner s verification that the requirements of the Qualifying Avoidance Disclosure have been met.</p><p>In 2014, 24 cases were settled for a yield of 13 million (including interest and penalties) and the future restriction of losses of &euro;1.6 million.  A further 459 cases were examined to see if anti-avoidance legislation could be applied but were ultimately found not to be capable of challenge using anti-avoidance legislation.</p><p>In 2013, 14 avoidance cases, 13 of which were under Section 811 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, settled with a yield of &euro;2.6 million (including interest and penalties) and a restriction of losses of &euro;1.1 million.</p><p>In 2012, 36 avoidance cases involving financial transactions giving rise to capital losses with a tax at risk of &euro;138 million were actively investigated under Revenue s general anti avoidance legislation. As a result of these enquiries 24 Notices of Opinion under anti avoidance legislation were issued.  No avoidance cases were settled in 2012.</p><p><b>Tax Evasion</b></p><p>I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that non-compliance takes many forms including failure to register for taxes and duties, failure to make a tax return, under- declaration of income and overstatement of expenses and deductions.  Revenue carries out a robust programme of compliance interventions that aims to minimise the burden on the compliant taxpayer and tackle in a thorough and effective way the non-compliant taxpayer.  This approach involves taking account of all the risks that apply to a taxpayer across all taxes and duties.  Revenue s priority is to recover any unpaid tax or duty along with interest and penalties as efficiently as possible.  Revenue has a range of tools and techniques at its disposal to tackle non-compliance in all its guises, ranging from light touch early interventions to criminal prosecutions for serious tax and duties fraud.</p><p>Amounts recovered (tax, interest and penalties) as a result of Revenue Audit and Compliance Interventions (including interventions tackling avoidance) are outlined below:<table><tr><th>Yield</th><th>2015 Jan-June </th><th>2014</th><th>2013</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>Audit </td><td>&euro;198.5m </td><td>&euro;338.8m </td><td>&euro;311.9m </td><td>&euro;359.0m </td></tr><tr><td>Risk Management Interventions </td><td>&euro;158.3m </td><td>&euro;240.5m </td><td>&euro;186.4m </td><td>&euro;88.0m  </td></tr><tr><td>Assurance Checks </td><td>&euro;3.7m </td><td>&euro;9.5m </td><td>&euro;19.5m </td><td>&euro;22.0m  </td></tr><tr><td>PAYE Compliance Interventions </td><td>&euro;8.2m </td><td>&euro;21.6m </td><td>&euro;30.5m </td><td>&euro;23.0m  </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>&euro;368.7m </td><td>&euro;610.4m </td><td>&euro;548.3m </td><td>&euro;492.0m  </td></tr></table></p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Annual Reports published by the Revenue Commissioners provide comprehensive details of the various compliance programmes utilised by Revenue to tackle evasion and avoidance.

The threshold was initially set at &euro;5 million, which was subsequently reduced to &euro;2.3 million in 2010 and further reduced in Budget 2014 and Finance (No 2) Act 2013 to &euro;2 million with effect from 1 January 2014.</p>  <p>  The full year yield from the reduction in the SFT to &euro;2.3 million with effect from 7 December 2010 was estimated at the time of the change at &euro;20 million.</p>  <p>  Information on the numbers and values of individual pension funds or on individual accrued benefits in pension schemes are not generally required to be supplied to either the Revenue Commissioners or to my Department by the administrators of pension schemes and personal pension arrangements. The estimate of the yield of &euro;120 million in 2014 and in a full year arising from the changes to the SFT regime introduced in Finance (No 2) Act 2013 was arrived at following considerable internal work over a period by my Department involving, among other things, data gathering and consultation with private sector sources relating to the specific changes to be made. There is no readily available underlying data or methodology on which to base reliable estimates of the savings that would arise from further changes to the SFT of the scale envisaged in the questions.</p>  <p>  I would also like to clarify some points arising from the questions raised. The Deputy might note that the SFT regime does not involve the non-application of tax relief to pension contributions. Instead, the regime addresses the problem of pension overfunding and excessive pension accrual by imposing a much higher effective tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down, thus discouraging the accumulation through contributions of large pension funds in the first place or unwinding the tax advantage of such overfunding by way of the higher effective tax charge.</p>  <p>  Finally, the valuation factors to be used for establishing the capital value of defined benefit pension rights at the point of retirement for SFT purposes, and which accrue after 1 January 2014, were changed by Finance (No 2) Act 2013 from the previous single factor of 20 to a range of higher age-related valuation factors that vary with the individual's age at the point at which the pension rights are drawn down.  The higher factors range from 37 for defined benefit pension entitlements drawn down at age 50 or under to a factor of 22 for pensions drawn down at age 70 or over.</p></reply>

Information on the total value of share options exercised is not readily available and could not be obtained without conducting a protracted examination of Revenue records.

While this information is returned through the RSS1 form, the information is then compiled separately on the Revenue records of each individual beneficiary.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that since February this year the RSS1 form may be filed electronically with Revenue. To date 409 forms have been filed successfully.</p>  <p>  In relation to Restricted Stock Units (RSU), I am advised by Revenue that the award of shares and the entitlement to a future award of shares is made through a variety of schemes. One such scheme is known as RSU. An RSU is a taxable emolument of employment chargeable to income tax. However, due to the manner in which the data are recorded, these cannot be separately distinguished from other such emoluments. Therefore, the total value of RSUs granted to employees sought by the Deputy is not available.</p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to Approved Profit Sharing Schemes (APSS), I am advised by Revenue that information regarding the total value of payments made under APSSs to employees is returned to Revenue on Form ESS1. Returns for 2014 are currently being processed and figures will be available for 2014 in due course. As such, I am not in a position to give the information sought by the Deputy at this stage.</p></reply>

As such, the estimated cost attached to REITs relates not to an exemption from tax, but rather to the move from direct taxation of rental income in the hands of investors, to the taxation of dividends distributed to investors from REIT profits arising from that rental income.  The REIT legislation requires that a minimum of 85% of all property income profits be distributed annually to shareholders.</p>  <p>   In answer to the question about the amounts of Dividend Withholding Tax ("DWT") refunded, I am assuming the "amount refunded through the Dividend Withholding Tax Refund Scheme" in context of the question refers to non-resident investors only. In general, distributions (payments) made to non-resident investors by Irish companies are exempt from DWT, where a relevant exemption certificate (proof of non-residency) is supplied by the investor to the company.  In cases where the proof of non-residency cannot be provided, the company will deduct DWT.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the total amount of DWT that has subsequently been refunded in accordance with the relevant Double Taxation Agreements ("DTAs") in 2015 is not readily available.   The general exemption for payments to non-resident investors does not apply to payments made by REITs to non-resident investors.  However, non-resident investors who are resident in countries with which Ireland has a DTA may be able to reclaim some of the DWT.  Claims for such refunds must be made on a specific form and  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the total amount of DWT (which was deducted by REITs on payments to non-resident investors) that has subsequently been refunded in accordance with the relevant DTAs to such investors is &euro;17,083.86. </p>  <p>  In answer to the question as to the total amount of REIT income which was not taxed at investor level, the relevant legislation provides that a REIT must return to Revenue details of distributions made where DWT is deducted.  As mentioned above, unlike the general rules for distributions paid to non-resident investors, distributions by REITs to such investors are subject to DWT and the non-resident investor will, depending on the national Income Tax rules in his or her country of residence, be subject to tax in that country.  Non-resident investors who are resident in countries with which Ireland has a DTA may be able to reclaim some of the DWT, if the relevant DTA permits.  Distributions made to Irish resident investors are subject to DWT, deducted by the REIT, in the normal way.  Such distributions are subject to Income Tax, PRSI, USC, etc. in the hands of the investor at the relevant rates in the normal way, where applicable, depending on the personal circumstances of the investor.  Where appropriate, a credit is given for the DWT deducted against the Income Tax due. </p>  <p>  In answer to the question as to the total value of property held by REITs here, a REIT is obliged to file relevant tax returns (VAT, PAYE/PRSI, Corporation Tax, etc.) in the same way as any other company.  In addition, it must file an annual statement to Revenue confirming the conditions attaching to being a REIT have been met and is also obliged to file details of DWT deductions on payments made to non-resident shareholders.  The legislation does not provide that a REIT must provide information to Revenue as to the total value of property held.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as the information furnished on VAT returns does not require the yield from particular activities or products to be identified, it is not possible to estimate the VAT yield for the sector mentioned by the Deputy.  Accordingly, I am not in a position to provide the projected figures for the reduction of the VAT rate suggested by the Deputy.</p><p>I would point out that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  A change in VAT rates must be in compliance with the EU VAT Directive.  Article 98 of the Directive limits to two the number of reduced rates a Member State may have.  Since Ireland has two reduced rates, the 13.5% and the 9% rate, it would not be possible to introduce a third reduced rate for a category of construction activities as suggested by the Deputy. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, I introduced the home renovation incentive (HRI) in Budget 2014 and extended it to rental properties, whose owners are liable to income tax, in Budget 2015.  This incentive came into operation on 25 October 2013 and will run until 31 December 2015.  The incentive provides tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence or a rental property.  Qualifying expenditure is that which is subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.  </p><p>The work must cost a minimum of &euro;4,405 exclusive of VAT, at which level it would attract a credit of &euro;595.  Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 exclusive of VAT, a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply.  The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is paid for.  </p><p>The aim of the measure is to increase and improve housing supply at a time when there is strong demand for housing and insufficient supply in certain areas.  HRI has been very successful to date.  </p><p>The incentive is generating significant employment in the tax compliant construction sector and increasing sales in building supplies, hardware and related businesses.  </p><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that data relating to HRI are available from the statistics section of the Revenue website at .  In particular, the data related to HRI are available in the &quot;Tax Expenditures&quot; section of the page at .These statistics will be updated in due course.</p></reply>

This CGT exemption does not extend to a disposal by a person who is not the beneficial owner of the policy and who acquired the rights or interest in the policy for a consideration in money or money's worth.  Any chargeable gains arising on such disposals would be liable to CGT at the current rate of 33%.  The Revenue Commissioners do not have the relevant data on disposals of life assurance policies to which the CGT exemption applies that would allow for any reliable estimate of the figure sought by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  However, the Deputy should also note that, since January 2001, an investment in a life policy is taxed under what is known as the gross roll-up taxation regime.  This regime allows a policyholder's investment to grow tax-free throughout the term of the policy, subject to a deduction of income tax (commonly referred to as exit tax), from payments made by the life assurance company to the policyholder.  The current rate of this exit tax is 41% and it is applied to any gain arising on a payment made to the policyholder, on the redemption, in full or in part, of the policy. </p>  <p>  For completeness, I should also mention that in addition to the deduction of exit tax from payments made to policyholders, there is also a further tax provision in place to ensure that policyholders cannot indefinitely postpone taxation by letting their monies accrue on a tax exempt basis in a policy.  Under this provision, a taxable event is deemed to take place on the ending of the 8 year period beginning with the date of commencement of the policy, and on every subsequent 8 year period.  This is known as the "deemed disposal".   The effect of this provision is that the life assurance company is obliged to account for tax (at the rate of 41%) on the same basis as would apply if the policy had been redeemed by the policyholder on that deemed disposal date.  Whenever an actual payment is subsequently made by the life assurance company to the policyholder, a tax credit is given for the exit tax paid on the deemed disposal event.</p>  <p>  The yield from exit tax in 2014 was &euro;130 million.</p></reply>

Overall, the cumulative value of savings delivered under the lease rationalisation and re-negotiation programme, between 2008 and 2014 is &euro;110,822,292 and has involved the surrender of approximately 1.2 million square feet of accommodation.  Annual rental expenditure, nationally, has been reduced from &euro;132 million in 2008 to an estimated &euro;86 million in 2015.  </p><p>Between 2011 and 2015, annual rents in Dublin have been reduced by &euro;13.68 million.  The number of leases in Dublin during the same period has reduced from 151 to 135. It should be noted that in 2012, the OPW took over 70 leases countrywide from F&Aacute;S and the Health Service Executive (HSE) on behalf of the Department of Social Protection and a proportion of these were in Dublin.</p><p>The lease rationalisation strategy pursued in the last 5 years has shifted the ratio of owned to leased office accommodation from 60% leased to 40% owned to the current ratio of c. 40% leased to 60% owned.  This rationalisation programme is continuing and will generate further savings in the coming years.</p><p>Recent legislation banning &quot;upward only&quot; rent review clauses from leases is not retrospective, so leases entered into prior to the legislation have not been impacted. Many of the leases surrendered in Dublin in the last five years contained &quot;upward only&quot; rent review clauses.</p></reply>

The country's ability to offer the appropriate talent through training, re-deployment and immigration all speak to the competitiveness of Ireland's offering. Other factors which also affect investor decisions include Ireland&rsquo;s relative cost competitiveness, good infrastructure, ease of doing business and openness to trade, competitive corporate tax regime, property availability, innovation landscape and available financial supports.</p>  <p>  Clear trends are evident in the demands of FDI investors in selecting particular locations, including: regions of scale with appropriate urban centres, supply of skilled people, international connectivity, energy infrastructure, telecommunications, R&amp;D capabilities, sub-supplier and services infrastructure.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland constantly monitors competitor locations and the value propositions they offer potential mobile investment.  Competition for FDI is intense and global, with virtually every country in the world actively seeking new FDI investments. Globally, the US continues to be the largest single investor in Ireland accounting for over 70% of investments won since 2010.  Competition for US FDI in Europe is intense.</p>  <p>  Europe is IDA Ireland&rsquo;s second largest market and accounts for 20% of investments won by IDA since 2010. Within Europe, Ireland&rsquo;s FDI performance positions us in absolute terms inside the top ten European locations for investment projects with the UK, Germany and France as the top locations.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland has a long and credible track record of presenting potential investors with the best location options throughout Ireland for each client.  </p>  <p>  During 2014 some 15,012 new jobs were created by IDA client companies with a net increase in employment of 7,131, one of the net highest levels of job creation in a decade. The impact of the FDI companies is very significant to the Irish economy injecting &euro;8.5 billion of wages and salaries into the Irish economy. Some &euro;2.8bn of tax revenue is paid by IDA client companies via corporation tax with some &euro;2.6bn of materials and &euro;11.3bn of services purchased by these companies.</p>  <p>  In February 2015 IDA announced its new strategy entitled "Winning: Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019" which sets out ambitious targets to boost FDI in Ireland by over 40%, creating 80,000 new jobs in the economy over the next five years.    </p>  <p>  Regional development is a major component of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s new corporate strategy. For the first time ambitious investment targets have been set for each region, with a strong focus on securing an increased share of investments.  Central to this is a strong ambition for employment growth throughout all regions over the lifetime of the strategy. By working closely with stakeholders in each region, as a cohesive team, it will be possible to strive for these goals;</p>  <p>  - A &euro;150m property investment plan, spread out over five years, will support the achievement of the organisation's regional goals.  The funding will be used to upgrade Ireland's Business and Technology parks, make investments in a number of strategic utility-intensive sites and build new advanced technology buildings in regional locations.</p>  <p>  - IDA is targeting a 20% increase in spending by overseas firms within Ireland, bringing expenditure to &euro;26.8bn per annum. In particular IDA is committed to showcasing Irish industry to its client companies. </p>  <p>  - A 20% increase in cumulative spend (&euro;3bn) on Research Development and Innovation is also a target of the strategy, as overseas companies place additional high value activity into Ireland.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s future FDI success will require continued support of existing sectors, and exploiting new opportunities in new sectors.  It will also require continued marketing of global markets and in relation to IDA&rsquo;s global strategy, North America will remain the key source market for FDI, while also targeting market share growth in Europe and increasing returns from regions such as Asia-Pacific. </p>  <p>Additionally, Growth Markets including India China, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Australia/New Zealand, Russia and Brazil, have   become central sources of and destinations for global FDI flows, with Asia in particular becoming a key player.  IDA Ireland has put additional resources into these markets over the past five years and has seen good results with &lsquo;New Name&rsquo; investments rising from 4% in 2010 to 20% in 2014 and on average accounting for 10% of total investment. A strong emphasis in the strategy is on bringing first time investors to Ireland from USA, Europe and the new markets where IDA will continue to target high growth companies.</p>  <p>  The ambitious targets will bring total direct employment by overseas companies in Ireland to 209,000 people by 2019. This will be the highest level of employment from overseas firms in the history of the State and will deliver wide-ranging economic benefits for the people of Ireland.</p></reply>

The National Competitiveness Council and my Department and its agencies are continually engaged with relevant stakeholders on the particular policy needs required to support cost competitiveness.  The stakeholders include other Government Departments, regulatory bodies and public and private bodies.  We continue to monitor Ireland's cost competitiveness on a regular basis.  This is specifically required under the Action Plan for Jobs 2015. Action 247 requires the National Competitiveness Council to &ldquo;Benchmark key business costs and publish a report highlighting areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2015 report shows that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last five years, and driven by reforms set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness position has improved in recent years. </p>  <p>  As noted in the Government&rsquo;s Spring Economic Statement, this improvement in competitiveness has facilitated a reallocation of resources towards the tradeable sectors of the economy.  Job creation has been the stand-out impact of this improvement.  However, as the Council report makes clear, Ireland remains a high cost location for a range of key business inputs and there is a significant risk that recent competitiveness gains may be eroded.</p>  <p>  The Costs of Doing Business in Ireland report published in April 2015 benchmarks key business costs across over 50 indicators and focuses on areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors, and on costs that are largely domestically determined.</p>  <p>  The 2015 report concentrates on the costs that are largely domestically determined such as labour, property, energy, water, waste, communications and business services.  The report finds that while relative cost competitiveness is improving (i.e. although costs are increasing, they are increasing at a slower rate than in many of our competitors), this improvement is largely being driven by external factors beyond the control of domestic policymakers. In particular, a weak euro exchange rate, low ECB interest rates, and low international fuel prices have all combined to improve Irish cost competitiveness.</p>  <p>  The NCC report concludes that Ireland&rsquo;s industrial cost base has improved but pressure points are emerging in labour, property and business service costs.  We must therefore focus intensely on reducing costs that are out of line with those in competitor countries.  There is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage their cost base and drive efficiency, thus creating a virtuous circle between the costs of living, wage expectations and cost competitiveness.</p></reply>

The role of SMEs in job creation can hardly be overstated, as we know from research by the Central Bank that two-thirds of new jobs are created by firms in the their first five years. It is in this context that we have placed a key focus on promoting entrepreneurship and scaling of businesses in manufacturing and services sectors at the heart of the Action Plan for Jobs.</p>  <p>  This focus on entrepreneurship and SMEs in Action Plan for Jobs is having a positive impact.  As of Q1 2015, there were an additional 104,00 at work in the economy since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012, which achieved and exceeded the Government&rsquo;s target of 100,000 extra at work by 2016.  The services sector made the largest contribution to the achievement of the Government&rsquo;s target of 100,000 more at work. Following a number of years of decline in employment from 2007, the manufacturing sector has also recorded increases in job numbers since 2011.</p>  <p>  To achieve our ambition of sustainable full employment, jobs growth in export oriented manufacturing and services SMEs will be essential over the next twelve months and beyond.  The 2015 Action Plan for Jobs sets out a comprehensive range of measures to support entrepreneurship, SMEs and the self-employed in the areas of education and research, business environment and supports, innovation and access to finance, networks and mentoring; and, access to markets.  Increasing entrepreneurial activity is a Disruptive Reform in the Action Plan for Jobs for 2015.  Our key priority is driving implementation of the actions in the National Entrepreneurship Statement, which was published in October last year and to achieve the ambitions targets set out for a 25% increase in the number of start-ups and in the scaling and sustainability of new enterprises. </p>  <p>  The launch of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) was a major reform delivered in 2014 and the clients of the LEOs increased employment by 4,012 last year to 31,326 jobs throughout the country.  In 2015 the LEOs will have ambitious and robust county strategies and targets for start-ups, enterprise engagements and supports to be effective first-stop-shops for enterprise information and supports and launch an Entrepreneur Partnering Programme.</p>  <p>  My Department through its agencies will build on the 2014 success of the awards programmes such as Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur with a renewed programme for 2015.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland works to increase the number of companies starting-up, succeeding, expanding, exporting and ultimately creating jobs in Ireland.  EI&rsquo;s support system for young companies includes help with business planning, mentoring and development advice, feasibility funding and finance, often in the form of equity investment, as appropriate to the founder&rsquo;s ambitions and the company&rsquo;s potential and stage of growth. Enterprise Ireland has set itself an ambitious target of 550 new and early start-ups supported by 2016.  Enterprise Ireland also continues to support the development of the Seed and Venture Capital and Business Angel sectors to increase the provision of early stage funding to support entrepreneurs and early stage companies.</p>  <p>  The launch of the simplified Startup Refunds for Entrepreneurs Scheme (SURE) in 2015 will provide additional finance for entrepreneurs. In many cases the lack of a first reference sale is a key barrier to accessing funding at an early stage.  Early intervention through entrepreneur development programmes such as New Frontiers and others workshops and accelerator programmes helps companies accelerate their business development and to build up the skills and contacts needed to successfully start and grow. EI will support 130 new Entrepreneurs via the New Frontiers programme in 2015.</p>  <p>  A range of agricultural related measures are being implemented including steps to maximise available agricultural land with measures to encourage long term leasing. We are also continuing to supporting the tourism sector with retention of 9% VAT rate</p></reply>

Statistics show that RDI performers are gaining an increasing share of sales, export sales and are accounting for increasing shares of employment. </p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are focused on the development and support of internationally trading manufacturing and services firms in Ireland, and have a clear and steady focus on the potential and opportunities that exist and can be created by prioritising innovation and technology as a key driver of success.  Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland provide a spectrum of innovation and science/technology development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support to help companies become more innovative, encourage and support competitiveness, and help them grow their sales and exports in order to create a climate in which sustainable employment will grow and expand. </p>  <p>  Evidence, from both the EU and internationally, shows that the Government&rsquo;s strategy of accelerating the economic and societal return on our STI investment is paying off.  Globally, Ireland is ranked:</p>  <p>- 1st in the world for the availability of skilled labour [Source: IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook];</p>  <p>- 11th in the Global Innovation Index 2014 out of 143 countries [Source: Cornell University, INSEAD and WIPO 2014]</p>  <p>- 13th in the world for university-industry collaboration on R&amp;D [Source: Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014]</p>  <p>- Ireland&rsquo;s global ranking in terms of citations was 16th in 2014 &ndash; up 4 places from 2013 [Essential Science Indicators Thomson Reuters]</p>  <p>In addition, Ireland has improved its position for 2 years in a row in the European Commission Innovation Union Scoreboard according to the 2015 edition.  We are now ranked 8th amongst the 28 EU Member States moving from 9th place in 2014 and 10th place in 2013.  It is particularly encouraging to see that Ireland is the overall leader in two specific dimensions: Innovators &ndash; which measures how innovative firms are; and Economic Effects - which captures economic success stemming from innovation in terms of employment, revenue and exports.</p>  <p>  With a budget of just under &euro;80 billion and covering the period 2014 to 2020, Horizon 2020 is the EU&rsquo;s new programme providing access to European funding to researchers, research organisations and industry to engage in leading edge research, thus facilitating European economic recovery.  Horizon 2020 is a core part of Europe 2020, the Innovation Union and the European Research Area and is responding to the economic crisis by investing in future jobs and growth, addressing people&rsquo;s concerns about their livelihoods, safety and environment and strengthening the EU&rsquo;s global position in research, innovation and technology.</p>  <p>  Ireland performed to a very high standard in the preceding programme, the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Innovation 2007-2013 (FP7) with almost &euro;600 million in funding to participants in Ireland having been allocated from call results to date, thereby achieving the national target set for Irish participation in this programme.  It is important to remember that this funding is provided on a competitive basis, with excellence being the key award criterion.</p>  <p>  In December 2013, the Government approved a national strategy for participation in Horizon 2020 together with an ambitious target of &euro;1.25 billion in funding to Ireland over the lifetime of Horizon 2020.  The strategy sets out a comprehensive range of actions designed to maximise Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the programme and achieve the target, involving all of the key Departments, agencies and research performers.  A Horizon 2020 High Level Group, under the chairmanship of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has been established to oversee the implementation of the national strategy.  This includes identifying key areas of opportunity where Irish researchers, agencies and companies can maximise their participation in the programme.  During the first nine months of Horizon 2020, Ireland has been awarded &euro;97 million &ndash; our target for the full year is &euro;100m.</p>  <p>  A national support network of National Contact Points coordinated by Enterprise Ireland has been established, comprising knowledgeable and experienced practitioners from relevant Departments and agencies, charged with helping companies and academics access the funding opportunities presented by Horizon 2020.</p>  <p>  I am confident that, building on our successful performance in FP7 and supported by our national strategy and a strong national support network, Irish companies and multinational corporations based in Ireland will continue to have excellent support to compete for Horizon 2020 funding.</p></reply>

Improved competitiveness has made Irish firms more cost competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in.</p>  <p>  Addressing Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness therefore remains a key economic priority for Government.  Since 2012, the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs has set out a comprehensive set of measures to improve our competitiveness performance.  The themes in this year&rsquo;s Plan build on the reforms of previous years in the areas of competitiveness and sets out a range of actions to facilitate improved competitiveness.</p>  <p>  We continue to monitor Ireland's cost competitiveness on a regular basis.  This is specifically required under the Action Plan for Jobs 2015. Action 247 requires the National Competitiveness Council (NCC) to &ldquo;Benchmark key business costs and publish a report highlighting areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors&rdquo;.  The NCC&rsquo;s Costs of Doing Business in Ireland report published in April 2015 benchmarks key business costs across over 50 indicators and focuses on areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors, and on costs that are largely domestically determined.</p>  <p>  The 2015 report concentrates on the costs that are largely domestically determined such as labour, property, energy, water, waste, communications and business services.  The report finds that while relative cost competitiveness is improving (i.e. although costs are increasing, they are increasing at a slower rate than in many of our competitors), this improvement is largely being driven by external factors beyond the control of domestic policymakers. In particular, a weak euro exchange rate, low ECB interest rates, and low international fuel prices have all combined to improve Irish cost competitiveness. </p>  <p>  The NCC report concludes that Ireland&rsquo;s industrial cost base has improved but pressure points are emerging in labour, property and business service costs.  We must therefore focus intensely on reducing costs that are out of line with those in competitor countries.  There is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage their cost base and drive efficiency, thus creating a virtuous circle between the costs of living, wage expectations and cost competitiveness.  Measures that ensure open and competitive markets are essential.  Improving productivity performance is also key.</p>  <p>  Government will continue to progress actions that improve Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness position.  The policy implications of the Costs of Doing Business and associated structural reforms required to address Ireland&rsquo;s cost base, will also be included in the NCC&rsquo;s annual Competitiveness Challenge report which will be published later this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-15a.307.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071500089#WRJ01400"><p>The aim of the Action Plan for Jobs is to support enterprise growth and job creation for all age cohorts.  While we have made great progress in addressing our unemployment and competitiveness challenges and in building a new, sustainable enterprise economy driven by skills, innovation and success in markets, we need to sustain the momentum and stretch ourselves further if we are to achieve sustainable full employment by 2018 and ensure that all parts of our regions benefit from the recovery.</p>  <p>  Over 104,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012.  The CSO data for June 2015 indicates that the number of persons aged under-25 on the Live Register has fallen by 22,300 over the two years since June 2013. This is equivalent to a decrease of 38 per cent over the last two years, which compares favourably with the overall rate of decline in the numbers unemployed on a Live Register basis of 28 per cent over the period.  As a result, the proportion of the unemployed that are under-25 years of age has declined from 20.2 per cent in June 2013 to 17.6 per cent of the unemployed in June 2015.  The overall rate of unemployment has declined from a peak of 15.1 per cent at the start of 2012 to 9.7 per cent in June 2015.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.  Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.</p>  <p>  My Department and agencies are working with other Departments and supporting the work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and the new Apprenticeship Council in advising on future enterprise skills needs and ensuring that education and training provision is providing our young people with the skills required to take up available employment opportunities.  In particular we are focusing on the education and training provision in the areas where we see future job opportunities arising from both expansion and replacement demand for a range of occupational roles including in ICT, data analytics, manufacturing, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, international sales and marketing, project management, freight transport, distribution and logistics &ndash; including warehousing and growth in the hospitality sector.</p>  <p>  While it is the Pathways to Work strategy that focuses on specific measures to improve employment opportunities for young persons, the steps taken to date under previous Action Plans, and those set out for this year, complement that work and directly assist young job seekers.  The Action Plan for Jobs commits to implementing the 70 actions in Pathways to Work 2015.  These include beginning the new account management approach to employers, roll-out JobPath, continuing to roll-out the Youth Guarantee initiatives, and introduce a Back to Work Family Dividend. In addition, as part of Pathways to Work, a new JobsPlus strand for young people will be available in 2015 under the Youth Guarantee.</p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan was published in January 2014.  The Youth Developmental Internship, First Steps, is an additional measure to provide youth with valuable work.  This will offer young jobseekers aged between 18 and 25 the opportunity to gain valuable work experience and training with the help of dedicated assistance from department of Social Protection case officers.  The target is to provide up to 1,500 work experience placements of six to nine months duration for young job seekers during 2015.  Earlier and more intensive engagement by Intreo with the young unemployed will also be introduced.  Models for the engagement of young people through Intreo have been agreed and will form the basis of the national roll-out of the Youth Guarantee in 2015.</p>  <p>  There will be a continuing focus on improvement in skills provision through the provision of programmes for a diverse range of individuals including young unemployed people through the Education and Training Boards in the implementation of the Further Education Strategy 2014-2018, the Momentum programmes, the recent launch of the fifth iteration of Springboard, offering short higher education courses for jobseekers with previous work experience, employment incentive schemes such as JobsPlus and doubling of high-end skills as part of the second ICT Skills Action Plan.  The launch of the call for new apprenticeships should provide further opportunities for young people to find rewarding careers for the future.</p>  <p>In the areas of entrepreneurship, the launch of the Local Enterprise Offices provides a first-stop-shop for young entrepreneurs with an idea or interested in starting a business and we will build on the success of &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur&rdquo; competition which was launched in 2014 </p></reply>

The Action plan for Jobs process has specifically targeted access to finance issues as being central to the welfare of business.  Under this process the SME State Bodies Group, chaired by the Department of Finance, was established and works to deliver on this agenda for all SMEs.  A number of key policy initiatives have been developed which are contributing to the evolution of a more robust and effective platform for the financing of SMEs. These include:</p>  <p>- The establishment of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) providing up to &euro;800 million of funds;</p>  <p>- The development of an innovative SME State Support On-line tool to provide an individual with a list of the possible government business supports available to their particular business;</p>  <p>- Government agreement to amend the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 and introduce a new more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme;</p>  <p>- The review of Microfinance Fund Ireland (MFI).</p>  <p>  A recent credit demand survey conducted by Red C for the Department of Finance has found that improved trading conditions mean that far fewer companies are seeking credit in order to survive day to day financial pressures.  Only just under half (48%) of those SMEs seeking finance between October 2014 and March 2015 did so for working capital needs, compared to 61% in the previous period. Improved turnover and profit have led to SMEs suggesting they fund working capital through internal funding/retained earnings (64%).</p>  <p>  This Survey also shows banks are currently more likely to approve funding for working capital (69%) than for growth (61%). Decline rates for growth stand at 18%, with the decline rate for working capital at just 13%.  Of course any SME who has been refused bank credit or has issues with the terms and conditions offered can appeal these decisions to the Government&rsquo;s Credit Review Office.</p>  <p>  As the economy moves into a new phase of growth there is an opportunity to further develop a policy agenda that addresses some of the structural constraints in the financing of the SME sector such as the need for improved payment practices in Ireland. </p>  <p>  One initiative to improve payment performance in Ireland is the Government requirement that all central Government Departments pay their suppliers within 15 calendar days of receipt of a valid invoice.  The recent launch of the Prompt Payment Code (PPC) portal is another important step in addressing the culture of late payments in Ireland.  These initiatives, together with the late payment legislation, demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s continuing drive and commitment to encourage a prompt payment culture in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Building on the progress to date and further supporting the financing of growth within the SME sector will require a clear focus on how best to maximise the benefits to SMEs of the evolving financial landscape in Ireland.  Our continued focus is on the adoption and delivery of actions that contribute to developing a more diversified and competitive financial system, capable of financing the growth potential of Irish SMEs</p>  <p>  As a Government we will continue to maintain our focus on assisting SMEs to establish, scale and export in order to ensure that they continue to drive our economic recovery and create further jobs.</p></reply>

Nevertheless, competition for FDI has intensified over recent years and we need to be continuously alert to differentiating Ireland&rsquo;s offering to attract investment.  My Department's Policy Statement on Foreign Direct Investment, which was published at the end of July 2014, sets out the strategic direction for FDI to 2020 and the key actions needed to enhance Ireland's attractiveness and business environment in the context of intensified international competition for investment and talent.  I recently launched IDA Ireland's new corporate strategy for the years 2015 to 2020 which aims to create 80,000 new jobs in the economy over the next five years.</p>  <p>  Total employment at IDA client companies now stands at 174,488 people, the highest level in the history of IDA Ireland.  The job performance took place against a particularly challenging European economic environment and changing corporate taxation landscape.  There were 197 investments in 2014, equating to a 20% increase on 2013.  There was a notable rise in new-name investment, with 88 new name investors in 2014.</p>  <p>  All FDI is hard won.  The range of countries competing for FDI in Europe demonstrates the intensity of the marketplace to secure investments for Ireland. In Ireland's case, it is a range of factors that play a role in influencing location investment decisions.  In addition to the strong economic management and certainty on the 12.5% corporate tax rate, these factors include: our relative cost competitiveness; the availability of a dynamic talent pool and our continuing investment in our education and training systems; our focus on building comparative advantage in a range of sectors; and our investments in strengthening our national innovation system. </p>  <p>  While no formal assessment has been carried out in relation to the possible impact of a cut in the UK corporation tax rate on Foreign Direct Investment into Ireland, it is well known that Ireland is a supporter of fair tax competition and the OECD has consistently stated that low corporation tax rates combined with a broad base is the best way to encourage economic growth while still maintaining tax revenues.</p>  <p>  The US continues to be the largest single investor in Europe accounting for about 25% of all inward investment projects and job creation.  While Ireland is a significant recipient of US FDI for contestable investments, competition with the UK, Germany and France, the major overall beneficiaries of US investment into Europe, is intense. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland constantly monitor competitor locations and the value propositions they offer potential mobile investment.  Competitor locations differ depending on the sector of the mobile investment. In this respect, IDA Ireland is continuously working to ensure that Ireland is the most competitive, innovative and relevant to the investment being targeted.</p>  <p>  Ireland's relative cost competitiveness, corporate tax regime and available direct firm level financial supports remain critically important - but in reality they are no longer aspects that will substantially differentiate Ireland's offering for FDI over the longer term.  So in addition to maintaining a competitive offering in these areas we must at the same time redouble efforts to develop and reinforce the aspects that truly differentiate Ireland's offering in a context of intensified global competition for mobile investment in relation to our skills and talent base, our productivity levels and our levels of innovation and the excellence of our science and research base.</p></reply>

As of Q1 2015, there were an additional 104,00 at work in the economy since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs, which achieved and exceeded the Government&rsquo;s target of 100,000 extra at work by 2016.  The services sector made the largest contribution to the achievement of the Government&rsquo;s target of 100,000 more at work.  Following a number of years of decline in employment from 2007, I am pleased to report that the manufacturing sector has also recorded increases in job numbers since 2011.</p>  <p>  In relation to agency assisted firms, the net increase in fulltime employment in manufacturing and services since the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs to 2014 is 25,665, of which there a was a net increase of 8,051 in manufacturing employment and a net increase of 17,614 in internationally traded services employment.  This equates to just under one-third, or 31 per cent, of the net increase in full-time employment in agency assisted firms was in manufacturing and two-thirds of the net increase was in internationally traded services enterprises, since the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs. </p>  <p>  Arising from the strategy for the manufacturing sector &lsquo;Making it in Ireland: Manufacturing 2020&rsquo;, prepared by Forf&aacute;s and the report of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs Skills Report on the skills needs for the sector, both of which I launched in 2013, there are now a range of initiatives being progressed by my Department and relevant Agencies to drive the Government&rsquo;s jobs targets.</p>  <p>  To achieve our ambition of sustainable full employment, jobs growth in export oriented manufacturing and services businesses will be essential over the coming years.  Manufacturing was a Disruptive Reform in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 and is a key focus in the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs and also in the Action Plans for Jobs-Regional, with a range of measures designed to support industry growth including encouraging entrepreneurship, further improving our skills base, improving access to finance by SMEs and supporting indigenous companies and foreign-owned manufacturing companies to transform their businesses as part of a National Step Change Initiative.  The Manufacturing Development Forum is helping to address the key issues arising from the Strategy recommendations.  My Department is also preparing a guide for manufacturing firms to state support available.  These initiatives are important to growing and sustaining the competitiveness of existing enterprises, to sustaining employment and to attracting new investment.</p></reply>

This Policy Statement represents the first time a Government has published a comprehensive national plan for entrepreneurship in Ireland.  The key target contained in the plan is to double the jobs impact of start-ups in Ireland over the next five years.  The National Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship is the Government&rsquo;s plan to deliver an ambitious but realistic increase in the numbers of start-ups in Ireland over the next five years.  The Government has set out a vision for Ireland to be among the most entrepreneurial nations in the world and to be acknowledged as a world-class environment to start and grow a business.  By driving implementation of the actions in the new National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement we will double the jobs impact of start-ups in Ireland over the next five years, from 93,000 currently.</p><p>  I have established and chair an Implementation Group to drive delivery, oversee implementation and monitor progress on the 94 actions set out in the Policy Statement.  This Group will also support my Department in seeking to identify and consider further initiatives to support the entrepreneurship agenda in Ireland.</p><p>Membership of this group is drawn from the enterprise development agencies, key central government stakeholders such as the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Finance, and most importantly entrepreneurs themselves. </p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2015 details a number of the immediate key actions to support the Government's ambition and confirms the commitment to continue to identify new approaches that will enhance and strengthen Ireland's entrepreneurial ecosystem and ultimately create jobs.  Key actions are set out to expand reform measures to boost entrepreneurship across all areas of the economy and society.</p><p>A number of the key objectives to support entrepreneurship delivered in 2015 include:</p><p>-  Launch of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs;</p><p>- Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur 2015 competition launched;</p><p>- Launch of the Startup Refunds for Entrepreneurs (SURE) scheme;</p><p>- Continue to promote LEOs as one stop shops for small business; and</p><p>- Develop an action programme of support for pre-investment HPSUs.</p><p>All actions related to entrepreneurship within the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 have been delivered on schedule under the quarter one update.  The quarter two update has not been finalised yet, but there are no indications to suggest that any related actions are delayed.  Considerable work has been undertaken in recent years to support entrepreneurs and startups and the actions identified in the National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement will strengthen existing supports.</p><p>No one policy intervention will generate substantial impact on the entrepreneurship ecosystem, but various actions if taken together will combine to create greater synergies.  The overarching National Entrepreneurship Statement serves to co-ordinate all areas of Government policy in the area of entrepreneurship to drive these synergies and will deliver on the targets I referred to above.</p></reply>

While we have made great progress in addressing our unemployment and competitiveness challenges and in building a new, sustainable enterprise economy driven by skills, innovation and success in markets, we need to sustain the momentum and stretch ourselves further if we are to achieve sustainable full employment by 2018 and ensure that all parts of our regions benefit from the recovery. In the South West Region, since the launch of the national Action Plan for Jobs process four years ago where the rate of unemployment in the South West Region has fallen from 13.5% in 2011 to 10.6% in Q4 2014 and our ambition is to reduce this further. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs for the South West Region is about building on the capabilities and strengths of the region, covering counties Cork and Kerry, to develop a more dynamic, internationally competitive and sustainable enterprise economy that can provide well paid jobs and secure sustainable full employment over the long term. Employment in the South West declined by 45,600 (15%) during the crash; since the national Action Plan for Jobs was launched in Q1 2012 jobs in the region have grown by 11,200 (4%).</p>  <p>  Our ambition is to achieve full employment by 2018 and vibrant and competitive regions are central to realising that ambition. The aim of the Action Plan for Jobs Regional (APJR) for the South West is to develop the full potential of the region for enterprise and job creation, building upon its assets and areas of competitive advantage. This can only be achieved by a new level of collaboration among key players in the region working to achieve common goals.</p>  <p>  The primary objective of this APJR is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in the region by 2020 and to ensure the unemployment rate is within 1% of the State average. Achieving this goal in the SW will contribute to the overall ambition of creating sustainable full employment in Ireland from 2018 onwards. Successful implementation of the Plan for Kerry and Cork could see creation the creation of between 27,780 and 41,670 additional jobs in the region by 2020. </p>  <p>  The levels of employment growth actually achieved within that range will depend on factors including the level of support and collaboration within the local community for the Plan, and the level of collaboration between organisations in the region and the main Government bodies involved in the plan. Based on all the evidence and the strong buy-in for the process up to this point I believe it is realistic to target 40,000 additional jobs in the region by 2020. I am delighted Bob Savage, head of EMC in Cork, has agreed to chair a joint public-private sector Implementation Group to drive forward the delivery of the Plan.</p>  <p>  The South West Plan covers counties Kerry and Cork, and key sectors targeted as part of the plan include agri-food, tourism, life sciences, manufacturing and ICT, as well as high-potential emerging sectors such as multimedia/content and the green economy, energy and marine. Actions in the Plan to be delivered over the period 2015-2017 include new measures to increase the number of businesses starting-up, scaling and surviving, delivered through a range of measures including more co-working space and mentoring for entrepreneurs and new funding through competitive calls, new initiatives to increase employment in exporting companies, delivered by adding 30-40% to the number of IDA investments achieved, building an IDA advance facility in Tralee, increasing enterprise-research collaborations and increasing the levels of workforce training and development activity. A range of actions are also set out to promote new sources of growth in the region including in the content and multimedia sector, actions to develop innovative energy technology and solutions combining the regions strengths in research and enterprise, developing the green economy in the region and rolling out &ldquo;smart region&rdquo; infrastructure such as sensors for traffic and utility management.</p>  <p>  To support the Regional Action Plan for Jobs Process, my Department through EI and IDA, will provide &euro;250m in additional funding over five years to support the implementation of the Regional Action Plans. This comprises &euro;150m for IDA Ireland to roll out a 5-year capital investment programme and &euro;100m to support and encourage regional stakeholders in working together on best practice initiatives, provided by DJEI through Enterprise Ireland and a series of competitive calls. The first tranche of applications for &euro;10 million in competitive funding to support initiatives proposed by the LEOs and to support the development Community Enterprise Centres in all regions are currently being assessed.</p></reply>

The abolition of milk quota presents a massive opportunity for the Irish dairy sector and one which we should look forward to with confidence. The fact that producers will face a super-levy bill in relation to the final year of the system is obviously unwelcome. However, the rules governing the imposition of a super levy were set by regulations agreed at EU level. It was not possible for me on a unilateral basis to adjust these super levy rules.</p>  <p>  However, arrangements recently introduced by the Commission, following consistent requests from Ireland and other Member States for some relief for farmers with super levy bills allow Member States to facilitate the payment by milk producers of this super levy liability in three annual instalments, without interest. The first instalment must be collected by the milk purchaser in the normal way and paid to my Department before 1 October 2015 and the two subsequent payments must be paid by similar dates in 2016 and 2017. I have introduced the scheme at national level and co-ops and farmers are currently processing applications with a view to returning them to my Department.</p>  <p>  It is worth mentioning at this stage that I have also been proactive in other areas in terms of ensuring the right balance of measures are in place to ensure that Irish dairy farmers can enter the new quota free era with confidence. On-going contact has been maintained with the Minister for Finance to ensure that existing and future taxation policy reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture. Of interest to dairy farmers here will be the announcement in last October&rsquo;s budget to provide for income averaging over five years when it comes to paying income tax bills. I have also ensured that priority has been given to measures for the dairy sector in the Rural Development Plan. In addition, I have impressed upon the Irish banks the need to show flexibility in their dealings with farmers experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties in 2015.   </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this mix of measures, can help to mitigate the impact of the superlevy.</p></reply>

The only source of funding available to the National Reserve will be clawback from the sale of entitlements without land and from unused entitlements, so the available resource could be limited.

BNG is the statutory body with responsibility for the improvement and development of the greyhound industry, greyhound racing and coursing.  Detailed rules governing the practice of the artificial insemination of greyhounds were set down in the Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds Regulations, 2005, (S.I.

Arising from this decision, and with the consent of the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, new regulations were introduced by Bord na gCon which came into effect on 1 November 2014 removing this two year limit on semen from an expired sire.</p>  <p>  I am informed by Bord na gCon that in conjunction with the Irish Coursing Club they have carried out preliminary research and discussions with various experts in the areas of Quantitative Genetics, Animal &amp;amp; Bioscience Research and Canine Genetics on the specific aspects such as:</p>  <p>  - Pedigree analysis of inbreeding levels and rate of accumulation of inbreeding in the Irish Greyhound</p>  <p>  - Developing a breeding program to ensure long term gains while simultaneously managing genetic diversity</p>  <p>  - The impact on the age of semen or age of semen donor on gene mutation rate.</p>  <p>  Bord na gCon has informed me that greyhound owners are not allowed to ignore the provisions of the legislation pertaining to the greyhound industry and any allegations of breaches are investigated by Bord na gCon.</p></reply>

Any changes to the management of this fishery are therefore given careful consideration prior to enactment.  The Lobster (Conservation of Stocks) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 591 of 2014), which I signed into law in December 2014, concluded the roll-out of changes to lobster conservation measures which I had announced in May 2014.  The regulations replace and revoke previous regulations with the objective of supporting the reproductive potential of the stock. In that regard, I am conscious of my responsibilities under the Common Fisheries Policy to strive for sustainable inshore fisheries in the long term.</p>  <p>  The package of enhanced conservation measures I announced in May 2014 were approved following the consideration of over 250 submissions received during an extensive public consultation on the lobster fisheries.  These submissions were reviewed in light of scientific advice and information on the status of the fisheries.  The changes to the lobster management measures are aimed at ensuring the long-term viability of this stock by protecting its reproductive potential.  The most recent stock advice from the Shellfish Stocks and Fisheries Review 2012 noted that the egg production level for the stock is estimated to be below generally accepted limit reference points. The measures which now apply to the lobster fishery include:</p>  <p>- Continued legal protection in the aforementioned regulations for lobsters v-notched under an incentivised National Lobster V-Notching Programme which provides financial support for fishermen engaged in conservation practice of v-notching live lobsters and returning them to sea to contribute to the reproductive capacity of the stock;</p>  <p>- The introduction of a new maximum landing size for lobster of 127mm, which took effect from 1 January 2015 through the aforementioned regulations;</p>  <p>- An increase in grant aid to fishermen for the voluntary v-notching of lobsters from the existing rate of 55% to a new maximum of 75% of the market price;</p>  <p>- Transitional arrangements that provide fishermen with grant aid of up to 80 % of the market price for v-notching oversize lobsters and returning them alive to sea during the first two years of the maximum landing size measure;</p>  <p>- EU regulations prohibiting the landing of lobsters of less than 87mm in carapace length.</p>  <p>  I established the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) specifically to give inshore fishermen a voice in policy making and decisions on inshore fisheries management and to work with the Department and the marine agencies in developing robust, scientifically sound measures to support sustainable fisheries into the future.  I have invited the delegates to bring forward proposals from their respective Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums on how some of the specific challenges faced by the lobster fishery could be addressed, including projects which could be funded under the forthcoming EMFF operational programme, for discussion.</p>  <p>  Delegates in a number of regions identified recreational fishing as a growing concern and the National Inshore Fisheries Forum has brought forward proposals on how this could be addressed.</p>  <p>  I look forward to publishing a consultation paper taking account of these proposals in the near future.</p></reply>

No. 207 of 2015) came into force on 1 June 2015. The regulations have been made under the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 and have been laid before each House of the Oireachtas in accordance with section 3 of that Act.  The regulations apply to the razor clam fishery in the north Irish Sea and implement a weekly catch limit for vessels and limiting fishing to certain days of the week.  In addition, the Razor Clam (Conservation of Stocks) Regulations 2015 (S.I. No. 206 of 2015) also introduce monitoring and reporting measures for razor clam fishing around the coast to ensure traceability of catch and to provide appropriate information on the patterns of exploitation of these fisheries.</p>  <p>  The regulations were developed from a request to introduce management measures from the North Irish Sea Razor Fishermen&rsquo;s Association which I published for public consultation in November 2014 to give all potentially affected stakeholders an opportunity to comment.  Following analysis of the 39 submissions received, in February 2015 a briefing session was facilitated between the North East and South East Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums, officials from my Department, the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and representatives from the aforementioned Association and other razor clam fishermen to review the comments and discuss future steps.  The measures were also discussed with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum meetings in April and May.  I am satisfied that these regulations have undergone a comprehensive consultation process.</p></reply>

However, I am aware of successful voluntary initiatives.  BiaFood and FoodCloud are working with large retail outlets to offer edible food to charities in a safe, efficient and responsive way.  I have visited the BiaFoodInitiative regional hub in Little Island, Cork, the first of three planned hubs.  This has an infrastructure to receive and redistribute large volumes of surplus food to an industry standard, software technology to track and trace all product movements from point of entry to end user, and is a strong voluntary model. <font color="#222222"> Tesco is providing them with equipment and some other support.  </font>The Department of Social Protection is supporting staffing of the hub and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has provided advice on carrying out the business in a safe way in compliance with the food regulations, as such organisations come under the definition of a food business in general food law.  In March BiaFoodInitiative joined Bord Bia's online Origin Green Platform, which provides access to a network of over 400 companies, who could include this as a waste reduction measure in their Origin Green action plans. </p><p>FoodCloud connects businesses that have too much food to charities in communities that have too little.  Using the FoodCloud app, or the website, participating businesses can upload details of their surplus food and the time period in which the food can be collected.  This automatically sends a text message to the most appropriate charities in their community.  The first charity to accept the offer collects it directly from the business.  By donating surplus food to various charities, businesses can assist them in reducing their food costs and therefore allow them to redirect funding to programs assisting those who are disadvantaged, creating tangible and long lasting local benefits.  Following a successful pilot programme, Tesco Ireland and FoodCloud last year announced a partnership that will see all surplus food from Tesco&rsquo;s stores redistributed to charities and community groups through the use of FoodCloud&rsquo;s innovative app.</p><p>There is much to be said for promoting voluntary engagement by the industry with such initiatives before consideration by Government on whether legislation is appropriate.</p></reply>

Its board includes representatives of farm bodies, breed societies, and AI and Milk Recording Organisations.  My Department is represented on the board, but is not a shareholder.</p><p>The ICBF is the only approved body currently designated in Ireland under Commission Decision 2006/427/EC to set the rules for performance recording, assessing genetic value and for publication of the evaluation results of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species.  The EU legislation states <i>&lsquo;all data must be recorded under the responsibility of the approved body'</i>.  The ICBF provides independent animal genetic evaluations for beef and dairy cattle farmers and the wider cattle breeding industry in Ireland and its activities include:</p><p>a. operating and maintaining the ICBF cattle database and animal events recording system to gather data for genetic evaluation services;</p><p>b. operating the test centre at Tully;</p><p>c. establishing and supporting the breeding programmes for Irish dairy and beef breeds;</p><p>d. engaging with research organisations to develop further services to Irish cattle farmers.</p><p>The Irish Cattle Breeding Federation Society Ltd is registered with the Companies Registration Office in Dublin under Registration Number 4914R, through the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1978.  The ICBF has registered offices at Highfield House, Shinagh, Bandon, Co Cork. The gross income of the ICBF in 2014 was &euro;8,742,349, and its accounts were filed with the Register of Friendly societies.  The ICBF will be providing the information in relation to its 2014 expenditure to the Charities Regulatory Authority within the timeframe required by the legislation (10 months after year end).</p><p>In relation to the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) as the Deputy is aware, this scheme allocates funding of some &euro;300 million to support suckler farmers in Ireland over the next six years.  The BDGP builds on the large strategic investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in Ireland in recent years and which has been undertaken in conjunction with the ICBF.  It will ultimately bring about fundamental improvements to the entire sector by substantially improving the overall genetic quality of the national beef herd, which is an objective I believe we all share.  It is clear that such a scheme could not happen without the existence of the ICBF whose knowledge infrastructure and databases are key to the scheme&rsquo;s design and operation.</p><p>The BDGP forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020 and, in line with other farm supports included in that programme, it was designed and negotiated by my Department.  As part of this design process, and the subsequent negotiations with the European Commission, my Department sought technical input from various sources, including technical experts in ICBF, Teagasc and Bord Bia on an ongoing basis.  This input was essential in helping my Department formulate the scheme design and deal with issues as they arose in the negotiations.  My Department presented the details of the BDGP to the ICBF Board prior to its launch, and the Board agreed to implement certain elements of the scheme at the request of my Department.  My focus is now on ensuring the successful implementation of this 6 year programme of investment and I welcome the central role that the ICBF will play in its operation.</p></reply>

Humanitarian operations are not armed operations in the sense of the missions in Lebanon or UNDOF, where they require to be armed and be able to deliver an armed response to events on the ground as part of the mission mandate. Clearly the humanitarian operation in the Mediterranean does not fall within these parameters. In addition, the fact that Naval Vessels carry arms and have installed guns does not of itself make this an armed mission.</p><p>PDFORRA have made a claim for additional payments for PDFORRA members of the Naval Service deployed on humanitarian relief and rescue duties in the Mediterranean. They are seeking payment of the Armed Peace Support Allowance and Patrol Duty Allowance in addition to the Unarmed Peace Support Allowance. The claim is being processed through the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for Members of the Permanent Defence Force process. As such matters are confidential to that process, it would be inappropriate for me to make any comment on these pay claims at this time.</p></reply>

The total number of Fixed Charge Notices, relating to penalty point offences, paid during the periods in question was 197,344 (2013), 226,238 (2014) and 84,288 (Jan to 22 May 2015).  These figures are provisional, and do not include Fixed Charge Notices relating to offences other that those to which penalty points apply. </p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that payment of any Fixed Change Notice is not accepted without the correct driving licence details.  Where an individual elects to pay their Fixed Charge Notice in a Post Office and they do not present a driving licence or provide incorrect licence details, the payment will be refused.  Where a Fixed Charge Notice is paid by Billpost and the driver licence details are inaccurately completed or omitted, payment is rejected and returned, along with the original Fixed Charge Notice.  In both of these circumstances, the Fixed Charge Notice remains effective and if not paid together with correct driving licence details, will result in a summons being issued for the original offence.</p></reply>

This programme support some 25,000 children each year.  Pobal has responsibility for the new Programme Implementation Platform (PIP) system which has streamlined the implementation and administration of all childcare programmes.  The introduction of this new system did not result in any change to the administration criteria of the CCS programme.</p>  <p>  There are in the region of 900 community childcare services participating in the CCS programme and they qualify for funding on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  Support is provided to parents based on information gathered during a designated week in the month of October, and it is only parents who satisfy the qualifying criteria in this particular week who qualify for support under the programme.  If a child leaves the service after qualifying for CCS support, they may be replaced by another eligible child. In this situation the service retains this funding until the end of that school year. However, during the course of the year if a substantial number of children leave the service and are not replaced, the CCS funding to the service will be reviewed. </p>  <p>  The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which provides the free pre-school year to eligible children, and a number of programmes that support parents returning to the work force are also implemented by Pobal through the new PIP system.  The criteria for the administration of these programmes has not changed.  If the Deputy wishes to clarify further what the issue is, I will ask my officials to examine the matter again. </p></reply>

This National Strategy builds on the achievements and challenges of the National Children&rsquo;s Strategy in further embedding effective, meaningful and systematic participation by children and young people in decision-making on issues that affect them in all aspects of their lives.</p><p>The  National Strategy for the Participation of Children and Young People in Decision Making includes an Action Plan containing agreed actions for key Government departments and agencies, including the Department of Education and Science.  The DCYA will oversee and drive implementation of these actions  under the structures established to implement <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, 2014-2020,</i>published in April 2014. <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>sets out the Government&rsquo;s agenda and priorities in relation to children and young people under the age of 25 and provides the overarching framework for the development and implementation of policy and services. </p><p>The  National Strategy for the Participation of Children and Young People in Decision Making strongly promotes the importance of children and young people&rsquo;s involvement in decision-making in education policy, in the running of schools and services, in school inspections, and school self-evaluation, in the curriculum, in behaviour and bullying policies, in support services and other areas, as outlined in the Action Plan. In addition, the strategy notes the need for improvement in the effectiveness of student councils in second-level schools, in accordance with the Education Act 1998 and the establishment of student councils in primary schools.</p><p>The strategy also outlines actions to ensure that children and young people participate in decision-making in non-formal education systems, such as youth clubs and services. </p><p>My Department will have a key role in supporting the implementation of the National Strategy for the Participation of Children and Young People in Decision Making (2015-2020). The establishment of a Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation Hub as a national centre of excellence is the key priority action for the DCYA in the Action Plan accompanying the strategy.  The Hub will provide information, guidance and practical support to Government departments and agencies in delivering commitments outlined in the Action Plan.  It will also become a key driver in supporting the implementation of this strategy and <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>.  To achieve this, the hub will champion and promote participation, create resources and training materials, conduct training, document and disseminate learning and establish an online children&rsquo;s participation database. It will also form partnerships with third-level and adult education institutions to oversee development of education on children&rsquo;s rights (including participation in decision-making) for professionals who work with and on behalf of children and young people.  Work has already begun on the development of the Hub.</p></reply>

The programme is designed to be delivered for three hours per day, five days per week, over 38 weeks (183 days per year), and capitation fees are paid to participating services on the basis of this provision.  The programme is based on the primary school model, under which primary schools are required to open on 193 days per year (equivalent to 38.6 weeks).  There are currently no plans to extend the programme to a 52 week model. </p>  <p>  The ECCE programme is a universal and free programme for which all children qualify when they are within the qualifying age range, which is between 3 years and 2 months to 4 years and 7 months in the September of the relevant year.

Provisions in relation to registration is one of the areas being amended.  It is proposed to remove the equivalence of the certificate of experience as a requirement for entry to the Trainee Specialist Division as part of the planned amendment process, subject to Government approval.  This would mean that entry to the Trainee Specialist Division for non-EEA doctors would be by way of the PRES (unless exempted) and the offer of a specialist training post by the HSE in a recognised training programme.  </p><p>However I am also conscious of Ireland's need to develop a national policy of self-sufficiency in medical personnel.  The World Health Organisation recommends that countries <i>'strive to create a sustainable health workforce and work towards establishing effective planning, education and training, and retention strategies that will reduce their needs to recruit migrant health personnel'</i>.  Ireland is committed to a national policy of health worker self-sufficiency.</p><p>In this context, the HSE has developed the International Medical Graduate Training Initiative.  This Initiative provides one possible route for overseas doctors wishing to undergo structured postgraduate medical training within the public health service in Ireland. The Training Initiative enables suitably qualified overseas postgraduate medical trainees to undertake a fixed period of active training in clinical services in Ireland. </p><p>The purpose of the Initiative is to enable overseas trainees to gain access to clinical experiences and training that they cannot get in their own country, with a view to enhancing and improving the individual&rsquo;s medical training and learning, and in the medium to long term, the health services in their own countries. </p><p>The first bilateral agreement under this Initiative was signed with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Pakistan and the Initiative was launched in June 2013.  In 2014, 100 trainees were offered posts under the Initiative following a joint selection process. Further expansion of this Initiative in the coming years is key to both delivering on Ireland's commitments under the WHO Global Code, and supporting the service requirements of the Irish public health system.</p></reply>

The Department has, to date, received in excess of 130 reps in relation to nursing and midwifery matters which require input from State Agencies and in many cases, the matter would be required to be researched in order to provide a comprehensive reply. I have arranged that a reply to the reps referred to in your question be prepared as a matter of urgency.  In the interim, I have also set out as follows the position in relation to the matters raised in your reps.</p>  <p>  Each year approximately 1,500 nurses complete the nursing degree programme in Ireland. This is the number seen as necessary to maintain nursing numbers at the level required to support service delivery. Retention of these graduates in the Irish health system, due to the moratorium on recruitment, which resulted in a fall of about 4,500 in nursing numbers between 2007 and the middle of 2013, has been an issue.</p>  <p>  In the intervening period and to date, other jurisdictions outside of Ireland, most notably the UK, are actively recruiting. UK recruitment campaigns offer highly competitive employment packages with attractive terms and conditions along with in-built educational and professional development opportunities. Therefore a fundamental issue facing our health system is our ability to compete with such attractive nurse employment packages in an effort to retain Irish nurse graduates.</p>  <p>  The HSE have been working on the design of an international nurse recruitment campaign. It is intended that this will be a high profile initiative focusing on the UK market to encourage Irish trained nurses home.</p>  <p>  There are a number of strategies to support the retention of our current graduate nurses/midwives in the Irish health system.  In addition significant support for education opportunities along with regularisation of nursing and midwifery acting positions are all designed to contribute to stabilising the nursing resource.</p>  <p>  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI), following assessment of qualifications by an applicant, may require an applicant nurse or midwife to undertake a period of adaptation and assessment, which if required, must be successfully completed as a pre-requisite to registration.  In 2014 the HSE facilitated 151 nurses to complete a period of adaptation. There are 2 remaining HSE adaptation courses available this year in June and August. These courses are 6-12 weeks in duration and facilitate the integration of global nurses to nursing in an Irish context.</p>  <p>  Outside of the current provision for placements in 2015 &ndash; there are 293 requests for placements by employers. These numbers are not reflective of a national total as some hospital sites have also run independent adaptation programmes.</p>  <p>  A collaborative group established by the HSE that includes representatives of both the Department of Health and Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI) continue to explore options to facilitate adaptation and thereby registration with NMBI. A meeting between these parties to discuss the current issues has taken place and options are being actively explored.</p>  <p>  The RCSI on behalf of the NMBI are currently consulting on the possibility of developing an alternative approach to the adaptation programme. This however is not a short-term solution.</p>  <p>  Pending the outcomes of these consultations and possible subsequent development of an alternative to the current adaptation process there remains a requirement to provide adaptation programmes. Options in this regard are under consideration by the office of the Nursing and Midwifery Services Director in the HSE.</p></reply>

It is important to support affected families in every way that we can. There is a wide range of bereavement support and information services available and significant work is already underway to standardise these services so as to provide appropriate support for families who find themselves in this unfortunate situation.</p><p>The 2001 Report of the National Advisory Committee on Palliative Care recommended that bereavement support should be an essential part of all specialist palliative care programmes and should be available in all settings where specialist palliative care is offered.</p><p>The HSE has recently published the Palliative Care Competence Framework which sets out the core competencies as to the required knowledge, attitudes and skills across 10 different health care disciplines. One of the areas of care addressed is Loss, Grief and Bereavement, and through its implementation the Framework will ensure that the provision of bereavement support is enhanced across all care settings, including the community, nursing homes, hospitals, and specialist palliative care units.</p><p>Another palliative care service improvement being undertaken by the HSE is the compilation of <i>Towards Excellence in Palliative Care, </i>which will<i></i>meet the requirements of HIQA&rsquo;s National Standards for Better Safer Healthcare. This consists of 8 Quality Assessment and Improvement Workbooks which will be used to assess specialist palliative care services against the national standards.  One of the Essential Elements is in relation to maximising the quality of life and support in bereavement, including the development of bereavement plans.</p><p><i>Palliative Care for Children with Life limiting Conditions in Ireland &ndash; a National Policy</i>(DoH 2009) recommends that bereavement supports for children&rsquo;s palliative care should be developed to defined levels and encompasses child, adult and family support.  A National Network for Children&rsquo;s Bereavement Services is being developed by the Irish Hospice Foundation in partnership with the Family Support Agency.  A progress report on the initiative will be presented later this year to the HSE's National Development Committee for Palliative Care.</p><p>The HSE recently conducted a survey of acute hospitals on palliative and end of life care, including bereavement services, and the responses received will be analysed as soon as possible. </p><p>HSE national guidelines for bereavement care following pregnancy loss and peri-natal death have been developed. They will be issued for public consultation this week with a view to publication and launch in the Autumn.</p><p>The role of the Children&rsquo;s Outreach Nurse is to support parents not only while their child is ill, but also into bereavement. The families are also supported by palliative home care teams who are experienced in the provision of bereavement support and who can refer parents with complicated grief to appropriate services.</p><p>The HSE Directory of Bereavement Support Services &lsquo;<i>You are not Alone&rsquo; </i>published in 2013 includes information on bereavement and other support services. Organisations such as the Irish Cancer Society and Citizens Information Services provide bereavement support and information as part of their services. Parents also have access to local bereavement support services provided across the country.</p><p>The scheme of grants for marriage, child and bereavement counselling services has been managed by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, since its establishment in January 2014.</p><p>The scheme is open to voluntary organisations that provide marriage and relationship counselling services, helping people to deal with difficulties they experience in their relationships, counselling services to children and bereavement counselling and support to families on the death of a family member. A key feature of the scheme is that it makes counselling available to those who could not otherwise afford it.</p><p>While there is of course a place for formal national policies, the most immediate priority in this area has been to develop relevant front-line services to the maximum possible extent within available resources. However, I have asked the HSE to consider whether the Executive&rsquo;s objectives and priorities in the area of bereavement services are sufficiently consolidated and clear at this point in time, and to revert to me as soon as possible with the outcome. I will consider the position further at that point.</p></reply>

Vaccination related events such as dizziness and syncope (fainting) was also reported and would not be unexpected in this patient population.</p><p>Healthy Ireland, the Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013 &ndash; 2025, is the national Framework for action to improve the health and well-being of the population of Ireland over the coming generation.  Vaccination against HPV types 16 and 18, which protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults, is a long-term investment as the initial costs of vaccination will be offset by improved health outcomes and treatment savings 15 to 30 years in the future.</p><p>The HPRA continues to ensure that the quality, safety and efficacy of all vaccinations licensed in Ireland including HPV meet the required standards.  The safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first introduced both nationally and at EU level and like all medicines and vaccines will continue to be so.</p></reply>

The vaccine is given to protect babies against Tuberculosis (TB).  In Ireland the number of cases of TB has been falling and there were no cases in young children in 2014.</p>  <p>  The HSE has a contract with a Danish supplier for the procurement of BCG vaccine.  BCG vaccine must be specifically packed for distribution to each country.  According to the contract when BCG vaccine arrives into Ireland it should have a shelf life of 6 months.  The contract contains a delivery schedule of an agreed amount of BCG vaccine every three months.  The delivery volume is more than sufficient vaccine for newborn babies and others requiring BCG vaccination.</p>  <p>  Since 2014 the supplier has been supplying BCG vaccine with significant delays due to issues in their production.  The last shipment of BCG vaccine due to arrive at the end of October 2014 arrived at the end of December 2014.  The delay in delivery meant that two months shelf life was lost and this expired at the end of April 2015.  The HSE had sufficient BCG vaccine in Ireland until it expired at the end of April 2015.  Had more stock been purchased it too would have expired at the end of April 2015.</p>  <p>  In addition delivery of BCG vaccine produced in 2014 was suspended pending an extensive investigation regarding a possible problem with the capping of the vials.  This investigation has now been concluded and product produced during 2014 is being released, but it will take some time to release all the batches produced.  As a result this BCG vaccine will have very short remaining shelf life until newly produced product becomes available.</p>  <p>  In addition a number of qualification/validation activities have to be performed following repair of central equipment in the first half of 2015.  This means that production of new product will not commence until August 2015 and due to the lengthy analysis and release procedure, vaccine from this production will not become available until the end of 2015 or beginning of 2016.</p>  <p>  As a result there are limits to the quantities that can be ordered and delays on all deliveries.  The supplier does not expect that the delivery situation will be resolved until the first quarter of 2016 at the earliest.  Other European countries are experiencing delays with the supply of BCG vaccine.</p>  <p>  The HSE will arrange appointments for vaccination clinics when the BCG vaccine supply is restored. </p></reply>

I visited Beaumont Hospital ED in December last year.  Shortly thereafter I convened the ED Taskforce to provide focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by ED overcrowding.  Last April, the HSE published the Taskforce action plan, with a range of time defined actions to optimise existing hospital and community capacity, develop internal capability and process improvement and improve leadership, governance, planning and oversight.  </p>  <p>  Based on the Task Force&rsquo;s Action Plan, additional funds of &euro;74 million were provided in 2015 to increase long term nursing home care places and reduce the waiting time for their funding, as well as providing additional transitional care and home care packages to provide viable supports for those no longer needing acute hospital care.  This was additional to measures already taken in Budget 2015, when the Government provided &euro;25 million to support services that provide alternatives to, and relieve pressure on, acute hospitals.  </p>  <p>  Beaumont hospital has undertaken a number of initiatives both internally within various teams and departments, and externally with the HSE to improve the patient pathway both through the ED and the hospital.  Hospital staff work consistently with their community counterparts to ensure that patients who no longer require acute care are facilitated to move from the hospital to more appropriate care settings, or to home, as appropriate.  In addition the RCSI Hospitals Group has developed a Frail Elderly Project Team, led by a Community Geriatrician, with a focus on provision of care in Day Hospital and Nursing Homes rather than in the ED.  </p>  <p>  Other actions which are ongoing include: use of 16 additional beds in Clontarf Orthopaedic Hospital for step down purposes; transfer of patients to Mount Carmel for transitional or rehabilitative care; continuation of funding of transitional care beds in addition to release of Fair Deal funding; continuation of escalation measures, including curtailment of electives where necessary; increased access to diagnostics out-of-hours and at weekends and a focus on reduction of average length of stay for medical in-patients.</p>  <p>  The HSE is engaged in a focussed programme of work to ensure immediate actions are being taken to effect a reduction in delayed discharges and to drive improved performance in EDs, including at Beaumont Hospital.  Overall, the emphasis is on driving a more integrated approach between primary care, acute hospitals and community care.  Progress against the various actions set out in the ED Taskforce action plan is being reported on a monthly basis to the ED Taskforce Implementation Oversight Group.  </p></reply>

The Bill is part of a suite of measures agreed by the Government in 2013 on foot of the recommendations in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy. The other measures (eg for the HSE, professional bodies etc) set out in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, were endorsed by Government and are to be progressed by the relevant departments and organisations. The HSE has responsibility for implementing a number of recommendations and some of these measures are reflected in the HSE Service Plan for 2015.

The average weighted cost of care in a public facility is &euro;1,390.  It is true that costs for public nursing homes are higher than in the private sector and vary considerably even within the public system.  There are valid factors for a difference, in that more complex and highly dependent residents are often catered for by the public system, and conditions of employment and tenure etc. are different too.</p>  <p>  It is, however, important that public facilities operate as efficiently and economically as possible and towards that end, the HSE is already engaged in a comprehensive exercise to review and streamline the operation and cost structures of public facilities.  The Department of Health will also be conducting a Value for Money Review of public nursing home costs to identify more fully the factors that may be increasing costs and any areas that require correction.</p>  <p>  Long-term nursing home care is provided through a mix of public and private nursing homes, with the public sector accounting for approximately 20% of all beds.  At the end of 21014, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) estimated that there were approximately 29,000 long stay beds in a total of 565 designated centres.  It is anticipated that almost 24,000 people will be in receipt of support under the Nursing Home Support Scheme by the end of 2015. </p>  <p>  The proportion of older people in residential care is a constantly changing one, and international comparison can be quite problematic because of differences in models of care and in definition of what constitutes long term residential care etc.  However, in Ireland we generally have somewhere between 4% and 4.5% of those aged over 65 in residential care, and this is about average for other countries in the OECD.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I would hope to reduce this number further, as older people generally prefer to stay in their own homes and communities for as long as they can.  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, as well as considering the historical and future operation of the Scheme itself, will consider how community and other services should be developed in order to facilitate more older people to stay at home for longer, and towards this end it identifies the services that should be prioritised into the future as resources allow.</p></reply>

Towards this end, ring-fenced funding of &euro;125 million and some 1,150 posts have been provided since 2012 to develop community mental health services and suicide prevention resources.  The budget for mental health services in 2014 is significant at approximately &euro;791.8 million.</p><p><i>A Vision for Change </i>indicates a requirement for 10,647 WTE staff which, when adjusted for the 2011 population census, equates to around 12,240 WTE staff by 2016.  However, given the changed economic circumstances since the publication of <i>Vision</i>in 2006, the Government had to reduce the numbers employed across the public service in order to meet fiscal and budgetary targets.  While the health sector must make its contribution to that reduction, the HSE can make staff appointments once it remains within its overall employment ceiling, and has the financial resources to do so.  In its 2014 Service Plan, the HSE committed to develop workforce planning to bring greater certainty around essential replacements, and the streamlining of recruitment to allow for more local control and specialisation, where appropriate.  A National Recruitment Optimisation Group was established in 2014 to improve the process and communications on advancing approval, advertisement and recruitment of all replacement and development posts. </p><p>While staffing levels in the mental health service have fallen, there are positives that must be acknowledged.  Many of the staff numbers lost were supporting the excessive numbers of beds which are no longer part of the service user, recovery-focused, modern, community-based model for mental health.  The overall reduction in numbers has been mitigated due to the priority ring-fenced Programme for Government investments in 2012, 2013 and again in 2014.  This has allowed the HSE to begin to re-balance the staff skill mix in mental health and to introduce new staff in the historically under represented disciplines recommended in <i>A Vision for Change</i>, i.e. psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists.</p><p>Recruitment of new posts is ongoing.  As at end of May 2015, 399.5 or 96% of the 416 posts approved in 2012 and 420.5 or 88% of the 477 posts approved in 2013 have now been filled.  Of the 251 posts allocated in 2014, 75 have been recruited of which 63 had started by 31st May, 2015 and a further 78.5 are at various stages of the recruitment process.  Allocations for new service developments in 2015 are also due to be finalised in the very near future.</p></reply>

There has been significant activity in cross-border health and social care activity over the last decade.  Collaboration takes place on a wide range of health and social care issues including, for example, Radiotherapy Services, Paediatric Congenital Cardiac Services, Health Promotion (Alcohol, Tobacco and Obesity, Cancer Research, Food Safety, Suicide Prevention and GP out of Hours Service.</p>  <p>  A new Radiotherapy Unit at Altnagelvin Hospital, Derry is being developed by the Western Health and Social Care Trust (Northern Ireland).  The Radiotherapy Unit, which is due to open in Autumn 2016, will provide access to radiotherapy services to people in the north west of the island, including patients from this jurisdiction.  A Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the Trust and the Health Service Executive has been agreed for the provision of services to patients from this jurisdiction.  The HSE will pay the trust for the provision of these services. The Irish Government has committed capital funding of one third of the cost (up to &euro;19m) of the project.  &euro;3m of this amount was paid in 2014, with the balance to be paid in 2015 and 2016.</p>  <p>  There is continued engagement between my Department and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland on progressing co-operation and finding a solution for Paediatric Cardiology Services on an all-Island basis.  Work is progressing on the procurement of Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) procedures in Altnagelvin for the population of the North-West.  Looking further ahead, there is a recommendation to establish a joint cardiology Department between Letterkenny and Altnagelvin, which will be the first ever joint cross-border Department in medicine or surgery.</p>  <p>  The Food Safety Promotion Board/Safefood's budget for 2015 is &euro;7.820m (&pound;6.334m).  The Board is involved on an all-island and cross-border basis, with tasks involving food safety awareness.  It has run a number of successful campaigns in recent years such as the Operation Transformation TV programme, the Community Food initiative which aims to promote greater access and availability of healthy and safe food in low-income areas and Eatright.eu a new website with a focus on healthy eating, food safety and physical activity. Safefoods&rsquo;s Knowledge Networks continue to enhance linkages across the island among food safety professionals working in the food production and processing sectors, in research and academia, and the wider public sectors.</p>  <p>  &euro;30 million was allocated under Interreg IVA to Cooperation and Working Together (CAWT Partnership) for cross-border health and social care initiatives.  Interreg IVA supported one project, diverse in nature which CAWT delivered on behalf of the two health departments north and south, across 12 strands of activity with a strong focus on improving access to services, promoting health and well-being, reducing health inequalities and promoting social inclusion.</p>  <p>  The new Interreg V programme has been agreed and I understand a call in the health area will issue in the coming months. &euro;53m ERDF funding will be available under the theme "Promoting social inclusion, combating poverty and any discrimination".</p>  <p>  I am committed to continuing to work together with my Northern colleagues on issues of common concern and benefit.</p></reply>

SOLAS, with the assistance of relevant experts such as the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), employers and local and national organisations, have published a five year strategy for the further education and training sector which provides us with a strategic roadmap for this crucial element of the education and training system.  The strategy includes a vision of a flexible, quality-driven, labour market-relevant, integrated and responsive sector that supports learner progression, transitions into employment and personal development.  The higher education system is also going through a process of transformation through structural change arising from the Higher Education Strategy.</p><p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), which is funded by my Department, advises the Government on current and future skills needs of the economy.  It has a central role in ensuring that labour market needs for skilled workers are anticipated and met.  The expert group's membership is broad and specifically includes representation from enterprise. Its research provides an input to the development of course curricula and informs the selection of new targeted programmes designed to tackle the skills shortages in particular elements of the economy, such as Momentum, Springboard and the ICT skills conversion programme.</p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, my Department has committed to review the National Skills Strategy.  The review will provide an opportunity to determine the volume, type and mix of skills required to meet the Government's goal of full employment by 2018 and the challenges to be addressed to achieve this.</p><p>  Direct engagement between employers and education and training providers is also critical to ensuring that programmes are aligned to changing skills needs.  As well as the actions that are being implemented across the education and training system as part of the Further Education and Training and Higher Education reform programmes to enhance links with enterprise and prepare learners for the different roles they will have over their working lives work is also underway in the context of the Skills Strategy review to develop the regional and national infrastructure for engagement between education providers, employers and other enterprise stakeholders, in communicating and addressing skills needs.</p><p>  SOLAS also has statutory responsibility for the Apprenticeship system in Ireland.  The Apprenticeship system is employer led and the number of craft apprentices registered with SOLAS is determined by individual employers recruiting potential apprentices within a broad range of occupational sectors.</p><p>  At the end of 2014, apprentice registrations to the existing 27 trades were up 40% on the same point in 2013.  The trend is continuing this year and the most recent apprenticeship forecasts anticipate that these growth trends will continue generally until 2018. </p><p>  It should also be noted that as part of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs initiative in 2013, an independent group was established to carry out a review of the Irish Apprenticeship system to determine whether the current model should be retained, adapted or replaced.  The subsequent report of the Review Group made a wide number of recommendations regarding the reform of existing apprenticeships and the extension of the apprenticeship model into new enterprise areas.  An Apprenticeship Implementation Plan was published in June 2014 in that regard. </p><p>  A new industry-led Apprenticeship Council was appointed in November 2014 and is made up of a wide variety of stakeholders.  In January 2015, the Apprenticeship Council formally invited proposals for new apprenticeship programmes from consortia of enterprise, professional bodies and education and training providers. </p><p>  Over 80 separate proposals were received in response to the call for proposals.  They have been assessed by the Apprenticeship Council against a range of sustainability and deliverability criteria and I have recently received the Council's report with recommendations on proposals that should be developed into apprenticeships.  I am currently considering the recommendations with a view to progressing a number of proposals to the development stage.</p></reply>

These actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying are addressed. </p><p>As part of the implementation of the Action Plan, new National Anti-Bullying Procedures for schools were published in September 2013.  All Boards of Management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of the procedures.  A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures.</p><p>The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils.  They include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.</p><p>A very important element of the new procedures to help ensure greater transparency for parents and pupils is the requirement for schools to publish their anti-bullying policy on the school's website and to provide it to the parents association.  The procedures also include important new oversight arrangements that involve the School Principal reporting regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation.  Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the parents association and published on the school website.</p><p>A clear picture of the implementation of the new procedures at school level will become available as part of my Department's inspection work.  Where the Inspectorate encounters non-compliance with the requirement to publish a policy in line with the new procedures, relevant findings will be included in published WSE inspection reports.</p><p>In addition to requiring schools to publish their policy on the school website, the procedures also require that the school's anti bullying policy must be made available to the school's Parents' Association.  In that regard, in any school which has not done this, Parents Associations can raise this issue directly with their school Board of Management.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that the percentage split between adjacent and non-adjacent can fluctuate from one year to another as some students graduate and new applicants come into grant.  It is, therefore, difficult to quantify the cost of amending the criteria for eligibility, for the award of the non-adjacent rate of grant, to 30 kilometres due to the fact that each individual's circumstances are different and any impact would affect an unknown cohort of new applicants applying to SUSI at some future date.

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>This may, in some instances, include provision for children who are enrolled to early intervention classes in recognised primary schools, or special schools, where support is provided for as part of the schools total quantum of SNA support. There were 95 such classes in operation in the 2014/15 school year. </p><p>However, as set out in my Departments Circular 0030/2014 in relation to the SNA scheme, SNA support is not provided to preschool services which operate outside of the primary or special school provision.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p><p>  The staffing structure of NEPS for professional grades comprises posts at Director, Regional Director, Senior Educational Psychologist and Educational Psychologist level. NEPS is organised on an 8 region structure with each region headed by a Regional Director. Currently there are 23 regional and local offices providing service to schools within their catchment areas. The allocation of schools to NEPS psychologists is therefore done on the basis of regional rather than county distribution with individual staff providing service to schools in one or a number of counties. It is not therefore feasible to disaggregate employment numbers by county.</p><p>  As of 31st June last NEPS established numbers amounted to 178 psychologists (equating with 167.9 whole-time-equivalents when work-sharing arrangement are factored in). A regional breakdown of these number is provided in the attached table.</p><p>  In the same period there were some 7 staff (7 w.t.e.) staff on statutory or extended maternity leave and 2 (2 w.t.e.) on sick leave. These staff, as is the normal practice in the system, are not replaced but schools affected by the absence of their assigned psychologist are afforded assessment services through the above mentioned SCPA scheme and emergency consultation cover by psychologist staff in the local or regional office.</p><p> I can inform the Deputy that the average salary paid to a NEPS psychologist is currently &euro;78,853 and append for his information the pay-scales currently applicable to the grades of psychologist within NEPS in the following table.</p><p><b><i>Established Numbers of Educational Psychologists Employed in NEPS</i></b></p><p><b>By Region</b><table><tr><th>NEPS Region</th><th>Count</th><th>W.T.E.</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>25</td><td>23.40</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin/Mid Leinster</td><td>28</td><td>25.60</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-Munster</td><td>26</td><td>23.53</td></tr><tr><td>North-East</td><td>17</td><td>16.40</td></tr><tr><td>North-West/Midlands</td><td>19</td><td>17.80</td></tr><tr><td>South-East/midlands</td><td>22</td><td>21.33</td></tr><tr><td>South-West</td><td>21</td><td>20.40</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>18</td><td>17.40</td></tr><tr><td>No Region</td><td>2</td><td>2.00</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>178</td><td>167.86</td></tr></table>Note: Numbers at 21/6/15</p><p><b>By Grade</b><table><tr><th>Grade</th><th>Count</th><th>W.T.E.</th></tr><tr><td>Director</td><td>1</td><td>1.00</td></tr><tr><td>Regional Director</td><td>7</td><td>7.00</td></tr><tr><td>Senior Psychologist</td><td>39</td><td>37.53</td></tr><tr><td>Psychologist</td><td>131</td><td>122.33</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>178</td><td>167.86</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Current Pay-scales for NEPS Psychologists by Grade</b><table><tr><th>NEPS Grades</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Regional Director</td><td>&euro;84,233</td><td>&euro;86,144</td><td>&euro;88,065</td><td>&euro;89,972</td><td>&euro;91,405</td><td>&euro;94,184</td><td>&euro;96,963</td></tr><tr><td>Regional Director (PPC)</td><td>&euro;88,440</td><td>&euro;90,452</td><td>&euro;92,470</td><td>&euro;94,479</td><td>&euro;95,990</td><td>&euro;98,917</td><td>&euro;101,839</td></tr><tr><td>Senior Psychologist</td><td>&euro;74,035</td><td>&euro;75,733</td><td>&euro;77,406</td><td>&euro;79,068</td><td>&euro;80,721</td><td>&euro;81,353</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;83,834</td><td>&euro;86,318</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Senior Psychologist (PPC)</td><td>&euro;77,751</td><td>&euro;79,495</td><td>&euro;81,251</td><td>&euro;83,003</td><td>&euro;84,745</td><td>&euro;85,409</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;88,018</td><td>&euro;90,631</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Educational Psychologist</td><td>&euro;53,984</td><td>&euro;56,326</td><td>&euro;58,654</td><td>&euro;60,963</td><td>&euro;63,867</td><td>&euro;65,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;68,132</td><td>&euro;71,854</td><td>&euro;74,880</td><td>&euro;77,182</td><td>&euro;79,459</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Educational Psychologist (PPC)</td><td>&euro;56,789</td><td>&euro;59,246</td><td>&euro;61,701</td><td>&euro;64,128</td><td>&euro;65,000</td><td>&euro;67,729</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;71,593</td><td>&euro;75,517</td><td>&euro;78,619</td><td>&euro;81,013</td><td>&euro;83,414</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Charles Flanagan T.D., has advised me that the development education programme managed by Irish Aid in his Department seeks to deepen the understanding of the Irish public on issues relating to global poverty and development.  Irish Aid's development education budget provides funding each year through competitive funding rounds for the development education activities of education institutions and Non-Governmental Organisations, including in formal education settings. At primary school level development education grants are made available through Irish Aid's Annual Development Education Funding Scheme and at post-primary level, grants are provided under Irish Aid's Worldwise Global Schools Annual Funding Scheme.  It is anticipated that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will issue a call for applications for funding under Irish Aid's Annual Development Education Funding Scheme in September 2015 and the next call for applications under Worldwise Global Schools will be in April 2016. Further information on both of these funding schemes is available by contacting the Civil Society and Development Education Unit in Irish Aid. </p></reply>

It should, however, be noted that gas appliances, which are dependent on electric currents or electromagnetic fields in order to work properly, come under the scope of the European Union (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) Regulations 2014 which aim to reduce the amount of waste electrical and electronic equipment that ends up in landfill.  These Regulations transpose the requirements of the re-cast WEEE Directive 2012/19/EU which came into effect on 14 February 2014.  Unlike typical waste gas cookers or boilers which are more easily recycled, WEEE is a complex mixture of materials and components that because of their hazardous content and if not properly managed, can cause major environmental and health problems. Moreover, the production of modern electronics requires the use of scarce and expensive resources. To improve the environmental management of WEEE and to contribute to a circular economy and resource efficiency, enhanced collection, treatment and recycling of electronics at the end of their life is essential.</p></reply>

These two sets of regulations place clear obligations on waste collectors, businesses and households to promote the segregation and recovery of food waste for purposes of producing energy, compost and digestate, thereby supporting job creation in the waste and bio-energy sectors. The Regulations also facilitate the achievement of the targets set out in the Landfill Directive (Directive 99/31/EC) for the diversion of bio-degradable municipal waste from landfill sites, by directing source-segregated household food waste to composting and to other forms of treatment.  There are positive indications that the implementation and enforcement of these Regulations are resulting in more food waste being diverted from landfill. The Environmental Protection Agency recently published <i>Compost and Anaerobic Digestion (AD) Statistics</i>for 2013 which highlighted the following trends: </p><p>-The quantity of municipal organic waste accepted for treatment at composting facilities was 158 kilo tonnes (kT) in 2013, a 3% increase from 154 kT in 2012; </p><p>-The quantity of food waste accepted at composting and AD facilities in 2013 was up 8% (from 105 Kt in 2012 to 114 kT in 2013); </p><p>-The quantity of brown bin organic waste (food and garden waste) accepted at anaerobic digestion facilities increased from 0.7 kT in 2010 to 7.7 kT in 2013. </p><p>The successful roll-out of the brown bin is dependent on appropriate education and awareness measures being introduced to support households in using the brown bin correctly. In this regard, my Department has provided sponsorship and grants to fund food waste awareness campaigns, including development of a dedicated website, , to provide the public with the information required to use the brown bin appropriately, including advice on the optimal methods for effective collection and storage of food waste. </p><p>A report conducted in 2013, entitled <i>Review of Best International Practice on How to Educate Households on Using the Brown Bin Correctly</i>, recommended a national pilot programme of &lsquo;brown bin advisors&rsquo; to educate householders on how to use the brown bin system. Sligo County Council submitted a successful proposal to my Department for Sligo town to be the national pilot of the Brown Bin Advisor Pilot Programme. The aim of this project is to see how a range of educational and collection tools, such as the use of brown bin advisors and the provision of kitchen caddies to householders, can improve the capture and quality of food waste in the brown bin. The goal is to demonstrate the positive impact that relatively low cost measures can have on the performance of the system. On foot of the findings of this project, it is anticipated that the best practices identified in Sligo town will form a model for other towns to adopt. </p><p>The introduction of pay by weight as a condition for the collection of household waste will also have significant potential to reduce average household waste by almost one third and support higher levels of segregation by providing a clear price incentive for households to properly use the three-bin system. The simple message with pay by weight is that the less your bin weighs, the less you will pay. </p></reply>

In this context, I believe that the parties responsible for poor workmanship and/or the supply of defective materials should face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate actions to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.</p>  <p>  In March of last year, my Department met with a number of private homeowners from County Mayo whose homes are affected by structural problems. The problems appear to concern approximately 15 private houses and the period of construction for the houses involved was 1997 to 2002. My Department was also made aware of problems associated with the cracking of concrete blocks in a small number of local authority estates in County Mayo involving some 17 dwellings.</p>  <p>  Similar to the position in County Mayo, my Department also met with a number of private homeowners from County Donegal in December last year and, subsequently, I visited a number of the affected dwellings in late February of this year. Test reports on the affected concrete blocks, which had previously been commissioned by a number of the affected homeowners, were made available to my Department in order to provide a more detailed and scientific insight into the problems that have arisen in Donegal.</p>  <p>  Having regard to the information available to my Department, a technical report has been prepared for my consideration; I intend to complete my deliberations in these matters shortly.</p></reply>

The target for Dublin City Council is 3,347 social housing units, supported by &euro;292m of investment. This funding is being invested in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes by the Council to accommodate people on their housing waiting list.  The announcement I made on 5 May 2015 in respect of a major Social Housing construction programme, involving &euro;312m of investment comprising some 100 projects and 1,700 housing units nationally, includes investment of over &euro;35m in the Dublin City Council area. </p><p>The provision of social housing services is a matter for each local authority as the housing authority for its area.

In addition, my Department is committed to the regeneration of Dolphin House and St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens which will result in the provision of over 80 new social housing units in addition to the refurbishment of a number of existing units. </p><p>When I announced the major social housing construction programme in May, I stated that this was part of the first phase of direct-build projects under the Government&rsquo;s <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>and that further assessments are being carried out which will result in the approval of additional projects. Local authorities, including Dublin City, are continuing to submit and refine proposals in respect of their social housing construction plans and further announcements will be made shortly, according as these are evaluated.  </p></reply>

However there is currently a civil remedy available concerning branches or roots of neighbouring trees encroaching on a person&rsquo;s property.  The previous Minister of State for Housing and Planning wrote to the Minister for Justice in June 2012 to explore the possibility of providing a broader civil law remedy for parties affected by high trees and hedges on adjoining properties. In this regard, advice was sought on the possibility of legislative provision being made whereby a person substantially deprived of the enjoyment of their property, such as the deprivation of light caused by high trees on a neighbouring property, could apply to the Courts for an order, and that the Courts could make an order as they see fit, e.g. to cut the trees back to an appropriate height. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice responded in July 2012 suggesting that disputes of this nature between neighbours could perhaps be more appropriately dealt with through mediation &ndash; which is being increasingly used internationally as a tool for the resolution of civil disputes - rather than through the Courts. In this regard, I understand that the Minister for Justice proposes to publish a Mediation Bill later in 2015. Such mechanism, when introduced, should assist in speeding up the resolution of civil disputes of this nature, reduce legal costs and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings. </p></reply>

Accordingly, 2015 will be the first full year of the operation of these and other significant changes in the local government system and, in the circumstances, it would be premature to attempt a comprehensive assessment of the financial or other impacts of these changes.  Nonetheless, I have initiated an evaluation process on the operation of the new structures through a broadly based advisory group which my Department has recently convened together with a working group for engagement with the Association of Irish Local Government, both of which played an important role in the early stages of the local government reform process.  The groups will examine how the new arrangements are impacting in relation to both non-financial and financial matters such as governance, strategic functions, organisational change, administrative savings, streamlining of operations and services and efficiency aspects generally.  In this regard, it is important to view the benefits of structural reorganisation not only in terms of expenditure reductions but also having regard to the broader objectives of local government reform such as strengthening the sector, addressing issues and anomalies relating to boundaries and seeking greater efficiency and more productive use of resources.   </p>  <p>  Overall, the thrust of Government policy remains to strengthen local government and foster the potential for improved subsidiarity, coherence and efficiency, resulting in greater value for money for the taxpayer and, ultimately, improved service delivery for citizens.  The review underway will provide a sound evidence base upon which to consider the operation to date of the revised structures and arrangements and the on-going implementation of the reform programme including any further developments to local government and local democracy. </p></reply>

These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016.  This map is available at .  The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers plan to deliver high speed broadband services.  The AMBER areas on the map show the target areas for the State intervention. </p><p>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.</p><p>Under EU State Aid rules, public investment in a commercial market has to be targeted at areas where there is evidence of market failure.  Therefore, the Government's proposed investment under the NBP will apply to those parts of the country that are unlikely to be served commercially. </p><p>eircom recently announced an investment that may address a further 300,000 premises with fibre-to-the-premises technology.  My Department will be rigorously examining the assurances from eircom in relation to these new plans, which is a requirement for all operators, and will review how this impacts the proposed intervention area.</p><p>l published the draft Intervention Strategy for public consultation today and the draft strategy and relevant expert reports are available on the NBP website .  Following the consultation process over the summer, I hope to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. </p><p>I expect the physical build of the network to begin in late 2016, and it will take 3-5 years to fully complete &ndash; depending on the details of the bid or bids selected. </p><p>This complex national infrastructure project will definitively address the long-standing challenge of deploying a resilient and high-quality broadband network in rural parts of Ireland.  </p></reply>

The decision requires Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte to proceed with a partial merger, by way of a joint venture, in four key areas: wind; biomass; tourism and recreation; and shared services.  As the implementation of the Government decision is a matter for both companies, associated costs do not arise for the parent Departments or, consequently, the State.  It was envisaged that harnessing the strengths of both companies would result in a financial benefit to the companies and their respective shareholders.  While the implementation of the decision is being progressed by both companies, overseen by a Steering Group of senior officials from my Department, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and NewERA, it is too early in the process to determine the full extent of such financial benefits.  However based on the information provided to date it is expected that the partial merger will deliver a positive financial outcome for the State on its completion.</p></reply>

Section 22 (1) of the Road Traffic Act 2002, as amended by section 63 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 was commenced on 28 October 2011.</p>  <p>  However, the remainder of Section 22, that is subsection 2 and 3 have not been fully commenced to date.  In particular, section 22(2) which makes it an offence to fail to produce a licence has been commenced by different orders in respect of certain penalty point offences only.</p>  <p>  The Department has sought legal advice on how best to commence this section in full and I will make any necessary Order or Orders to commence the remainder of the section when the legal advice has been received.</p></reply>

While my Department does not provide direct support for students attending Irish colleges in the Gaeltacht, I am aware that scholarships are provided from time to time by various Irish language, cultural and sports organisations, as well as by several local authorities.  I am also aware that some of the Irish colleges themselves offer part scholarships.  The report entitled <i>Tionchar na gCol&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge ar an Teanga agus ar Phobal na Gaeltachta</i>contains an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats relating to the Irish colleges in the Gaeltacht.  The findings of the study, which was published earlier this year, are mostly positive regarding the impact of the Irish colleges.  My Department will be examining the report&rsquo;s conclusions, in cooperation with the Department of Education and Skills, in the context of future policy with regard to the Irish colleges.  In addition, my Department will be engaging in discussions with Comhchoiste N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na gCol&aacute;ist&iacute; Samhraidh (CONCOS), the federation of Irish colleges, regarding the report's recommendations, including ways to improve access to the Irish colleges.</p></reply>
