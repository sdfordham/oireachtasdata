    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-10a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014121000061#WRA00600"><p>The secondment of 20 Garda&iacute; to the Department to assist the SIU with fraud investigation work took effect from last Friday, 5 December having been agreed earlier this year with the Minister of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Eight of the officers will be located in Dublin with the others being assigned to various urban locations around the country.<br/><br/>It is too early to predict with absolute certainty the precise additional financial savings that will arise; however, I am confident that additional exchequer savings will be generated.  My Department believes that there is a strong case for greater investment on a value for money basis in this area especially when the value of the current control activity by the Department&rsquo;s SIU is taken into consideration.<br/><br/>One of the key areas that the Department looks at in terms of measuring activity is the savings and overpayments generated by the Special Investigation Unit.  In the period 2011 to 2013, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) generated fraud control savings of over &euro;193 million.  This year, a further additional savings of &euro;64.5 million has been achieved.<br/><br/>Consequently when additional resources are applied, we believe that there will be a commensurate increase in savings.  Moreover, the additional resources can be targeted in sectors where social welfare fraud is most pronounced. <b><i></i></b>The case for the provision of additional resources is also compelling for the following reasons:<br/><br/>- These resources will ultimately generate additional Exchequer savings; <br/><br/>- The administrative costs associated with the existing SIU  resources is offset by a factor of about nine to one from the savings they generate; <br/><br/>- It will allow for activity in areas such as the black economy, multiple claiming and identity fraud to be intensified;<br/><br/>- It will enhance public confidence and the overall deterrence of social welfare fraud.<br/><br/>Overall, I am confident that it will be a very productive use of resources.</p></reply>

The criteria for participating on CE are based on age and length of time in receipt of various qualifying social welfare payments.  The general conditions are that an applicant needs to be in receipt of a relevant welfare payment for a minimum period of 1 year.  The qualifying social welfare payments include jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, one parent family payment, widow&rsquo;s/widower&rsquo;s/surviving civil partners contributory and non-contributory pension, deserted wife's benefit and farm assist.</p><p>  The qualifying period is waived for Drug Rehabilitation clients where a separate referral process applies whereby medical practitioners and other agents can make the referral.</p><p>  Once the entry qualifying criteria are satisfied, all Community Employment (CE) participants are guaranteed a minimum payment of &euro;208 per week, regardless of means.  Accordingly, if the weekly rate of the social welfare payment received by the participant was less than or equal to &euro;188, the applicable CE allowance is &euro;208 (including an increase of &euro;20 per week).  </p><p>  If the welfare payment was more than &euro;188, the applicable rate of allowance is the rate of the qualifying payment which was payable before commencement of CE plus &euro;20 per week.  </p><p>  The welfare rate of payment such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for example is determined by calculating the participant&rsquo;s maximum entitlement, that is, the personal rate, and the adult dependent and child dependent rates, if applicable.  Household means are then deducted.  If there are no household means, then the maximum applicable rate applies.</p><p>  As CE placements last for at least one year, a change in family circumstances may occur during the placement (change in the number of dependants/change in household income, etc.).  Participants are obliged to inform the Department of any such change that would affect the underlying entitlement rate payable (up or down).</p></reply>

The farm assist scheme provides support for farmers on low incomes and is similar to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. Farm assist recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.</p><p>  All recipients of farm assist have benefitted from the Christmas Bonus paid last week and all recipients with children will also benefit next month from the increase in child benefit I announced in the Budget.</p><p>  Changes introduced in Budgets 2012 and 2013 have brought farm assist into closer alignment with the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed persons. Farm assist is a flexible payment and any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cash-flow issues can ask their local social welfare / Intreo office to review the level of means applying to their claim.</p><p>  The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is designed to reflect the actual net income from farming.  Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.  </p><p>  The scheme will be kept under ongoing review by my officials and there are no plans to change the current scheme criteria.</p></reply>

Unlike the impression given in the question, there were no reductions applied to rent limits at that time.  Importantly, rent limits in Dublin and Galway were increased, with Dublin limits increasing by a weighted average of 9%.</p><p> The current review of maximum rent limits undertaken by the Department is nearly finalised. In this regard, raising rent limits at this time may not be the solution to the problems in this area as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and could impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers and students.  I am keeping the matter under close review.</p><p>  The homelessness issue is about more than just funding and accommodation.  A collaborative approach including all stakeholders including the government, local authorities, state agencies, voluntary services and the general public is required to address the difficult and complex issues around homelessness. </p><p>  The Department of Social Protection has put measures in place to ensure that the housing needs of rent supplement customers who are in danger of becoming homeless are being addressed by providing for increased flexibility in the administration of the rent supplement scheme.  </p><p>  A notice reminding all staff, of their statutory discretionary power to award, on a case by case basis, a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated earlier in the year and further instruction has issued this week.  </p><p>  The tenancy sustainment protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations is designed to protect families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation from becoming homelessness.  The Department has provided support through increasing rent limits for some 240 families since its launch in mid-June.</p><p>  Staff outside the Dublin region are also increasing rental payments as necessary and are actively engaging with the various organisations involved in homelessness.  The Department is reviewing the local arrangements in place throughout the country to strengthen the existing framework to ensure that the necessary supports continue to be provided in a consistent manner.</p></reply>

This resulted in a rebalancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities including the relocation of some staff to main centres, primarily Intreo offices.</p><p>  Where the CWS has been re-structured, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service.  If a person is unable to travel to a new clinic, for example due to illness, alternative arrangements are in place including arranging a visit to the client&rsquo;s home if necessary. </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s services are continually monitored and kept under review by management to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service.  I am very conscious of the need to provide efficient and effective customer facing services at a local level for clients of the Department.  It is therefore essential that the services provided are reconstituted to meet the changing needs of Irish society.  </p><p>  There are no plans to re-open the CWS clinics referred to and the level of service at the alternative clinics has not changed since September 2013. Customer feedback has indicated that the level of service provided is sufficient with waiting times being reduced due to the introduction of an appointment system.</p></reply>

This necessitates a review of entitlement to Carers&rsquo; Allowance to ensure that the appropriate care conditionality is satisfied.  There has been a long-standing process of communicating with parents, six months in advance of the child reaching 16, advising them of the requirement to review their entitlement to Carers&rsquo; Allowance and of the potential entitlement of the child to Disability Allowance.

Also, it is important to note that where CA claims for former DCA recipients are being reviewed upon a child reaching 16, the claims remain in payment while the review is underway, even if the child has already reached 16.</p><p>  Upon the child reaching 16 years, DCA is no longer payable.  It is open to the child to apply for disability allowance (DA).  In respect of CA claims for children under 16, the care requirement for the care recipient are deemed to be satisfied where DCA is in payment in respect of that child.  CA must be reviewed once a care recipient reaches 16 years in order to ensure that the care requirement of the child meets the statutory conditions for receipt of CA.</p><p>  There has been a long-standing process to notify DCA recipients at least 6 months in advance that DCA will stop when the child reaches 16 and that continued entitlement to CA would be reviewed.  The purpose of that communication is to ensure that parents are aware of what is going to happen, their future options and to give them time to gather the necessary information.  That communication also draws the attention of the parent to the potential eligibility of the child for DA.</p><p>  Recently, the Department decided to review its communications with parents who are in receipt of both domiciliary care allowance (DCA) and carer's allowance (CA) for children who are reaching 16 years.  </p><p>  In order to ensure that the parent supplies sufficiently detailed information from the child's doctor(s) and other healthcare professionals, schools etc., the notification to the parent that issues in advance of the child reaching 16 will be revised to state the conditions which need to be met in relation to CA (which are not the same as those for receipt of DCA) and to advise them of the importance of providing the Department at the outset with full and comprehensive information on the current and ongoing care requirements of the child.  It is hoped that this will reduce the number of CA cases that are stopped at first instance but subsequently reinstated upon review of additional information supplied.  The Department is liaising with the groups involved as part of this review.</p></reply>

It aims to enhance the employability and mobility of disadvantaged and unemployed persons by providing work experience and training opportunities for them within their communities. In addition, it helps long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine.  CE schemes are typically sponsored by groups wishing to benefit the local community, namely voluntary and community organisations and, to a lesser extent, public bodies involved in not-for-profit activities. Such projects provide a valuable service to local communities while, at the same time, providing training and educational opportunities to job-seekers.</p><p>  In 2013, the Department provided an additional 2,000 places bringing the number of CE places to 25,300 for 2014. There are approximately 1,000 CE schemes throughout the country at any one time providing services which range from childcare and social care to community support and drug rehabilitation.  The budget for 2015 is &euro;357m which is an increase of circa &euro;22m on this year to reflect the full year implementation costs of the additional 2,000 places next year. The Department is fully committed to the future of this programme and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the participants and the valuable contribution it makes to local communities.</p><p>  With regard to a CE pension scheme, in July 2008, the Labour Court recommended that an agreed pension scheme should be introduced for CE supervisors and assistant supervisors and that such a scheme should be adequately funded by F&Aacute;S, the agency responsible for CE at that time.  The Department of Social Protection is now responsible for CE.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the position of this Department in rejecting that liability for these costs should be met from public funds, this matter has been the subject of discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (D/PER) and the unions representing CE supervisors.  The D/PER&rsquo;s position, as outlined to the unions, is that companies contracted by the State to provide a service, including in the community sector, will have to manage their expenditure pressures, including labour and pension costs, from within existing funding levels. </p><p>  Given the level of funding that would be required from the Department, the implementation of the claim is not considered sustainable in light of the current and on-going fiscal environment and the requirement to contain public expenditure.  The costs of the introduction of any scheme are likely to be of the order of &euro;3m per annum. </p><p>  It should also be noted that this Department is not the employer of CE supervisors and such employees are not public servants but are employees of the sponsoring organisations.  The responsibilities of the sponsoring organisations as employers and the individuals concerned as employees must also be considered. </p><p>  Employers (including CE Sponsoring Organisations) are legally obliged to offer access to at least one Standard Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) under the Pension (Amendment) Act 2002.  All CE sponsoring organisations were informed of their responsibilities under this Act at that time. </p><p>  It should also be noted that CE Supervisors may also qualify for the State Pension at 66 years of age.  If they have accrued sufficient PRSI contributions (520 contributions @ full rate, equivalent to 10 years contributions) they will qualify for the State Pension (Contributory), which is not means-tested.  In the event that there are insufficient contributions, the person may qualify for the State Pension (Non-Contributory), provided they satisfy the means test. </p></reply>

The Department is committed to delivering a high quality customer service to all its customers. Each week the Department delivers social welfare payments to in excess of 1.5 million customers.  In 2013, it answered 8.3 million telephone calls, processed 2.1 million applications and carried out 1.1 million control reviews.<br/><br/>The Department&rsquo;s Customer Charter and Action Plan 2013 - 2015 sets out the level of service customers can expect when dealing with the Department and its commitment to provide a professional, efficient, courteous and timely service to all customers.  The Customer Charter is prominently displayed in all public offices and is also available on the Department&rsquo;s website at .<br/><br/>I wish to assure the Deputy that the Department is committed to ensuring that a customer service ethos is embedded in everything it does and is embraced by everyone in the organisation.  Accordingly, since 2011, almost 3,000 staff throughout the Department have been supported with learning and development in the area of customer service, as part of a comprehensive suite of training.<br/><br/>In the event a customer is dissatisfied with the standard of service they receive, they should contact the staff member or section involved to have the matter resolved.  If this does not resolve the issue to their satisfaction, they can make a formal complaint to the Quality<font color="#C20000"> </font>Customer Service Team in person, by telephone, in writing or on line at .  Their complaint will be dealt with promptly, fairly and impartially.  Receipt of the complaint will be acknowledged, and it will be referred to a complaints officer for investigation.  A response to the customer normally issues within 15 working days of the date of receipt of the complaint.  If the complaint remains unresolved, the customer has the right of further appeal to the Office of the Ombudsman.  The table below provides a summary of the formal complaints received for the past four years. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014(to date)</th></tr><tr><td>No. of complaints recorded</td><td>1,734</td><td>1,566</td><td>1,215</td><td>978</td></tr></table><br/><br/><br/><br/>In recent years, the Department streamlined and enhanced its structures and processes when faced with increasing numbers of customers across the spectrum of its schemes and services during a period when the Government had committed to reduce public sector spending.  This redesign included the roll out of a new integrated Intreo model of service delivery nationwide.  To date, some 44 of the Departments social welfare local offices have been re-launched as Intreo centres, with work continuing the remaining 16 offices.  The Intreo model provides for the seamless integration of services to jobseekers from the first day of their unemployment until their return to work.  It involves the traditional claims process allied with the Department's activation supports and recourse to the Department's Community Welfare Service where required.<br/><br/>I wish to advise the Deputy that the Department is fully committed to ensuring that claims are processed as expeditiously as possible and that backlogs of claims are kept to a minimum.  Each scheme area is continuously monitored and reviewed to ensure customers are responded to as quickly as possible.  Where difficulties arise, the Department moves to address these as speedily as possible, within the operating constraints in place.  In this regard, the Department has had major success in clearing backlogs, notably in the disability and caring schemes.  It must also be remembered that processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process. <br/><br/>As part of the Department&rsquo;s programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.  <br/><br/>In addition, the staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.</p></reply>

This is the first Budget where we have had the scope to make real positive improvement for welfare recipients. This is evidenced by the &euro;65 million we are spending on the Bonus as well as &euro;198 million of new welfare developments which I announced in the Budget and which will come into effect next year.  It is hoped that with the continuing betterment of economic conditions, further resources will be freed up for future Budgets.</p><p>  In relation to rent supplement, it is clearly my preference that a person should not be refused accommodation due to the fact that they are receiving financial support from the State. This position has been advised to the two larger property website owners in terms of their advertising, following which, one subsequently removed the reference to rent supplement on their website.  Officials in the Department are also engaging with those in the Department of Justice and Equality in regard to this matter.</p><p>  However, the fact that approximately 71,800 people are in receipt of rent supplement, of which some 19,000 were awarded this year, shows that a significant number of persons are being accommodated by landlords under the scheme.  </p><p>  It is open to any person who has been refused a private tenancy and who feels discriminated against on the basis of his or her gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Travelling community to refer a discrimination complaint to the Equality Tribunal under the Equal Status Acts.</p></reply>

To connect employers with prospective employees who meet their recruitment needs, the Department also identifies and notifies potential suitable candidates of available job opportunities.</p><p>  In order to improve the job/candidate matching capability of JobsIreland, a tender process is currently underway for a new job matching system. Subject to the outcome of the tender process it is anticipated that the new system will go live during 2015.  Improving the job/candidate matching capability of this service will incentivise employers to use the service to provide more jobs for those who are unemployed.  </p><p>  This addresses one of the key pillars of Pathways to Work 2015 which is to ensure better engagement with people who are unemployed, so that in addition to the right of accessing efficient, work-focused income supports, unemployed clients also have a responsibility to engage with employment services, which is tailored to the client&rsquo;s individual profile. One of the actions identified under this pillar is to make it a condition for receipt of jobseekers payments that jobseekers upload CVs to the bsIreland.ie or other employment sites at the request of their case officer.</p><p>  In order to populate the new job matching site with sufficiently detailed candidate profiles to enable employers match their job requirements with suitable candidates, jobseekers will be asked to upload their CVs on bsIreland and other similar employment sites.  In addition to providing evidence to the Department that the jobseeker is genuinely seeking, and available for, employment this will bring benefits to the jobseeker as it will improve their chances of being &lsquo;matched&rsquo; with employers in three ways. </p><p>  First, the new bslreland service will itself automatically match candidate profiles with suitable jobs and will notify both the jobseeker and the employer of the match details. </p><p>  Second, employers will have the ability to refine the search parameters and conduct an &lsquo;advance&rsquo; search for job for candidates with specific skills, qualifications and/or experience. </p><p>  Third, jobseekers will have a similar search capability and will, by examining matching results, be able to refine the presentation of their CV to maximise its likelihood of being identified as a match for particular job types.</p><p>  It is important to note that, unless otherwise specified by the jobseeker, candidate personal information, such as name and address, will not be visible to employers or other users. Instead candidate ID numbers will be used and these will enable prospective employers to communicate with jobseekers using messaging functionality on the system.  </p><p>  In addition jobseekers will only be requested to upload their CV in circumstances where their case worker is of the opinion that it is appropriate to do so. In particular it is not intended that jobseekers with significant barriers to employment, for example literacy problems, will be requested to upload their CV. Such jobseekers will, as is the practice at the moment, be referred to appropriate service interventions.</p></reply>

I refer you to Questions 98 and 99 of 21 October 2014.</p><p>  In July 2008, the Labour Court recommended that an agreed pension scheme should be introduced for Community Employment (CE) scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors and that such a scheme should be adequately funded by F&Aacute;S, the agency responsible for CE at that time. The Department of Social Protection is now responsible for CE. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the position of this Department in rejecting that liability for these costs should be met from public funds, this matter has been the subject of discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the unions representing CE supervisors. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has stated to the unions that companies contracted by the State to provide a service, including in the community sector, will have to manage their expenditure pressures, including labour and pension costs, from within existing funding levels.</p><p>  Given the level of funding that would be required from this Department, the implementation of the claim is not considered sustainable in light of the current and on-going fiscal environment and the requirement to contain public expenditure. The costs of the introduction of any scheme are likely to be of the order of &euro;3m per annum, with retrospective costs of the order of at least &euro;39m. In this context, it should be noted that the Supervisors and Sponsors have made no contribution towards the cost of the pension arrangements they are currently seeking from the Department. </p><p>  It should also be noted that this Department is not the employer of CE supervisors and such employees are not public servants but are employees of the sponsoring organisations. The responsibilities of the sponsoring organisations and the individuals concerned must also be recognised when considering pension provision arrangements.</p></reply>

The Department has no relationship with the landlord and tenant behaviour is a matter for the landlord in the first instance.  There are a number of avenues open to landlords in such cases, including the mediation service for landlords and tenants operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) and/or recourse to the Garda Siochana and/or the Courts in relation to the enforcement of the law in dealing with anti-social or criminal behaviour.</p><p>  Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 tenants are obliged not to behave within a dwelling, or in the vicinity of it, in a way that is anti-social.  Landlords are obliged to enforce the tenant&rsquo;s obligations, and may seek termination of a tenancy due to a tenant&rsquo;s antisocial behaviour.  Landlords who fail to enforce the tenant&rsquo;s obligations may be subject to a fine imposed by the PRTB.  Termination of the tenancy would result in the termination of rent supplement. </p><p>  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides the Department with the authority to refuse, suspend or terminate payment of a rent supplement in the case of a person who has been required to deliver up possession of a dwelling provided by a housing authority or an approved body where the reasons for that requirement include anti-social behaviour or the interests of good estate management.  </p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to review the operation of the rent supplement to ensure that tenants who are receiving long term support from the State under the rent supplement scheme are subject to the same type of anti-social behaviour regime as local authority tenants.  The most appropriate way for this to happen is for local authorities to take over responsibility for meeting the accommodation needs of these individuals which will be delivered through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) which is currently being rolled out in selected local authorities.</p></reply>

However, a recent query of system data shows that in the past 6 months (June to November 2014) 1,382 children whose parents were previously deemed eligible for domiciliary care allowance (DCA) have turned 16 and their DCA subsequently ceased.</p><p>  Of these 1,382 children, 458 have applied for disability allowance (DA) up to the end of November 2014. Of these 458 applications, 127 have been awarded DA, 260 have been disallowed, while 71 are awaiting decision.</p><p>  In relation to carer's allowance (CA), 270 of the 1,382 CA schemes in payment have been stopped following review. The remaining 1,112 cases remain in payment although the review process may be ongoing in some of these cases.</p><p>  The qualifying conditions for the respective schemes are set out in legislation and regulations specific to each scheme and are not the same.  The Department must ensure that the relevant qualifying conditions for each scheme are satisfied.</p><p>  The review of the continued entitlement of a former DCA recipient (parent/guardian) to CA is not dependent in any way on whether the child who turns 16 years either claims or is entitled to DA.   Also, it is important to note that where CA claims for former DCA recipients are being reviewed upon a child reaching 16, the claims remain in payment while the review is underway, even if the child has already reached 16.</p><p>  Upon the child reaching 16 years, DCA is no longer payable.  It is open for the child to apply for disability allowance (DA).  In respect of CA claims for children under 16, the care requirement for the care recipient are deemed to be satisfied where DCA is in payment in respect of that child.  CA must be reviewed once a care recipient reaches 16 years in order to ensure that the care requirement of the child meets the statutory conditions for receipt of CA.</p><p>  There has been a long-standing process to notify DCA recipients at least 6 months in advance that DCA will stop when the child reaches 16 and that continued entitlement to CA would be reviewed.  The purpose of that communication is to ensure that parents are aware of what is going to happen, their future options and to give them time to gather the necessary information. That communication also draws the attention of the parent to the potential eligibility of the child for DA.</p><p>  The Department is reviewing its communications with parents who are in receipt of both domiciliary care allowance (DCA) and carer's allowance (CA) for children who are reaching 16 years, to  further emphasise to the parent the importance of supplying sufficiently detailed information from the child's doctor(s) and other healthcare professionals, schools etc to the Department at the outset.  The notification will also state the conditions which need to be met in relation to CA (which are not the same as those for receipt of DCA).  It is hoped that this will reduce the number of CA cases that are stopped at first instance but subsequently reinstated upon review of additional information supplied.</p></reply>

Through these and other social transfers, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children is reduced from 45 per cent to 18.8 per cent, a poverty reduction effect of 59 per cent.<br/><br/>Ireland is amongst the best performing member states in the EU in this regard.  In Budget 2015, the Government committed a further &euro;96 million for children, including an increase of &euro;5 per month in child benefit. <br/><br/>In order to break the cycle of child poverty where this arises, the Government invests in prevention and early intervention services targeted at disadvantaged children through the Area Based Childhood programme and the DEIS programme. <br/><br/>Of course a key way to tackle child poverty is to get parents back to work.  Through Pathways to Work and the Action Plan on Jobs, the Government is putting people into real jobs.

The recommendation is that this change should be made from a specific date, with the age threshold for payment of DCA to increase to age 18 for all new and existing claimants aged 16 and under on that date.  On this same date the age threshold for payment of DA would change to age 18, to apply to new claimants only.</p><p>  However, the Deputy will be aware that there are differing views on the best way to proceed so as to provide support to the group of people in question. While the recommendations of the reports will be kept under consideration as part of ongoing review of the wider disability area, there are no plans to extend the age limit for receipt of DCA at this time.</p></reply>

This objective is bedded into a range of Government initiatives including the Public Sector Reform Plan, e-Government Strategy and the Department&rsquo;s Payment Strategy.  That Strategy aims to facilitate greater use of electronic payments to provide wider payment options to our clients and build levels of financial inclusion, while also continuing to serve those who are more vulnerable in our society.</p><p>  Last year, the cost of 42.7 million cash payments to clients was almost &euro;73 million gross.  By comparison, 37 million payments were issued by EFT at a cost of only &euro;9 million.  Reducing levels of cash payments can deliver real savings for Irish taxpayers and benefit welfare clients simultaneously.  Efforts are also being progressed to gradually deplete the levels of cheques issued in support of the objectives of the recent e-Day initiative.</p><p>  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is fully briefed on the Department&rsquo;s strategy.  While matters relating to An Post are a matter for its Board to consider in consultation with my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I was interested to note that An Post is itself making moves in the direction of electronic payments with its recent invitation to the market for electronic payment solutions and allied services. I am very conscious of the important role of post offices which offer financial and other services locally. This Government has consistently stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network in the Programme for Government and I was glad to play my part in that when, following an EU-wide procurement competition, I signed a new contract with An Post last December which is worth in excess of &euro;50 million to it this year.</p></reply>

There are approximately 71,800 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.  </p><p>  I am keeping the matter regarding rent limits under consideration and the review being undertaken by the Department will be finalised shortly. The Department is in a position of both significant influence in the private rented market and responsibility. There is a real concern that increased rent limits may add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers, their families and students. </p><p>  Central to the current supply issue is that rent supplement policy must provide flexibility. I can assure the Deputies that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience and make every effort to ensure that accommodation needs are met including through the use of their discretionary statutory powers as necessary and, in Dublin, through the Interim Tenancy Sustainment Protocol (ITSP). A notice reminding staff of their statutory discretionary power to award, on a case by case basis, a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated in July 2014. Further instructions are issuing this week to ensure that the necessary supports continue to be provided and that there is consistency throughout the country.</p><p>  Rent supplement payments are being made in excess of the maximum limits throughout the county, including over 240 cases under the Interim Tenancy Sustainment Protocol, in order to maintain tenancies. The Department is reviewing the local arrangements in place to strengthen the existing framework. </p><p>  I strongly advise that where a person in receipt of rent supplement is at risk of losing their tenancy they should make contact with the Tenancy Protection Service provided by Threshold on 1800 454 454 in Dublin or their local Community Welfare Service throughout the country.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-10a.107.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014121000062#WRB03900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 45 together.<br/><br/>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to reduce long-term and youth unemployment has been through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. This strategy is working. Employment has risen by about 85,000 since the recovery began in 2012. The unemployment rate, according to the most recent Live Register figures for November, is falling and is currently at 10.7%, the lowest rate in over 5 years &ndash; and is down from a peak of 15.1% in 2012. <br/><br/>The most recent QNHS figures for long term unemployment show that since the peak in Q1 2012 of 204,000, the numbers had fallen by 65,100 as of Q3 2014, a reduction of 31.9% (see Figure 1 below). The percentage of the labour force who are long-term unemployed (the long-term unemployment rate) rose from 8.2% in 2011 Q1 to 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling over the last two years to a recent low of 6.4% in Q3 2014. <br/><br/>The most recent figures also show youth unemployment down by 11,400 year-on year to 48,400 in Q3 2014, equating to an unemployment rate of 23.2%.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, despite the progress that has been made, the Government recognises that both long-term unemployment and youth unemployment remain unacceptably high. People who are long-term unemployed account for 58% of total unemployment and within the overall number who are more than 12 months unemployed the number that are two and three years unemployed is particularly worrying.  It is clear that some people who became unemployed at the height of the jobs crisis in 2009 have found it particularly difficult to find employment. Hence, the Government recognises the need for additional activation measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created as the economy recovers are taken up by long-term and young Live Registrants. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee, both of which are being led by the Department of Social Protection.  <br/><br/>In Pathways to Work 2012, a target was set for the Department of Social Protection of moving 75,000 of those who were long-term live registrants at the end of 2011 into employment by the end of 2015. Up to the end of the third quarter of 2014, over 65,000 of this group had moved into, and remain in, employment. Given progress to date, the Department is on course to reach its 2015 target. <br/><br/>The latest iteration of the Pathways to Work Strategy - Pathways to Work 2015 - includes a wide range of programmes and services to help long term unemployed jobseekers back to employment. These include programmes such as JobBridge, JobsPlus and Momentum introduced by this Government and schemes such as Community Employment and T&uacute;s, where the Department has significantly increased the number of places available. JobsPlus is targeted specifically at encouraging employers to recruit people who are long-term unemployed.  Almost 3,000 long-term unemployed people have been placed in employment as a result of JobsPlus and over 60% of these have been unemployed for 2 years or more.<br/><br/>Pathways to Work 2015 also includes arrangements to increase the level of systematic engagement of the employment services with those who are out of work for long periods. There is also a specific focus on employer engagement to encourage employers to recruit from the Live Register.<br/><br/>The most recent figures for participation on the main activation programmes are set out in the table below: <br/><br/><b>Activation Programmes (October 2013 and October 2014) </b><br/><br/><b>Live Register Activation Programmes (Number) by Type of Activation</b><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Programme and Month</b><div></div><table><tr><th><b></b></th><th><b>Oct 2013</b></th><th><b>Oct 2014</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>Back to Work payments</b></td><td><b></b></td><td><b></b></td></tr><tr><td>Back to work allowance scheme - employee strand</td><td>12</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Back to work enterprise allowance scheme - self employed strand</td><td>10269</td><td>10897</td></tr><tr><td>Short-term enterprise allowance</td><td>708</td><td>516</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total back to work payments</b></td><td><b>10989</b></td><td><b>11418</b></td></tr><tr><td><b></b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>Other activation programmes</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>DSP part-time job incentive</td><td>243</td><td>384</td></tr><tr><td>TUS - community work placement initiative</td><td>6849</td><td>7683</td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge</td><td>6174</td><td>6599</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total other activation programmes</b></td><td><b>13266</b></td><td><b>14666</b></td></tr><tr><td><b></b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>Community employment schemes (excluding supervisors)</b></td><td>21806</td><td>22815</td></tr><tr><td><b>FAS full time training for unemployed people</b></td><td>9145</td><td>8434</td></tr><tr><td><b></b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>Back to education courses</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS)</td><td>5000</td><td>5000</td></tr><tr><td>Back to education allowance (BTEA)</td><td>24432</td><td>21201</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total back to education courses</b></td><td><b>29432</b></td><td><b>26201</b></td></tr><tr><td><b></b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>Total activation programmes</b></td><td><b>84638</b></td><td><b>83534</b></td></tr></table><br/><br/>Back to Work allowance scheme - Employee strand: This scheme was closed to new applications from 1st May 2009.<br/><br/>Short-term Enterprise Allowance: This scheme was introduced from 1st May 2009.

The implementation of the Guarantee is a medium-term policy of the Irish Government. The guarantee of an offer of training, education or work experience for those aged less than 25 years after a four month period is currently being implemented on a phased basis. Processes and programmes are being progressively rolled out to ensure that all of those young unemployed people who need most support (i.e. are assessed as having a low probability of securing employment in the absence of support from the Public Employment Services) will receive a Youth Guarantee offer within four months. During 2014&ndash;2015 all long-term unemployed young people under 25 will be engaged by the Public Employment Service and will receive a Youth Guarantee offer if still unemployed after four months of this engagement process commencing. <br/><br/>With respect to evaluation of the impact of Pathways to Work and the Youth Guarantee, it cannot be precisely separated from the impact of other factors affecting the decline in long-term unemployment (such as the general improvement in the economy and the labour market resulting from the government&rsquo;s overall economic and employment policies).  A full evaluation of the Pathways to Work programme will be commissioned next year which will seek to quantify what aspects of Pathways to Work are most effective and the reasons for their effectiveness.<br/><br/>With respect to age profiling those on the live register, the Department of Social Protection keeps a detailed breakdown of the profiles of jobseekers. Data on each client&rsquo;s age, past occupation, and his/her education, is collected at the point of registration for job-seekers&rsquo; payment; these and other relevant data are processed and the probability of exiting the live register is calculated (PEX). This is essentially a predictor of whether or not someone will become long-term unemployed.  The roll-out of the profiling system at the Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; Intreo offices implicitly involves age profiling of the long-term unemployed, as age is one of the main determining variables in predicting if someone will become long-term unemployed. In other words, if someone is in an age category that is more likely to experience long-term unemployment, s/he will, all other things being equal, receive more targeted assistance.  <br/><br/>Summary statistical information on the clients&rsquo; age (under/over 25), duration of unemployment (under/over one year), and last held occupation together with other demographic and regional information is published on the Central Statistics Office website. <br/><br/></p></reply>

This includes those who move to self-employment, such as the construction sector.  It will also apply to One Parent Family Payment recipients who similarly go back into the workforce.  The scheme will be worth &euro;1,550 per child in the first year of employment or self-employment and half that amount again in the second year. </p><p>  The Dividend will help increase the pace of the progress we are making in helping people back to work, thereby reducing poverty.  It will help boost the recovery, reduce welfare expenditure in the long-run, and, most importantly, help the families in question to build a better financial future for themselves. </p><p>  The Budget also provided for the expansion of JobsPlus to provide subsidies to employers to recruit and employ an additional 3,000 long-term unemployed jobseekers.  This scheme has proven to be particularly successful with the longer-term unemployed (i.e. unemployed for more than two years.)</p><p>  I was also pleased to be in the position to increase Child Benefit from &euro;130 to &euro;135 per month, which will benefit over 611,000 households with children. This will help all families with children but also has the additional benefit for unemployed families in that it is work neutral as it is retained in full when they return to the workforce.</p><p>  I also announced, on Budget Day, a number of welfare initiatives which will benefit pensioners, carers and people with disabilities who are in receipt of a welfare payment. These initiatives included the re-introduction of a Christmas Bonus and an increase in the Living Alone Allowance.</p><p>  The Christmas Bonus was abolished by the previous Government in 2009. I am pleased to say that I am in a position to partially restore the Bonus this year. A bonus of 25% was paid last week to long-term welfare recipients including all pensioners, people with disabilities, carers and long-term jobseekers. This will cost over &euro;65 million and is in recognition of the position of vulnerable households.</p><p>  There will be an increase in the living alone allowance of &euro;1.30 per week from January, bringing the rate up from &euro;7.70 to &euro;9 for pensioners and people with disabilities.  The living alone allowance is a payment made to pensioners and people with disabilities who live alone and was last increased in 1996. </p><p>  As well as the measures mentioned above, all existing welfare payments and supports for pensioners will be maintained in 2015 &ndash; there will be no reductions. </p><p>  Throughout the crisis, this Government protected core weekly welfare rates and maintained a massively strong social welfare safety net. That was a political choice which this Government made very deliberately; it is not one that was followed in other bailout countries. This is acknowledged by the ESRI, among others, which has pointed out that, unlike in other countries, income inequality has fallen in Ireland in recent years, largely because of the overall maintenance of the welfare system. </p><p>  This is the first Budget where we have had the scope to make real positive improvement for welfare recipients. This is evidenced by the &euro;65 million we are spending on the Bonus as well as &euro;198 million of new welfare developments which I announced in the Budget and which will come into effect next year.  It is hoped that with the continuing betterment of economic conditions, further resources will be freed up for future Budgets.  </p><p>  Social transfers play a crucial role in redistributing resources to those most in need. In 2012, social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of poverty rate from 39 per cent to 16.5 per cent, thereby lifting one fifth of the Irish population out of income poverty.</p><p>  Ireland is amongst the best performing EU countries in reducing poverty through social transfers (excluding pensions). Using comparable data from Eurostat from 2012, Ireland&rsquo;s performance in reducing poverty at 60 per cent was far in excess of the EU-28 norm of 35 per cent.</p><p>  Social impact assessment is an evidence-based methodology to estimate the likely distributive effects of policy proposals on poverty and social inequality, including the impact on family types, lifecycle groups and gender. </p><p>  The Department published an integrated social impact assessments of Budgets 2013 and 2014 (using the ESRI SWITCH model) which included the main welfare and tax measures. </p><p>  The Department is currently preparing a social impact assessment of the main welfare, tax and related measures for 2015.  This will be finalised to take account of government decisions relating to water charges and affordability. It is intended to publish the analysis as soon as is feasible (when available).  Furthermore, the Government has committed to carrying out a social impact assessment of the main taxation and welfare measures before the publishing of budgets by a cross-Department body led by the Departments of Finance, Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-10a.113.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014121000062#WRB04500"><p>The average appeal processing time for 2012, 2013 and 2014 broken down by all social welfare scheme types is outlined in the tables below. <br/><br/>Appeal processing times peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 the average processing time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks and the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  Further improvements were achieved in 2013, when the average appeal processing time reduced to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision, and also in 2014.  As at 30 November 2014, the average time taken to process an appeal requiring an oral hearing was 28.7 weeks and for a summary decision was 21.4 weeks.  <br/><br/>Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system. By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.<br/><br/>There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013. In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.<br/><br/>In addition to the improvement in processing times, these measures have also led to a significant increase in the annual number of appeals finalised in the appeals office from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress has also been made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 9,769  at 1 December 2014.<br/><br/>In addition the Department has undertaken a process of reform in many of its scheme areas aimed at reducing the time taken to respond to requests for submissions in relation to appeals. It is anticipated that with these improvements, the processing times for appeals will continue to improve.  Appeal processing times are kept under continual review in the Social Welfare Appeals Office.<br/><br/>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<br/><br/><b>2012 - Appeals Processing times by scheme 1/1/2012 - 31/12/2012</b><table><tr><th></th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Summary Decisions</th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Oral Hearings</th></tr><tr><td>Adoptive Benefit</td><td>27.7</td><td>40.4</td></tr><tr><td>Blind Pension</td><td>24.4</td><td>34.7</td></tr><tr><td>Carers Allowance</td><td>33.5</td><td>42.5</td></tr><tr><td>Carers Benefit</td><td>27.3</td><td>35.3</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td>47.1</td><td>53.1</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>34.2</td><td>40.6</td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td>41.9</td><td>50.3</td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care</td><td>32.5</td><td>41.4</td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wives Benefit</td><td>27.6</td><td>45.4</td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wives Allowance</td><td>24.5</td><td>39.5</td></tr><tr><td>Farm Assist</td><td>23.4</td><td>44.9</td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant</td><td>29.0</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement</td><td>22.8</td><td>31.2</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>38.8</td><td>48.7</td></tr><tr><td>Liable Relatives</td><td>33.9</td><td>69.7</td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment</td><td>29.4</td><td>44.6</td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td>30.8</td><td>41.7</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td>33.2</td><td>59.4</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Cont)</td><td>27.7</td><td>51.1</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)</td><td>25.1</td><td>49.1</td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit</td><td>19.5</td><td>66.9</td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit (Medical)</td><td>78.7</td><td>87.4</td></tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension</td><td>35.7</td><td>46.0</td></tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement</td><td>14.2</td><td>48.8</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Con)</td><td>25.8</td><td>49.1</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-con)</td><td>32.0</td><td>58.8</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-Retirement Allowance</td><td>54.6</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)</td><td>22.8</td><td>38.2</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance</td><td>24.4</td><td>34.4</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit</td><td>20.9</td><td>30.8</td></tr><tr><td>Respite Care Grant</td><td>28.5</td><td>37.3</td></tr><tr><td>Insurability of Employment</td><td>45.6</td><td>83.3</td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare  Allowance</td><td>17.6</td><td>22.9</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment Benefits</td><td>19.0</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Con)</td><td>27.1</td><td>60.5</td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Non-con)</td><td>30.9</td><td>39.1</td></tr><tr><td>Widows Parent Grant</td><td>23.2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>All Appeals</td><td>27.8</td><td>39.5</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In the case of jobseekers, the qualifying period required for access to the BTWEA is 12 months in receipt of a jobseekers payment, provided a person has an underlying entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Jobseekers who were previously self-employed, similar to PAYE workers, may access social welfare supports including BTWEA by establishing eligibility to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. <br/><br/>The STEA provides immediate access to those who have lost their jobs and qualify for jobseekers&rsquo; benefit and wish to set up a business. Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. <br/><br/>Information on accessing the scheme and supports for people considering starting their own business is available from DSP Intreo centres, local enterprise offices and local development companies.  Further information is available on the Department&rsquo;s website .<br/><br/>Information on the number of applications approved for Back to Work in each of the years 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014 is set out in the table below.<br/><br/><b><i>Number of Back To Work Applications Approved 2012-2014</i></b><table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014<br /><br />(end of October)</th></tr><tr><td>Back To Work Enterprise Allowance</td><td>10,811</td><td>10,098</td><td>10,897</td></tr><tr><td>Short Term Enterprise Allowance </td><td>1,066</td><td>583</td><td>516</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>11,877</td><td>10,681</td><td>11,413</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The number of claims cleared in turn is largely dependent on the nature of the claims (claims requiring income assessment or assessment of medical conditions take longer to process) and the completeness of the information provided with the claim form.  Therefore the fact that claims are on hand is not necessarily indicative of a backlog.<br/><br/>My Department measures the performance of each scheme area on a monthly basis including the measurement of the number of claims pending a decision at the end of each month. The table below shows the number of claims pending at the end of October 2013 and at the end of October 2014 for the scheme areas for which this information is available together with the total number of claims received during that period and the total number of claims in payment as at the end of October.  As can be seen at the overall level, the number of claims pending a decision in my Department as a percentage of claims received during the period is 3.6% and the overall number of claims pending has reduced by 12.9% during the period.<table><tr><th>Type of Payment <br /><br />ranked by number of recipients</th><th>Recipients October 2013</th><th>Recipients October 2014</th><th>Claims Registered  1/11/13 to 31/10/14</th><th>Claims Pending at 31/10/13</th><th>Claims Pending at 31/10/14</th><th>Pending Claims as % of claims registered</th><th>Year-on-year change in pending claims</th><th>% change in pending claims year-on-year</th></tr><tr><td>Free Travel</td><td>781,757</td><td>809,155</td><td>7,918</td><td>33</td><td>49</td><td>0.6%</td><td>16</td><td>48.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td>612,408</td><td>613,284</td><td>146,348</td><td>3,766</td><td>3,391</td><td>2.3%</td><td>-375</td><td>-10.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Household Benefits</td><td>419,828</td><td>413,019</td><td>69,141</td><td>2,449</td><td>609</td><td>0.9%</td><td>-1840</td><td>-75.1%</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td>326,992</td><td>344,566</td><td>40,039</td><td>2,355</td><td>2,511</td><td>6.3%</td><td>156</td><td>6.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Living alone/Over 80/Island Allowances</td><td>318,304</td><td>325,428</td><td>11,714</td><td>378</td><td>666</td><td>5.7%</td><td>288</td><td>76.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance</td><td>286,667</td><td>265,705</td><td>211,714</td><td>13,930</td><td>9,977</td><td>4.7%</td><td>-3953</td><td>-28.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Widow/er's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension</td><td>117,269</td><td>118,403</td><td>7,409</td><td>573</td><td>498</td><td>6.7%</td><td>-75</td><td>-13.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>104,831</td><td>111,301</td><td>19,429</td><td>5,162</td><td>6,122</td><td>31.5%</td><td>960</td><td>18.6%</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</td><td>95,759</td><td>95,417</td><td>9,011</td><td>2,028</td><td>2,038</td><td>22.6%</td><td>10</td><td>0.5%</td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment </td><td>78,516</td><td>70,317</td><td>12,548</td><td>2,815</td><td>1,750</td><td>13.9%</td><td>-1065</td><td>-37.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Carer's Allowance</td><td>56,907</td><td>58,871</td><td>14,574</td><td>2,658</td><td>5,049</td><td>34.6%</td><td>2391</td><td>90.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td>59,980</td><td>57,939</td><td>235,354</td><td>4,035</td><td>2,352</td><td>1.0%</td><td>-1683</td><td>-41.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>52,948</td><td>54,015</td><td>9,125</td><td>2,176</td><td>2,364</td><td>25.9%</td><td>188</td><td>8.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement</td><td>41,989</td><td>49,084</td><td>67,098</td><td>4,409</td><td>3,141</td><td>4.7%</td><td>-1268</td><td>-28.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit</td><td>53,101</td><td>40,426</td><td>148,773</td><td>4,924</td><td>3,636</td><td>2.4%</td><td>-1288</td><td>-26.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment Benefits</td><td>35,871</td><td>36,375</td><td>500,729</td><td>2,604</td><td>2,663</td><td>0.5%</td><td>59</td><td>2.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance</td><td>25,442</td><td>27,020</td><td>5,323</td><td>553</td><td>998</td><td>18.7%</td><td>445</td><td>80.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td>22,457</td><td>22,275</td><td>46,661</td><td>4,493</td><td>4,846</td><td>10.4%</td><td>353</td><td>7.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare Allowance</td><td>24,744</td><td>19,877</td><td>62,093</td><td>4,259</td><td>4,019</td><td>6.5%</td><td>-240</td><td>-5.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Disablement Benefit</td><td>14,199</td><td>12,388</td><td>531</td><td>1,664</td><td>1,042</td><td>196.2%</td><td>-622</td><td>-37.4%</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)</td><td>13,441</td><td>3,361</td><td>5,466</td><td>1,647</td><td>747</td><td>13.7%</td><td>-900</td><td>-54.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Carer's Benefit </td><td>1,574</td><td>1,674</td><td>2,039</td><td>356</td><td>588</td><td>28.8%</td><td>232</td><td>65.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Interim Illness Benefit</td><td>350</td><td>361</td><td>13,417</td><td>247</td><td>181</td><td>1.3%</td><td>-66</td><td>-26.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Other schemes (some 2014 claims pending data not yet available)</td><td>99,537</td><td>167,321</td><td>n/a</td><td>486</td><td>15</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>-96.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>3,644,871</td><td>3,717,582</td><td>1,646,454</td><td>68,000</td><td>59,252</td><td>3.6%</td><td>-8,277</td><td>-12.9%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The provision of rent supplement in the Ballymun designated area was identified by housing authorities as a risk to the tenure diversity objective of the project which is to achieve a more balanced tenure mix by providing additional private market housing.</p><p>  In response to the concerns about achieving a tenure balance mix, Section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 provided that a payment of rent supplement can be refused in respect of accommodation which is situated in an area notified to the Minister for Social Protection by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, as being an area of regeneration.</p><p>  The Department was advised that there was broad consensus on the need for the rent supplement restrictions in Ballymun to protect the significant exchequer investment in the area. Dublin City Council engaged with elected representatives in relation to this matter and there was consultation with Ballymun Regeneration Limited. The payment of rent supplement was also identified as an issue which could undermine the policy of reducing social segregation by the Ballymun Neighbourhood Council, which included representatives from local residents, political representatives and local agencies including Dublin City Council and Ballymun Regeneration Limited. </p><p>  It should be noted that the measures provided for in Section 25 are not a blanket refusal of rent supplement in areas of regeneration.  Specific provision is made to ensure that:</p><p>  - people already residing in such areas and in receipt of rent supplement may continue to receive payment; and </p><p>  - people already residing in such areas in private rental accommodation and who may have recourse to rent supplement in the future would not have their entitlement restricted.</p><p>  The lifting of the condition for rent supplement with respect to the Ballymun regeneration area is a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives and the reform measures introduced to date go somewhat toward that goal.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age is taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. </p><p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Therefore, to qualify for a state pension a person must:</p><p>  - have at least 520 paid contributions and </p><p>  - satisfy a yearly average (a yearly average of 48 is required for a full rate pension).</p><p>  There have been significant changes to the PRSI system over the years which have increased social insurance coverage to most classes of working people.  Accordingly, under the pension reform programme, it is planned to adopt a total contributions approach where the number of contributions paid over a work life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received.  For example, in a model where 30 years contributions (1560) would qualify a person for a maximum State pension (contributory), a person could accumulate 1/30th of a pension for each year of contributions up to a maximum of 30/30ths, inclusive of a certain number of credits. </p><p>  The proposed date for the introduction of a move to a total contributions approach is 2020, but this may be subject to change as it is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.  </p><p>  It should be noted that the pension system has evolved over decades, largely to the benefit of pensioners, and that it has generally been the case that the system at retirement is the one used to calculate pension rates, rather than the rules that pertained when they commenced employment.  Accordingly, while it isn&rsquo;t possible to be definitive about the potential impact of changes on individuals, I can assure the Deputy that contributions paid and credited under existing rules will continue to be used as part of the calculations in a new approach.</p></reply>

The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT in certain circumstances to assist individuals who may have difficulty paying the tax.  To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence.  The gross income thresholds for a full deferral are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or qualifying cohabitants. A person may claim a deferral if their gross income will not, &quot;as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date&quot; exceed these thresholds in that year.  <br/><br/>A deferral of up to 50% of the LPT liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for married persons/civil partners/cohabitants.<br/><br/>The full and partial deferral thresholds may be increased in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage. In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments. The deferral option in such qualifying cases will apply until the end of 2017.<br/><br/>Interest of 4% per annum will apply to any amounts deferred. Where a liable person no longer satisfies the necessary conditions, amounts deferred prior to the date on which eligibility ceased may continue to be deferred. The deferred amount, including interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred. Any amount deferred will be a relatively small part of the overall value of the property, even where the deferral lasts for a number of years.<br/><br/>The LPT legislation also provides for the possibility of a deferral for liable persons who cannot without excessive hardship pay their LPT when it becomes payable, as a consequence of a significant and unexpected financial loss or expense. Further information on this deferral option, including Revenue Guidelines, is available from: <br/><br/>Where a liable person does not qualify for, or does not wish to avail of, a deferral, phased payment of LPT can be used to assist with budgeting. Taxpayers have a wide choice of payment options for the LPT from which they can choose the method most suited to their individual circumstances.</p></reply>

An analysis of the complaints on a county basis is set out in the following table.  Enquiries into these complaints are on-going.<br/><br/><b>Complaints Received in Relation to Petrol Stretching</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>July</th><th>August</th><th>September</th><th>October</th><th>November</th><th>December (to 5th)</th></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>12 *</td><td>11 *</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></table><br/><br/>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the statistics provided to me in relation to complaints made  in Co. Mayo, and included in my reply to PQ No 45780/14 on 2 December 2014 were in fact incorrect, and that the correct figures are shown in the above table.  The Commissioners advise me that the error in the previous figures arose because of some duplicates in the Revenue database of complaints received, and because some complaints were attributed to the incorrect county. I am assured that these database errors have now been corrected and I am pleased to avail of this opportunity to amend the record.<br/><br/>Normally when 'fraudsters' attempt to stretch petrol, they add methanol, kerosene or other low excise duty agents. To-date 208 samples have been referred by Revenue to the State Laboratory for analysis. Despite extensive testing by the State Laboratory, no evidence of any prohibited stretching agent has been found in any of the samples, except two samples taken from one site.  The conclusive results received in that particular case has resulted in the seizure of the product and closure of the facility and a file is being prepared for prosecution.<br/><br/>Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results have been received in the last two weeks which indicate the presence of traces of road diesel in several samples taken from a variety of locations. This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time. There is no rational economic reason or fraudulent incentive for anyone to deliberately mix normal road diesel with petrol. This contamination could have taken place earlier in the summer, well ahead of the problems manifesting themselves in cars in Co. Mayo and elsewhere. <br/><br/>If the problems that have come to light were caused by an unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed into petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved. However, the Deputies can be assured that the Revenue Commissioners are vigorously investigating the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems. In any instances where the analysis of petrol samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents, Revenue will take swift and robust action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.<br/><br/>I am also advised by Revenue that they undertake, on an ongoing basis, an extensive programme of compliance and enforcement actions to ensure adherence to the legal requirements governing the supply and sale of mineral oil and to allow action to be taken against fraud. This involves, among other things, carrying out analysis of the monthly oil movement returns that oil traders are required to make, and of other supply chain data. In addition, Revenue officers conduct control or compliance visits to mineral oil traders, during which they examine transport and movement documentation and take samples of fuel for analysis.<br/><br/>The Revenue Commissioners are working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and share information and intelligence on this issue.  Also, as part of Revenue's normal operating procedures, fuel delivery tankers are challenged when encountered by enforcement officers, particularly throughout the Border Midlands West Region.  No cases of contaminated petrol have been identified as a result of these checks from June 2014 to date. <br/><br/>I wish to assure the Deputies that I am satisfied the Revenue Commissioners  are allocating resources to this issue and taking  all possible actions to identify the problem and challenge any instances of identified fuel fraud including, where possible, pursuing prosecutions against offenders.</p></reply>

However it seems that neither the person nor the 'designated DSP agent' have yet made this request and as a consequence the LPT team can not make the necessary amendments. </p><p>  Because of the circumstances of the case, a member of the LPT team has made a further number of unsuccessful attempts to contact the person's son by telephone to clarify the issues. Given that telephone contact has not been possible, the LPT team will write directly to the person advising on the procedures that must be followed when acquiring a 'new style' PPS number from DSP. As soon as the person receives the new PPS number from DSP then she or her representatives should make immediate contact with the LPT team who will create the correct linkage to the property and will set up her preferred payment methods. </p></reply>

I understand that there is the very small number of large claims where the maximum ICF payment of &euro;825,000 will apply.  There is a number of claims by bodies corporate or unincorporated bodies which are not covered by the ICF as there is no liability to or by an individual and these policyholders might anticipate at a maximum 30% of the total amount of any award under the claim. It is not as yet possible for the Liquidator to provide a final figure on the number of such claims.</p><p>  I appreciate that the current uncertainty regarding the timing of compensation payments is causing difficulty for the former customers of Setanta Insurance and I have asked that information on ICF procedures is made available publicly as soon as possible. The Accountant of the Courts of Justice can only deal with claims which are submitted by the Liquidator, so the advice to all claimants continues to be that they should contact the Liquidator of Setanta.</p></reply>

As I announced in Budget 2014, half of the proceeds from the Lottery licence transaction were allocated to help fund a number of job rich projects across the country including the Wild Atlantic Way, the 1916 Commemoration and the National Sports Campus. The full list of these projects can be viewed on my Department's website at www.per.gov.ie.  The other half of the proceeds, received in a second instalment last week, will be used to help fund the construction of the new National Children's Hospital - the largest, most complex and significant capital investment project ever undertaken in healthcare in Ireland, which will also have a major job creation impact.  </p><p>  The lottery licence was awarded following an open, transparent, competitive process. The new operator, Premier Lotteries Ireland, a joint venture between An Post and Camelot, the operator of the UK national lottery, aims to grow the business.  While a small number of staff have availed of voluntary severance arrangements, the vast majority of staff of An Post National Lottery Company have transferred to the new operator.  I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that the outcome of the award process for the lottery licence has been very successful and has had a positive impact on job creation.</p></reply>

In addition significant savings from reductions in the Live Register have been reinvested to meet expenditure pressures. These funds have been allocated to areas such as Social Protection, Health, Education, Justice and Housing in order to support key policy initiatives and to ensure that demographic pressures are met.</p><p>  It is estimated that there will be an increase of 18,000 in the number of pensioners next year. The estimates of expenditure published on Budget Day show an increase of &euro;185 million in the allocation for pension related payments through the Social Protection Vote and Social Insurance Fund.</p><p>  Demographic demands are being met in the Education Sector with the pupil-teacher ratios in all schools remaining unchanged. The additional current expenditure of &euro;60m for Education in 2015, compared to the REV 2014 allocation, will be mainly used to deal with demographic pressures and for extra resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants. Provision has been made for an additional 1,700 full-time posts comprised of 920 mainstream teachers, 480 resource teachers and 365 Special Needs Assistants.</p><p>  Health Expenditure is being protected with &euro;305 million of the overall increase of &euro;429 million in gross current expenditure being directed to support the delivery of existing services and Programme for Government initiatives in the Health area.</p><p>  Moving beyond 2015, there will be a number of expenditure pressures emerging over the coming years, most notably those related to demographics and their impact on the Social Protection, Health and Education sectors. The expenditure ceilings for 2016 and 2017 contained in the Comprehensive Expenditure Report provide for expenditure increases in these areas to accommodate these demographic pressures. Decisions regarding the finalisation of these allocations for 2016 and 2017 will be taken in the context of the Budget for those years with due regard to the level of expenditure required to ensure the effective delivery of key public services and the fiscal parameters set out under the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), in particular the Expenditure Benchmark.</p></reply>

When my consideration is more advanced, I will of course bring proposals to Government in the first instance.  Any proposals to amend the FEMPI Acts, including any changes to the Public Service Pension Reduction will require primary legislation to be brought before the Oireachtas.</font><br/><br/>The Alliance has also raised concerns in relation to the Universal Social Charge (USC). As the Deputy will be aware, issues in relation to the USC and its application to income streams, including pensions, are the responsibility of the Minister of Finance. I would however note that in the recent Budget, the USC exemption limit was raised to just over &euro;12,000, while the 2% rate was reduced to 1.5% and the 4% rate reduced to 3.5%.  </p></reply>

Furthermore, with Russia and China accounting for 27% of the traded world market in the dairy sector, the effect of surplus stocks in the Chinese market along with the displacement effect of the Russian ban can be seen as critical factors in setting the context for price evolution in the sector.   </p><p>  The anticipated decline in 2015  largely reflects the impact of the aforementioned developments on global dairy markets. Teagasc expects that average Irish milk prices in 2015 will fall to 27 cent per litre, a reduction of over 10 cent per litre on the average for 2014. However it should be noted that this follows several years of very good incomes on dairy farms. Furthermore, Teagasc are clear that these negative effects are expected to be temporary in nature. </p><p>  Under the new Common Agriculture Policy there is a range of tools available to mitigate the worst impact of downward price volatility, including Aids to Private Storage, Intervention and Export Refunds and I have called on the EU Commission to deploy these tools as appropriate. The Single Farm Payment will also provide a measure of income stability during this difficult period. I have also asked the banking sector to tailor their financial products  to allow for the kind of price volatility that will be a feature of international dairy markets, and  of course  co-ops have a role to play in ensuring that their contractual arrangements with suppliers provide a measure of stability.  A focus on innovation and the production of added value products will also have a role to play in mitigating the impact of volatility, and a greater use of futures markets may also feature among the tools deployed by the sector.</p><p>  In terms of how this will evolve in the medium term, Teagasc, in common with a number of other commentators, anticipate that lower milk prices will lead to a slowdown in the expansion of milk production globally through 2015, with global dairy markets set to witness signs of recovery as the year progresses. In the medium to longer term population growth and increasing affluence in developing countries will continue to drive strong growth in demand for dairy products, and Irish producers will be well placed to take full advantage of this demand.</p></reply>

I have already signed a common note from Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, France, Hungary and Romania, which is supported by Austria and Estonia, calling on the Commission to introduce a scheme of aid for private storage of pigmeat.</p><p>  As to the dairy sector, the continuing weakness in the global dairy market is having a severe impact on dairy farmers in Ireland and throughout the EU. Prices have fallen from historically high levels in 2013 to exceptionally low levels at present, and further reductions are anticipated. This weakness in prices has been exacerbated by the Russian import ban. In these circumstances it is important that the European Commission uses the measures available to it to assist the situation. Some private storage aid has already been provided. I will be raising the dairy sector at next week&rsquo;s Council of Ministers and will be calling on the Commission to take whatever action is necessary to support the market in a way that is both timely and effective during the period of instability in prices.</p></reply>

Eligible land is defined as land that is used for an agricultural activity. An agricultural activity is defined as the production, rearing or growing of agricultural products including harvesting, milking, breeding of animals and keeping animals for farming purposes. In addition, land must be maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition, which can be achieved by carrying out farming practices such as grazing or by topping the land.</p><p>  Bogland in Ireland ranges from raised bog in lower elevations to blanket peat at higher elevations. In the main raised bog is not eligible land as it is traditionally not used or suitable to carry out a traditional farming activity such as the rearing of animals. On the other hand blanket peat can be eligible where it continues to be used to carry out an agricultural activity such as sheep farming.</p><p>  When carrying out eligibility inspections to ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements governing the Single Payment Scheme all areas submitted for payment are inspected on their own merit and where my Department is satisfied that an acceptable agricultural activity is being conducted the land will be considered eligible.</p></reply>

A Project Board, comprising senior representatives of the three Departments concerned along with the Chief Executive Officers of the three Agencies, is overseeing the merger. The CEO Designate of the merged body, who acts as Project Manager for the merger, was appointed from 1 July 2013. It is anticipated that Ministerial responsibility for the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland will be transferred to the Minister for Justice &amp;amp; Equality in due course. </p><p>  Full implementation of the merger of the three organisations to form a new organisation to be called Tailte Eireann will require primary legislation. I intend to publish the General Scheme of the Tailte Eireann Bill early in the new session and to proceed as quickly as possible thereafter to enactment of the legislation.</p><p>  The merger of the Valuation Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Property Registration Authority provides an opportunity for more efficient and cost-effective delivery of land, spatial data and property administration services. Savings in the short to medium term are anticipated from the consolidation of common back office functions such as Human Resources, conventional ICT systems, Financial Management and a potential reduction in the cost of accommodation and software licensing. In the longer term, more efficiencies/synergies may be achievable in operational areas and through the exploitation, including where possible commercialisation, of combined data sets. </p></reply>

The contents of the Garda report will then determine the course of the Tribunal's directions on the case.  In a fatal case the Garda report is essential to the Tribunal to determine if the victim died as a result of a crime of violence; if the victim had any responsibility for the incident; if the victim's behaviour, way of life, etc. were contributory factors to the incident, and including details of the victim's criminal record, if any.A Tribunal member must take account of any contributory factors to the incident on the part of the victim and the Tribunal member has discretion under the Scheme to reduce an award or to refuse an award as a consequence.<br/><br/>I can also inform the Deputy that the Scheme has no time-limit for the submission of an application in a fatal case.However, under the terms of the Scheme it is a matter for the claimant to establish his/her case i.e. to provide the Tribunal with the necessary documentation to support the claim. <b></b>I understand that information in relation to the length of time taken  to process applications is not available as this can vary widely from case to case. For instance, if there is a delay in receiving the Garda report or if Tribunal queries arise which result in applicants taking time to respond or if there is a dispute between dependants or family members an application may take some time to finalise. In addition, I understand that in cases of serious injury to the victim it can take a considerable amount of time (in some cases a number of years) before their treating consultant is in a position to give a final prognosis.<br/><br/>In fatal cases the Scheme provides that qualified dependants of the victim may receive a solatium, currently &euro;30,000, and any vouched out of pocket expenses incurred or suffered by dependents as a result of the death of the victim, i.e. funeral costs, loss of earnings etc.<br/><br/>Finally, the Deputy may be interested to note that a copy of the Scheme and application forms may be accessed on the Department's website at . </p></reply>

The Act stipulates that the Ombudsman Commission is statutorial independent in the exercise of its functions and I have no role in the processing of individual complaints which are referred to it for investigation.</p><p>  Under the Act a complaint can be made direct to the Ombudsman Commission.  It can also be made to the Garda Commissioner, any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a Garda station or a member at or above Chief Superintendent rank at a place other than a Garda station, who will forward it to the Garda Ombudsman.  Complaints to GSOC must be referred for investigation within six months of occurrence of the incident.  However, there is provision for GSOC to extend the time limit if it considers that there are good reasons for doing so. </p><p>  After receiving a complaint the GSOC will determine whether it is admissible. Where a complaint is inadmissible (e.g. the alleged behaviour would not constitute misbehaviour, or the complaint is not made within the required timeframe), the complainant is notified of the reason that it is inadmissible in writing.</p><p>  GSOC may refer less serious complaints for resolution through the Mediation or Informal Resolution process. GSOC directly investigates complaints involving allegations of criminality, and its investigative staff have full police powers to do this.  It may refer other complaints to the Garda Commissioner for investigation under the Garda disciplinary code, and it may maintain oversight of progress in those investigations.</p><p>  GSOC has the authority to make recommendations to the Garda Commissioner concerning disciplinary proceedings, and also to send a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions where it feels that the conduct under investigation may constitute an offence.</p><p>  Under s103 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 the Ombudsman Commission is required to provide the complainant with sufficient information to keep them informed of both the progress and the results of an investigation. I am informed by GSOC that, in cases where they are making a recommendation to the Garda Commissioner concerning disciplinary proceedings, they generally provide complainants with information regarding the nature of the recommendation.</p><p>  GSOC is not empowered to take disciplinary action against a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Under section 26 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 it is the Commissioner who has statutory responsibility for the direction and control of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The application of the Disciplinary Regulations is a Garda operational matter and is the sole responsibility of the Commissioner.</p><p>  The Garda Commissioner is not obliged to implement recommendations made by GSOC and there is no statutory time-period for the Garda Commissioner to deal with such recommendations. GSOC is entitled, however, to be notified of a decision made under the Disciplinary Regulations concerning a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who is the subject of a recommendation. </p><p>  The statistics requested by the Deputy are not readily available and would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort to prepare and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources. GSOC is, however, required under section 80 of the Act to submit an annual report of its activities in the preceding year to me as Minister, and these and other reports from the Ombudsman Commission are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Copies of the 2013 Annual Report are available in the Oireachtas Library and on GSOC's website, www.gardaombudsman.ie. </p></reply>

Currently, there are no plans to implement the changes referred to by the Deputy. </p><p>  The Government is pursuing a strategy of greater co-ordination and co-operation on visa issues with the UK authorities in the context of the Common Travel Area (CTA).  This is exemplified by the launch in China at the end of October of the British Irish Visa Scheme which allows for travel to and around Ireland and the UK on a single visa.   As part of this greater co-operation, the matter of alignment of those States whose citizens are visa required is also being examined.  The greater the extent of alignment between the two jurisdictions, the greater the opportunity to increase the numbers of tourism and business visits to the CTA.   At present, both Ireland and the UK require all citizens of Georgia to be in possession of a visa for travel to their jurisdiction and any proposals for change will also need to be considered in this context.</p></reply>

In this regard I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that all reports of petrol stretching are being followed up as a matter of course and samples of fuel are sent to the State Laboratory for scientific analysis where there is reason to suspect excise duty fraud.<br/><br/>In addition to analysing samples referred to it, the State Laboratory is providing technical and scientific support for the ongoing investigations as the analysis of potentially stretched petrol is a complex one which, to date, has involved a significant level of time-consuming, non-routine testing bearing in mind the sufficient level of evidence required in order to pursue prosecutions in this area. I am also advised that the volume of samples sent for analysis has necessitated a reallocation of resources within the State Laboratory.<br/><br/>In this regard the Laboratory has prioritised the testing of all samples submitted in connection with the petrol stretching issue, and all staff who have the necessary experience and expertise in this area are currently being deployed to work on these samples. If the results of the analysis reveals the presence of any illegal stretching agents, I can assure the Deputy that the Revenue Commissioners take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where feasible. <br/><br/>The practice of petrol stretching is a matter of serious concern to the Government as it results in losses to the Exchequer, threatens legitimate businesses and potentially can cause significant damage to the vehicles of unsuspecting purchasers of adulterated fuel. I can assure the Deputy, therefore, that our law enforcement authorities are continuing to direct their resources to address this issue. <br/><br/><b>No.of complaints  to An Garda Siochana (Western Divisions) of petrol stretching June-December 2014 </b><table><tr><th>Month</th><th>Sligo/Leitrim Garda<br /><br />Division</th><th>Mayo Garda<br /><br />Division</th><th>Galway Garda]<br /><br />Division</th><th>Roscommon/ Longford Garda<br /><br />Division</th></tr><tr><td>June 2014</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>July 2014</td><td>0</td><td>9</td><td>0</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>August 2014</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>September 2014</td><td>0</td><td>105</td><td>0</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>October 2014</td><td>0</td><td>59</td><td>7</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>November 2014</td><td>0</td><td>41</td><td>11</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>December 2014 (as at 10 Dec)</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>0</td><td>222</td><td>21</td><td>65</td></tr></table></p></reply>

However, I can inform Deputy that the number of Fixed Charge Notices issued as a result of detection for speeding by speed camera vans, by county, and by speed limit zone, are set out in the attached table.It should be noted that separate figures for GoSafe safety camera detections and detections by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na camera vans are not readily available.<br/><br/>Insofar as payments received in respect of Fixed Charge Notices issued as a result of detections by GoSafe safety cameras are concerned, I am informed that a total of &euro;18.9m was received in the period November 2010 to the end of June 2014.  This income is retained and off set against the cost of the safety camera contract.<br/><br/>In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, a speeding detection may proceed to court and may therefore result in the imposition of a fine. I have been informed by the Courts Service that from February 2011 to date,  6,911 fines totalling &euro;1,259,288 have been imposed by the Courts in respect of detections relating to GoSafe safety camera vans. 1,184 fines, totalling &euro;286,060,  are overdue by more than 3 months as of 9 December 2014. <br/><br/><b>Details by County and Speed per Km/H of the Number of Fixed Charge Notices as a result of detection by all speed camera vans November 2010 to February 2014 Speed Limit per Kilometre per Hour</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>50 km/h</th><th>60 km/h</th><th>100 km/h</th><th>120 km/h</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>3,129</td><td>1,226</td><td>237</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>6,697</td><td>4,855</td><td>1,466</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>16,087</td><td>8,380</td><td>7,207</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>37,066</td><td>15,872</td><td>16,280</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>8,291</td><td>7,865</td><td>1,928</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>143,344</td><td>172,309</td><td>5,272</td><td>790</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>17,633</td><td>11,722</td><td>2,756</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>3,253</td><td>11,293</td><td>1,159</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>34,449</td><td>11,324</td><td>781</td><td>267</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>11,272</td><td>8,943</td><td>1,226</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>12,601</td><td>1,497</td><td>1,758</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>11,461</td><td>582</td><td>174</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>23,663</td><td>15,876</td><td>2,241</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>3,495</td><td>610</td><td>3,044</td><td>872</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>17,456</td><td>1,480</td><td>2,795</td><td>7,077</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>4,750</td><td>1,481</td><td>1,112</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>15,783</td><td>3,787</td><td>10,597</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>4,709</td><td>1,885</td><td>2,689</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>2,362</td><td>2,443</td><td>603</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>12,831</td><td>8,381</td><td>2,161</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>20,769</td><td>1,934</td><td>730</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>17,114</td><td>888</td><td>1,930</td><td>261</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>9,846</td><td>8,020</td><td>742</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>5,519</td><td>518</td><td>2,399</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>5,617</td><td>10,202</td><td>2,227</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>11,793</td><td>12,863</td><td>11,991</td><td>3</td></tr></table><br/><br/>Figures are provisional, operational and liable to change. </p></reply>

This is a matter of serious concern as petrol stretching, like all forms of fuel fraud, results in losses to the Exchequer, threatens legitimate businesses and potentially can cause significant damage to the vehicles of unsuspecting purchasers of adulterated fuel.<br/><br/>Petrol stretching is an offence under section 102 of the Finance Act ,1999 and carries a penalty on summary conviction of &euro;5,000 or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both. If it is an indictable conviction, the fine is up to a maximum of &euro;126,970 and the prison term is up to a maximum of five years, or both. <br/><br/>It is Revenue's Customs Service which takes the enforcement lead nationally in relation to this issue and the Service is supported in this role by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as required. In this regard I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  that all reports of petrol stretching are followed up as a matter of course and samples of fuel are sent to the State Laboratory for scientific analysis where there is reason to suspect excise duty fraud. <br/><br/>In addition to analysing samples referred to it, the State Laboratory is providing technical and scientific support for ongoing investigations in this matter as the analysis of potentially stretched petrol is a complex one which, to date, has involved a significant level of time-consuming, non-routine testing bearing in mind the sufficient level of evidence required in order to pursue prosecutions in this area.

If the results of the analysis reveals the presence of any illegal stretching agents, I can assure the Deputy that the Revenue Commissioners take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where feasible. <br/><br/>I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as part of Revenue's normal operating procedures, fuel delivery tankers are regularly checked by Revenue's enforcement officers. No cases of contaminated petrol have been identified arising from such checks which were carried out during the period from June 2014 to mid - November. <br/><br/>With regard to details on the number of convictions secured for petrol stretching offences such information is not readily available to me. However, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency,and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. I have, therefore, requested the CSO to provide all available relevant statistics directly to the Deputy.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

It comprises three integrated units: a clinical genetics service; a cytogenetics laboratory and a molecular genetics laboratory. The service is under the governance of OLCHC, which has recently made a decision to discontinue the separate identification of the service as the National Centre for Medical Genetics, in the interest of clarity on governance arrangements. I am assured  that there has been no reduction in the scope of the services provided.</p><p>  There have been rapid and progressive developments in genetics and genomic medicine over the past five years, and it is well recognised as one area of medicine that will continue to rapidly develop over coming years. A recently-commissioned review of the genetic services at OLCHC recommended the development of a plan for a National Genetic and Genomic Medicine Network to reflect best international arrangements for the provision of genetic services. This recommendation has been accepted by the HSE  and a Steering Group to progress it is currently being established. </p></reply>

In January 2014 the Minister for Health announced that following this review, two satellite centres of the new children's hospital would be developed, one at Tallaght Hospital and a second at Connolly Hospital.  These centres will support the children&rsquo;s hospital in the provision of secondary paediatric care for the region and enhance the interface with primary care by local access to emergency and local access to OPD general paediatric services, including rapid access clinics, for local children and young people.  Each centre will provide consultant-delivered urgent care, and secondary outpatient services including rapid access general paediatric clinics. The centres will be under the governance of the new children&rsquo;s hospital, with staff of the main hospital rotating through the centres </p><p>  Design work on the satellite centres is now commencing, with the aim of submitting a planning application for the centres as part of the overall new children's hospital planning application in June 2015.  Subject to planning, work will commence at all three sites in January 2016. Transition of services to the satellite centres is expected to commence in April 2017. </p></reply>

On 26th November last, I endorsed and launched a further three National Clinical Guidelines. Two of the guidelines promote safety and higher standards in maternity hospitals through standardising an early warning system and clinical handover communication tools. These assist the early identification of deterioration and on-going monitoring of the woman&rsquo;s condition. The third guideline specifically aims to tackle sepsis for patients, both adults and children, in the emergency department and in hospital wards. The guidelines were quality assured by the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee and were subject to international peer review. I should also draw attention to the additional funding of &euro;2m which has been provided in the recently published national service plan to address current pressures in maternity services. The measures proposed include the appointment of additional obstetricians, midwives and other frontline staff. An additional consultant obstetrician post will be assigned to Sligo Regional Hospital. In 2015 the HSE will also establish a new National Maternity Office within its Acute Hospitals Division which I hope will drive further improvement in our maternity services. </p><p>  The HSE has advised that improvements continue to be made in Sligo Regional Hospital including:</p><p>  - The introduction of a structured handover meeting with medical staff, from one shift to the next.</p><p>  - The establishment of a Postnatal Communication Process for women who developed severe HELLP syndrome.</p><p>  - Enhancement of the admission and discharge policy for ICU.</p><p>  - The continued development of risk management structures and processes.</p><p>  I believe it is important that we reassure women, and indeed their families, that Ireland continues to be a safe country for a woman to give birth, and our safety record compares favourably with other developed countries.</p><p>  While I have not yet received a request from the family concerned for a meeting, I can assure the Deputy that any such request will be treated with compassion and sensitivity. </p></reply>

This is not a problem that is unique to Ireland. The European Commission's 2012 report, Gender in Research and Innovation, showed that, across the EU Member States, women represented only 20% of professorial staff.</p><p>  The HEA has a specific legislative role in relation to 'promoting the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education'. The Universities Act 1997 and the Institutes of Technology Act 2006 require our higher education institutions to promote gender-balance and equality of opportunity among students and staff, and to prepare and implement statements of policy in respect of equality, including gender equality, across all of their activities. The HEA has a role in reviewing these policies.</p><p>  The HEA also publishes profiles of individual higher education institutions and these provide the framework for the enhancement of data-collection by the HEA across all areas of the mission of higher education, and they will be complemented by the development of a database of staff employed in the sector, empowering us to ensure that gender-equality at all levels within the academic profession in Ireland becomes a reality.</p></reply>

It recognises and rewards skills which cannot readily be assessed through externally assessed written final examinations.<br/><br/>It is essential that students are marked by their own teachers to promote better student learning and improved student outcomes. School based assessment empowers teachers to support the unique talents and skills of the students in their classrooms. It allows for a much more rounded picture of student achievement to emerge.<br/><br/>This combined approach with its external checks and balances will lead to state certification on completion of junior cycle. It will have integrity and validity and teachers will be supported in this change.<br/><br/>This reform is not about protecting systems, it is about improving standards. The integrity of the existing junior certificate will be maintained and improved by my proposal.<br/><br/>The benefits of having teachers assess their own students work, was based on a range of research findings including, for example: <br/><br/>Black and Wiliam, (1998).

In addition, the SEC will be checking a proportion of these marks to ensure consistency, standards and fairness.  This will entail additional costs which will need to be fully explored, in the context of the proposed reform.</p><p>  I will be considering other costs in the context of implementation.

A minimum of 4.5 days CPD will be available to all teachers of English and a minimum of 4 days CPD will be available to teachers of all other subjects.  Additional supplementary CPD in particular areas of interest will also be made available e.g. workshops on teaching film and drama for teachers of English.</p><p>  All schools will also have one day whole-school in-service per year for each year of the roll-out of the JCSA and approval is given for schools to close, subject to Board of Management approval, to facilitate this CPD for all staff.

The EPA has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants, based on data obtained from the 29 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network. <br/><br/>The EPA publishes an annual report on air quality. The most recent report, <i>Air Quality in Ireland 2013 &ndash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality, </i>which is available on the EPA website at , was published in October 2014 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2013, compared to CAFE Directive standards as well as assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health.<br/><br/>Ireland currently meets all EU standards for air quality but exceeds WHO guidelines for particulate matter in some areas. Particulate matter levels are of concern, particularly during the winter heating season in areas where the use of solid fuel is prevalent and the sale of &lsquo;smoky&rsquo; coal is permitted. As a result, levels of particulate matter in smaller towns are often higher than those in cities, where &lsquo;smoky&rsquo; coal is banned. <br/><br/>The EPA also funds research monitoring and the air pollution levels recorded in Killarney by the Environmental Research Institute of University College Cork are part of this research and elaborate the findings of EPA air quality monitoring at local level. Elevated levels of particulate matter were found to occur in Killarney during the winter evenings and this has been attributed primarily to the burning of solid fuel. The research is endeavoring to attribute the level of air pollution to specific fuels, including coal, peat and wood. <br/><br/>The ban on the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of bituminous fuel (or &lsquo;smoky coal ban&rsquo; as it is commonly known) currently applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people bringing the ban areas broadly into line with national EPA air quality management zones. While the ban does not currently apply in Killarney as its population is below the threshold for compulsory inclusion, local authorities may at any time propose new towns for consideration for inclusion under the ban if it is considered necessary to protect local air quality.<br/><br/>While air quality monitoring by the EPA has shown that air quality is poorer in towns where the &lsquo;smoky&rsquo; coal ban does not apply, there is also evidence that smaller ban areas tend to be less effective. The further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the most effective solution to addressing the problem of emissions from residential solid fuel use in these areas. Similarly, the border with Northern Ireland would present enforcement challenges if a national ban on smoky coal were unilaterally introduced. However, it is recognised that having different regulations between urban and rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for citizens in different locations.<br/><br/>Under the auspices of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC), and in conjunction with the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, my Department has commissioned a study to inform a discussion on policy options to further address emissions from residential solid fuel use on an all-island basis. A final report is due to be presented to the NSMC in May 2015.</p></reply>

It is estimated that Irish consumers spend more than &euro;6bn online annually and this figure is set to almost double by 2020. With up to 70% of Ireland's annual online spend currently going overseas, targeting Irish businesses for online trading is a key jobs and economic imperative. In Ireland today, however, less than 1 in 4 small businesses are selling to customers online.</font><br/><br/><font color="#212121">  To address this challenge, my Department launched a national Trading Online Voucher Scheme in July last, following a pilot in the Dublin area. This is a key initiative under the Government&rsquo;s National Digital Strategy and is included in the Action Plan for Jobs. Working in partnership with Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Office network, the Scheme offers financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500 to small and micro businesses to develop their online trading capability. It aims to get 2,000 small businesses trading online by the end of 2015, </font>as well as catalysing action from other small and medium sized enterprises  <font color="#212121">. The Scheme has the capacity to bring new sustainable Irish jobs to all parts of Ireland. </font><br/><br/><font color="#212121">  Early indications from the Dublin pilot were positive, with companies saying they had experienced or envisaged more sales and were expecting to recruit as a result. More information on this scheme can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at </font><font color="#212121"> and on the websites of each Local Enterprise Office.</font><br/><br/><font color="#212121">  Other initiatives include the WebActivate programme which is operated by the Digital Skills Academy, based at the Digital Hub. It assists Irish businesses to develop their online presence and open themselves up to the advantages of the internet, such as business efficiencies, and access to global markets. The IE Domain Registry also operates the Optimise Fund to assist small businesses to optimise their websites using professional consultancy, experience and insight that might otherwise be beyond their budgets or resources.</font></p></reply>

Prior to the recent change, this offence involved a direct summons to court and the assignment of 5 penalty points on conviction. The provisions in the 2014 Act bring this offence within the fixed charge notice system. An alleged offender will now be issued with a fixed charge notice and, on payment of the &euro;60 charge, will have 3 penalty points assigned to their licence. The driver will, of course, continue to have the option of going to court where 5 points will still apply on conviction.</p><p>  Enforcement of the relevant legislation is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. If a person&rsquo;s NCT test date is imminent, it will be a matter for the Gardai to use their discretion. However, responsibility rests with owners and users of vehicles to ensure their vehicles are in compliance with the law.</p><p>  The Road Safety Authority (RSA) informs me that the NCTS is in a favourable position to deal with current demand and the Authority has also run a campaign over the past few months, to get people to book early, as the test may be undertaken up to 90 days in advance of the due date without affecting the expiry date of the new certificate. This system, is to ensure that owners have ample time to have their vehicle tested before their current NCT certificate expires. </p><p>  The National Car Testing Service (NCTS) is currently experiencing a strong demand as car owners respond to the changes in the application of fixed charges to NCT certificates. This was anticipated and NCTS has recruited in excess of 60 more staff to deal with the additional demand and will have 565 Vehicle Inspectors in place in January, the highest in the history of NCT.</p><p>  The RSA also advised me that the majority of car owners, including those who require an early test, will receive an NCT appointment within 28 days and additional resources have been put in place to help deal with such requests.  I understand from the RSA that the availability of appointments on the NCT website is not a reflection of the total number of slots available to customers. If the person referred to by the Deputy has relied solely on the website booking system, I would suggest that they follow the advice on the NCTS website which clearly advises customers that if they cannot obtain a suitable slot online to contact the NCTS call centre directly on (01) 413 5992.</p></reply>
