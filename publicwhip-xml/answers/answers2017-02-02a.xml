Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, have to be completed before payments can issue.  These checks have been completed in the majority of cases and 2016 payments totalling over &euro;120m have already issued to farmers under these Schemes.</p><p><b>GLAS</b></p><p>The number of farmers active in GLAS is almost 37,500, of which 25,825 are in GLAS 1 and 11,667 in GLAS 2.  Almost 20,000 farmers in GLAS 1 and almost 8,700 farmers in GLAS 2, have successfully completed the GLAS prepayment checks in respect of the 2016 scheme year and a first payment instalment of 85% has issued.  The balancing payment due to farmers who have received 85% of their 2016 payment will issue later in the year when the last of the required on the spot inspections has been initiated. </p><p>The most recent payments issued on the 30 January 2017 and further payments will issue on  a weekly basis as files clear the required checks.  To comply with governing regulations and strict European Union audit requirements it is absolutely clear that all administrative checks must be passed and eligibility conditions met before payment can issue.</p><p>I would also point out that 2016 has been an exceptionally busy year for the GLAS Scheme as an additional 11,500 farmers were processed to approval in GLAS 2 and a further 14,000 new applications were submitted under Tranche 3 and are currently being processed to approval stage with a view to increasing the overall numbers in the scheme to in excess of 50,000 scheme participants from 1 January 2017.  I acknowledge that payment targets have not been fully met, with 3,000 GLAS 1 and almost 6,000 GLAS 2 payments remaining to be fully processed, this is due mainly to unanticipated outcomes of the checks required to be carried out on each application.  Available resources are being maximised including the availability of overtime to expedite the processing of outstanding payment files.</p><p>Outstanding payments under both GLAS 1 and GLAS 2 are delayed due to a variety of reasons including the declaration of incompatible parcel usage on the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) application for a chosen GLAS action; changes in parcel boundaries on which a GLAS action is chosen including splitting or merging of parcels; an applicant no longer claiming a parcel on their 2016 BPS; incomplete documentation such as incorrect information on Low-Emission Slurry Declaration; incomplete interim commonage management plans and incompatible data and parcel history on Department databases.</p><p><b>AEOS</b></p><p>Just over 8,615 farmers in the Agri Environment Options Scheme are due a payment in respect of 2016.  A payment has issued to 6,020 AEOS farmers with almost 2,600 remaining to be paid.  </p><p>As in GLAS, AEOS 2016 payments are issued in two parts with an advance payment of 85% and the remaining 15% issuing thereafter.  </p><p>Outstanding payments under AEOS 2 are largely delayed due to rechecks which must be completed on payments made for all scheme years before the final contract payment can be processed.  Outstanding payments under AEOS 3 are delayed by stocking density checks - farmers had until 31 December 2015 to meet their stocking density on commonages and a density check must be completed before payment can issue.</p><p>Payments under both AEOS and GLAS will continue to issue on an ongoing basis as issues are resolved and cases are cleared for payment.</p></reply>

One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers.  The Scheme was developed in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), which has confirmed that AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank will distribute the loans, making &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%.  It will provide farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  This loan scheme forms part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility, which I announced as part of Budget 2017.  Along with tax measures and farm payments, it will alleviate some of the pressures being caused by the recent market difficulties, which have been compounded by the uncertainty around Brexit.</p>  <p>  The loans will be available to all livestock farmers, tillage farmers, horticulture producers (including mushroom growers) and others involved in primary agricultural production (including poultry producers).  The loans will be for amounts up to &euro;150,000 for up to six years.  The interest rate at 2.95% will represent a significant saving for farmers when compared with other forms of short term unsecured finance currently available.  The loans will be flexible with interest only facilities of up to three years.</p>  <p>  The SBCI has demonstrated its commitment to the agriculture sector and has worked with my Department to get this product to the market in a timely manner.  I welcome the participation of the main banks, which will ensure nation-wide coverage for the scheme.  The fact that most farmers will have an existing relationship with the participating banks should facilitate the loan application process.  Normal lending assessment criteria will apply although the loans will be &lsquo;unsecured&rsquo; in nature, thereby facilitating a more straightforward application process.  Potential applicants should note that the loans will be dispersed on a &ldquo;first come, first served&rdquo; basis and will need to be allocated by late summer 2017 to comply with the requirements attaching to the EU funding. </p>  <p>  The number of farmers that will benefit will depend on the size of the loans.  Loans are for amounts up to &euro;150,000 but there is no minimum loan amount specified.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-02a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020200055#WRA02300"><p>I am acutely aware of the potential risks and challenges that arise in the agri-food sector from the Brexit vote, and have been taking steps both to mitigate the short-term impact and to prepare for the longer-term implications that are likely to arise in areas such as tariffs and trading arrangements, and border controls and certification requirements.   </p>  <p>  The question refers to the most immediate impact of the vote, which has arisen from the effects of the fall in the value of sterling against the euro, with sectors such as mushrooms and forestry particularly exposed due to their high dependence on the UK market.  </p>  <p>  In this regard it is noteworthy that Bord Bia estimates that the overall value of  agri food exports increased by 2%, to a record &euro;11.15 billion in 2016, despite a reduction of approximately &euro;356 million in the value of such exports to the UK.  The proportion in value of exports to the UK declined from 41% in 2015 to 37% in 2016, but this was offset by increased exports to other EU and third countries. </p>  <p>  Without diminishing the critical importance of the UK market to the Irish food sector, it is heartening to see that progress is being made on increasing the share of exports to other markets.  I have provided additional resources to Bord Bia in both 2016 and 2017 to assist it in its efforts to promote Irish Food and I will be engaging in a number of trade missions in 2017 to help industry to  increase the profile of Irish food and build business relationships in overseas markets. </p>  <p>  I will be visiting Saudi Arabia and UAE at the end of this month, and in 2016 I lead missions to China the Far East and North Africa to promote the trade agenda.</p>  <p>  In the UK, I have met with the CEOs of major multiples and with political counterparts to assure them that Irish companies remain determined to occupy a prominent position as suppliers of high quality product on UK supermarket shelves. </p>  <p>  In parallel with this work, my department is engaged in efforts to obtain access to new markets for Irish agri food products and to simplify certification and trading conditions in countries to which we already have access.  I am currently considering a reconfiguration of this work to intensify these efforts. </p>  <p>   At farm level, my Department and its agencies have implemented a range of measures, a new low-interest agri-cash flow fund of &euro;150m, a number of agri-taxation measures, and increased funding for the Rural Development Programme, to mitigate the impact of Brexit and improve the competitiveness of Irish agriculture. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that these efforts will continue, and that progress will be monitored on an ongoing basis and in consultation with affected sectors, including through my Department&rsquo;s Consultative Committee of Stakeholders on Brexit and the All Island Civic Dialogue.</p></reply>

It poses enormous challenges for the Irish agri-food sector as a whole including the fisheries sector.  However, potentially, depending on what the UK seeks to do, there are additional and unique challenges for our fishing industry<i>. </i></p><p>Fish stocks are a shared resource managed under the Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union.  Nearly all of the main commercial stocks upon which the Irish fisheries sector is reliant are shared to some degree with the UK.  In addition, many of our traditional fishing grounds lie within UK waters.  Any change to the existing situation could have very serious negative consequences for our fleets. </p><p>My Department, together with its agencies and stakeholders, has been considering all of the potential impacts, looking at the areas where the greatest risks will arise and on which we will need to focus when the negotiations begin.  Ensuring that our fishing interests are reflected in the overall EU negotiating position will be a key priority. </p><p>I have established a dedicated Brexit unit in my Department, and a consultative committee of stakeholders has been convened in order to ensure a full exchange of information as negotiations proceed.  My Department also organised a dedicated Civic Dialogue on the Impact of Brexit for the Seafood Sector which was held yesterday.</p><p>This was an excellent and well attended engagement dealing with all of the potential issues and we will continue to have an ongoing dialogue with key stakeholders.</p><p>My officials are in constant contact with their counterparts in the European Commission and just last week met with the Director General of Fisheries to impress upon him Ireland&rsquo;s key interests in the upcoming negotiations.</p><p>I will remain in close contact with fisheries stakeholders as the issues develop and work with them and my fellow fisheries Ministers in the EU to ensure that we are all fully prepared for what are likely to be extremely complex negotiations.</p><p>While fisheries was not specifically on the agenda for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s recent meeting with Prime Minister Rajoy, the excellent bi-lateral relationship we hold with Spain was discussed and it was agreed that we will continue to work closely together in the coming period.  The Taoiseach was pleased to have Prime Minister Rajoy's assurance that we share the objective of constructive negotiations towards a close future relationship between the EU and the UK.</p></reply>

This reflects the level of co-operation that exists between all stakeholders and the genuine efforts by all concerned to put in place workable solutions where difficulties arise.  I do, however, expect that over the coming months, as Commonage Management Plans are further developed, to see a number of referrals to the committee in instances where some shareholders may have difficulty in achieving their individual minimum stocking requirements.</p>  <p>  Commonage represents a significant proportion of all lands declared annually for the purposes of the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and other direct payments.  Approximately 7% of all land declared annually on BPS by 14,000 separate farmers is commonage, with over 6,500 already participating in GLAS 1 or GLAS 2.  This figure is expected to rise to in excess of 9,000 in 2017 as a further 2,700 commonage farmers who have applied for GLAS 3 are approved into the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  The basis for payment under GLAS is in respect of actions which are above the baseline requirements for the Basic Payment Scheme.  This requires a Commonage Management Plan for all GLAS shareholders farming commonages greater than 10 hectares in size.  This  will mean an individual stocking requirement for each shareholder and a move to the management of the commonage under GLAS by means of a single Commonage Management Plan, where shareholders work together to manage the grazing effort and any other actions required (for example to conserve habitats or bird species).  In recognition of this, the rate of payment for commonages has been increased from &euro;75/ha under the previous Rural Development Programme to &euro;120/ha for the current Rural Development Programme 2014 - 2020.</p></reply>

Therefore the selection of cases for inspection, while commencing after the closing date for receipt of applications, i.e. 15th May for the 2016 Scheme year, is an on-going process so as to ensure this specific regulatory requirement is adhered to.  Furthermore as amendments to applications could be accepted by my Department up to 10th June 2016, the details of the land to be subject to the inspection could not be finally established until this period has elapsed.    </p>  <p>  The process of a remote sensing inspection involves a comprehensive review of the satellite imagery received at three stages during the year to ensure that the actual claimed area in the application form corresponds to the area farmed by the applicant, that the crop types are as claimed and that ineligible land or features are not included for payment purposes.  The verification of crop types is of particular significance in relation to the ensuring compliance with Crop Diversification requirements for the Greening Payment.  The governing regulations further prescribe that where it is not possible to make an accurate determination on the eligibility of a parcel or parcels of land by means of an assessment of the available imagery, a field visit must be undertaken to verify the position on the ground. </p>  <p>  As the commencement of a remote sensing inspection is dependent on the receipt of and processing of a range of satellite imagery throughout the year it is not possible to give a definitive commencement date for an inspection.  For the 2016 scheme year my Department commenced receiving final remote sensing inspection results from the beginning of September, with results for 99.7% of the selected cases having been received by mid December.  Results for the majority of the remaining cases have now been received with a very small number of cases still outstanding.  My Department is prioritising the processing of all outstanding cases and cases continue to be finalised to payment stage on a daily basis.</p></reply>

One of the key elements in coping with these challenges is ensuring that there are sufficient markets for Irish beef.  A strong demand for meat, including beef exists globally, and figures from the European Commission's most recent Short Term Outlook for meat markets showed a 2.1% projected growth of per capita beef consumption for 2016.</p>  <p>  While we exported approximately 97% of our beef exports in 2016 to the UK and EU, I am acutely conscious of the importance of growing third country markets as a valuable outlet for any increase in Irish beef production.  Indeed, this is a crucial component of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  Very significant progress has been made in this regard in recent years, and my Department is currently in the process of securing beef access to a range of third countries including China, South Korea, Ukraine, Thailand and Vietnam.  This builds on the opening of some major markets in the last two years including the US, Canada and Japan.  This is a vital means of providing our beef sector with as many commercial opportunities as possible for Irish beef in addition to our traditional European markets.</p>  <p>  I am also very conscious of the vital role that live exports play in providing an alternative market outlet for Irish farmers, especially in an environment where the number of calf births has increased, as in recent years.  The opening of the Turkish market for live cattle exports in 2016 has been a good example of this, with approximately 20,000 live cattle exported there over the course of the last few months.  I also note that exports of live cattle to Libya have recommenced, which is a positive and welcome development.  My Department is also currently actively examining the possibilities of bilateral health certificates for the export of cattle to Kazakhstan and Montenegro and for breeding cattle to Morocco.  I remain actively committed to ensuring that Irish beef producers have the option of exporting to as many markets as possible.</p>  <p>  One of my priorities now, particularly in the context of Brexit, is to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drink internationally.  We are after all an exporting nation, with 90% of our food produce leaving the island.  For this reason I led a major trade mission to four Asian Countries in September of last year and one to Algeria and Morocco at the beginning of November.  I will also be leading a trade mission to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates at the end of February.  Only through further increasing our footprint internationally will we help to mitigate the effects of Brexit and develop our agri-food sector to realise its full potential. </p>  <p>  My Department and state agencies such as Bord Bia will continue to work to ensure that any increase in production from the Irish beef herd can deliver a viable return to the primary producer.  I allocated additional funding to Bord Bia in Budget 2017 for the specific purpose of dealing with the impact of Brexit which will help to support Irish food and drink exports in 2017.  This, in addition to the opening of a new office by Bord Bia in Singapore this year, will ensure that exports of Irish beef are promoted effectively to provide viable export markets for any increases in Irish beef production.  Bord Bia has been very proactive in recent years in its promotion of Irish Beef in Europe and further afield and this work allied to our trade mission promotional work will help to ensure there are a growing number of viable markets open to Irish beef this year and into the future. </p></reply>

As such, the review of the potential impact on the agri-food sector, including the beef sector, that has been conducted by my Department, remains valid, in that it has taken into account the possibility of a so-called &lsquo;hard&rsquo; Brexit.</p>  <p>  The extent of the East-West and North-South trading relationships, and the fact that the UK is the natural first step for agri-food businesses moving into the exporting arena for the first time, means that the agri-food sector is particularly exposed not only to the more short-term impacts arising from the fall in the value of sterling against the euro, but also to the medium-long term impacts that will arise from changes to the EU-UK trading relationship, to regulations and standards, to origin labelling, to border controls and certification, and to the related areas of veterinary and health certification.</p>  <p>  The Government remains very focused on supporting the agri-food industry, and the beef sector, through the challenges ahead.  I will continue to consult with the industry as the negotiations develop, and I will continue to press Ireland's case for continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures.</p></reply>

A young farmer is defined as a farmer aged no more than 40 years of age in the year when they first submit an application under the Basic Payment Scheme and who commenced their farming activity no more than five years prior to submitting that application.  A new entrant to farming is defined as a farmer who commenced their agricultural activity during the previous two years and did not have any agricultural activity in their own name and at their own risk in the five years preceding the start of the present agricultural activity. </p>  <p>  The Regulations governing the operation of the National Reserve also include an optional provision whereby Member States may use the National Reserve to allocate new entitlements or give a top-up on the value of existing entitlements for persons who suffer from a &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo;.  Support for such categories can only be considered once the two mandatory categories of young farmer and new entrant have been catered for.  Decisions regarding the eligibility of farmers under the &lsquo;specific disadvantage&rsquo; category of the National Reserve require the approval of the EU Commission.  Ireland successfully negotiated the inclusion of a group of farmers commonly known as &lsquo;old young farmers&rsquo; as a specific disadvantage group under the 2015 National Reserve.</p>  <p>  A group commonly known as the &lsquo;Forgotten Farmer&rsquo; group comprises farmers aged under 40, who established their holdings prior to 2008, and who hold no or low value entitlements and also consider themselves to be a category of specific disadvantage.  Preliminary analysis carried out by my Department shows there are some 3,900 farmers in this category.  An estimation of the cost of increasing the value of existing entitlements to the National Average for these 3,900 farmers stands at over &euro;12 million.  The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to further pursue the category of &lsquo;forgotten farmers&rsquo; at an EU level.</p>  <p>  In the context of negotiations with the EU Commission in relation to the &lsquo;Old Young Farmer&rsquo; specific disadvantage category Ireland notified the Commission that there were other categories of farmers who may also require consideration as suffering from a &lsquo;specific disadvantage&rsquo;.  The Commission notified Ireland that any application for a specific disadvantage category of the National Reserve may only be made to the EU Commission in the context of the operation of the National Reserve for that year. </p>  <p>  In 2015 the National Reserve fund was based on a 3% cut to the Basic Payment Scheme financial ceiling and provided some &euro;24 million in funding which was the maximum financing rate available under the relevant EU Regulations.  There was no National Reserve in 2016 as all available funding had been utilised under the 2015 scheme.  In order to provide for a National Reserve in 2017 funding is required to replenish the Reserve.  EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that funding for the replenishment of the National Reserve may be obtained by means of surrender of entitlements that remain unused by farmers for two consecutive years and by claw-back derived following the sale of entitlements without land.  It is envisaged that funding derived from these two sources in 2017 will be very limited.  The Regulations also provide for the option of applying a linear cut to all farmers' entitlements to fund the National Reserve. </p>  <p>  Consultation between Department officials and the Direct Payments Advisory Committee comprising members of the main farming organisations, agricultural education and farm advisory bodies takes place annually as part of the decision making process for the National Reserve.  Decisions relating to the availability of a 2017 National Reserve can only be made following determination of available funding and the consultation process involving the Direct Payments Advisory Committee.  This advisory group is due to meet shortly in relation to the 2017 National Reserve.</p></reply>

In the short-term, the impact of the fall in the value of sterling against the euro is one that is already being  felt, while in the longer-term we will have to deal with the significant challenges that will potentially arise from  changes to trade and tariff arrangements, the introduction of border controls, certification requirements, and from the loss of the UK contribution to the EU budget.  There are also very significant and complex implications for the fisheries sector. </p><p>From an agri-food perspective, and given the importance of the UK market for the sector, our demand will be for continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal  customs and administrative procedures, and to keep the UK market viable for Irish producers by minimising the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries. </p><p>In fisheries, we want to maintain current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal and protect Ireland&rsquo;s quota share for joint fish stocks.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to progress its analysis of the likely implications of Brexit, and to further its engagement with stakeholders, UK and Northern Ireland counterparts, Member State colleagues and European institutions. </p><p>The steps taken to date include:</p><p>- a dedicated Brexit unit has been established to co-ordinate all activities;</p><p>- a Brexit Response Committee comprising  all relevant Department divisions is now active;</p><p>- A Stakeholder Consultative Committee has been established;</p><p>- Brexit has been added as a standing item to the agenda of the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee,</p><p>- Close consultation with Bord Bia, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Enterprise Ireland is ongoing - significant additional resources were allocated to Bord Bia and BIM in Budget 2017 in order to provide Brexit-related supports to affected companies;</p><p>- Other Budget 2017 supports for the sector included a new &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme, agri-taxation measures, and increased funding under the Rural Development Programme and Seafood Development Programme;</p><p>- The Department is feeding into the overall Government response being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach;</p><p>- I hosted an All Island Civic Dialogue on 15 December, to which interested stakeholders from both sides of the border were invited.  It focused on dairy, cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry.  Two further events are planned for 1 February (Fisheries) and 8 February (other agri-food sectors); </p><p>- DAFM officials are engaging closely with their NI counterparts through the NSMC and bilateral meetings, including on specific areas of co-operation; </p><p>- Political engagement with NI and UK counterparts has also increased, including through my own recent meetings with NI Minister Michelle McIlveen and UK SoS Andrea Leadsom (most recently in Berlin on 22 January 2017).</p><p>- At EU level, I am in regular contact with counterparts on the margins of AgriFish Council meetings, and arrangements are currently being made for formal bilateral meetings with key Member States, including France, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and forthcoming EU Presidencies Estonia, Bulgaria and Austria in the coming weeks;</p><p>- My Department's network of agriculture attaches is also engaged as appropriate in agri-food-related Brexit follow-up through the Embassies in London, Paris and Geneva, and Ireland's Permanent Representation in Brussels;</p><p>- I have also spoken regularly to Commissioner Hogan (most recently on 26 January 2017), and officials have taken part in meetings with the Commission and the Barnier Task Force (most recently on 24 January 2017).</p><p>- On the market front, I have met with the CEOs of major UK retailers and I have provided an additional &euro;1.6 million for Bord Bia in 2016, and &euro;2 million in 2017, to assist it in its efforts to promote Irish food.  My Department is also active on third country markets with a view to developing new business opportunities for Irish food companies.  In that context, I will be leading a Trade Mission to Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates at the end of this month. </p><p>All of the Department&rsquo;s ongoing activities will continue to be informed by the need to secure the best possible outcome for the Irish agri-food sector.

Following a very productive meeting I subsequently initiated a number of responses to address key issues raised by stakeholders. </p><p>As I set out at the Forum, one of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers.  So I was pleased to announce the launch of the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo; on Tuesday. </p><p>The Scheme was developed in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), which has confirmed that AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank will distribute the loans, making &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at low-cost interest rates of 2.95%.  It will provide tillage farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p><p>As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, I also confirmed that advance payments would be made in 2016 in respect of the Basic Payment and Greening Payment schemes.</p><p>Advance payments commenced on the 17 October last, the earliest possible date by which payments can begin under the governing EU Regulations, with the addition of balancing payments from the 1 December. </p><p>To date <b>&euro;1,174 billion</b>has been paid out to 123,199 farmers and payments are ongoing.  Payments of <b>&euro;198,722 million </b>have also been made to 93,000 applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints scheme. </p><p>In my concluding remarks to the stakeholder forum of last October, I reiterated my view that in the changing international economic landscape we need to take a fresh look at our tillage industry to ensure that it is best positioned to withstand future challenges and to avail of new opportunities which may present themselves. </p><p>The Forum is therefore an opportunity to explore and build such opportunities, as well as addressing the challenges.  As I stated in the D&aacute;il just over a week ago, I plan to convene a further meeting of the stakeholder&rsquo;s forum and which I can confirm to the House will occur on the 16th of February next.  This Forum will provide an opportunity for all to work together to evaluate further measures for the longterm sustainability of the tillage sector.</p></reply>

Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular.  In accordance with this development, Brexit has now been added as a standing item to the agenda of the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee.</p>  <p>  In terms of the European dimension to our response, additional funding that I have provided to Bord Bia - including through Budget 2017 - has been used to support market diversification efforts by companies through its Market Intensification Programme, which was launched in late October 2016, and to support promotional campaigns for Irish beef in Germany and the Netherlands.</p>  <p>  In addition, Bord Bia has been providing information to companies on how to establish a presence in other EU countries, and using its network of offices to build long-term relationships in those markets, including through participation in trade fairs.  It has also recently opened a new office in Warsaw to expand its support in Eastern Europe, and in Singapore to service eight emerging markets in South East Asia).</p>  <p>  Looking beyond Europe, Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.  Again, Bord Bia has been intensifying its work in these markets, and has opened a new office in Singapore to service eight emerging markets in South East Asia.</p>  <p>  In keeping with these priorities, I led a Trade Mission to China and Singapore in September 2016 and at the same time Minister Doyle led a Trade Mission to Vietnam and South Korea in September 2016.  In November I also led a trade mission to Morocco, which was extended at senior official level to include Algeria.  Earlier in 2016, senior officials accompanied a Bord Bia trade mission to Iran, and travelled on to Turkey and met with officials to discuss the opening of trade in live animals, which was subsequently secured.</p>  <p>  I will lead a further Trade Mission to the Gulf Region at the end of February.  This will cover the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  My Department is currently working with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland to finalise the arrangements for this mission, which will include participants from across the agri-food sector, and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as political discussions with my counterparts in the host countries.</p>  <p>  The mission will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  It will also promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products in the Gulf region.</p>  <p>  I am also considering a range of other destinations for the remainder of 2017, although no decision has yet been made in terms of content or timing.  Again, markets in Asia, Africa and America are likely to feature prominently in these considerations, and I am of course ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.</p></reply>

A young farmer is defined as a farmer aged no more than 40 years of age in the year when they first submit an application under the Basic Payment Scheme and who commenced their farming activity no more than five years prior to submitting that application.  A new entrant to farming is defined as a farmer who commenced their agricultural activity during the previous two years and did not have any agricultural activity in their own name and at their own risk in the five years preceding the start of the present agricultural activity.</p>  <p>  The Regulations governing the operation of the National Reserve also include an optional provision whereby Member States may use the National Reserve to allocate new entitlements or give a top-up on the value of existing entitlements for persons who suffer from a &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo;.  Support for such categories can only be considered once the two mandatory categories of young farmer and new entrant have been catered for.  Decisions regarding the eligibility of farmers under the &lsquo;specific disadvantage&rsquo; category of the National Reserve require the approval of the EU Commission.  Ireland successfully negotiated the inclusion of a group of farmers commonly known as &lsquo;old young farmers&rsquo; as a specific disadvantage group under the 2015 National Reserve.</p>  <p>  A group commonly known as the &lsquo;Forgotten Farmer&rsquo; group comprises farmers aged under 40, who established their holdings prior to 2008, and who hold no or low value entitlements and also consider themselves to be a category of specific disadvantage.  Preliminary analysis carried out by my Department shows there are some 3,900 farmers in this category.  An estimation of the cost of increasing the value of existing entitlements to the National Average for these 3,900 farmers stands at over &euro;12 million.  The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to further pursue the category of &lsquo;forgotten farmers&rsquo; at a EU level.</p>  <p>  In the context of negotiations with the EU Commission in relation to the &lsquo;Old Young Farmer&rsquo; specific disadvantage category Ireland notified the Commission that there were other categories of farmers who may also require consideration as suffering from a &lsquo;specific disadvantage&rsquo;.  The Commission notified Ireland that any application for a specific disadvantage category of the National Reserve may only be made to the EU Commission in the context of the operation of the National Reserve for that year. </p>  <p>  In 2015 the National Reserve fund was based on a 3% cut to the Basic Payment Scheme financial ceiling and provided some &euro;24 million in funding which was the maximum financing rate available under the relevant EU Regulations.  There was no National Reserve in 2016 as all available funding had been utilised under the 2015 scheme.  Therefore there was no opportunity to consider any specific disadvantage groups under a 2016 National Reserve Scheme. </p>  <p>  In order to provide for a National Reserve in 2017 funding is required to replenish the Reserve.  EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that funding for the replenishment of the National Reserve may be obtained by means of surrender of entitlements that remain unused by farmers for two consecutive years and by claw-back derived following the sale of entitlements without land.  It is envisaged that funding derived from these two sources in 2017 will be very limited.  The Regulations also provide for the option of applying a linear cut to all farmers' entitlements to fund the National Reserve. </p>  <p>  Consultation between Department officials and the Direct Payments Advisory Committee comprising members of the main farming organisations, agricultural education and farm advisory bodies takes place annually as part of the decision making process for the National Reserve.  Decisions relating to the availability of a 2017 National Reserve can only be made following determination of available funding and the consultation process involving the Direct Payments Advisory Committee.  This advisory group is due to meet shortly in relation to the 2017 National Reserve.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Young Farmer Scheme is the only other measure which specifically caters for Young Farmers under Pillar 1 of the CAP.  Under EU Regulations the Young Farmers Scheme is available only to young farmers who are setting up an agricultural holding for the first time or have set up such a holding during the five years preceding the first submission of the Basic Payment Scheme application.  There is no &lsquo;specific disadvantage&rsquo; category under the Young Farmers Scheme.  Therefore this scheme is not available to young farmers who commenced their farming activity prior to 1 January 2010.</p>  <p>  It is a requirement of the Young Farmers Capital Investment Scheme of TAMS II that the farmer must have been set-up in farming within a period of five years from the date of application for support.  However, young farmers who do not meet this requirement are being given priority under the other TAMS II Schemes available.</p></reply>

Movements are recorded at the level of Member State only on TRACES. </p>  <p>  Figures from TRACES show that over the course of 2016, a total of 432,316 sheep were imported from the UK.  This compares to a total of 169 from all other territories from which Ireland imported sheep last year, namely Belgium, France, Spain Germany and the Netherlands.</p>  <p>  As of 30 January this year, a total of 40,920 sheep have been imported to the Republic from the United Kingdom.  This represents a drop of approximately 14% when compared to January of 2016. </p>  <p>  While I have stated already that TRACES does not allow for the breakdown of movements within Member State level, figures from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) in Northern Ireland show that a total of 394,439 sheep were exported into Ireland direct for slaughter in 2016 and 50,204 sheep were exported to farms in Ireland in 2016.  There are no comparable figures available in relation to 2017 yet.</p>  <p>   There are no similar figures available for imports from Scotland, however it is clear that the vast majority of the total imports of sheep from the UK originate from Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  I am very much conscious of the range of factors which impact on the livelihood of sheep farmers.  The Programme for a Partnership Government made a commitment to the introduction of a scheme for sheep farmers under the Rural Development Programme with a budget of some &euro;25 million to be made available in Budget 2017.  This Sheep Welfare Scheme, which was launched successfully by my Department last December, was followed up with a series of strongly attended public meetings held by officials from my Department on the scheme in the last number of weeks.  I am glad to report that applications are currently being received by my Department in high numbers on a daily basis.</p>  <p>  The scheme provides a support of &euro;10 per ewe to farmers for undertaking actions which make positive contributions to the welfare of flocks.  Regarding the design of the scheme, I was conscious that the differing challenges faced by sheep farmers in lowland and hill areas would need to be taken into account and I believe we have successfully struck this balance.  The end product reflects the extensive consultations which were carried out by my Department with a range of sectoral stakeholders, particularly farm organisations last year, in addition to intensive discussions with the European Commission. </p>  <p>  The scheme represents a clear acknowledgement of the contribution which the sheepmeat sector makes to the Irish Agri-Food sector, which in 2016 saw an increase in exports of sheepmeat of 3% in volume and 4% in value terms to approximately &euro;240 million.  In addition, the sector supports some 35,000 farm families directly, as well as providing several thousand jobs indirectly in rural areas.  This new Sheep Welfare Scheme, in addition to the existing supports available to sheep farmers under the BPS, GLAS, TAMS and ANC schemes, will make a vital contribution to ensuring the continuing viability, prosperity and sustainability of the sheep sector in Ireland.</p></reply>

My Department will be engaging with the Commission and with other Member States through this initial phase and throughout the negotiation process. </p>  <p>  Commissioner Hogan has indicated his intention to follow up the consultation with a stakeholder conference in July, and to present a communication on the future CAP in November of this year.</p>  <p>  The future of the CAP is an issue of enormous importance for the agriculture sector in Ireland and across Europe.  The CAP has evolved considerably and very effectively in recent years, in response to changing market, consumer and environmental demands.  It also plays a central role in delivering the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth sought under the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>  <p>  It is important that the CAP continues to evolve in a way that supports the achievement of European priorities, particularly in the context of securing a strong CAP budget for the post-2020 period.  This can only be achieved by reinforcing the relevance and effectiveness of the policy in helping to achieve broader societal goals. </p>  <p>  My Department is conducting a detailed policy analysis on the future shape of the CAP, taking into account what we see as the key challenges ahead.  These include:</p>  <p>  - the need to support the sustainable growth of food production, in order to meet the requirements of a growing global population while at the same time facilitating adaptation to climate change and mitigation against further change;</p>  <p>  - the need to implement modern and innovative measures to help mitigate the impact of increased global market volatility, including that caused by geopolitical issues, on farmers' incomes;</p>  <p>  - the need to more effectively promote and support generational renewal.</p>  <p>  On sustainability, I think we need to consider ways in which we can support sustainable intensification of food production in a more coherent and focused way than is currently the case.  This would involve a more holistic approach, for example by being clear about our objective - production of more food in an economically and socially sustainable way - and then identifying measures which allow us to achieve this objective.  Our Beef Data and Genomics Programme is a good example of how we can simultaneously enhance both sustainability and production efficiency, and I think can serve as a model for future approaches.  Similarly, our support for knowledge transfer initiatives, which help to encourage on-farm innovation in the drive towards more sustainable forms of production, is something that can be built upon by the future CAP. </p>  <p>  In terms of helping farmers to build greater resilience in the face of market volatility, I think we need to consider the use of more modern, and more innovative, measures.  There have been some interesting developments in recent times in the areas of fixed price contracts, futures markets and hedging arrangements, and I think we need to further explore these, and other, measures that encourage farmers to make provision for volatile incomes.  </p>  <p>  We are of course at a very early stage in considering the shape of the future CAP.  I will participate actively in the debate, which will begin to intensify over the coming months at Council level.  I very much welcome the Commission's public consultation, which will make an important contribution to the process.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role on labelling of products is focussed on ensuring that such labelling conforms to a number of regulatory requirements such as mandatory country of origin labelling (COOL) where it applies to food products on sale in retail outlets here. </p>  <p>  On waste policy I am informed that all packaging is managed under the EU Packaging Directive and implemented in Ireland under the European Union (Packaging) Regulations 2014.  The Directive  &ldquo;aims to harmonise national measures concerning the management of packaging and packaging waste in order, on the one hand, to prevent any impact thereof on the environment of all Member States as well as of third countries or to reduce such impact, thus providing a high level of environmental protection, and, on the other hand, to ensure the functioning of the internal market and to avoid obstacles to trade and distortion and restriction of competition within the Community&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Extended Producer Responsibility is a concept where manufacturers and importers of products should bear a significant degree of responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products throughout the products lifecycle.  Producer Responsibility Initiatives (PRIs) allow producers to devise schemes that have the capacity to fulfil the basic objects of waste management legislation.  Repak is the Producer Responsibility Organisation for Packaging in Ireland and their members pay fees based on the amount of packaging they place on the market.  It is therefore of financial benefit  for members of Repak to minimise the amount of packaging they place on the market in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Repak also employ an expert team of Packaging Technologists to assist companies in optimising their packaging systems and to prevent packaging waste, in line with their Producer Responsibility obligations.  Repak Technologists work directly with companies to identify areas where packaging waste can be prevented or minimised.  On-site surveys are carried out and 'Packaging Optimisation Reports' are compiled that guide member companies through the opportunities they have to improve their packaging systems and to reduce their packaging waste.  This saves material and money for the companies involved, and in turn helps to reduce the overall amount of packaging placed on the Irish market.</p></reply>

The decision of the UK to leave the EU has brought this into sharper focus, and indeed, Brexit is now a standing item on the agenda of the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee.</p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.  The value of exports to emerging markets in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central/South America stood at almost &euro;2.2 billion in 2015.  The value of trade to these markets increased by 82% in the period 2010 to 2015.  Exports to these markets now accounts for 21% of total food and drink exports compared to 16% in 2010.  This growth in share of exports occurred during a period when total food and drink exports jumped by more than 45%.</p>  <p>  Growth to emerging markets has been led by Asia, with trade growing by more than 250% to &euro;955 million over the period 2010 to 2015.  This has been led by China, which recorded a fourfold increase.  Exports to other Asian markets more than doubled over the period, to &euro;300 million.  Trade to Africa grew by more than 50% over the period, to &euro;535 million.  Exports to the Middle East jumped by a third, to &euro;380 million.  Trade to Central/South America was 60% higher, at &euro;91 million in 2015.</p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025, Minister Doyle and I led Trade Missions to Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore and China in early September 2016.  I also led a trade mission to Morocco in early November.  During the year senior officials also led missions to Iran, Turkey and Algeria.  This was done in co-operation with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland.  There were also participants from the agri-food sector on these missions. </p>  <p>  I will lead a Trade Mission to the Gulf Region at the end of February.  This will cover the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  My Department is currently working with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland to finalise the arrangements for this mission, which will include participants from across the agri-food sector and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as political discussions with my counterparts in the host countries. </p>  <p>  The mission will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  It will also promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products in the Gulf region.  I am also considering a range of other destinations for the remainder of 2017, although no decision has yet been made in terms of content or timing.  Again, markets in Asia, Africa and America are likely to feature prominently in these considerations, and I am of course ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.</p></reply>

While not addressed in a discrete piece of legislation, or one formal agreement, both jurisdictions have made administrative and legal provisions over many years as necessary to give effect to its operation.  Of particular note, insofar as Irish legislation is concerned, are the long-standing provisions in Irish law whereby UK nationals are not treated as 'aliens' or 'non-nationals' for the purposes of immigration law (most recently provided for in the Immigration Act 1999 and the Aliens (Amendment (No.2) Order 1999), as well as the provisions governing the exercise of entry controls whereby an Irish immigration officer can refuse permission to enter the State to a non-national if the immigration officer is satisfied that the person intends to travel (whether immediately or not) to Great Britain or Northern Ireland and would not qualify for admission there if he or she arrived there from a place other than the State (section 4 (3) (h) of the Immigration Act 2004).  Also of note are the provisions both jurisdictions made following Ireland's exit from the Commonwealth in 1948 which facilitated the continued enjoyment of reciprocal rights and privileges for citizens of both jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Protocol 20 to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union recognises that "the UK and Ireland may continue to make arrangements between themselves relating to the movement of persons between their territories (the Common Travel Area)".  Operation of the Common Travel Area takes full account of EU law and, while it is Ireland's intention to maintain and enhance cooperation with the UK in relation to general immigration and border enforcement following its exit from the UK, Ireland of course remains a committed member of the European Union and will continue to uphold the right of free movement for all EU citizens after the UK 's departure.</p></reply>

The first involves Judicial Review cases currently before the High Court taken by two applicants who were refused compensation as neither had been resident in one of the 12 specified institutions provided for under the Scheme.  That case is ongoing.  The second involves a formal review being undertaken by the Office of the Ombudsman into the administration of the Scheme by the Department of Justice and Equality and the issue underlying this review is, again, the inclusion of an institution not covered under the Scheme.  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment on either of these &lsquo;live&rsquo; issues as to do so would serve to prejudice the respective ongoing consideration processes.</p>  <p>  I will take this opportunity to give some background to the operation of the Ex Gratia Magdalene Restorative Justice Scheme.  To date, over &euro;25 million has been paid out to 669 women under the Scheme.  The Scheme remains open to new applications but it is important to note that decisions have been made on all of the 819 applications made to date.  The difference between that figure and the 669 payments made is accounted for by refusals and for other reasons including probate cases, applicants still considering provisional offers, and the application of the Assisted Decision Making Act, 2015 in relation to those women who lack the necessary capacity. </p>  <p>  The redress scheme was set up following the publication of the report in February, 2013 of an Inter-Departmental Committee set up to establish the facts of the State's involvement with the Magdalen Laundries.  It was chaired by then Senator Martin McAleese and it is commonly referred to as the McAleese report.  The material in the Report relates to 10 different institutions which were run by 4 different Orders of nuns over a period of 70 years. </p>  <p>  Although there was no finding in the McAleese Report which indicated that the State had any liability in the matter, following the report&rsquo;s publication the Taoiseach issued a State apology to the women.  Mr. Justice Quirke was asked by the Government to make recommendations on an appropriate redress scheme for those who were in the 10 Magdalen laundries that were the subject of the McAleese Report.  The Government also included in the scheme the laundry that was attached to Stanhope Street Training School and later also decided to include a 12th institution, the Training School in Summerhill.</p>  <p>  The Scheme provides for lump sum payments varying from &euro;11,500 to &euro;100,000 depending on the length of stay in the institution concerned.  Further, each woman is entitled to a top-up payment to bring her weekly income from the Irish State up to the equivalent of the Irish Contributory Pension in recognition of the fact that they were not paid for the work they did while in the laundries.</p>  <p>  Moreover, the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015 provided for certain services to be made available by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to the women.  The services, which are free of charge, include GP services, prescribed drugs, medicines, aids and appliances, dental, ophthalmic and aural services, home support, home nursing, counselling services, chiropody, podiatry and physiotherapy.  The HSE has administrative arrangements in place for health and social services for women living outside Ireland.</p></reply>

The Committee took the view that a ground landlord's ground rent is a form of property right which is constitutionally protected and that abolition of such rents would be unconstitutional in the absence of adequate monetary compensation.  The Committee also noted that where leases were approaching expiry, any legislation providing for the abolition of ground rents would have to provide for the payment of enhanced compensation by the ground tenant.</p>  <p>  In light of the foregoing, I have no immediate plans to implement further measures in this area but operation of the existing statutory framework is, however, kept under review by my Department.  Moreover, as the Deputy will appreciate, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any individual case.</p></reply>

While most cases are now generally processed within six months, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established specifically for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, with a further 152 attesting today.  To date 66 of these probationer garda&iacute; have been assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Division.  I am informed by the Commissioner that another 750 trainee garda&iacute; are scheduled to attest this year which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across all Garda Divisions.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will benefit all areas of Garda activity.</p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the following table the information requested by station from 2006 to 31 December 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available from the Commissioner.</p><p><b>GARDA STRENGTH DMR NORTH DIVISION</b><table><tr><th>STATION</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th></tr><tr><td>MALAHIDE</td><td>37</td><td>35</td><td>34</td><td>34</td><td>30</td><td>29</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>SWORDS</td><td>84</td><td>77</td><td>77</td><td>74</td><td>70</td><td>65</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>COOLOCK</td><td>120</td><td>117</td><td>114</td><td>112</td><td>109</td><td>103</td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td>LUSK</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>BALBRIGGAN</td><td>68</td><td>70</td><td>69</td><td>64</td><td>62</td><td>64</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>GARRISTOWN</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr></table>*Coolock, Malahide and Swords Garda stations form the R District which comes under the DMR North Division.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in this jurisdiction.  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs supply and works closely with dedicated Divisional Drugs units and other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.

As the Deputy will also be aware, the allocation of judicial resources and the scheduling of court cases is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the judiciary who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  The President of the Circuit Court has been very helpful as regards consideration of dedicated new court  arrangements for repossessions and the option and implications of use of pre-existing legislative powers to implement a system of specific court sittings for repossessions at specific venues on specific dates.  This is being pursued at present between my Department and the Courts with a view to possible new arrangements for the Easter law term where appropriate and having regard to constitutional constraints.  Furthermore the Government, at its meeting of 6 December 2016, decided to reassign, by appointment, three specialist judges of the Circuit Court as ordinary judges of the Circuit Court to fill three existing vacancies and so there are currently no vacancies in the Circuit Court.  The Department is actively involved in discussions, including with the judiciary and Courts Service, as regards what progress can be made on introducing the proposed dedicated arrangements for mortgage arrears cases which I hope to bring to Government for consideration in the near future.<br /><br />A key element of the commitments in the Programme for Government is, as the Deputy will also be aware, putting in place a national mortgage arrears resolution service and priority was given last year to getting the new national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service (Abhaile) up and running and this was formally launched last October. The service, which forms part of the Programme for Partnership Government commitments on mortgage arrears, ensures that people who are at risk of losing their home have access to free independent financial and legal advice and assistance.  The objective is to help these homeowners to identify and put in place solutions to their mortgage arrears, with priority to helping them remain in their home wherever possible.<br /><br />The Abhaile service is available through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) helpline and MABS offices across the country.  Homeowners who are at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears, including those facing repossession proceedings, can contact MABS which will provide support and advice.  Support available includes in-house dedicated Mortgage Arrears advisers in MABS offices across the country, specifically to assist and negotiate with financial institutions on the borrower's behalf.  MABS can also provide access to free independent financial advice and assistance on personal insolvency and bankruptcy from a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP), and to free independent legal advice from a solicitor, under a 'voucher' system.  The advice and assistance is provided by a PIP or solicitor from expert panels, established under the Scheme respectively by the Insolvency Service of Ireland and by the Legal Aid Board.  The service also includes free support and assistance at Circuit Court repossession court lists country-wide, with MABS court mentors in attendance to provide help and advice to borrowers attending, and a 'duty solicitor', from a Legal Aid Board panel, to provide legal assistance in court to unrepresented borrowers in repossession proceedings.  The scheme also offers legal aid to borrowers seeking the new Personal Insolvency court review under the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015.  Over 4,100 vouchers have been issued under the Scheme up to 27 January 2017.<br /><br />A further key element related to the power of a court to impose mortgage arrears solutions for those in arrears and it is critical to note that use of the key statutory provision allowing for imposition of debt solutions involving a mortgage, where the solution has been rejected by the creditors, is increasing due to the availability of the Abhaile service since last October.  I am referring to the &quot;section 115A&quot; procedure put in place under the 2015 Personal Insolvency legislation which allows the Circuit Court, in defined circumstances, to impose a personal insolvency arrangement (PIA), on application from the debtor, where the proposed arrangement has been rejected by the creditors.<br /><br />I would also like to point out to the Deputy that early indications, while based on small initial samples, suggest that the new Abhaile service is reaching those most at risk of losing their homes, and particularly the cohort of those who are in mortgage arrears equivalent to 720 days or more.  They also suggest that access to free, independent expert help, and to statutory protection against creditor pressure for those who are engaging, is a significant relief for those at risk, and that independent advice is identifying solutions which offer better outcomes for the homeowner, often enabling them to remain in their homes.  Representative outcome data for the Abhaile Service is not yet available, but this information is being tracked and collected, and full analysis will be available at a later date.</blockquote><p>My Department, together with the Department of Social Protection, leads both operational oversight and governance steering groups for the new Abhaile service and its effectiveness and impacts are being closely monitored as part of these processes, whilst my Department also continues to pursue the remaining aspects of the Programme for Government commitment with a view to further implementation measures in the next three months.</p><p>Furthermore, I wish to underline to the Deputy as outlined above that the establishment of a dedicated new court to sensitively and expeditiously handle mortgage arrears and other personal insolvency cases continues to be examined by my Department, including the identification of any necessary legislation, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, having regard to the constitutional and legal aspects arising.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Garda Reserve on 31 December 2016, the latest date for which figures were readily available was 695, and in the Dublin Metropolitan Region the strength was 208. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner in relation to the delivery of the commitment to double the Reserve to 2,000 and what steps might be taken to ensure that the expanded Reserve is used to best effect in support of visible policing.  In this regard I am informed that the Garda Reserve Management Office is undertaking an audit of the experience and skills of Reserves which, when completed, will assist Garda management in considering the future role to be played by the Reserve.  Work is also underway on the development of a recruitment plan with the objective of recruiting and training 300 new Reserves annually starting this year, to bring the strength of the Reserve up from its current strength of 695 members to 2,000 by 2021.  As part of the planning process, I understand that the Office is examining the possibility of recruitment at the regional or divisional level, rather than centrally, and also the manner in which the training is delivered.</p></reply>

The document sets out, among other things, the requirement that family reunification should not be an undue burden on the public purse.  Economic considerations, therefore, are a necessary part of family reunification policy.  Reflecting the balance of interests referred to in the document, sponsors will have to achieve minimum levels of earnings prior to being eligible to sponsor a family member.  The policy is a national policy and does not discriminate on the basis of geography.</p>  <p>  The financial thresholds will rise significantly where the application is made in respect of a dependent elderly parent.  Any grant of immigration status in such cases will be subject to strict conditions aimed at protecting the public purse.  These will include medical insurance and financial guarantees.  Given the level of risk, which cannot be fully mitigated by undertakings of financial support by family members, the financial thresholds for earnings to support an elderly dependant relative must be high enough to meet the foreseeable expense.  Obviously, health and medical costs which are not geographically dependent increase significantly for older persons and factors such as potential future nursing home costs also need to be taken into account.  Therefore, a sponsor of an elderly dependent relative will be required to have earned, in each of the 3 years preceding the application, an income after tax and deductions of not less than &euro;60K in the case of one parent and &euro;75K where two parents are involved.  Where the elderly dependent relative has a guaranteed income into the future this can be used to partially offset the financial limits.</p></reply>

Their objective is to identify, where possible, measures which might be implemented to contribute to a reduction in the risk of deaths in the future.  In addition, the National Suicide and Harm Prevention Steering Group chaired by the Director General, Irish Prison Service, provides a forum for collating the reports of the local Suicide Prevention Committees and disseminating significant findings throughout the prison system. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has also advised that a comprehensive training programme in Mental Health Awareness is being delivered to all staff within the prison service to deal with persons in custody who present with mental health difficulties.</p>  <p>  All prisoners on committal to prison, receive a comprehensive health assessment which includes a risk assessment for mental health issues.  Management interventions to ensure the prisoners safety including recommendations on accommodation within the prison, observation levels to be conducted on the prisoner, increased healthcare inputs, and any other specific measures that may be appropriate are implemented to reduce the risk in individual cases.  In such cases, further assessments are undertaken by the in-reach mental health services, and a multi-agency approach to deal with prisoners needs.

Prisoners on approved temporary release programmes are not entitled to payment of the daily gratuity as they are not required to return overnight to the prison.</p>  <p>  The daily gratuity allows prisoners to purchase items from the prison tuck shop during their sentence and/or to save money which may be transferred to family members during sentence, or be used to assist their reintegration on release.</p></reply>

A major focus for the 2017 Forum was the macro economic outlook for the European, Asian and North American economies and impacts for financial services.

Additional themes included risk-pricing and bank-financed growth, asset management in a near-zero interest rate environment, unpicking the Blockchain conundrum, and promoting diversity in financial services.  </p><p>The EFF had 24 domestic and international speakers which included President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Jin Liqun; Blackrock Vice Chairman, Philipp Hildebrand; and Credit Suisse Vice-Chair of the Board of Directors (&amp;amp; Chair of the British Bankers' Association), Noreen Doyle among others.

It set out a vision for payments, including universal acceptance of electronic forms of payment, robust and reliable payment systems, and migration from cash and cheques to cards and electronic payments.</p>  <p>  Under the National Payments Plan, Ireland made significant progress including full migration to the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) with the result that credit transfers and direct debits paid from anywhere within SEPA are as fast and as reliable as those made domestically.  Rounding of 1c and 2c coins was rolled out nationally from October 2015 and has been generally welcomed.</p>  <p>  All of the major banks now issue debit cards.  Usage is continuing to increase and debit card payments exceeded cash withdrawals for the first time in 2015.  Most debit cards now have contactless capability and the contactless payment limit is now &euro;30.  In December 2015, interchange rates were reduced to make card acceptance more attractive for retailers and Ireland now has one of the lowest rates of interchange fees on debit cards in the EU.  Stamp duty on debit cards was reformed with the effect that stamp duty was removed and replaced with a 12c charge per ATM transaction.  There are no charges for debit card transactions.  No consumer will lose out as a result of this change as the stamp duty was capped at the previous level of &euro;2.50 or &euro;5, depending on card type. </p>  <p>  The measures recommended under the National Payments Plan were designed to ensure that the payments environment here facilitates increased adoption of more efficient payment methods.  The EU is creating a single market for payments across the Member States and my Department is now working on transposing EU measures on payments.  The Payment Accounts Directive was transposed in September 2016 and it ensures access to a payment account with basic features for anyone who does not have a payment account.  The revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which is due in 2018, will further open the EU payment market for companies offering consumer or business-oriented payment services based on access to payment accounts and ensure a level playing field for both existing and new players.</p>  <p>  The work done as part of the National Payments Plan not only positions Ireland to take advantage of what is happening at European level but also allows actions on payments to be developed as part of the IFS2020 strategy.  The IFS2020 Action Plan for 2017, published last week, contains several measures designed to grow jobs in the payments sector.</p></reply>

The data in the Household Credit Market Report are for 2015 and do not reflect changes to loan balances and house prices since December 2015.  The Central Bank estimates that 15 per cent of PDH loans and 26 per cent of BTL loans were in negative equity at end December 2015. 10 per cent of PDH and 14 per cent of BTL loans were deemed to be in negative equity and performing.</p><p>I would also refer the Deputy to the Central Bank Report on Mortgage Arrears, produced in response to a request from me to the Governor and published on 16th December and which may be viewed at <i>http://www.finance.gov.ie/what-we-do/banking-financial-services/publications/reports-research/report-mortgage-arrears-2016.  </i>This report includes an analysis of loan level data submission up to June 2016, including estimates of the proportion of PDH accounts currently in the legal process that were in negative equity.</p><p>In the mortgage market overall, the numbers in negative equity have been reducing and this has important implications for the wider economy such as improving mobility amongst those affected, potential greater spend on home improvements and maintenance, and increased consumption via the wealth effect. </p></reply>

This has been primarily achieved by customers engaging directly with their banks and agreeing a sustainable payment plan which allows the customer an achievable path out of arrears, as well as protecting the value of the loan for the bank.  In the vast majority of cases this achieves the best outcome for all involved. </p><p>Despite this progress, the level of NPLs in the Irish banking sector remains well above the European average.  Hence the SSM has tasked the management and board of each institution with developing and implementing a strategy to address this challenge.  In recent years banks have introduced multiple engagement channels to facilitate those customers who are reluctant to engage directly with them.  Having exhausted these initiatives, if meaningful engagement is not forthcoming from particular customers the bank may be left with no option but to look at alternative solutions which could, as a last resort, include the sale of the loan.</p><p>As the deputy is aware, in the case of AIB the relationship between the Minister for Finance and the bank is governed by a Relationship Framework Agreement which can be found here:</p><p><i></i>.  I would point out to the deputy that there are only a small number of matters which require Ministerial consent such as the appointment of the CEO and Chairman of the Bank.  The disposal of loans is a commercial decision for the management and Board of each individual institution and is not subject to Ministerial consent, as I have no role in the day-to-day commercial and operational decisions of any of the banks' in which the State has a shareholding. </p><p>The Relationship Framework Agreement also sets out the criteria for determining which matters require Ministerial consultation which include 'material' matters and states that a matter should be deemed 'material' if &quot;it is an acquisition, investment or disposal other than in the ordinary course of business and the total purchase price, investment or proceeds is likely to exceed &euro;100 million&quot;.  Therefore if the bank decided to sell a loan book with a value over &euro;100m then I, as Minister, would need to be consulted. </p></reply>

The Central Bank sought to conduct a broad examination of tracker mortgage-related issues covering, among other things, transparency of communications with and contractual rights of tracker mortgage borrowers.</p><p>This review is currently underway, and the Central Bank is working with the banks to conduct a comprehensive examination of customer mortgage accounts with regard to tracker rates, including any instances where banks may have failed to deliver on their obligations to customers.  Such instances may include cases where the bank was not sufficiently clear with customers on their terms and conditions, or where they have failed to honour contractual commitments.</p><p>The Central Bank has laid out a detailed and rigorous process for each institution to follow.  The identification of affected customers, implementation of any appropriate rectification actions, as well as the calculation of any appropriate interest redress or compensation, are all processes currently being worked through by the banks.  The review also involves oversight of each bank's work by an independent third party, and the establishment of an independent appeals process.  Further, the Central Bank continues to review and monitor each institution's progress at every stage.  It is possible that different banks will progress through the review process at different speeds.</p><p>I expect that the Central Bank, and each of the institutions involved, will provide information periodically on steps taken and progress made.  The tracker mortgage review is an ongoing process involving the banks, their regulator and any affected customers; I have no direct role in its implementation.  It is therefore not possible, nor appropriate, for me to speculate at this time on the number of customers that may be affected and the Deputy will appreciate that this information is not held in my Department. </p><p>Below is a brief update from each of the banks in which the State is a shareholder:</p><p><b>AIB</b></p><p>&quot;AIB is conducting a comprehensive review of customer mortgage accounts with regard to tracker rates.  This process is ongoing. AIB s review has found the bank fell short on its  obligations to some customers.  In order to prevent further detriment for the customers identified to date, AIB has in the first instance begun correcting interest rates on these accounts and writing to customers to outline their new interest rates and repayment amounts.  Approximately 50% of the impacted customers are EBS and the remainder AIB.  You will note that AIB s CEO Bernard Byrne recently told the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach that, based on an assessment of the work done to date, 14 customers may have lost their homes as a result of having the incorrect rate applied to their mortgage accounts.  AIB is contacting these customers to agree appropriate compensation measures.  The process involved an examination of tens of thousands of accounts and is being conducted in accordance with Central Bank of Ireland guidelines.  As the review progresses, AIB is commencing refunds to customers who overpaid interest and is paying compensation.  Details of a set payment towards the cost of independent professional advice will also be made available to customers and the bank will establish an independent appeals process.  An independent third party, KPMG, is reviewing key aspects of AIB s work.  The overall review will take some time to complete.  AIB has put in place a customer Freephone Helpline 1800 235 460 (Mon-Fri, 8:00am-7:00pm) to assist with any queries its customers may have.&quot;</p><p><b>PTSB</b></p><p>In July 2015, following an enforcement investigation by the Central Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB announced that it had identified 1,152 mortgage accounts which it deemed should be offered the opportunity to move from a variable rate to a tracker mortgage rate because of concerns about the potential impact of administrative failures including the failure to provide full information to some account holders about the consequences of certain choices the account holders were taking earlier in the term of the accounts.  All these accounts were moved to the correct interest rate from that date.</p><p>Following this exercise, the bank commenced a review of all mortgage accounts to identify whether any other errors relating to mortgage accounts required correction and/or redress.  The bank is also cooperating with the Central Bank of Ireland in respect of its industry wide review of tracker mortgages.  The bank will update the market on the progress of these exercises in due course.</p><p><b>Bank of Ireland</b></p><p>In 2015 the Central Bank of Ireland announced that it would conduct a Tracker Mortgage Examination with all lenders in Ireland.  This examination is underway, and Bank of Ireland is co-operating fully with it. On December 16 2016 the bank provided an update on the examination process.  This update is available at: <i>https://www.bankofireland.com/about-bank-of-ireland/press-room/press-releases/item/571/statement-from-bank-of-ireland-regarding-the-central-bank-tracker-mortgage-examination-process/#december. </i></p><p>In respect of the other bank referred to by the Deputy, as I do not have a shareholding in that bank nor a relationship framework agreement with it.  I am therefore not in a position to provide any data for that bank.</p></reply>

There are no plans to re-establish a dedicated training organisation for the sector, but rather to deliver the required education and training through the mainstream higher and further education and training sectors, in line with provision for other sectors.</p><p>The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGSFN) carried out a study on the future skills needs of the sector and the report of the study was published in November 2015.  The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020.  The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth.  The report provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth which is one the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025. </p><p>The Study assesses skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings.  The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020.  A key recommendation in the report was the need to set up of a National Oversight and Advisory Group comprising all the key hospitality stakeholders.  </p><p>Following on this recommendation, the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group was established early last year, chaired by SOLAS for the first year.  To date the group has held seven meetings.</p><p>Membership of the Group includes the Restaurant Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotel Federation, Irish Hospitality Institute, Licenced Vintners Association, Vintners Federation of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Social Protection, Higher Education Authority, Skillnets, SOLAS, ETBs, IoTs, DIT and Quality and Qualifications Ireland.</p><p>The role of the Group is to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the EGFSN and to provide a forum for on-going collaboration in addressing the skills needs of the sector and to identify and progress actions to overcome barriers on its implementation.</p><p>The Group plan to publish a progress report later this year.  To date work has been undertaken on careers promotion via a range of fora, the launch of the <i>Tourism Insight</i>online programme &ndash;aimed at promoting careers in tourism and hospitality with particular reference to transition year and Youthreach participants.  Audits of both higher and further education facilities and courses are underway as well as the establishment of a Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet which aims to address key skills requirements of restaurants and catering companies to help drive the domestic hospitality sector, employment growth, talent attraction and retention.</p><p>Funded through the National Training Fund by my Department, the network plans to design tailored programmes covering all aspects of the restaurant, food and beverage industry to SMEs nationally, with a particular focus on career progression for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings and increase retention levels within the sector and is well placed to address key recommendations of the EGFSN 2015 Report on the Future Skills.</p><p>Last week, I launched the 2016-2020 Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, setting out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period to 2020.  The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals in 2015 and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year, to provide for the needs of all sectors, including hospitality and tourism.  Over the lifetime of the Action Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes representing a doubling of current activity. </p><p>Work is progressing on the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry Education and Training Board.  It is planned that this programme will commence later this year.  The Apprenticeship Council also recently approved development funding for a separate proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship.  The Apprenticeship Council will continue to work with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.  The funding for planned and forecast expansion in 2017 will see an additional &euro;20 million provided.</p><p>In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was begun by SOLAS in collaboration with ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice.  Networks of Employers have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers in identifying training needs, designing the training programmes, recruitment of learners and delivery of the training on and off the job.  The Career Traineeship model of work-based learning is currently being piloted with the Hospitality and Engineering sectors, with the involvement of seven ETBs.</p><p>Given the breadth and range of programmes within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, it is not possible to provide details of funding and places on a county by county basis across specific sectoral provision.  However, one way in which Solas classify FET provision is by the career areas which it serves.  The table on provision in the FET sector, shows the total number of beneficiaries in the career areas of Food and Beverage and Tourism in each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards for 2015 along with that planned for 2016.  As yet, final 2016 figures are not available. </p><p>While it is not possible to give details of expenditure at the level of career areas, the scale of total investment in FET and the numbers served on both a full and part time basis are also included in the table.</p><p>In relation to the number of tourism and hospitality skills training positions within the higher education sector in 2015 and 2016 and the amount of funding allocated for tourism and hospitality skills training in the same years, it is not possible to give a breakdown by county as students can apply for courses throughout the country, through the CAO application process.  However the table on provision in the higher education sector gives a breakdown outlining the number of training positions and the total estimated funding allocated which is categorised by each individual Institute.</p><p>In 2015 the total number of student in higher education courses in this sector was 8,220 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;47.4million and in 2016 the total number of student for the sector was 8,033 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;48.4m.  The funding detailed in this response includes an estimation of grants allocated to these courses, student contribution and free fees.  The student numbers are calculated as full time equivalents (FTE) which includes part time and full time student counts.</p><p>This analysis of the higher education sector includes all courses within the following categories:</p><p>- Tourism/Hotel/Leisure/Event</p><p>- Hospitality &amp;amp; Culinary</p><p>- Heritage &amp;amp; Cultural</p><p><b><font color="#1F497D">  </font></b>I also<font color="#1F497D"> </font>understand that a limited amount of complementary tourism-related business development and training supports are provided by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the agency responsible for encouraging, promoting and supporting tourism as a leading indigenous component of the Irish economy.  However, I have no role or responsibility in relation to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Matters relating to that agency and its training and business supports are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</p></reply>

This to be done, having regard to the published criteria and process for designation as technological university which is already in place.</p>  <p>  The Minister appointed Mr. Michael Kelly to lead the process of consultation.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Michael Kelly Report into the development of a Technological University for the South-East a significant process of engagement and consultation took place with regional stakeholders.  The Governing Bodies of Waterford Institute of Technology and the Institute of Technology, Carlow agreed that the engagement process would be supported by the Institute and the Technological University (TU) Co-ordinator in each Institute provided administrative and logistical support for all meetings.  A total of some 40 meetings were held with groups of stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Stakeholders met included the following:</p>  <p>  Institutes &ndash; WIT and IT Carlow : Governing Body, President and Executive Team, Academic Staff, undergraduate, post graduate and lifelong learning students, Professional and Support Staff, PIB members, Trade Unions [IMPACT, SIPTU, UNITE],  Campus Companies. </p>  <p>  External Stakeholders: Local Authorities, Chambers of Commerce, Employers, Enterprise Development Agencies, Education and Training Boards, Guidance Counsellors, Collaborative Partners, Social and Community Groups, Wexford Group. </p>  <p>  A number of one-to-one meetings also took place with members of the Oireachtas representing the region or at the request of individual stakeholders.  Meetings also took place with a number of the external facilitators or advisors previously linked with the TUSE project.</p>  <p>  The report presented a compelling rationale for a new type of higher education institution to support a &ldquo;step-change&rdquo; in the economic and social development of the entire South-East region.  This is clearly the overwhelming wish of stakeholders in the region.</p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Kelly report, a preliminary facilitation process which was recommended in the Report has been completed.  There was strong engagement in the process by both parties and this facilitation process has been an important building block in terms of building trust between the parties and in developing a strong working relationship between the Presidents and Chairs of both institutions.  As part of this, the Presidents of the two institutions, have jointly developed an initial work-plan to support the development of a joint TU proposal.</p>  <p>  In addition to this both Institutions made a joint presentation and submission to the Higher Education Authority (HEA), seeking funding to underpin the next phase of engagement. This was part of the latest call issued by the HEA regarding the restructuring of the higher education landscape.  The call sought submissions for funding support in respect of the costs arising from mergers as part of the implementation of the National Strategy for Higher Education.</p>  <p>  Arising from the submissions received and subsequent detailed presentations made to the HEA, the TUSE project were allocated a ring-fenced sum of &euro;1.445 Million in 2016 to support the further development of the project.</p></reply>

It has established standards for post-qualification professional practice, as set out in Droichead, the new model of induction and probation for newly qualified primary and post-primary teachers.  The Droichead programme was the subject of a three-year pilot before it was approved by the Council in March 2016.  The programme is being introduced on a phased basis since last September.</p>  <p>  During the growth and development phase of Droichead, teachers employed in a special education or restricted setting must avail of the Droichead programme to achieve full registration with the Council.  </p>  <p>  The INTO issued a directive to its members not to co-operate with or participate in Droichead from 1 July 2016.  This directive has prevented newly qualified teachers employed in special education settings from participating in Droichead since September and thereby closed off the registration pathway.  I hope the INTO will review its approach.</p>  <p>  Under the pay measures which the Department agreed in September 2016 with the INTO it was agreed there would be an immediate time-bound engagement involving relevant parties, to resolve issues with Droichead, including the current directive on non-cooperation.  The INTO has since met with the Teaching Council and the Council undertook a review of Droichead Policy which resulted in a revised Policy being approved by the Council on 12 December 2016.  The revised policy does not change the requirement for teachers in a special education setting to avail of Droichead.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that the INTO have raised the issue of resources to support the implementation of the new policy.  My Department is considering the impact of the new policy adopted by the Council.</p></reply>

This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.</p>  <p>  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, as school will now a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile.  Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations.</p>  <p>  The model will, however, allow for some exceptionality for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The Inclusion Support Service, established under the National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school.</p></reply>

The measures under these four headings will be implemented through the 29 actions contained in the Strategy.</p><p>One of the measures contained in the Strategy is the introduction of a Rent Predictability Measure.  This is a new provision that will moderate the rise in rents in the parts of the country where rents are highest and rising fastest.  In these areas, called Rent Pressure Zones, rents will only be able to rise by a maximum of 4% annually.  The rent predictability measure addresses the major threat to tenant security.  Where tenants cannot afford their rents, their tenancies are not secure and evictions for non-payment of rent may ensue.</p><p>The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 introduced the Rent Predictability Measure with effect from 24 December 2016.  This measure was applied immediately to Dublin and Cork city because they already meet the criteria for a Rent Pressure Zone.  A further 12 Local Electoral Areas were designated as Rent Pressure Zones on 27 January 2017.</p><p>The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 also gives effect to other actions to address tenants&rsquo; security:</p><p>- The abolition of a landlord&rsquo;s right, during the first 6 months of a further Part 4 tenancy, to end that tenancy for no stated ground;</p><p>- The extension of the term of Part 4 tenancies from 4 to 6 years;</p><p>- Where a landlord proposes to sell 10 or more units within a single development at the same time, the sale will be subject to the existing tenants remaining in situ, other than in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>My Department does not hold or collate figures on cases of evictions in the private rented sector.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Acts to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides that rents may not be greater than the market rent.  Market rent is defined in the Residential Tenancies Acts as the rent a willing tenant would give and a willing landlord would take for the dwelling concerned, having regard to the other terms of the tenancy and the letting values of dwellings of a similar size, type, and character and situated in a comparable area.  Tenants may refer a complaint to the RTB where they feel the rent set under a tenancy, either at the start of a tenancy or through a rent review, is in excess of the market rent.  These provisions have effect notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in a lease or tenancy agreement.</p><p>The <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>, published on 13 December 2016, identifies high and rapidly rising rents as the key driver of accommodation insecurity for tenants and a factor in the termination of tenancies.  To address this situation, the Rental Strategy introduced a Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where the imbalance between demand and supply of rental accommodation is driving rent levels upwards most acutely.</p><p>The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 gave effect to, and provided for the immediate implementation of, the Rent Predictability Measure. Areas of the country satisfying the statutory criteria will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones and rent increases in those areas are generally capped at 4% per annum for a period of 3 years.  The measure was introduced with immediate effect in the four Dublin Local Authority areas and in Cork City.  A further 12 Local Electoral Areas were designated as Rent Pressure Zones on 27 January 2017.</p><p>The provisions limiting rent increases in rent pressure zones apply both at the commencement of a tenancy and at each rent review.  In addition, at the beginning of a tenancy, there is a statutory obligation on a landlord in a rent pressure zone to provide a tenant with details of the rent under the previous tenancy of the dwelling, together with a statement as to how the new rent has been calculated.  The purpose of this provision is to allow a tenant to ensure that their rent complies with the legislation.  The existing prohibition on charging a rent above market rent continues to apply in all areas.</p></reply>

Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.  For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a local electoral area within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001.  There is no provision for any other type of area to be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p><p>For an area to be designated a Rent Pressure Zone, it must satisfy the following criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended by section 36 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016):</p><p>(i) The annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and</p><p>(ii) The average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (the National Indicative Rent in the RTB&rsquo;s Rent Index Report)  in the last quarter.  </p><p>Following the enactment of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, the Housing Agency reviewed the rental markets in certain counties nationally and identified nine housing authorities containing electoral areas that could potentially be Rent Pressure Zones.  The Housing Agency consulted with the relevant housing authorities regarding their views on the rental markets, including housing demand and supply, and their experiences in relation to the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), trends in relation to both general housing needs and homelessness and other relevant issues.</p><p>On the basis of this analysis, five housing authority areas were examined in more detail by the Housing Agency to identify local electoral areas with significant rental pressures.  The areas of Galway County, Limerick City and County, Louth and Waterford City and County were excluded by the Housing Agency from this more detailed analysis as the preliminary analysis had indicated that these areas would not currently meet the criteria for designation as Rent Pressure Zones. </p><p>Accordingly, on 24 January 2017 the Housing Agency proposed that 15 Local Electoral Areas in the following five housing authority areas should be considered by the RTB for designation: Cork County, Galway City, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  On foot of the proposal from the Housing Agency, and in accordance with section 24A(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended), I requested the Director of the RTB to make a report to me as to whether these areas met the criteria for designation as Rent Pressure Zones. </p><p>On 26 January 2017, I received a report from the RTB confirming that 12 out of the 15 Local Electoral Areas examined met the criteria.  As required by section 24A(5) of the Act, I made Orders designating the 12 Rent Pressure Zones on 26 January 2017.  The Orders came into effect on 27 January 2017.  Details of the areas that met the criteria and have been designated as Rent Pressure Zones are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i></i>.</p><p>The Local Electoral Areas of Cobh, Maynooth and Greystones were found not to meet the criteria.  </p><p>Under the Act, I have no further role or discretion in proposing areas for designation as Rent Pressure Zones or in deciding whether they should be designated.  The designation process is independent and based on clear objective criteria and quantifiable evidence.  </p><p>The Housing Agency will continue to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation.  Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as rent pressure zones.  </p></reply>

The duty of care provisions have been augmented by the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 and associated regulations.  Any person who considers that his or her treatment system constitutes, or may constitute, a risk to human health or the environment is responsible for having any necessary remediation works carried out without delay.  The Act assigns responsibility to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to make a National Inspection Plan (NIP) for domestic wastewater treatment systems and neither I nor my Department has any direct role in monitoring the implementation of the plan by the local authorities.  </p><p>Local authorities carry out inspections of septic tanks and similar systems for a variety of reasons, including water quality issues at drinking water sources or within designated shellfish or bathing water catchments and arising from reports of pollution from members of the public.  Separately, inspections are carried out based on the EPA&rsquo;s <i>National Inspection Plan 2015-2017: Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems</i>, which uses a risk-based methodology for the selection of systems for inspection, taking into account factors such as densities of individual treatment systems across the numerous hydrological and geological settings in Ireland and the locations of sensitive groundwater or surface water receptors.  Selection of treatment systems for inspection under the EPA&rsquo;s plan is carried out by the local authorities using an IT system developed by the EPA.  Householders cannot request inspections of their own treatment systems.  It is a matter for the local authority, using the systems available to it, to select relevant septic tanks for inspection.</p><p>The Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2013, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, brought into operation a grants scheme to assist with the cost of remediation of septic tanks and domestic waste water treatment systems which are deemed, following inspection under the EPA&rsquo;s National Inspection Plan and the subsequent issue of an Advisory Notice by the local authority, to require repair or upgrading.

The strategy is structured around 4 key areas: security, standards, supply and services.  The measures under these four headings will be implemented through the 29 actions contained in the Strategy. </p><p>In terms of supply, the focus in the strategy is on maintaining existing levels of rental stock and encouraging investment in additional supply.  The overarching objective of the strategy is to increase supply and support the development of a stable, strong and viable rental sector offering true choice for households, investment opportunities for providers and reflecting the rights and responsibilities of tenants and landlords.</p><p>There are shortages in the supply of rental accommodation in key locations, particularly in urban areas.  In some of these areas there is also significant demand for transitory short-term accommodation.  In this context, easier access to short term rentals at higher prices may be an attractive option for landlords.  However, a recent determination by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in a particular case has determined that the exclusive use of a residential apartment for short-term holiday lettings is a material change of use requiring planning permission. </p><p>My Department has, by way of Circular letter PL12/2016 of 22 December 2016, brought this determination to the attention of all planning authorities to ensure that they are aware of:</p><p>- the grounds on which the Board reached its decision,</p><p>- the planning implications in terms of the requirement for such commercial use of residential units to be the subject of an application for planning permission, and</p><p>- the importance of a proactive approach to planning enforcement generally in this regard. </p><p>A copy of the Circular letter is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i></i></p><p>The implications of this case have raised a number of regulatory and other related issues, such as tax liability, residential tenancy regulation, support for tourism, and planning.  The issue was considered in the preparation of the recently published Strategy for the Rental Sector and, with a view to providing more information on the scale and nature of the issue and full clarity regarding the appropriate regulatory approach to be adopted by relevant statutory authorities in relation to short-term tourism-related lettings, my Department, as provided for in the strategy, is establishing a working group, comprising representatives of relevant stakeholders including local authorities, relevant Departments, public bodies and other interests in the area, to consider the disparate issues involved and report in Quarter 2 2017. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-02a.393.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020200063#WRJ03000"><p>I am very much aware of the public concern highlighted by the recent publicity surrounding defined benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  The provision of occupational pensions in this country is on a voluntary basis and depends on the willingness of employers to contribute to, and maintain schemes for their employees.  Traditionally, many such schemes were organised on a defined benefit basis.  However, in recent decades defined benefit provision has been under pressure because of volatility in the stock markets and increasing liabilities arising from demographic pressures, low interest rates, and regulatory requirements.  Accountancy standards, which make pensions liabilities very apparent on a company's balance sheet, also contribute to the pressures under which defined benefit schemes are operating.  During the financial crisis the decline of defined benefit pension schemes accelerated to the extent that the whole pension sector was possibly at risk. </p>  <p>  As a consequence of all these factors, the movement from defined benefit to defined contribution schemes has become a feature of the pensions landscape, even in cases where firms are very profitable. </p>  <p>  Almost all defined benefit schemes have a rule that allows the employer to cease contributions, usually after a notice period.  There is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions and no further liability on the employer where contributions cease.  Where changes to these schemes are being sought by employers, I am strongly of the opinion that they should first engage in discussions with the trustees and employee representatives.  The introduction of a debt on employer would raise a range of issues including possible negative consequences for defined benefit schemes, some of which may not be beneficial for members. </p>  <p>  Neither the Minister for Social Protection nor the Pensions Authority has the power under legislation to intervene to freeze the winding-up of a scheme or to compel the employer to make contributions to a scheme.  However, over the last number of years the Government has amended pension legislation to protect the pension sector and to ensure fairer and more equitable outcomes for all scheme members.  These changes make more resources of the scheme available in the initial distribution of assets to active and deferred scheme members. </p>  <p>  At this stage, further regulation may only serve to add to the pressures on defined provision and could be counterproductive. </p>  <p>  While there are strong arguments for the introduction of greater employer obligations, it is also the case that doing so now could result in certain less desirable side effects.  These could include prompting well-funded schemes to wind up to avoid new obligations; threatening a company&rsquo;s financial stability; rendering some employers insolvent; and/or giving a competitive advantage to employers who either never provided a pension and/or put defined contribution schemes in place. </p>  <p>  While I have no immediate plans at this stage to bring forward amending legislation to enhance the provisions in the Pensions Act in relation to defined benefit schemes I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department and the Pensions Authority are closely monitoring developments in the DB sector and keep the need for legislative change under continuous review. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through Pathways to Work to ensure that as many of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register, and in particular the long-term unemployed. </p><p>Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, long term unemployment continues to fall.  The most recent data show that unemployment has fallen from a peak of 15% in 2012 to 7.1% in January 2017.  The long-term unemployment rate peaked at 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling to 4.2% in Q3 2016.  At the latter date, the long-term unemployed accounted for 52% of all those unemployed, down from almost 65% in early 2012.  The number of long term unemployed in Q3 2016 was 92,300; this compares to 204,300 in early 2012.  Long-term unemployment fell by 18% during 2016, faster than the overall fall in unemployment of 13%.</p><p>Looking forward, in the context of <i>Pathways to Work 2016-2020</i>, one of the high-level targets adopted by the Government is to decrease long-term unemployment to 2.5% by 2020.  Targets were not set for intermediate years.  However, it seems clear based on the most recent developments in the labour market that the target for 2020 is now likely to be achieved or indeed improved on.</p><p>A set of milestones and metrics have been developed as indicators of progress in addressing the challenges and delivering on <i>Pathways to Work 2016-2020</i>.  Progress on milestones and metrics are published on the Department of Social Protection website and the metrics themselves will be reviewed and updated on an annual basis to reflect the key challenges and issues being addressed under this strategy each year.  The relevant data for 2016 targets and outcomes are set out in Table 1.  Many of these will directly or indirectly impact upon the reduction of long-term unemployment over the period of the strategy to 2020. </p><p><b>Table 1: Pathways To Work Measures/Metrics and 2016 Targets</b><table><tr><th>Measure/Metric</th><th>2016 Target Performance</th><th>2016 Performance (Actual)</th></tr><tr><td>Move 50,000 long term unemployed at the start of 2016 into employment by the end of 2020</td><td>20,000</td><td>26,000</td></tr><tr><td>Reduce the persistence rate (the rate at which short term unemployed people become long term unemployed) by 25% from 27% to 20% by the end of 2018</td><td>24%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Increase the exit rate of people on the Live Register for two years or more by 30% (to 52%) by the end of 2018</td><td>44%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Fully implement the JobPath programme and refer at least 60,000 long term unemployed people to JobPath in 2016</td><td>60,000 referrals to JobPath</td><td>70,000 referrals</td></tr><tr><td>Double the number of employers signed up to the Employment and Youth Activation Charter</td><td>300 new employers</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td>Reduce the ratio between youth and overall unemployment from 2.2:1 to less than 2:1 by the end of 2017 (EU average = 2.2:1)</td><td>2.1:1</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Increase the engagement frequency for one-to-one meetings for Low PEX and LTU clients from 6 meetings per year to 12 meetings per year</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Target an aggregate progression to employment rate across activation programmes of 40% (measured 6 months after completion of programme)</td><td>40%</td><td>N/A</td></tr></table></p><p>I have set out new objectives for 2017 to build on this progress: </p><p>- Help another 20,000 people move from welfare into work;</p><p>- Develop a Working Family Payment to make work more attractive for families currently on welfare;</p><p>- Implement an Action Plan for Jobless Families to zero in on long-term unemployment;</p><p>- Launch a new work experience programme to replace the JobBridge scheme that was closed in 2016;</p><p>- Recalibrate labour activation schemes like CE and T&Uacute;S to focus on those farthest from the labour market;</p><p>- Intensify our engagement with employers and boost the take up of JobsPlus, and the Wage Subsidy Scheme for employees with disabilities;</p><p>- Promote and make access to the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance easier;</p><p>- Work with other Government Departments to overcome the barriers to work including the cost of childcare, transport, education and housing;</p><p>- Increase the number of employers participating in the Department&rsquo;s long-term unemployment and youth activation charter to over 600.</p><p>The <i>Pathways to Work 2016-2020</i>strategy continues to prioritise support for the long-term unemployed.

Given that this is a major change in the social protection system, significant adjustments to operational systems and processes will be required to support this measure. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the measure will come into effect in December 2017 and apply to those satisfying the conditions of the scheme from that date.</p>  <p>  I trust that this provides clarity on the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

JobPath is one of a range of activation supports, including schemes such as Community Employment (CE), catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers.</p>  <p>  When referred to the JobPath service, the intention is that the client would work with the Personal Advisor to overcome barriers to employment and to obtain and sustain employment.  Jobseekers are supported through the service for 12 months, have access to supports while in employment (for up to a period of 12 months) and can be referred to education or training programmes/courses as appropriate.   </p>  <p>  CE Schemes provide long-term unemployed people with part-time experience as a stepping stone back to employment.  However, they are not full-time sustainable jobs.</p>  <p>  In order to manage the allocation of activation support places effectively the Department does not facilitate or encourage jobseekers to leave the JobPath service early in order to take up a place on such a scheme.  After 12 months with the JobPath service however, and if at that point the client is not undertaking an education or training programme or has not secured employment, the Department will arrange for the client to progress onto the most appropriate intervention thereafter.  The JobPath service is therefore an element of the overall activation service being delivered by the Department. </p>  <p>  It is a legislative requirement that people in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance must participate in such employment services or schemes as the Department deems appropriate.  A failure to engage with any employment service or scheme can result in the application of sanctions, but all decisions regarding a person&rsquo;s welfare entitlements are taken only by Department officials and not by the JobPath companies.  The process for sanctioning clients who do not engage with the JobPath activation process is exactly the same as the process for clients who fail to engage with the Department&rsquo;s own activation service. </p>  <p>  The primary goal of the Department&rsquo;s employment services is to move people from unemployment to full and sustained employment.  As I am sure you will appreciate, it is not always possible to find employment that matches individual expectations. </p>  <p>  The initial data on the impact of the service is encouraging, showing high satisfaction levels among clients of the service, and that people who engage with the service are more likely to secure employment than those who do not.  The results of an independent customer satisfaction survey recently undertaken (JobPath Performance Data Report, which is published on the Department&rsquo;s website) indicates that jobseekers feel that they are receiving a good service, and that JobPath has improved their chances of securing employment. </p>  <p>  The department continues to monitor the delivery of the service and will publish performance data on a quarterly basis this year. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

On Budget Day, I was pleased to announce a number of important measures which will benefit the self-employed. </p>  <p>  From March 2017, the self-employed will have access to the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearings aids.  Treatment benefit entitlements will also be extended from October 2017 so as to provide further dental and optical benefits (these improvements will benefit both the self-employed and employees).</p>  <p>  More significantly, self-employed contributors will be eligible for the Invalidity Pension from December 2017.  For the first time, this will give the self-employed access to the safety net of State income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability without having to go through a means test.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed.</p>  <p>  The self-employed will also benefit in 2017 from the further increase in Earned Income Tax Credit announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, as well as the extension of entrepreneurship supports.  These measures are all part of the Government&rsquo;s policy of making work pay and encouraging self-employment and entrepreneurship I plan to continue extending cover for the self-employed to other benefits on a phased basis in future Budgets. </p>  <p>  In 2017, my Department will examine the extension of social insurance to cover new risks and contingencies, including developing proposals on a form of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit where a person's business fails or they can no longer continue working in their profession or trade.  I look forward to introducing further improvements for the self-employed in future Budgets.</p></reply>

The 2017 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit of &euro;343 million. </p>  <p>  The PRSI contribution classes that count towards qualifying for jobseekers benefit are PRSI Class A, H and P.  Individuals who are self-employed cannot typically access jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit as PRSI Class S contributions do not qualify a person for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  To qualify for jobseeker's benefit a person must satisfy the conditionality for the scheme including the contribution condition.  They must have at least 104 weeks qualifying PRSI contributions paid since they first started work and 39 weeks qualifying PRSI contributions paid or credited in the relevant tax year or, 26 weeks qualifying PRSI paid in the relevant tax year and 26 weeks qualifying PRSI paid in the tax year immediately before the relevant tax year.  The relevant tax year is the second last complete tax year before the year in which your claim is made.  So, for claims made in 2017, the relevant tax year is 2015. </p>  <p>  However, a self-employed person who has sufficient social insurance contributions as an employee could qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit provided they either give up their self-employment or if their self-employment is considered to be subsidiary employment.</p>  <p>  To be considered as subsidiary employment the relevant employment should be in addition to the jobseeker&rsquo;s usual employment.  Also, either the amount of earnings or profit from the occupation cannot exceed &euro;12.70 per day, or the jobseeker must have a minimum of 117 PRSI contributions, paid immediately preceding the date of the claim or in respect of the last 3 complete contribution years.  However, the individual must satisfy all conditions of the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme, including being available for and genuinely seeking full-time employment.  If the jobseeker does not have the relevant number of qualifying contributions they may be eligible for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or if engaged in farming they may qualify for farm assist. </p>  <p>  Any decision to change the qualifying PRSI classes for jobseeker's benefit would be a matter for Government to consider in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

Section 64P sought to achieve this flexibility by prohibiting the bundling of a registered administrator&rsquo;s services with other services or products.  It later transpired that it would be in breach of EU and domestic legislation for an insurer to act as a registered administrator, without also holding the underlying policy of insurance.  As insurance companies would be unable to provide separate registered administrator services to comply with section 64P its commencement was revoked (S.I. 398 of 2008 refers).</td></tr></table></p><p><b><i>Un-commenced provisions of the Civil Registration Act 2004</i></b><table><tr><th>Uncommenced Provision</th><th>Description</th><th>Status</th></tr><tr><td>Section 4 and the Second Schedule<br /><br /><br /><br />Sections 13(1)(f) and (g)<br /><br />Part 7 (section 59)<br /><br />Section 73</td><td>Repeal various enactments dealing with civil registration matters prior to the enactment of the Civil Registration Act 2004.<br /><br />Provide for the establishment and maintenance of a register of all decrees of divorce and all decrees of nullity of marriage.<br /><br />Provides for the registration of decrees of divorce and decrees of nullity of marriage.<br /><br />Provides for the compilation and publication of statistics relating to events registered under the Act.</td><td>Section 4 and the Second Schedule have been commenced, except in so far as they relate to the repeal of the Vital Statistics and Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1952.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains and administers a roster of observers for such missions.  The aim is to ensure that Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international election observation missions, organised in the main by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the EU.</p><p>In 2013, 72 observers were deployed; in 2014 there were 53 deployed; in 2015, 46 and in 2016, 68.  A full listing of all elections observed since 2013 is posted on the Irish Aid website and can be accessed at the following address: </p><p>Various factors influence the number of observers deployed each year.  The principal reason for the variation is the number of elections taking place in any given year and where the host authorities have extended an invitation to the OSCE or EU to deploy an observation mission.  A further factor can be the postponement of planned elections or the issuing of a limited call, as recently in relation to Timor-Leste where only Long Term Observers were sought by the EU.  It is therefore difficult to provide a specific target for the number of observers to be deployed for 2017.</p><p>The European Union covers the costs associated with EU Election Observation Missions.  For OSCE missions, the Department covers all costs incurred by the individual Irish election observers.  This includes a daily allowance based on OSCE guidance, to cover the cost of food, accommodation and local transport costs in country.  A return airfare is also provided.  In addition, all Irish election observation roster members undertaking a mission, receive a once-off grant annually of &euro;600 from the Department to cover pre-departure mission expenses.  Insurance cover is also provided by the Department for all observers.  There are no plans to review the conditions or allowances for observers.</p></reply>

At their meeting in Dublin earlier this week, at which I participated, the Taoiseach and Prime Minister May reaffirmed their joint commitment to maintaining the CTA and to continuing the two governments&rsquo; work together on this.</p>  <p>  For her part, Prime Minister May has listed the CTA as one of her priorities for the exit process.  In her public statements around her Dublin visit, she referenced the status of Irish citizens in UK law as well as her wish for the rights Irish and UK citizens enjoy in both countries to continue.</p>  <p>  In the particular case of the CTA, as in regard to other specific-Irish related issues, it is clearly essential that we secure the understanding and support of the EU institutions and Member States regarding this long-standing and important bilateral arrangement.  With a view to achieving this, the Government continues to engage very actively at both the political and official/diplomatic levels in setting out this and other key priorities to them.</p>  <p>  It is important and welcome that Ireland&rsquo;s concerns have been explicitly and publicly recognised by the chief negotiators of both the Commission and the European Parliament, Michel Barnier and Guy Verhofstadt respectively.</p>  <p>  Therefore, while pending the triggering of Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union by the United Kingdom, formal negotiations have not yet begun, important groundwork has been done with both the UK government and with our EU partners.  In tandem with this, the government, my Department, and our diplomatic missions in the UK will continue their close contact with the Irish community as the exit process continues.</p></reply>

Trump on 27 January, 2017, could have far-reaching implications, both on humanitarian grounds and on relations between the US and the global Muslim community.</p>  <p>  As I made clear in my statement on 29 January, 2017, I fully share the concerns expressed by other EU partners regarding this development.  Since then, I have had the opportunity to convey these concerns directly to the US Administration in Washington DC.</p>  <p>  I note the clarification issued by the Embassy of the United States in Dublin on 31 January, 2017, to the effect that the Executive Order in question does not restrict the travel of dual nationals to the United States, so long as they hold the passport of an unrestricted country and possess a valid U.S. visa, if required.</p>  <p>  Therefore, Irish citizens travelling to the United States on Irish passports should encounter no difficulties in this regard, as long as they have followed the relevant procedures governing the US Visa Waiver Programme and, if necessary, have obtained a US visa prior to travel.</p>  <p>  I wish to further advise that I am currently undertaking a pre-planned visit to Washington, DC.  I have had number of meetings with several Congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle &ndash; both Republican and Democrat &ndash; as well as representatives of the US Administration.  These meetings provided an opportunity to discuss a range of issues of mutual interest and concern to Ireland and the United States.</p>  <p>  In my meeting with the US National Security Adviser, General Flynn, I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s deep concerns with regard to the nature and impact of the most recent Executive Order.  In response, General Flynn outlined to me the rationale, in US immigration terms for these temporary measures, while I pointed out their damaging consequences in humanitarian terms, as well for the international reputation of the United States.</p>  <p>  Concerning the other elements raised in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I wish to note that the operation of the pre-clearance agreement between the United States and Ireland is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></reply>

Sligo as an Areas of Further Assessment (AFA) and it is being assessed as part of the Western CFRAM Study.  Collooney AFA has been modelled, mapped and assessed for options to manage flood risk.  Public consultation events were held in Spring 2015 on the draft flood maps, in Spring 2016 on the preliminary options and Autumn 2016 on the draft plans.  Sligo County Council were involved and participated in both the Progress and Advisory Group meetings for the Western CFRAM Study.</p>  <p>  The CFRAM draft plan identified Collooney AFA as being at low risk of flooding but identified the need for the local authority, who have a statutory responsibility under the Owenmore Drainage District, to continue the maintenance of the drainage channels within that district. </p>  <p>  The OPW carries out its own programme of Arterial Drainage Maintenance to a total of 11,500km of river channel and approximately 730km of embankments nationally.  These maintenance works relate to arterial drainage schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945, whose purpose was primarily to improve the drainage of agricultural lands.  The OPW has a statutory duty to maintain the completed schemes in proper repair and in an effective condition.  The annual maintenance programme typically involves some clearance of vegetation and removal of silt build-up on an average five-yearly cycle.</p>  <p>  For areas not covered by the Arterial Drainage Maintenance Programme, the Office of Public Works operates a Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  It is open to all Local Authorities to submit a funding application under the Scheme.  This administrative Scheme&rsquo;s eligibility criteria, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, are published on the OPW website, www.opw.ie.  Any application received will be considered in accordance with the scheme eligibility criteria and having regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management.

The Authority co-ordinates this work through service contracts it holds with a number of agencies, including Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Health Service Executive, Local Authorities and Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  The contracts specify the food sectors to be supervised, the types of controls to be provided, including inspections and laboratory analysis.  The contracts are published on the FSAI&rsquo;s website and their performance is subject to regular checks and audits.</p>  <p>  The collective work of the FSAI and the relevant agencies is set down within a comprehensive multi-annual National Control Plan, which is submitted to the European Commission and against which the FSAI and the agencies are audited by the Commission.  The control plan is updated on an annual basis.  More than 1,000 persons (whole time equivalents) are involved in food controls across all of the organisations involved.</p>  <p>  The system of official controls covers all foods produced or marketed in the State, including imports.  Imports of food of animal origin are the subject of specific authorisations before they can be placed on the market in Ireland or the EU.  Imports of foods of non- animal origin are subject to compliance with all relevant EU rules.  These are subject to market checks during the course of routine inspections and/or are tested as part of the annual extensive microbiological and chemical monitoring programmes.  The FSAI also receives regular information on foods which may pose a danger to health from the European Commission through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed.  Certain of these foods are subject to prescribed conditions of entry and a small number are the subject of emergency prohibitions. </p>  <p>  Controls are carried out on a risk basis and actions are taken routinely to close or suspend businesses or remove foods from the market which pose a danger to consumer health.</p></reply>

Biosimilar medicines are similar but not identical to their reference biological medicines, and therefore are not considered in the same way as generic medicines.  Under the Heath (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, biosimilars are not considered to be interchangeable, and therefore cannot be substituted for biological medicines.</p>  <p>  It is likely that the use of biosimilar medicines will grow in Ireland in the coming years as the patents on biological medicines expire, offering opportunities for the State to make further savings on the cost of medicines.  The recently signed  Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines 2016-2020 with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association includes a provision to take advantage of these new developments in the pharmaceutical industry.  Under the new Agreement the price of a biologic medicine will be reduced by 20% and an additional rebate of 12.5% provided upon entry into the market of a biosimilar.  </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently assessing the whole area of biosimilar medicines and are developing a national biosimilar policy.  It is intended that this policy will examine different policy levers and tools that might be implemented in Ireland in order to increase the uptake of biosimilars in the health system in the coming years.</p>  <p>  My officials will be working with the Health Products Regulatory Authority and the HSE to progress this agenda and will also examine the need for any legislative changes in this area.  It is useful to note that the HSE's Medicines Management Programme issued a position paper last year supporting the appropriate introduction of biosimliars into clinical use in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  In relation to savings generated from the use of biosimilars I have asked the HSE to reply to the Deputy on this matter.</p></reply>

While many causes are unknown, it may be the result of a brain injury, stroke, infection, malignancy or genetic conditions.  It is diagnosed using a variety of tests including an EEG, brain scans and blood tests.  These diagnostic tests are available in hospitals.  It can be managed by anticonvulsant medication which are widely available in primary care and acute hospital settings.  Surgery may be required for less common forms of epilepsy.</p>  <p>  The HSE's National Clinical Programme for Epilepsy has advised my Department of improvements in epilepsy services with the development of epilepsy centres, 16.5 whole time equivalent  Advanced Nurse Practitioners for Epilepsy in post, an Electronic Patient Record in use across the country (more than 6,500 patients are now registered on the Electronic Patient Record) and the development of additional specialised centres.</p>  <p>  Prior to the establishment of the National Clinical Programme for Epilepsy, there were two beds available nationally for Epilepsy Monitoring based at Beaumont Hospital.  Four beds are now available at Beaumont Hospital.  In addition, a second Epilepsy Monitoring Unit has been opened in Cork University Hospital which has 2 beds.  This has made an impact on services available to those with severe Epilepsy</p>  <p>  In Ireland, composite data from the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry system (HIPE) revealed that in 2008 - before the programme was established - there were 6,982 discharges from acute Irish hospitals with a principal diagnosis of epilepsy.  The total number of bed days used was 31,532 with an average (mean) length of stay (LOS) of 4.5 days (median 3.3 days) per discharge.  The creation of a new Model of Care in Ireland using a seizure care pathway with early follow-up and prioritised diagnostics shows average length of stay has been reduced to 3.4 days in 2015.  The number of patients being admitted to hospital has also seen a decrease to 6,009 &ndash; a release of thousands of bed days into the acute hospital setting.  This has been due in a large part to the development of a wide breadth of nurse led services including:</p>  <p>  -  Nurse led OPD clinics;</p>  <p>  -  Nurse led rapid access clinics;</p>  <p>  -  Regional Outreach services;</p>  <p>  -  Group OPD clinics;</p>  <p>  -  Ambulatory phone and email service; and</p>  <p>  -  Educational programmes to both nurses and other health &amp;amp; social care professionals. </p>  <p>  Another contributing factor to the reduction in admissions has been the development and implementation in 2 sites of the Acute Seizure Integrated Care Pathway.  An audit of the use of the integrated care pathway in one hospital demonstrated a reduction in admission rate from 45.9% (when the pathway wasn&rsquo;t used) to 28.7% where the pathway was followed.  A significant drop in patient readmissions with seizure was also noted when the pathway was used i.e. 7.41% of patients were readmitted to hospital with seizure when the pathway was not used versus 0.8% readmission rate when the pathway was used. </p>  <p>  The HSE National Clinical Programme for Epilepsy has a vision for the transformation of epilepsy care in Ireland.  The core of the plan to deliver these objectives is to address each aspect of care with a specified care pathway delivered by experts:</p>  <p>1. Local level: This includes the patient&rsquo;s GP, Primary Care HSCPs and nurses, Community Rehabilitation Teams, the nearest Acute General Hospital and support provided by Epilepsy Ireland, the national advocacy service for people with epilepsy.</p>  <p>2. Group Epilepsy/Neurology Services: The hospitals with an epilepsy service (existing or proposed) collaborate to function as a Group Neurology Service, operating as a Clinical Network in each of the six Hospital Groups.  These group neurology services will support hospitals within their hospital group and Primary Care professionals in the management of patients with epilepsy in a planned and coordinated way.</p>  <p>3. National Tertiary Centres: In addition to the two neuroscience centres, Beaumont Hospital and Cork University Hospital, tertiary centres can be further developed across the service.  Tertiary centres will generally have teams with sub specialism in some of the low volume / high complexity conditions within epilepsy.</p></reply>

The NWIHP will lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services, ensure the consistent delivery of high quality care in these services and oversee the development of maternity networks.  Governance arrangements for the networks will be agreed between the NWIHP and the hospital group CEOs. </p>  <p>  The Maternity Strategy provides that all development funding for maternity services will be ring-fenced and allocated through the NWIHP.  Thus the Programme will facilitate greater oversight and support for service providers and ensure the appropriate allocation and targeting of new resources.

The hospitals/maternity units currently providing anomaly scans accept referrals from other maternity units, if requested.  This occurs where the medical team in the referring maternity unit consider that an anomaly scan is clinically indicated. </p>  <p>  The National Maternity Strategy is very clear that all women must have equal access to standardised ultrasound services and, consequently, the issue of anomaly scanning is a priority issue for the newly established HSE National Women and Infants Health Programme (NWIHP).  A Programme Director was seconded into position on the 3 January last.  A Clinical Director has recently been appointed and takes up position on the 1 March 2017.  An early priority for the Programme will be to develop clinical guidance regarding routine detailed scans at 20 weeks.  In the meantime, the NWIHP will continue to work with the six Hospital Groups to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans for those units with limited availability. </p>  <p>  One of the current challenges to increase access to anomaly scans is the recruitment of ultra-sonographers.  In this context it is expected that the establishment of maternity networks across hospital groups will assist in developing a sustainable model that ensures that all women within each hospital group can access anomaly scans.</p>  <p>  In relation to the query concerning the number of scans provided, I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  A care needs assessment is carried out to determine if a person requires long term care, followed by a financial assessment to determine how much a person will contribute to their cost of care.    </p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held.  In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. </p>  <p>  In assessing a person's non-cash assets e.g. principal private residence, property etc., the asset must be valued on the basis of the estimated market value which is defined in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009 as the price the asset would fetch on the open market on the date on which the application for financial support is made to the HSE.  Section 44(4) of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009 provides for applications for financial support to be accompanied by valuations of assets.  In line with the Scheme's national guidelines, persons applying for financial support must submit valuations of assets with their application form.  However, under Section 10 of the legislation, the HSE does not have to accept a valuation submitted by an applicant and may seek its own independent valuation of a particular asset. </p>  <p>  On the commencement of the Local Property Tax in 2013, the use of the Revenue Commissioners valuations for the purposes of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme was considered by the Department of Health and the HSE.  It was decided at that stage not to use the Revenue Commissioners information as it was based on valuation bands and deemed not to be an accurate assessment of the amount that an asset would fetch on the open market on the date on which the application for financial support is made to the HSE.</p>  <p>  When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015 and contained a number of recommendations in relation to improvements to the administration of the Scheme, including reviewing the financial validation processes.  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress certain Review recommendations, and work on implementing these improvements is well underway by the HSE.</p></reply>

The result of the Brexit vote has caused considerable uncertainty for the Agency and its staff as it will have to be relocated to a country remaining within the European Union.  This scenario creates real risks for the EMA and its stakeholders &ndash; foremost, European citizens and the industries which the Agency regulates.  </p>  <p>  The Government believes that it will be important to address the question of the Agency&rsquo;s future location relatively early in the Brexit process.  It is important that the selection of a new host country is informed by clear and careful consideration of the requirements which will need to be met in order to ensure continuity of the EMA&rsquo;s activities and a sustainable future for the Agency.  It will be particularly important to maximise the retention of the EMA staff whose expertise and skills have been key to Agency&rsquo;s development over the last 20 years and to the standing which it enjoys as a regulator at a global level.</p>  <p>  In October the Government decided to propose Dublin as a new home for the EMA.  An interdepartmental/interagency working group led by my Department was established to prepare a proposal. </p>  <p>  Last week I visited the EMA in London in order to better understand the workings of the Agency and the challenges it will face as a result of Brexit.  I met the Executive Director, Professor Guido Rasi, and key members of his team.  It was agreed that we would not speak publicly about the content of those discussions.</p>  <p>  Work is continuing on Ireland&rsquo;s proposal to host the EMA and I will travel to Brussels next week for discussions with a range of stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Ultimately the decision on the new location for the EMA will be made by the European Council at heads of state or government level.  I have not discussed Ireland's bid for the EMA with fellow health ministers, many of whom are also actively campaigning to host the Agency. </p></reply>

Controlling the substances in the Act was part one of a two-step process and Regulations and various Orders are also required to allow legitimate users (e.g. patients with a prescription, health professionals) to possess the substances.  It is expected that various sections of the 2016 Act can be commenced in the coming weeks when the drafting of the various Regulations and Orders is complete.</p>  <p>  Once the Regulations are finalised, under the Technical Standards Directive, Member States are required to inform the Commission of any new regulations or standards which may create a barrier to the free movement of goods.  Since these draft Regulations have the potential to affect trade, in particular because of the introduction of a requirement for import licences, they must be notified to the EU whilst they are in draft and before they are adopted in national law.</p>  <p>  Notified regulations are usually subject to a 3-month standstill period - to enable the Commission and the other Member States to examine the notified text and to respond appropriately.  The Department intends to invoke an urgency procedure which can shorten the notification period to 10 days if the matter is considered to be related to the protection of public health or safety.  If the Commission does not raise any objections the Regulations will be in order to be signed.</p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the 2016 Act is to protect public health by bringing certain substances which are open to misuse and known to be traded on the illicit market under the scope of the Misuse of Drugs legislation.  These include so-called z-drug sedatives - zopiclone and zaleplon.</p>  <p>  The Act also controls the benzodiazepine phenazepam and a number of new psychoactive substances which Ireland is required to control under our EU and UN obligations, as well as two substances found in the headshop drug &lsquo;Clockwork Orange&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  The new Regulations will apply import and export controls, tighter prescribing and dispensing controls as well as an offence of possession, thereby assisting the Customs and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in protecting public health and local communities.  Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, will also be subject to these additional controls.</p>  <p>  Whilst the imperative to bring these medicines under the control of the Misuse of Drugs Acts is understood, many of these medicines are used by tens of thousands of legitimate patients.  Updating the regulations from 1988, imposing additional prescription and dispensing controls on many of the legitimate medicines has had to be undertaken whilst ensuring that there are no significant unintended consequences on those legitimate patients and ensuring healthcare professionals are enabled to continue to prescribe and dispense these medicines, as appropriate.</p></reply>

The Strategy will be implemented on a phased basis over the coming years, and this work will be led by the HSE <i>National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme</i>.  In this regard, the newly-appointed Programme Director has advised that clinical guidance on routine 20 week anomaly scans will be developed as a priority.</p><p>In the interim, the Programme will continue to work with the six hospital groups to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans for those units with limited availability.  One of the current challenges to increase access to anomaly scans is the recruitment of ultra-sonographers.  In this context it is expected that the establishment of maternity networks across hospital groups will assist in the development of a sustainable model that ensures that all women within each hospital group, including those attending the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar, can access anomaly scans routinely.</p></reply>

The information sought is shown in the following table in regard to legislation passed since 2004.  The Deputy might let me know if she would like information in regard to any specific earlier Act.<table><tr><th>Name of the Act</th><th>Sections not in force</th><th>Timeline</th></tr><tr><td>Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2016</td><td>Whole Act.</td><td>Regulations and various Orders are required to allow legitimate users to possess the substances which are controlled under this Act.

This is a comprehensive Act which is being commenced on a phased basis. A further Commencement Order is currently being prepared.</td></tr><tr><td>Health (General Practitioner Service) Act 2014</td><td>Sections 2, 3(a) and 9 - Amendments to Health Act 1970 and other issues.</td><td>Consultations are ongoing with the AGO. A decision will be made on commencement on the conclusion of the consultation process.</td></tr><tr><td>Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014</td><td>Sections 6(a)(iii), 12(b), insofar as it relates to the insertion of subsection (1B) of section 26 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005; sections 21 and 23. </td><td>Section 6(a)(iii), part of section 12(b) and section 21 relate to the proposed division of the profession of radiographer into the two professions of radiographer and radiation therapist.  <br /><br />The commencement of section 6(a)(iii), part of section 12(b) and section 21 can not take place until CORU has made various bye laws.<br /><br />Section 23 provides for conditions to be attached to the registration of a person with a relevant medical disability.  <br /><br />The registration system is being updated to allow section 23 to be commenced.

There are no plans at present to extend this function to the Chief Inspector of Social Services.</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006</td><td>Sections 7 and 11(a)(v).</td><td>There is legal inconsistency with the Irish Medicines Board Act and the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 which needs to be addressed. The Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2016 makes a number of technical amendments to allow the commencement of sections 7 and 11(a)(v) of the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. Discussions on the transfer of functions from the Department to the Health Products Regulatory Authority under these sections are on-going.</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Act 2005</td><td>Part 2.</td><td>The Act was partly commenced in 2007 in respect of children up to the age of five.

However, arising from a High Court ruling in 2009, all children born on or after 1st June 2002 have been deemed as being eligible to apply for an assessment of need under the Act. There are no plans to extend the Act to all persons at present.</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Section 4.</td><td>Section 4 substitutes section 8 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002. Section 8 of the 2002 Act repeals the Tobacco Products (Control of Advertising, Sponsorship and Sales Promotions) Act 1978 and the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act 1988. However, sections of both of these are still in effect. This section will be commenced if and when legislation is enacted to replace the sections still in effect.</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Section 9 in relation to subsection (5) of section 38 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002.</td><td>This subsection refers to batch ID and was superseded by the tobacco products Directive.</td></tr><tr><td>Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Act 2004</td><td>Sections 11 and 12.</td><td>Sections 11 and 12 substituted sections 40 and 41 of the 2002 Act. Section 40 refers to the testing of tobacco products. This work was not undertaken as a laboratory had not been identified to carry out the relevant testing. Section 41 refers to the publication of certain information on foot of the testing of tobacco products. These provisions will be commenced when a laboratory is designated for the purposes of the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The discarding of smaller less valuable fish is completely unacceptable and must be effectively ended.</p>  <p>  There has been a focus on risk based controls by our control authorities the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Naval Service in recent times in order to ensure that State resources are concentrated on those fishing vessels that are considered to be doing the most damage.  We need to do more in this area and I am working at EU level for additional tools for Ireland to strengthen our control capability in respect of all fishing vessels operating in our 200 mile zone.</p>  <p>  The monitoring and control of fishing vessels within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone are matters for the Irish control authorities.  Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service.  The Minister is precluded from getting involved in operational matters including in relation to law enforcement.</p>  <p>  In relation to the overall framework for fisheries control in the EU, in October 2009 a regulation dealing with fisheries controls was adopted.  Council Regulation 1224/2009 establishes a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy.  Control and inspection is now focused where it is most effective through an approach based on systematic risk analysis.  Inspection procedures are standardised and harmonised for all stages in the market chain, including transport and marketing.  The Control Regulations were introduced so that there is a common EU level playing field and to provide for an effective range of controls across EU waters.</p>  <p>  The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service through the Fisheries Monitoring Centre monitor the movements of vessels when in our Exclusive Fisheries Zone, using the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), Automatic Identification System (AIS) and declared catches through Electronic Reporting System (ERS).  The SFPA is reliant on the seagoing fishery patrol activity of the Naval Service to verify compliance of vessels not landing into Ireland.  Further details of monitoring and control of fishing activities by all vessels within Ireland's 200 miles Exclusive Fisheries Zone may be sought from the SFPA who are the competent authority for Sea Fisheries Control within Ireland's Exclusive Fishery Zone.</p></reply>

Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular.  In accordance with this development, Brexit has now been added as a standing item to the agenda of the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee.</p>  <p>  In terms of the European dimension to our response, additional funding that I have provided to Bord Bia - including through Budget 2017 - has been used to support market diversification efforts by companies through its Market Intensification Programme, which was launched in late October 2016, and to support promotional campaigns for Irish beef in Germany and the Netherlands.</p>  <p>  In addition, Bord Bia has been providing information to companies on how to establish a presence in other EU countries, and using its network of offices to build long-term relationships in those markets, including through participation in trade fairs.  It has also recently opened a new office in Warsaw to expand its support in Eastern Europe.</p>  <p>  Looking beyond Europe, Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.  The value of exports to emerging markets in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central/South America stood at almost &euro;2.2 billion in 2015, which represented an increase of 82% on the figure for 2010.  Exports to these markets now account for 21% of total food and drink exports compared to 16% in 2010.  This growth in share of exports occurred during a period when total food and drink exports jumped by more than 45%.</p>  <p>  Growth to emerging markets has been led by Asia, with trade growing by more than 250% to &euro;955 million, and led by China, which recorded a fourfold increase.  Exports to other Asian markets more than doubled over the period to &euro;300 million.  Again, Bord Bia has been intensifying its work in these markets, and has opened a new office in Singapore to service eight emerging markets in South East Asia.</p>  <p>  Trade to Africa grew by more than 50% over the period to &euro;535 million.  Exports to the Middle East jumped by a third to &euro;380 million.  Trade to Central/South America was 60% higher at &euro;91 million in 2015.</p>  <p>  In keeping with these priorities, I led a Trade Mission to China and Singapore in September 2016 and at the same time Minister Doyle led a Trade Mission to Vietnam and South Korea in September 2016.  In November I also led a trade mission to Morocco, which was extended at senior official level to include Algeria.  Earlier in 2016, senior officials accompanied a Bord Bia trade mission to Iran, and travelled on to Turkey and met with officials to discuss the opening of trade in live animals, which was subsequently secured.</p>  <p>  I will lead a further Trade Mission to the Gulf Region at the end of February.  This will cover the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  My Department is currently working with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland to finalise the arrangements for this mission, which will include participants from across the agri-food sector, and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as political discussions with my counterparts in the host countries.  The mission will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  It will also promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products in the Gulf region.</p>  <p>  I am also considering a range of other destinations for the remainder of 2017, although no decision has yet been made in terms of content or timing.  Again, markets in Asia, Africa and America are likely to feature prominently in these considerations, and I am of course ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-02a.758.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020200071#WRR00500"><p>There are a number of challenges facing all sectors of Irish agriculture in 2017.  The immediate impact of Brexit was seen in increased volatility in currency exchange rates which impact on our biggest market for the export of our food and drink and wider political developments throughout the world may impact on Irish agriculture during the year also.  However one of my priorities now, particularly in the context of Brexit, is to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drink internationally.  We are after all an exporting nation with 90% of our food produce leaving the island.  It is for this reason I led a major trade mission to four Asian Countries in September and one to Algeria and Morocco at the beginning of November.  I will also be leading a trade mission to the Middle East at the end of February.  It is only through further increasing our footprint internationally that we will help to mitigate the effects of Brexit and develop our agri-food sector to realise its full potential. </p><p>My Department and state agencies such as Bord Bia will continue to work to ensure that as many markets as possible are opened  for Irish produce  to provide sufficient outlets for exports of Irish beef, lamb, pig and dairy exports.  I allocated additional funding to Bord Bia in Budget 2017 for the specific purpose of dealing with the impact of Brexit which help to support Irish food and drink exports in 2017.  This, in addition to the opening of a new office by Bord Bia in Singapore this year, will ensure that exports of Irish beef are promoted effectively to provide viable export markets for any increases in Irish beef production.</p><p><b>Beef </b></p><p>I am very aware that following a positive start to 2016, beef farmers faced a number of challenges as the year progressed.  However it should be noted that after an initial difficult period post the Brexit referendum that prices for R3 steers have been increasing since the first week in November and now stand at &euro;3.71c/kg, up 18 cents or 5% from &euro;3.53c/kg.</p><p>Turning to the prospects for 2017 it is clear from analysis undertaken by a number of bodies including Teagasc, Bord Bia and my Department that there will be a number of challenges specific to the beef sector in 2017. </p><p>One of the key elements in coping with these challenges is ensuring that there is a market for Irish beef.  There is a strong demand for meat globally including beef and figures from the European Commission's most recent Short Term Outlook for meat markets show a projected growth of per capita beef consumption of 2.1% for 2016.  Whilst we exported approximately 97% of our beef exports in 2016 to EU (including the UK), I am very conscious of the importance of growing international markets as a valuable outlet for any increased Irish beef production.  Indeed this is a crucial component of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  Very significant progress has been made in this context in recent years and my Department is currently in the process of attempting to secure beef access to a range of Third Countries including China, South Korea,  Ukraine, Thailand and Vietnam.  This builds on the opening of some major markets in the last two years including the US, Canada and Japan.  This is a vital means of providing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector with as many commercial opportunities as possible for Irish beef in addition to our existing European markets. </p><p>I am also very conscious of the vital role that live exports play in providing an alternative market outlet for Irish farmers.  The opening of the Turkish market for live cattle exports has seen over 19,500 exported in 2016, a number I am hopeful will grow in 2017.  I also note that exports of live cattle to Libya have recommenced which is a positive and welcome development.  My Department is also currently actively examining the possibilities of bilateral health certificates for the export of cattle to Kazakhstan, Montenegro and for breeding cattle to Morocco.  I remain actively committed to ensuring that Irish beef producers have the option of exporting to as many markets as possible.</p><p>I will also be launching in 2017 a scheme for the funding of facilitators for Producer Organisations in the beef sector.  This is a vital step in ensuring the primary beef producers who wish to come together to form a Producer Organisation can engage collectively with processors on the negotiation of the sale of finished cattle for slaughter. </p><p><b>Dairy</b></p><p>More recent price trends in the dairy sector have given tentative signs of green shoots in the global, EU and Irish dairy market.  This has also filtered through to farmgate prices throughout the EU and Ireland. </p><p>Maintenance of this forward momentum as we approach Ireland&rsquo;s flush period is important for Irish farmers, who as low-cost producers of the highest quality production, can be confident of benefitting early from any continued upswing in the market.</p><p>More recently the process of tendering for release of SMP intervention product back onto the market has commenced, with three tendering rounds, one in December and two in January.  On both occasions the Commission have adopted a cautious approach, with only 40 tonnes released thus far.  I welcome this approach with a view to continued market stabilisation.</p><p>The recently released Bord Bia Export performance review indicates that a rise of 5% in Irish milk output and a recovery in international demand as the year progressed combined to leave the value of Irish dairy and ingredient exports for 2016 around 2% higher that 2015 at &euro;3.38 billion.  This is a strong performance given the extremely difficult background context that prevailed.</p><p>In general the outlook for the dairy sector must remain cautiously optimistic, with the resolve to engage in measures to mitigate volatility should it re-emerge.</p><p><b>Sheep</b></p><p>On the sheep sector, I am also aware  profitability at farm level remains a challenge for all sheep farmers.  My Department already has in place a number of schemes, including the BPS, GLAS, ANC and TAMS which make vital contributions to ensuring the continuing viability of sheep farming.  The sheep sector is a valuable part of Ireland's agri-food industry and contributed &euro;240 million in exports in 2016 according to Bord Bia.</p><p>The Programme for Government committed to the introduction of a scheme for sheep farmers under the Rural Development Programme with a budget of some &euro;25 million provided in Budget 2017.  This new Animal Welfare scheme for sheep, in addition to the existing supports available to sheep farmers, will make a vital contribution to ensuring the continuing viability and sustainability of the sheep sector in Ireland.</p><p>In designing the scheme, I am aware of the different challenges facing sheep farmers in which different areas of sheep farming are carried out in Ireland.  I believe that this scheme will provide a lasting benefit to sheep farming and demonstrates and acknowledges the contribution sheep farming makes to the Agri-food sector in this country. </p><p><b>Pigs and Poultry</b></p><p>The outlook for the pig sector is currently optimistic.  Irish pigmeat exports in 2016 increased by 2% in volume while average pig prices were almost 2% higher.  This left the value of Irish pigmeat exports up by 4% in 2016 at an estimated &euro;615 million.  Net production also increased last year, helped by a significant demand for exports, particularly in China, with volumes up an estimated 44% at 65,000 tonnes reflecting strengthening demand for product in this market.  Increased export volumes to International markets, particularly Asia, offset lower shipments to the UK, which showed some decline due to unfavourable exchange rate movement post Brexit. </p><p>China is the second largest market for Irish pigmeat exports after the UK, accounting for almost 30% of total exports.  Ireland already enjoys pigmeat access to some important international outlets including Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Vietnam, Australia, South Africa and the United States and we are continually seeking to gain access to additional outlets for the pigmeat sector. </p><p>Any growth in Irish production in 2017 is expected to be modest.  Assuming all other factors are unchanged, export availability in 2017 is forecast to be maintained at 2016 levels.  However, much will depend on Chinese domestic production, competition from global exporters and exchange rate fluctuations.  A prolonged period of uncertainty around Brexit will continue to determine the competitiveness of Irish pigmeat product in the UK, in particular for secondary processing companies.  Domestically, consumption on the home market has benefitted from some improvement in the economy as consumers are purchasing pork more frequently.  Bord Bia continues to support the sector and will roll out promotional activity via a new advertising campaign later this year. </p><p><b>Poultry</b></p><p>On the back of increasing demand for poultry protein, the outlook for the sector is relatively positive for this year.  Indeed poultry production hit record levels during 2016, up 14% on 2015, driven by consumer demand mostly attributable to chicken.  Irish imports declined by over 7% last year, largely due to reduced fresh and frozen imports from the UK and other EU markets, however exports decreased driven by lower volumes of processed poultry.  While no significant change is expected in Irish poultry production in the short term, growth in production may be impacted by outbreaks of avian influenza, as it spreads throughout Europe.  In this very competitive sector where Ireland is over 100% self-sufficient it is important to have the edge and Bord Bia&rsquo;s Quality Assurance Scheme provides this on the shelves.  Bord Bia estimates that over 90% of poultry meat produced and 95% of eggs consumed on the island of Ireland is quality assured and the inherent added value this gives to the product does not escape the consumer.  </p><p>I am confident that notwithstanding the current challenges for the above sectors the prospects for these sectors remain positive and I am determined to take any necessary measures to ensure this remains the case.</p></reply>

In 1996 there were approximately 500 deer farms in Ireland with 20,000 deer, but numbers have declined significantly since that time.  There are now only a small number of farmers in Ireland supplying deer for meat production to cater to the niche market available. </p>  <p>  Its viability is dependant on producers and companies ensuring that there are customers available for their product, an objective which Bord Bia assists in by identifying potential market outlets.</p>  <p>  My Department has approved one factory for the slaughter of deer in Ireland.

Fertilisers (as with crude oil and gas) are mainly traded in US dollars and are thereby subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  A weak euro means increased costs for fuel and fertiliser imports and this has impacted on price trends in recent years.</p>  <p>  However, I note that fertiliser prices have more recently experienced a strong price reduction, primarily due to a drop in fertiliser cost inputs and raw materials and this is to be welcomed.</p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office (CSO) monitors the price of fertilisers on a monthly basis.  My Department receives data on the type and quantity of fertilisers and lime sold on a Quarterly basis from Industry.</p>  <p>  Currently, Europe is only 80% self-sufficient in fertiliser production and must import 20% of its requirements.  As such, European and Irish fertiliser prices are strongly linked to global prices and heavily influenced by supply and demand.</p>  <p>  I understand that the issue of price of fertilisers is an important issue for farmers and the advice from Teagasc is for farmers to keep in contact with merchants as prices often spike at periods of high demand when European order books are full.  Purchasing fertilisers at off-peak periods will help minimise prices.</p></reply>

Please note that the figure for cows include any female that has calved at least once in her lifetime and will be made up of animals from females less than 24 months old and females greater than 24 months old.

The  opening of the Turkish market for live cattle exports has seen over 19,500 exported in 2016, a number I am hopeful will grow in 2017.  I also note that exports of live cattle to Libya have recommenced which is a positive and welcome development.  My Department is also currently actively examining the possibilities of bilateral health certificates for the export of cattle to Kazakhstan, Montenegro and for breeding cattle to Morocco.  I remain actively committed to ensuring that Irish beef producers have the option of exporting to as many markets as possible.</p><p>I will also be launching in 2017 a scheme for the funding of facilitators for Producer Organisations in the beef sector.  This is a vital step in ensuring the primary beef producers who wish to come together to form a Producer Organisation can engage collectively with processors on the negotiation of the sale of finished cattle for slaughter.</p><p>The recently released Bord Bia Export performance review indicates that a rise of 5% in Irish milk output and a recovery in international demand as the year progressed combined to leave the value of Irish dairy and ingredient exports for 2016 around 2% higher than 2015 at &euro;3.38 billion.  This is a strong performance given the extremely difficult background context that prevailed.</p><p>In general the outlook for the dairy sector must remain cautiously optimistic, with the resolve to engage in measures to mitigate volatility should it re-emerge.<table><tr><th>-</th><th>National Herd</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>6,197,231</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>6,219,188</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>6,140,024</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>6,332,010</td></tr><tr><td>2016*</td><td>6,501,650</td></tr></table>* Please note that 2016 figures are subject to change over coming months</p><p>Beef<table><tr><th>Cows</th><th>Males &amp;lt; 24 months</th><th>Males &amp;gt; 24 months</th><th>Females &amp;lt; 24 months</th><th>Females &amp;gt; 24 months</th></tr><tr><td>1,535,906</td><td>1,198,332</td><td>151,152</td><td>1,221,147</td><td>1,259,571</td></tr><tr><td>1,469,111</td><td>1,180,788</td><td>173,849</td><td>1,194,862</td><td>1,234,342</td></tr><tr><td>1,364,146</td><td>1,167,118</td><td>171,731</td><td>1,166,096</td><td>1,205,362</td></tr><tr><td>1,196,397</td><td>1,254,274</td><td>141,464</td><td>1,242,949</td><td>1,168,448</td></tr><tr><td>1,015,065</td><td>1,289,441</td><td>131,372</td><td>1,292,317</td><td>1,156,840</td></tr></table></p><p>Dairy <table><tr><th><b>Cows</b></th><th><b>Males &amp;lt; 24 months</b></th><th><b>Males &amp;gt; 24 months</b></th><th><b>Females &amp;lt; 24 months</b></th><th><b>Females &amp;gt; 24 months</b></th></tr><tr><td>1,727,421</td><td>518,525</td><td>28,813</td><td>669,564</td><td>1,150,127</td></tr><tr><td>1,774,446</td><td>512,682</td><td>49,038</td><td>683,346</td><td>1,190,281</td></tr><tr><td>1,777,305</td><td>453,202</td><td>47,498</td><td>684,179</td><td>1,244,838</td></tr><tr><td>1,568,191</td><td>462,236</td><td>37,474</td><td>691,067</td><td>1,334,098</td></tr><tr><td>1,309,670</td><td>509,662</td><td>30,529</td><td>711,495</td><td>1,379,994</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These plants are required to meet prescribed structural and operational standards set under EU and national food safety regulations.  They are supervised by the Department&rsquo;s Veterinary Public Health Inspection Service, which has a permanent presence in slaughter plants and uses the services of approximately 600 Temporary Veterinary Inspectors (TVIs), on a contract basis, for meat inspection.  The numbers of animals slaughtered from the main species in Department-supervised plants in 2016 were 1.63m cattle, 2.67m sheep, 3.25m pigs, 92.9m poultry.  Smaller abattoirs are supervised by local authorities.</p>  <p>  The establishment of a slaughtering plant is a commercial decision made by individuals or companies.

Agri-food businesses will plan in accordance with their individual circumstances, and will make decisions in accordance with their best commercial interest, taking into account market priorities, availability of  raw materials, competitiveness issues, access to EU markets, availability of skilled labour, taxation, the regulatory environment and a range of other commercial factors. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to assist the sector through this period of uncertainty.

In 2015 the National Reserve fund was based on a 3% cut to the Basic Payment Scheme financial ceiling and provided some &euro;24 million in funding which was the maximum financing rate available under the relevant EU Regulations.  Some 6,300 farmers received an allocation of entitlements under the 2015 National Reserve. </p>  <p>  Due to the success of the 2015 National Reserve, all available funding was utilised and there was no remaining funding for a National Reserve in 2016. </p>  <p>  In order to provide for a National Reserve in 2017 funding is required to replenish the Reserve.  EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that funding for the replenishment of the National Reserve may be obtained by means of surrender of entitlements that remain unused by farmers for two consecutive years and by claw-back derived following the sale of entitlements without land.  It is envisaged that funding derived from these two sources in 2017 will be very limited.  The Regulations also provide for the application of a linear cut to the value of all farmers&rsquo; entitlements to replenish the National Reserve.</p>  <p>  Consultation between Department officials and the Direct Payments Advisory Committee comprising members of the main farming organisations, agricultural education and farm advisory bodies takes place annually as part of the decision making process for the National Reserve.  Decisions relating to the availability of a 2017 National Reserve can only be made following determination of available funding and the consultation process involving the Direct Payments Advisory Committee.  This advisory group is due to meet shortly in relation to the 2017 National Reserve.</p></reply>

The tightening situation in the dairy sector is of course influenced by the broader economy and the increasing competition for labour from other sectors. </p>  <p>  The expansion of the dairy sector, as envisaged in FH2020 and FW2025 is resulting in a continuous increase in the numbers of cows being milked by individual farmers.  The general rule is that a single labour unit can handle 80-100 cows effectively.  The increase in cow numbers is causing a demand for additional personnel.  However the lack of people with the necessary skills to work and manage these dairy farms has the potential to hinder development in the sector.</p>  <p>  My Department has formulated a number of responses to this, including the commissioning of Teagasc to conduct research into the factors affecting the labour shortage in the dairy sector in order to inform the development of the necessary interventions.  I intend to have the Teagasc findings discussed at the Dairy Forum in the near future with all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  My Department also co-funds a milking skills training course run by Teagasc and Farm Relief Services aimed at providing the necessary skills to ensure efficient milking on an expanded scale.  I have recently met with Farm Relief Services to discuss their concerns in relation to the shortage of labour in the sector and my officials are meeting them to review the milking skills course in the near future.</p>  <p>  Current data from Teagasc shows that the number of graduates from Agricultural Colleges actively seeking employment in the dairy industry is lower than might be expected.  Teagasc is keeping this issue under continuous review.</p></reply>

According to the national forest inventory 16.7% of Leitrim is under forestry, 27% of which is broadleaf.  In 2016 alone forestry payments worth over &euro;2.6m were paid by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to over 300 landowners with Leitrim addresses, 70% of whom were farmers.  Over 400 farmers living in Leitrim see forestry as an option for them and have participated in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s afforestation scheme. </p>  <p>  In terms of forest planning the afforestation scheme already includes a number of measures that take into account local concerns.  Proposals to plant trees under this scheme are subject to rigorous checks and balances and undergo careful planning by professional foresters.  Notice of all applications for afforestation is  placed on the Department&rsquo;s website showing townland, area of site etc.  In addition, the Department publishes notices in local newspapers where applications are made for afforestation in sensitive high-risk areas such as within a NHA, SAC, SPA or National Park or within a prime scenic area in the county development plan.  In addition to these measures site notices will also be a requirement at the proposed entrance to the site once the new Forestry Act is commenced.  Environmental concerns have been further addressed with the Department's recent Environmental Requirements document.  These rules  introduce, in certain circumstances, new setbacks and increases in some existing setbacks, in order to deliver more focused protection of water quality.</p></reply>

Examples of the type of tests still outsourced are the phage typing of bacteria and some confirmatory tests for toxins and chemical contaminants.</p>  <p>  Amelioration works in one area, the category 4 containment laboratories, are in progress with a view to bringing that laboratory into operation.

Queries received in relation to the NBP are then responded to by members of my Department&rsquo;s NBP team.  There is also helpful information on the NBP available through my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>The National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland.  The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at<i></i><i></i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>The areas marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county.  Individuals can check whether their premises are in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.</p><p>My Department is actively monitoring the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE areas to ensure that all premises can get access to services.  In this regard, direct feedback from consumers is important and if customers in these areas cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at , quoting their address and Eircode and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services. </p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map and finalise this Intervention Area for bidders, taking into account any industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, along with new industry investments and concrete, commitments by industry for further new investments within the proposed State Intervention Area.</p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the  25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to roll-out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.  The Taskforce report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i>. </i></p><p>I have signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, to provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.  </p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services. </p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  </p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at shows the extent of the State Intervention area.</p><p>The areas marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>Individuals can check whether their premises are in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode. </p><p>The Eircode referred to by the Deputy falls within a BLUE area and is therefore expected to be covered by commercial operators.</p><p>The map currently indicates that 77% of the townland of Muchgrange falls within an AMBER area and will therefore will be included in the State Intervention procurement process under the NBP.  The remaining 23% of Muchgrange falls within a BLUE area and is therefore expected to be covered by commercial operators.</p><p>The map also currently indicates that 100% of the townland of Annagh McCanns falls within an AMBER area and will therefore will be included in the State Intervention procurement process under the NBP.</p><p>While I cannot compel any operator to provide services to particular premises, the National Broadband Plan aims to ensure that all premises can access high speed broadband.  My Department is therefore closely monitoring the roll-out of services in the BLUE area, including Dundalk.  I would encourage consumers in Dundalk who cannot access high speed broadband services to contact my Department directly at , quoting their address and Eircode, and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services.  This information will assist the Department in keeping track of progress in those areas and following up if necessary.  </p><p>My Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area including over 15,100 premises in Co. Louth, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. </p><p>Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.</p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to roll-out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. </p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government gave a commitment to establish a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to identify immediate solutions to broadband/mobile phone coverage deficits and to investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention (NBP).</p><p>The Taskforce, which I co-chaired with my colleague, Minister Humphreys, was established in July last year and published its report in December and is available on both our Departments' websites.  The report can be accessed in my Department via the following link:<i>.</i></p><p>The Taskforce included representatives from across Government and agencies as well as engagement with the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) and the telecoms industry.  ComReg participated on the Taskforce as an observer in order to provide advice and guidance in its capacity as the independent regulator of the telecommunications market.  </p><p>The Taskforce  met on approximately twenty occasions with a number of helpful initiatives emerging in the areas of planning, local authority engagement, and consumer information and engagement.</p><p>The report of the Taskforce and an Implementation Programme on Mobile Phone and Broadband Access, identifies 19 of the 40 actions contained in the report as areas where immediate and direct action by Government Departments and State Agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p><p>The work of the Taskforce will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>Arrangements are now in place to deliver the Year 1 actions identified in the Implementation Programme. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded. </p><p>I have signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, to provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.  </p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services. </p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country, including County Louth.</p></reply>

Member States across Europe are now at varying stages of smart meter rollout programmes and smart meters are also being rolled out in other parts of the world including the United States, Brazil, India, and China.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, the National Smart Metering Programme, which includes both electricity and gas meters, is managed by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The regulator is developing a cost benefit analysis on the roll-out of smart meters.  The cost benefit analysis results are due in the second half of this year and will be the key determinant in relation to the scale, scope and timing of the roll-out.</p>  <p>  Over the next two years ESB Networks will be responsible for most of the procurements associated with the rollout of smart meters in Ireland and Gas Networks Ireland will be responsible for the rollout of gas smart meters.  The largest of the ESB Networks' procurements are the communications technology that underpins smart meters and the electricity smart meters.  Procurement of the communications technology commenced last year and the associated "Request for Tender" is due to issue this summer.</p>  <p>  There are a range of benefits to be secured through the introduction of smart meters.  These include accuracy, efficiency, increased competition and sustainability.  Energy bills will be more accurate and timely as there will no longer be a need to physically read meters.  Once consumers know more about their energy consumption they are likely to use less energy, be more efficient with it and therefore save money.  People will be able to reduce their energy bills by shifting when they use energy from more expensive peak consumption times to less expensive times.  By reducing the peak demand for energy, the peak market price will reduce, leading to savings for all energy consumers.</p></reply>

This project is well underway and section 8 of the Act in relation to SEM will be commenced when the market goes live in 2018.<br /><br />The remaining provisions refer to issues where CER readiness is vital for commencement. The new administrative sanction provisions, for example, involve the modification of existing licences which gives rise to timing and scheduling issues. The CER is currently assessing these issues and will advise the Department of the optimal date for the commencement of the provisions in question.<br /><br />It is anticipated that the remaining provisions in the Act will be commenced by way of commencement orders by Q3 2017.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Gas Networks Ireland's published Connections Policy, most recently revised in 2015, set out its policy on the connection of all loads to the transmission and distribution gas networks.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is statutorily responsible for all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and/or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.  It also approves the GNI Connections Policy.  I have no statutory function in relation to either the routing of pipelines or the connection of towns to the gas pipeline network.</p>  <p>  I understand that Listowel, Killarney and Tralee were assessed under the "New Towns Analysis Phase 3" report dated 9 April 2010, published by Gaslink, the predecessor of GNI, including on its website.  This assessment found that these towns did not qualify for connection on economic grounds at that time.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that in the intervening period a review by GNI found that the three towns had acquired an increase in gas demand associated with new large industrial/commercial facilities in each.  A sufficient anchor load has been identified in Listowel to make that town commercially viable for connection.  Unfortunately there have not been sufficient new loads identified for Killarney or Tralee and they therefore remain economically unviable for connection under the Connections Policy approved by CER in 2015.  I am informed also that the review carried out by GNI is regarded as commercially sensitive.</p>  <p>  The question of whether network extensions should, where economically feasible and in line with our energy policy goals in the White Paper, provide for the possibility of future connections in order to contribute to regional and rural development needs to be addressed.  At the launch of the Action Plan for Rural Development I set out my view that there are communities partly or sometimes wholly excluded from basic criteria of modern convenience and comfort, in terms of communications, energy efficiency and fuel poverty.  My long-standing position on the gas network is that the network should be developed generally in rural Ireland to provide natural gas to as many areas as possible.  I consider that that further extension of the gas network could have additional benefits.  Accordingly, and against the backdrop of the energy policy White Paper, it is my intention to commission research and to have a report by year end on  into the potential role that natural gas could play in supporting rural centres.</p></reply>

This is a mechanism outlined in the Preclearance Agreement which allows for representatives from both parties to meet and review any operational issues arising related to the Agreement.</p>  <p>  As you know clarification was issued by the Embassy of the United States in Dublin on Tuesday last to the effect that the Executive Order in question does not restrict the travel of dual nationals to the United States, so long as they hold the passport of an unrestricted country and possess a valid US visa, if required. Therefore, Irish citizens travelling to the United States on Irish passports should encounter no difficulties in this regard, as long as they have followed the relevant procedures governing the US Visa Waiver Programme.</p>  <p>  The Aviation (Preclearance) Act 2009 provides for a service whereby passengers can avail of the option to be pre-cleared for entry into the United States. The Preclearance service is available to all travellers on a voluntary and non-discriminatory basis.</p>  <p>  The preclearance facility is within Irish jurisdiction and the laws of Ireland apply at all times. This is expressly confirmed at Article II(5) of the Preclearance Agreement. Given the fact that US law does not apply, provision is made at Article II(6) of the Agreement to confirm that passengers who wish to avail of preclearance do so on condition that they recognise and consent to the right of the US to grant or refuse preclearance in accordance with its laws.</p>  <p>  If someone is refused permission to fly to the US at preclearance in either Dublin or Shannon Airports, the passenger then becomes the responsibility of the Irish authorities who deal with them, in line with Irish law and in accordance with the full human rights protections that apply.  A refusal at US Preclearance has no impact on the rights available to refugees or persons wishing to seek asylum in Ireland.  If they apply for asylum they will be dealt with in the normal way or if they wish to return to their point of origin they will be facilitated.  These are issues for Irish Immigration authorities and US officials have no role in relation to them.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that the operation of the Ireland-US Preclearance Agreement does not conflict with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, nor does it give rise to any breach of obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>  <p>  In light of recent events, An Taoiseach has requested that a review of US Preclearance in Ireland be undertaken by the relevant Departments:- Justice and Equality, Foreign Affairs and Trade and my own Department.  I expect that a report will be made to An Taoiseach next week.</p></reply>

Across the EU there is no maximum weight 'norm' for these vehicles and a lacuna in Ireland's Construction and Use Regulations has meant that a maximum weight limit for such has hitherto remained unstipulated. While a Transport Infrastructure Ireland commissioned study recommended a 36 tonne maximum weight limit for such vehicles, a regulatory exemption, subject to certain technical requirements, will apply to those rigids with five (or more) axles which have already been plated to operate at 39 tonnes and which are in service before 1 March 2017.  Separate to this the RSA has anticipated that there may be truck body builders who are presently at an irrevocable stage in the manufacture of five axle rigids which have manufacturer installed axles, come approved with a second stage incomplete EC 2007/46 Whole Vehicle Type Approval for a Gross Vehicle Design Weight of 39 tonnes, and which are compliant with all current and future RSA technical requirements for such vehicles.</p>  <p>  Where such vehicles are at an irrevocable stage of manufacture (prior to the date of the original RSA notification on this matter on 1 December last), the RSA will consider, on a case by case basis, the feasibility of such vehicles being included as part of the aforementioned regulatory exemption.</p></reply>

Clearly, volatility in exchange rates has been challenging for exporters who are reliant on the UK market, operate with low margins and have no hedging strategy in place.</p>  <p>  Given that Brexit is likely to represent a structural shift in the UK trading relations with partners, short, medium and long term responses are needed. These include market diversification, cost reduction, innovation and price repositioning. My Department, Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) have measures in place to address these issues for client companies.</p>  <p>  The LEOs are working in partnership with EI to ensure consistency in terms of delivery of Brexit interventions which will be based on the fundamental process of information provision, analysis, planning and support mapping and delivery. The LEO Capital allocation was increased by &euro;4m for 2017 and the LEOs will use the additional monies to enhance the competitiveness and longer-term sustainability of start-ups, micro and small firms, which is of critical importance in the context of Brexit. Targeted initiatives will be rolled out through every LEO to develop capabilities in innovation, market diversification, cost competitiveness and business management.</p>  <p>  In addition, I secured additional monies for 2017 to provide for 39 targeted posts in Enterprise Ireland to enable it to support its clients across all markets. EI will provide various targeted supports and programmes in terms of management capability, leadership, marketing/sales skills, innovation and R&amp;D to help companies to build market share and create new market opportunities. EI will also deliver a suite of supports that help clients reduce supply-chain costs and drive efficiencies and cost reductions as a means of improving operating margins, thereby increasing competitiveness.</p>  <p>  Last autumn, officials of my Department initiated discussions with senior officials from DG Competition to sensitise them to the potential difficulties to be encountered by Irish businesses in the UK market arising from the Brexit referendum result. These discussions are by no means over and will continue to address all relevant issues relating to any proposals emerging from my officials&rsquo; engagement with industry. </p>  <p>  My Department, working closely with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), EI and stakeholders (such as SFA, ISME, IBEC and Chambers), has conducted a structured engagement with a diverse range of companies across sectors and regions. The purpose of this engagement is to construct an evidence base on which appropriate, tailored and targeted responses can be delivered to meet real identified business needs. Work on this is well advanced and we hope to have the results of the structured engagement shortly.</p>  <p>  The outcome of the structured engagement, along with market developments as a result of Brexit, will inform further discussions with the Commission and the development of any further initiatives to business.</p></reply>

Ultimately any deal on Article 50 will require the agreement of the EU Commission, Council and Parliament.</p>  <p>  I understand that the UK will be seeking a Free Trade Agreement with the European Union and to secure the closest possible future relationship for Britain with the EU, a goal that Ireland shares.</p>  <p>  Until the UK leaves the EU, all types of subsidies, both within the UK and across the other 27 EU Member States are subject to the discipline imposed by EU State Aid law.</p>  <p>  Provisions on state aid (subsidies) and competition are a common feature of EU Free Trade Agreements to ensure any aid granted by authorities to private entities does not distort competition.  The terms of any future free trade agreement, including state aid rules, would be a matter for the EU 27 and the UK to agree as part of any negotiation.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding what the EU and UK agree to bilaterally, both remain bound by their obligations under the WTO, which has its own set of subsidy rules contained in the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.  WTO subsidy rules are similar in principle to EU State aid rules in many respects.</p>  <p>  The World Trade Organisation (WTO) currently has 164 members which between them are responsible for 95% of world trade.  It is a negotiating forum for its members to create international trade rules, and an organisation to oversee how they put the rules into practice. </p>  <p>   It is unclear what trading arrangements will apply among WTO members in relation to the UK and the EU following the end of the Article 50 process.  There is no WTO precedent in this regard.  The UK cannot simply &lsquo;cut and paste&rsquo; the terms of its current membership (as part of the EU) and carry those terms over. Depending on the terms of Brexit, at least some of these schedules will need to be rewritten, as the UK exit of the EU will affect the EU&rsquo;s own commitments to other WTO members. </p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s current WTO schedules specify tariff levels for more than 5,000 categories of goods. Each of these tariffs could, in principle, need to be re-visited and renegotiated, depending on policy decisions taken by the UK Government and the attitude taken by other countries. </p>  <p>  It will be a matter for the UK in the first instance to decide how best to approach its future position in the WTO.  The UK approach in this regard will also need to be cognisant of the EU Commission&rsquo;s competency in trade matters while the UK remains a member of the EU. </p></reply>

It is enabling the Department and, primarily, our Agencies recruit an additional forty to fifty staff to supplement existing staffing numbers.  In this regard, the additional &euro;3m has been allocated across Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority, as well as to support the dedicated Brexit Unit within my Department, which is led at Principal Officer level with a team of three staff (two assigned and one to follow), to be reviewed in line with the necessary workload as the Unit&rsquo;s agenda unfolds.  In addition, of course, the work of very many other Business Units across my Department is impacted by Brexit and these Units have, or are in the process of finalising, business plans for 2017 whereby Brexit implications for their work is factored in.</p><p>A workforce planning process spanning the years 2017-19 is currently underway across the Department and coordinated by my HR Unit which will review the level of resources assigned across all Divisions of my Department in relation to the current strategic priorities of my Department.  Naturally, responding to Brexit will feature heavily in the plan.</p><p>Staffing resources are an ongoing priority to ensure my Department&rsquo;s continued ability to facilitate the wide mission and volume of work in a range of challenging policy areas.  This will continue with ongoing day-to-day review of the appropriate staffing across my Department in response to known and developing priority areas. </p><p>In relation to the number of staff serving in the Trade Policy and Export Licencing Section in 2016 and 2017 is concerned the figures are as follows:<table><tr><th>January   2016</th><th>January   2017</th></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>18</td></tr></table></p><p>A small number of staff in this Unit have availed themselves of various reduced working hours arrangements such that the Fulltime Equivalent figures are:<table><tr><th>January   2016</th><th>January   2017</th></tr><tr><td>15.5</td><td>17.1</td></tr></table></p><p>In relation to the number of staff hired in the Department between 2012 and 2017 the following table sets out the position:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>New   &ldquo;hires&rdquo;</td><td>14</td><td>33</td><td>59</td><td>33</td><td>75</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Total   number of staff</td><td>843</td><td>857</td><td>854</td><td>848</td><td>857</td><td>854*</td></tr></table>*Position as at 27 January, 2017</p><p>It is important to appreciate that the increase in numbers in 2013 was primarily due to the transfer of functions from the Equality Tribunal from the Department of Justice and Equality, whereas for 2014 it was primarily as a result of the dissolution of Forf&aacute;s which was integrated into the Department.  Also, there would have been a number of exits through retirement, promotion, resignations and so on such that the total number of staff employed in the Department at year end in each year has been given to show how staffing levels have been relatively stable in recent years after the earlier period of downsizing under the various employment control measures introduced from 2008.</p></reply>

This Bill is scheduled for Report Stage in the Seanad on 22 February.</p><p><b>Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015</b></p><p>With regard to aftercare, which is covered under sections 2 to 9 of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015, commencement of the relevant provisions is anticipated following the outcome of consultations with Tusla with regard to appropriate timing and the readiness of the Child and Family Agency to implement same.</p><p>With regard to the technical amendments, covered under sections 13, 14 and 15, a draft Commencement Order is currently being finalised by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.  The commencement of these sections will need to be sequenced appropriately with the commencement of related sections of the Health Act 2007 and the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2011.  It is anticipated that the technical amendments will be commenced shortly.  </p><p><b>Child Care (Amendment) Act 2011</b></p><p>Given the legislative framework utilised to manage the interaction between the Child Care Act 1991 and the Health Act 2007, in relation to special care provisions, Regulations to be made by the Minister for Health under the Health Act 2007 are required in advance of the commencement of these sections.  These Regulations have now been finalised.  A draft Commencement Order is currently being finalised by the Office of Parliamentary Council.</p><p>Section 13 of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2011 is not commenced.  Section 13 of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2011 relates to amendments proposed to section 26 of the 1991 Act (Guardians ad litem) and these amendments which have not commenced will not now be required as they are being replaced more extensively by provisions in the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2017.</p><p>It is not intended to make a commencement order as this Section will be repealed under the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2017.</p><p>Section 14(b) of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2011 is not commenced.  This section proposes to amend section 27 to clarify that a reference in that section to a &lsquo;party&rsquo; includes a reference to a GAL (section 14(b) of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2011.</p><p>The Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2017 clarifies that a Guardian ad litem will not have party status as s/he is more in the nature of an expert witness.  The amendment proposed by section 14(b) of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2011 is not, therefore, consistent with the proposed policy direction.  It is not intended to make a commencement order as this Section will be repealed under the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2017.</p><p><b>Youth Work Act 2001</b></p><p>The Sections of the Youth Work Act 2001 yet to be commenced are Sections 8 to 16, 19 to 23 and 25 to 37. </p><p>Since the enactment of the Youth Work Act, in 2001 there have been significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services.  These include the publication of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Youth Funding Schemes and the National Youth Strategy 2015-2020.</p><p>The Value for Money and Policy Review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead.  It recommends the development of a new evidence-based and outcomes-focussed scheme designed to secure the optimal outcomes for young people and their communities.</p><p>Work on the development of this scheme has been prioritised by my Department. I intend that the provisions of the Youth Work Act 2001 will be considered in the light of these developments.  </p><p><b>Children (Amendment) Act 2015</b></p><p>The remaining sections of the Children (Amendment) Act 2015 which have yet to be commenced, as listed below, relate to the ending of the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities, the introduction of a new system of remission in the children detention schools and a technical issue relating to the operation of the Children Court on the issuing of detention orders under the Children Act 2001.  In relation to the first of these issues, this was contingent on the completion of a recruitment programme of care staff and of capital works at the Oberstown Children Detention Campus.  It is intended to commence the relevant sections in this regard in 2017.  An interim arrangement is in place to provide for the remission of children detention orders pending the completion of related policy work.  It is intended that the relevant sections of the Children (Amendment) Act 2015 dealing with remission and the issuing of detention orders will be commenced in 2017.</p><p>Sections of the Children (Amendment) Act 2015 remaining to be commenced: 3, 4(d), 6 (as it relates to section 88B), 8, 9, 10, 16, 18, 19, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32.</p></reply>
